Baseline/reference: The state against which change is measured. In the context of transformation pathways, the term \u2018baseline scenarios\u2019 refers to scenarios that are based on the assumption that no mitigation policies or measures will be implemented beyond those that are already in force and/or are legislated or planned to be adopted. Baseline scenarios are not intended to be predictions of the future, but rather counterfactual constructions that can serve to highlight the level of emissions that would occur without further policy effort. Typically, baseline scenarios are then compared to mitigation scenarios that are constructed to meet different goals for greenhouse gas emissions, atmospheric concentrations or temperature change. The term \u2018baseline scenario\u2019 is used interchangeably with \u2018reference scenario\u2019 and \u2018no policy scenario\u2019. In much of the literature the term is also synonymous with the term \u2018business as usual (BAU) scenario\u2019, although the term \u2018BAU\u2019 has fallen out of favour because the idea of \u2018business as usual\u2019 in century-long socioeconomic projections is hard to fathom. Bioenergy: Energy derived from any form of biomass such as recently living organisms or their metabolic by-products Cancun pledge: During 2010, many countries submitted their existing plans for controlling greenhouse gas emissions to the Climate Change Secretariat and these proposals were formally acknowledged under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Developed countries presented their plans in the shape of economy- wide targets to reduce emissions, mainly up to 2020, while developing countries proposed ways to limit their growth of emissions in the shape of plans of action. Carbon dioxide emission budget (or carbon budget): For a given temperature rise limit, for example a 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C long-term limit, the corresponding carbon budget reflects the total amount of carbon emissions that can be emitted for temperatures to stay below that limit. Stated differently, a carbon budget is the area under a carbon dioxide (CO2) emission trajectory that satisfies assumptions about limits on cumulative emissions estimated to avoid a certain level of global mean surface temperature rise. Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e): A way to place emissions of various radiative forcing agents on a common footing by accounting for their effect on climate. It describes, for a given mixture and amount of greenhouse gases, the amount of CO2 that would have the same global warming ability, when measured over a specified time period.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90bd5e79-dac7-451a-adc0-afa89f481844": {"__data__": {"id_": "90bd5e79-dac7-451a-adc0-afa89f481844", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ecf081bdf17df2ffdec4b86b34fd10d24a75a960d865dc6a254e0939a685e8b3"}, "2": {"node_id": "2706a23a-fc18-49de-a9e8-0a5b2629d24f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a57131e9b41cc3152e5fe3627e3db7852e5262fa9695887cf76b0de8b95ac277"}}, "hash": "e943265fc6bd5ffbe049dde1e6fc993b2395c01a162353946341b0598addb901", "text": "For the purpose of this report, greenhouse gas emissions (unless otherwise specified) are the sum of the basket of greenhouse gases listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol, expressed as CO2e assuming a 100-year global warming potential.

Carbon offset: See Offset. Carbon price: The price for avoided or released CO2 or CO2e emissions. This may refer to the rate of a carbon tax or the price of emission permits. In many models that are used to assess the economic costs of mitigation, carbon prices are used as a proxy to represent the level of effort in mitigation policies. Carbon tax: A levy on the carbon content of fossil fuels. Because virtually all of the carbon in fossil fuels is ultimately emitted as CO2, a carbon tax is equivalent to an emission tax on CO2 emissions. Co-benefits: The positive effects that a policy or measure aimed at one objective might have on other objectives, without yet evaluating the net effect on overall social welfare. Co-benefits are often subject to uncertainty and depend on, among others, local circumstances and implementation practices. Co-benefits are often referred to as ancillary benefits. Conditional NDC: NDC proposed by some countries that are contingent on a range of possible conditions, such as the ability of national legislatures to enact the necessary laws, ambitious action from other countries, realization of finance and technical support, or other factors. Emissions Gap Report 2019 X Conference of the Parties (COP): The supreme body of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It currently meets once a year to review the Convention\u2019s progress. Current policy trajectory: This trajectory is based on estimates of 2020 emissions considering projected economic trends and current policy approaches including policies at least through 2015. Estimates may be based on either official data or independent analysis. Deforestation: Conversion of forest to non-forest. Economic mitigation potential: The mitigation potential, which takes into account social costs and benefits and social discount rates, assuming that market efficiency is improved by policies and measures and barriers are removed. Downcycling: A form of recycling that involves reusing materials in less demanding applications, accepting reduced performance of the material in terms of specifications such as hardness, tensile strength, or ductility. In its new application, the downcycled material replaces a material of lower economic value than the original application. Emissions gap: The difference between the greenhouse gas emission levels consistent with a specific probability of limiting the mean global temperature rise to below 2\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C in 2100 above pre-industrial levels and the GHG emission levels consistent with the global effect of the NDCs, assuming full implementation from 2020. Emission pathway: The trajectory of annual greenhouse gas emissions over time. Global warming potential: An index representing the combined effect of the differing times greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere and their relative effectiveness in absorbing outgoing infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases: The atmospheric gases responsible for causing global warming and climatic change. The major greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Less prevalent, but very powerful, GHGs are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). Integrated assessment models: Models that seek to combine knowledge from multiple disciplines in the form of equations and/or algorithms in order to explore complex environmental problems. As such, they describe the full chain of climate change, from production of greenhouse gases to atmospheric responses. This necessarily includes relevant links and feedbacks between socio-economic and biophysical processes. Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC): INDCs are submissions from countries describing the national actions that they intend to take to reach the Paris Agreement\u2019s long-term temperature goal of limiting warming to well below 2\u00b0C. Once a country has ratified the Paris Agreement, its INDC is automatically converted to its NDC (see below), unless it chooses to further update it. INDCs are thus only used in this publication in reference to countries that have not yet ratified the Paris Agreement. Kigali Amendment: The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer aims for the phase-down of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by cutting their production and consumption. Kyoto Protocol: An international agreement, standing on its own, and requiring separate ratification by governments, but linked to the UNFCCC.

Lock-in: Lock-in occurs when a market is stuck with a standard even though participants would be better off with an alternative. Mitigation: In the context of climate change, a human intervention to reduce the sources, or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases. Examples include using fossil fuels more efficiently for industrial processes or electricity generation, switching to solar energy or wind power, improving the insulation of buildings and expanding forests and other \u2018sinks\u2019 to remove greater amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere. Monitoring, reporting and verification: A process/concept that potentially supports greater transparency in the climate change regime. Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC): Submissions by countries that have ratified the Paris Agreement which presents their national efforts to reach the Paris Agreement\u2019s long-term temperature goal of limiting warming to well below 2\u00b0C. New or updated NDCs are to be submitted in 2020 and every five years thereafter. NDCs thus represent a country\u2019s current ambition/target for reducing emissions nationally.

Product lightweighting: A process of creating lighter products through designs that require less material or substitute heavier material with lighter and/or less energy- intensive materials. Lighter material alternatives, both in weight or volume, can generate substantial energy savings in the transport and building sectors. Ride sharing/car sharing: Two forms of arrangements in which two or more people share a vehicle for transportation. In ride sharing, also known as carpooling, the driver takes a passenger along for a ride that the driver gains utility from as well, often for commutes or long distance trips. This arrangement is distinguishable from ride hailing or ride sourcing, both of which are a form of taxi service. In car sharing, a person hires a car from another for a limited duration of time without the owner to undertake the desired trip. Scenario: A description of how the future may unfold based on \u2018if-then\u2019 propositions. Scenarios typically include an initial socio-economic situation and a description of the key driving forces and future changes in emissions, temperature or other climate change-related variables. Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP): Scenarios of projected socioeconomic global changes up to 2100. They are used to derive greenhouse gas emissions scenarios associated with different climate policies scenarios. Source: Any process, activity or mechanism that releases a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas or aerosol into the atmosphere. Sustainable development: Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Technical mitigation potential: Such potential is estimated for given scenarios assuming full implementation of the best available pollutant reduction technology, as it exists today, by 2030 independent of their costs but considering the technical lifetime of technologies and other key constraints (e.g., cultural acceptance) that could limit applicability of certain measures in specific regions. Uncertainty: A cognitive state of incomplete knowledge that can result from a lack of information or from disagreement about what is known or even knowable. It may have many types of sources, from imprecision in the data to ambiguously defined concepts or terminology, or uncertain projections of human behaviour. Uncertainty can therefore be represented by quantitative measures (for example a probability density function) or by qualitative statements (for example reflecting the judgement of a team of experts).

The size of these annual cuts may seem shocking, particularly for 1.5\u00b0C. They may also seem impossible, at least for next year. But we have to try. We have to learn from our procrastination. Any further delay brings the need for larger, more expensive and unlikely cuts. We need quick wins, or the 1.5\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement will slip out of reach. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned us that going beyond 1.5\u00b0C will increase the frequency and intensity of climate impacts, such as the heatwaves and storms witnessed across the globe in the last few years. We cannot afford to fail. The Climate Action Summit has increased momentum to address this global challenge. Now, in this critical period, the world must deliver concrete, stepped-up action. To deliver the cuts we need, nations have to raise the ambition of their current pledges over fivefold for the 1.5\u00b0C goal when they revise their NDCs in 2020. To reach the 2\u00b0C goal, they must triple ambition. They must then immediately follow up with policies and strategies to implement their promises. The report tells us that the major transformation of our societies and economies we need can still happen. Political and societal focus on the climate crisis is at an all-time high, with youth movements holding us to account. There are many ambitious efforts from governments, cities, businesses and investors. There are plentiful options for rapid and cost-effective emission reductions. A shift to renewable energy and energy efficiency in the power, buildings and transport sectors, for example, could deliver reductions of over 16 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent each year by 2050. Using materials such as iron, steel and cement more efficiently also offers opportunities. This report gives us a stark choice: set in motion the radical transformations we need now, or face the consequences of a planet radically altered by climate change. I hope that its findings inspire governments to step forward with the increased climate ambition the world so desperately needs. Inger Andersen Executive Director United Nations Environment Programme Emissions Gap Report 2019 XIV Executive summary \u2013 Emissions Gap Report 2019 Introduction This is the tenth edition of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report. It provides the latest assessment of scientific studies on current and estimated future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and compares these with the emission levels permissible for the world to progress on a least-cost pathway to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. This difference between \u201cwhere we are likely to be and where we need to be\u201d has become known as the \u2018emissions gap\u2019. Reflecting on the ten-year anniversary, a summary report, entitled Lessons from a decade of emissions gap assessments, was published in September for the Secretary- General\u2019s Climate Action Summit. The summary findings are bleak. Countries collectively failed to stop the growth in global GHG emissions, meaning that deeper and faster cuts are now required. However, behind the grim headlines, a more differentiated message emerges from the ten-year summary. A number of encouraging developments have taken place and the political focus on the climate crisis is growing in several countries, with voters and protestors, particularly youth, making it clear that it is their number one issue. In addition, the technologies for rapid and cost-effective emission reductions have improved significantly. As in previous years, this report explores some of the most promising and applicable options available for countries to bridge the gap, with a focus on how to create transformational change and just transitions. Reflecting on the report\u2019s overall conclusions, it is evident that incremental changes will not be enough and there is a need for rapid and transformational action. The political context in 2019 has been dominated by the United Nations Secretary-General\u2019s Global Climate Action Summit, which was held in September and brought together governments, the private sector, civil society, local authorities and international organizations. The aim of the Summit was to stimulate action and in particular to secure countries\u2019 commitment to enhance their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by 2020 and aim for net zero emissions by 2050. According to the press release at the end of the Summit, around 70 countries announced their intention to submit enhanced NDCs in 2020, with 65 countries and major subnational economies committing to work towards achieving net zero emissions by 2050. In addition, several private companies, finance institutions and major cities announced concrete steps to reduce emissions and shift investments into low-carbon technologies. A key aim of the Summit was to secure commitment from countries to enhance", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56347a21-7c71-4b7e-9de3-afa5d77e7d48": {"__data__": {"id_": "56347a21-7c71-4b7e-9de3-afa5d77e7d48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b022837f40e11a97808b6281589e234cc66ea8770b8ea3daaceb97d1fb9632bd"}}, "hash": "b022837f40e11a97808b6281589e234cc66ea8770b8ea3daaceb97d1fb9632bd", "text": "their NDCs, which was met to some extent, but largely by smaller economies. With most of the G20 members visibly absent, the likely impact on the emissions gap will be limited. As regards the scientific perspective, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued two special reports in 2019: the Climate Change and Land report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems, and the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate report. Both reports voice strong concerns about observed and predicted changes resulting from climate change and provide an even stronger scientific foundation that supports the importance of the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement and the need to ensure emissions are on track to achieve these goals. This Emissions Gap Report has been prepared by an international team of leading scientists, assessing all available information, including that published in the context of the IPCC special reports, as well as in other recent scientific studies. The assessment production process has been transparent and participatory. The assessment methodology and preliminary findings were made available to the governments of the countries specifically mentioned in the report to provide them with the opportunity to comment on the findings. 1. GHG emissions continue to rise, despite scientific warnings and political commitments. \u25b6 GHG emissions have risen at a rate of 1.5 per cent per year in the last decade, stabilizing only briefly between 2014 and 2016. Total GHG emissions, including from land-use change, reached a record high of 55.3 GtCO2e in 2018. \u25b6 Fossil CO 2 emissions from energy use and industry, which dominate total GHG emissions, grew 2.0 per cent in 2018, reaching a record 37.5 GtCO2 per year. Emissions Gap Report 2019 XV \u25b6 There is no sign of GHG emissions peaking in the next few years; every year of postponed peaking means that deeper and faster cuts will be required. By 2030, emissions would need to be 25 per cent and 55 per cent lower than in 2018 to put the world on the least-cost pathway to limiting global warming to below 2\u02daC and 1.5\u00b0C respectively. \u25b6 Figure ES.1 shows a decomposition of the average annual growth rates of economic activity (gross domestic product \u2013 GDP), primary energy use, energy use per unit of GDP, CO2 emissions per unit of energy and GHG emissions from all sources for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and non-OECD members. \u25b6 Economic growth has been much stronger in non-OECD members, growing at over 4.5 per cent per year in the last decade compared with 2 per cent per year in OECD members. Since OECD and non-OECD members have had similar declines in the amount of energy used per unit of economic activity, stronger economic growth means that primary energy use has increased much faster in non-OECD members (2.8 per cent per year) than in OECD members (0.3 per cent per year). \u25b6 OECD members already use less energy per unit of economic activity, which suggests that non- OECD members have the potential to accelerate improvements even as they grow, industrialize and urbanize their economies in order to meet development objectives. \u25b6 While the global data provide valuable insight for understanding the continued growth in emissions, it is necessary to examine the trends of major emitters to gain a clearer picture of the underlying trends (figure ES.2). Country rankings change dramatically when comparing total and per capita emissions: for example, it is evident that China now has per capita emissions in the same range as the European Union (EU) and is almost at a similar level to Japan. \u25b6 Consumption-based emission estimates, also known as a carbon footprint, that adjust the standard territorial emissions for imports and exports, provide policymakers with a deeper insight into the role of consumption, trade and the interconnectedness of countries. Figure ES.3 shows that the net flow of embodied carbon is from developing to developed countries, even as developed countries reduce their territorial emissions this effect is being partially offset by importing embodied carbon, implying for example that EU per capita emissions are higher than Chinese when consumption-based emissions are included. It should be noted that consumption- based emissions are not used within the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Figure ES.1.

This report therefore pays close attention to G20 members. \u25b6 G20 members with 2020 Cancun Pledges are collectively projected to overachieve these by about 1 GtCO2e per year. However, several individual G20 members (Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, South Africa, the United States of America) are currently projected to miss their Cancun Pledges or will not achieve them with great certainty. Argentina, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have not made 2020 pledges and pledges from several countries that meet their targets are rather unambitious. \u25b6 Australia is carrying forward their overachievement from the Kyoto period to meet their 2020 Cancun Figure ES.2.

With this method, the Australian Government projects that the country will overachieve its 2020 pledge. However, if this \u2018carry- forward\u2019 approach is not taken, Australia will not achieve its 2020 pledge. \u25b6 On the progress of G20 economies towards their NDC targets, six members (China, the EU28, India, Mexico, Russia and Turkey) are projected to meet their unconditional NDC targets with current policies. Among them, three countries (India, Russia and Turkey) are projected to be more than 15 per cent lower than their NDC target emission levels. These results suggest that the three countries have room to raise their NDC ambition significantly. The EU28 has introduced climate legislation that achieves at least a 40 per cent reduction in GHG emissions, which the European Commission projects could be overachieved if domestic legislation is fully implemented in member states. \u25b6 In contrast, seven G20 members require further action of varying degree to achieve their NDC: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, the Republic of Korea, South Africa and the United States of Emissions Gap Report 2019 XVII Figure ES.3. CO2 emissions allocated to the point of emissions (territorial) and the point of consumption, for absolute emissions (left) and per capita (right) America. For Brazil, the emissions projections from three annually updated publications were all revised upward, reflecting the recent trend towards increased deforestation, among others. In Japan, however, current policy projections have been close to achieving its NDC target for the last few years. \u25b6 Studies do not agree on whether Argentina, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia are on track to meet their unconditional NDCs. For Argentina, recent domestic analysis that reflects the most recent GHG inventory data up to 2016 projects that the country will achieve its unconditional NDC target, while two international studies project that it will fall short of its target. For Indonesia, this is mainly due to uncertainty concerning the country\u2019s land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) emissions. For Saudi Arabia, the limited amount of information on the country\u2019s climate policies has not allowed for further assessments beyond the two studies reviewed. \u25b6 Some G20 members are continuously strengthening their mitigation policy packages, leading to a downward revision of current policy scenario projections for total emissions over time.

The emissions gap is large. In 2030, annual emissions need to be 15 GtCO2e lower than current unconditional NDCs imply for the 2\u00b0C goal, and 32 GtCO2e lower for the 1.5\u00b0C goal. \u25b6 Estimates of where GHG emissions should be in 2030 in order to be consistent with a least-cost pathway towards limiting global warming to the specific temperature goals have been calculated from the scenarios that were compiled as part of the mitigation pathway assessment of the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C report. \u25b6 This report presents an assessment of global emissions pathways relative to those consistent with limiting warming to 2\u00b0C, 1.8\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C, in order to provide a clear picture of the pathways that will keep warming in the range of 2\u00b0C to 1.5\u00b0C. The report also includes an overview of the peak and 2100 temperature outcomes associated with different likelihoods. The inclusion of the 1.8\u00b0C level allows for a more nuanced interpretation and discussion of the implication of the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature targets for near-term emissions. \u25b6 The NDC scenarios of this year\u2019s report are based on updated data from the same sources used for the current policies scenario and is provided by 12 modelling groups. Projected NDC levels for some countries, in particular China and India, depend on recent emission trends or GDP growth projections that are easily outdated in older studies. Thus, studies that were published in 2015, before the adoption of the Paris Agreement, have been excluded in this year\u2019s update.

The recent IPCC special reports clearly describe the dire consequences of inaction and are backed by record temperatures worldwide along with enhanced extreme events. \u25b6 Had serious climate action begun in 2010, the cuts required per year to meet the projected emissions levels for 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C would only have been 0.7 per cent and 3.3 per cent per year on average. However, since this did not happen, the required cuts in emissions are now 2.7 per cent per year from 2020 for the 2\u00b0C goal and 7.6 per cent per year on average for the 1.5\u00b0C goal. Evidently, greater cuts will be required the longer that action is delayed. \u25b6 Further delaying the reductions needed to meet the goals would imply future emission reductions and removal of CO2 from the atmosphere at such a magnitude that it would result in a serious deviation from current available pathways. This, together with necessary adaptation actions, risks seriously damaging the global economy and undermining food security and biodiversity. 6. Enhanced action by G20 members will be essential for the global mitigation effort. \u25b6 This report has a particular focus on the G20 members, reflecting on their importance for global mitigation efforts. Chapter 4 in particular focuses on progress and opportunities for enhancing mitigation ambition of seven selected G20 members \u2013 Argentina, Brazil, China, the EU, India, Japan and the United States of America \u2013 which represented around 56 per cent of global GHG emissions in 2017. The chapter, which was pre-released for the Climate Action Summit, presents a detailed assessment of action or inaction in key sectors, demonstrating that even though there are a few frontrunners, the general picture is rather bleak. \u25b6 In 2009, the G20 members adopted a decision to gradually phase out fossil-fuel subsidies, though no country has committed to fully phasing these out by a specific year as yet. \u25b6 Although many countries, including most G20 members, have committed to net zero deforestation targets in the last few decades, these commitments are often not supported by action on the ground. \u25b6 Based on the assessment of mitigation potential in the seven previously mentioned countries, a number of areas have been identified for urgent and impactful action (see table ES.2). The purpose of the recommendations is to show potential, stimulate engagement and facilitate political discussion of what is required to implement the necessary action. Each country will be responsible for designing their own policies and actions. 7. Decarbonizing the global economy will require fundamental structural changes, which should be designed to bring multiple co-benefits for humanity and planetary support systems. \u25b6 If the multiple co-benefits associated with closing the emissions gap are fully realized, the required transition will contribute in an essential way to achieving the United Nations 2030 Agenda with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). \u25b6 Climate protection and adaptation investments will become a precondition for peace and stability, and will require unprecedented efforts to transform societies, economies, infrastructures and governance institutions. At the same time, deep and rapid decarbonization processes imply fundamental structural changes are needed within economic sectors, firms, labour markets and trade patterns. \u25b6 By necessity, this will see profound change in how energy, food and other material-intensive services are demanded and provided by governments, businesses and markets. These systems of provision are entwined with the preferences, actions and demands of people as consumers, citizens and communities. Deep-rooted shifts in values, norms, consumer culture and world views are inescapably part of the great sustainability transformation. \u25b6 Legitimacy for decarbonization therefore requires massive social mobilization and investments in social cohesion to avoid exclusion and resistance to change. Just and timely transitions towards sustainability need to be developed, taking into account the interests and rights of people vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, of people and regions where decarbonization requires structural adjustments, and of future generations. \u25b6 Fortunately, deep transformation to close the emissions gap between trends based on current Emissions Gap Report 2019 XXI Argentina \u25cf Refrain from extracting new, alternative fossil-fuel resources \u25cf Reallocate fossil-fuel subsidies to support distributed renewable electricity-generation \u25cf Shift towards widespread use of public transport in large metropolitan areas \u25cf Redirect subsidies granted to companies for the extraction of alternative fossil fuels to building-sector measures Brazil \u25cf Commit to the full decarbonization of the energy supply by 2050 \u25cf Develop a national strategy for ambitious electric vehicle (EV) uptake aimed at complementing biofuels and at 100- per cent", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "158c69ec-4af9-448f-85c8-548035e8b655": {"__data__": {"id_": "158c69ec-4af9-448f-85c8-548035e8b655", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89ce5c98f6da1ddd12f44996b4f95a0f8f1b219aecc306518cec5fe163abb4d8"}}, "hash": "89ce5c98f6da1ddd12f44996b4f95a0f8f1b219aecc306518cec5fe163abb4d8", "text": "CO2-free new vehicles \u25cf Promote the \u2018urban agenda\u2019 by increasing the use of public transport and other low-carbon alternatives China \u25cf Ban all new coal-fired power plants \u25cf Continue governmental support for renewables, taking into account cost reductions, and accelerate development towards a 100 per cent carbon-free electricity system \u25cf Further support the shift towards public modes of transport \u25cf Support the uptake of electric mobility, aiming for 100 per cent CO2-free new vehicles \u25cf Promote near-zero emission building development and integrate it into Government planning European Union \u25cf Adopt an EU regulation to refrain from investment in fossil-fuel infrastructure, including new natural gas pipelines \u25cf Define a clear endpoint for the EU emissions trading system (ETS) in the form of a cap that must lead to zero emissions \u25cf Adjust the framework and policies to enable 100 per cent carbon-free electricity supply by between 2040 and 2050 \u25cf Step up efforts to phase out coal-fired plants \u25cf Define a strategy for zero-emission industrial processes \u25cf Reform the EU ETS to more effectively reduce emissions in industrial applications \u25cf Ban the sale of internal combustion engine cars and buses and/or set targets to move towards 100 per cent of new car and bus sales being zero-carbon vehicles in the coming decades \u25cf Shift towards increased use of public transport in line with the most ambitious Member States \u25cf Increase the renovation rate for intensive retrofits of existing buildings India \u25cf Plan the transition from coal-fired power plants \u25cf Develop an economy-wide green industrialization strategy towards zero-emission technologies \u25cf Expand mass public transit systems \u25cf Develop domestic electric vehicle targets working towards 100 per cent new sales of zero-emission cars Japan \u25cf Develop a strategic energy plan that includes halting the construction of new freely emitting coal-fired power plants, as well as a phase-out schedule of existing plants and a 100 per cent carbon-free electricity supply \u25cf Increase the current level of carbon pricing with high priority given to the energy and building sector \u25cf Develop a plan to phase out the use of fossil fuels through promoting passenger cars that use electricity from renewable energy \u25cf Implement a road map as part of efforts towards net-zero energy buildings and net-zero energy houses USA \u25cf Introduce regulations on power plants, clean energy standards and carbon pricing to achieve an electricity supply that is 100 per cent carbon-free \u25cf Implement carbon pricing on industrial emissions \u25cf Strengthen vehicle and fuel economy standards to be in line with zero emissions for new cars in 2030 \u25cf Implement clean building standards so that all new buildings are 100 per cent electrified by 2030 Table ES.2. Selected current opportunities to enhance ambition in seven G20 members in line with ambitious climate actions and targets Emissions Gap Report 2019 XXII policies and achieving the Paris Agreement can be designed to bring multiple co-benefits for humanity and planetary support systems. These range, for example, from reducing air pollution, improving human health, establishing sustainable energy systems and industrial production processes, making consumption and services more efficient and sufficient, employing less-intensive agricultural practices and mitigating biodiversity loss to liveable cities. \u25b6 This year\u2019s report explores six entry points for progressing towards closing the emissions gap through transformational change in the following areas: (a) air pollution, air quality, health; (b) urbanization; (c) governance, education, employment; (d) digitalization; (e) energy- and material-efficient services for raising living standards; and (f) land use, food security, bioenergy. Building on this overview, a more detailed discussion of transitions in the energy sector is presented in chapter 6. 8. Renewables and energy efficiency, in combination with electrification of end uses, are key to a successful energy transition and to driving down energy-related CO2 emissions. \u25b6 The necessary transition of the global energy sector will require significant investments compared with a business-as-usual scenario. Climate policies that are consistent with the 1.5\u00b0C goal will require upscaling energy system supply-side investments to between US$1.6 trillion and US$3.8 trillion per year globally on average over the 2020\u20132050 time frame, depending on how rapid energy efficiency and conservation efforts can be ramped up. \u25b6 Given the important role that energy and especially the electricity sector will have to play in any low-carbon transformation, chapter 6 examines five transition options, taking into account their relevance for a wide range of countries, clear co-benefit opportunities and potential to deliver significant emissions reductions. Each of the following transitions correspond to a particular policy rationale or motivation, which is discussed in more detail in the chapter: \u25cf Expanding Renewable Energy for electrification. \u25cf Phasing out coal for rapid decarbonization of the energy system.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c35eedc-0c36-4a09-acf6-971c3204d59c": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c35eedc-0c36-4a09-acf6-971c3204d59c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6fb9eec7acdc5411bedd5f4678b1d57c051556abc54e02deff19a466a357e4b4"}, "3": {"node_id": "e686a191-d7cb-4b06-8d42-dcc7efff989e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "78f82cb0e0d4a2986f0da7fed5910d1dc252ec7e12c832ec6b457ea323be0748"}}, "hash": "346c394dead02b65f92abe32a431addd50f5fc0733deecfa132ac5fbf38816fc", "text": "\u25cf Decarbonizing transport with a focus on electric mobility. \u25cf Decarbonizing energy-intensive industry. \u25cf Avoiding future emissions while improving energy access. \u25b6 Implementing such major transitions in a number of areas will require increased interdependency between energy and other infrastructure sectors, where changes in one sector can impact another. Similarly, there will be a strong need to connect demand and supply-side policies and include wider synergies and co-benefits, such as job losses and creation, rehabilitation of ecosystem services, avoidance of resettlements and reduced health and environmental costs as a result of reduced emissions. The same applies for decarbonizing transport, where there will be a need for complementarity and coordination of policies, driven by technological, environmental and land-use pressures. Policies will need to be harmonized wherever possible to take advantage of interdependencies and prevent undesirable outcomes such as CO2 leakage from one sector to another. \u25b6 Any transition at this scale is likely to be extremely challenging and will meet a number of economic, political and technical barriers and challenges. However, many drivers of climate action have changed in the last years, with several options for ambitious climate action becoming less costly, more numerous and better understood. First, technological and economic developments present opportunities to decarbonize the economy, especially the energy sector, at a cost that is lower than ever. Second, the synergies between climate action and economic growth and development objectives, including options for addressing distributional impacts, are better understood. Finally, policy momentum across various levels of government, as well as a surge in climate action commitments by non-state actors, are creating opportunities for countries to engage in real transitions. \u25b6 A key example of technological and economic trends is the cost of renewable energy, which is declining more rapidly than was predicted just a few years ago (see figure ES.5). Renewables are currently the cheapest source of new power generation in most of the world, with the global weighted average purchase or auction price for new utility-scale solar power photovoltaic systems and utility-scale onshore wind turbines projected to compete with the marginal operating cost of existing coal plants by 2020. These trends are increasingly manifesting in a decline in new coal plant construction, including the cancellation of planned plants, as well as the early retirement of existing plants. Moreover, real-life cost declines are outpacing projections. Emissions Gap Report 2019 XXIII Table ES.3.

Changes in global levelized cost of energy for key renewable energy technologies, 2010-2018 9. Demand-side material efficiency offers substantial GHG mitigation opportunities that are complementary to those obtained through an energy system transformation. \u25b6 While demand-side material efficiency widens the spectrum of emission mitigation strategies, it has largely been overlooked in climate policymaking until now and will be important for the cross-sectoral transitions. \u25b6 In 2015, the production of materials caused GHG emissions of approximately 11.5 GtCO2e, up from 5 GtCO2e in 1995. The largest contribution stems from bulk materials production, such as iron and steel, cement, lime and plaster, other minerals mostly used as construction products, as well as plastics and rubber. Two thirds of the materials are used to make capital goods, with buildings and vehicles among the most important. While the production of materials consumed in industrialized countries remained within the range of 2\u20133 GtCO2e, in the 1995\u20132015 period, those of developing and emerging economies have largely been behind the growth. In this context, it is important to keep in mind the discussion about the point of production and points of consumption (see figure ES.6). \u25b6 Material efficiency and substitution strategies affect not only energy demand and emissions during material production, but also potentially the operational energy use of the material products. Analysis of such strategies therefore requires a systems or life cycle perspective. Several investigations of material efficiency have focused on strategies that have little impact on operations, meaning that trade-offs and synergies have been ignored. Many energy efficiency strategies have implications for the materials used, such as increased insulation demand for buildings or a shift to more energy-intensive materials in the lightweighting of vehicles. While these additional, material-related emissions are well understood from technology studies, they are often not fully captured in the integrated assessment models that produce scenario results, such as those discussed in this report. \u25b6 In chapter 7, the mitigation potential from demand-side material efficiency improvements is discussed in the context of the following categories of action: \u25cf Product lightweighting and substitution of high- carbon materials with low-carbon materials to reduce material-related GHG emissions associated with product production, as well as operational energy consumption of vehicles. \u25cf Improvements in the yield of material production and product manufacture. \u25cf More intensive use, longer life, component reuse, remanufacturing and repair as strategies to obtain more service from material-based products.

GHG emissions in GtCO2e associated with materials production by material (left) and by the first use of materials in subsequent production processes or final consumption (right) \u25cf Enhanced recycling so that secondary materials reduce the need to produce more emission-intensive primary materials. \u25b6 These categories are elaborated for housing and cars, showing that increased material efficiency can reduce annual emissions from the construction and operations of buildings and the manufacturing and use of passenger vehicles, thus contributing a couple of gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent in emission reductions to the global mitigation effort by 2030. Emissions Gap Report 2019 1 Introduction Authors: Anne Olhoff (UNEP DTU Partnership) and John Christensen (UNEP DTU Partnership) 1 This tenth edition of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report provides an independent scientific assessment of how countries\u2019 climate pledges and actions are affecting the global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) trend, comparing it with the emission reductions necessary to limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C in accordance with the Paris Agreement. This difference between where we are likely to be by 2030 and where we need to be has become known as the \u2018emissions gap\u2019. To mark the 10-year anniversary, a publication summarizing the lessons from a decade of emissions gap assessments (Christensen and Olhoff 2019) was published to support the United Nations Secretary-General\u2019s Climate Action Summit in September 2019. This publication shows that despite a decade of increased focus on climate change, global GHG emissions have not been curbed and the emissions gap is now larger than ever. It is clear that the world cannot afford another decade lost. Unless mitigation action and ambition are increased immediately and profoundly through enhanced nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and supported by ambitious long-term mitigation strategies, it will not be possible to avoid exceeding the 1.5\u00b0C goal, and it will become increasingly challenging to achieve", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b7cec0e-4054-45af-99a6-d551d90c4eb0": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b7cec0e-4054-45af-99a6-d551d90c4eb0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c177e4d269abe87e8bab8daca121ee59c9e05ecbf01d232af1b92cd368645a34"}}, "hash": "c177e4d269abe87e8bab8daca121ee59c9e05ecbf01d232af1b92cd368645a34", "text": "the well below 2\u00b0C goal. At the Climate Action Summit, countries and regions announced their intention to improve national and subnational action. For example, 70 countries agreed to submit enhanced NDCs by 2020, with the number of commitments to zero GHG and carbon emission targets at some point during the second half of this century increasing from around 20 countries and eight regions before the Summit to 71 countries and 11 regions after the Summit. However, these countries and regions account for just 15 per cent of global emissions, indicating that the scale and pace of climate commitments and action is still far from what is required to keep the Paris Agreement goals within reach. The challenge for the twenty-fifth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 25) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the year to follow is thus to bring about the necessary move from incremental to transformational climate ambition and action. The year 2020, which is when countries are requested to submit new or updated NDCs and invited to communicate long-term mitigation strategies as part of the UNFCCC process, will be defining in this regard. As in previous years, this Emissions Gap Report has been prepared by an international team comprising 57 leading scientists from 33 expert institutions across 25 countries, assessing all available information, including that published in the context of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special reports. The assessment process has been overseen by a distinguished steering committee and has been transparent and participatory. The assessment methodology and preliminary findings were made available to the governments of the countries specifically mentioned in the report to provide them with the opportunity to comment on the findings. The report is organized into seven chapters, including this introduction, and is structured on the questions that guided the 2018 Talanoa Dialogue: Where are we? Where do we want to go? How do we get there? In this way, chapter 2 focuses on where we are, providing an updated assessment of the status and trends of current and projected global GHG emissions, and the progress of G20 members towards their Cancun Pledges for 2020 and their NDC targets for 2030. Addressing the issue of where we want to go and comparing it with where we are likely to be, chapter 3 assesses what the gap between estimated global emissions will be by 2030 if NDCs are fully implemented, as well as the range consistent with the well below 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C temperature goals. The chapter also considers what the temperature implications will be at the end of the century if current policies are continued, and whether global emissions by 2030 will be permissible if the current level of ambition of NDCs is not increased. Finally, the second part of the report examines how the gap can be bridged. Chapter 4 provides a comprehensive overview of recent ambitious climate actions by national and subnational governments as well as non-state actors, and Emissions Gap Report 2019 2 a detailed overview of policy progress and opportunities for enhanced mitigation ambition for selected G20 members. With the aim of informing the Climate Action Summit and the preparation of new and updated NDCs, a special pre-release version of chapter 4 was published in time for the Summit. The chapter illustrates that collectively, the G20 members have not yet taken on transformative commitments at the breadth and scale necessary, highlighting that despite many positive developments, commitments are still far from what is required. Chapter 5 details the key transformations that are needed to align global trends with the Paris Agreement goals and how such transformational pathways in many cases can be synergistic with achieving other development priorities, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Global transformation of energy systems is crucial for bridging the emissions gap. Chapter 6 reviews five transition options that are relevant for many countries, can be designed to achieve development and mitigation goals simultaneously and are associated with significant emission reduction potentials. Finally, chapter 7 assesses how material efficiency strategies for residential buildings and cars can contribute to bridging the gap.

The chapter is organized as follows: section 2.2 takes stock of the current global GHG emissions status and trends. Section 2.3 provides an assessment of whether G20 members are on track to meet their Cancun pledges and NDC targets, while section 2.4 summarizes recent policy developments of individual G20 economies. This section also serves as a basis for chapter 4, which explores opportunities for additional GHG emissions reductions that could be considered in the NDC update process by 2020 and beyond. Section 2.5 provides an overview of submitted long-term low emissions development strategies to date. In the 2019 report, all GHG emission figures are expressed using the 100-year global warming potentials (GWPs) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1 This change was made to be more in line with the decisions made at the COP in Katowice. Parties agreed on the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) for reporting reasons at COP 24 in Katowice. A full switch to AR5 GWP was not yet possible because the literature is still not up to date on this decision. 2 GHG emissions are 1.8 GtCO2e higher than the emissions estimate in 2017 presented in recent UNEP Emissions Gap Reports. This is mainly due to the impact of GWPs (1.5 GtCO2e) and the change in LUC emissions (-0.7 GtCO2e), whereas the yearly change in 2018 contributes 1.0 GtCO2e. 3 GHG emissions are based on EDGARv5 (Olivier and Peters 2019) and LUC emissions are from Houghton and Nassikas (2017). In this report, GWPs from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report are used (25 for CH4 and 298 for N2O). This yields total GHG emissions that are 1 GtCO2e higher in 1970 and 1.5 GtCO2e higher in 2018. Fourth Assessment Report1, unless otherwise noted, whereas United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report 2018 used Global Warming Potential (GWP) values of IPCC Second Assessment Report. 2.2 Current global emissions: status and trends Total GHG emissions grew 1.5 per cent per year in the last decade (2009 to 2018) without land-use change (LUC) and 1.3 per cent per year with LUC, to reach a record high of 51.8 GtCO2e in 2018 without LUC emissions and 55.3 GtCO2e2 in 2018 with LUC. GHG emissions growth was 2.0 per cent in 2018 and there is no sign of a peak in any of the GHG emissions3 (figure 2.1). GHG emissions have grown every year since the global financial crisis in 2009, with only slightly lower growth in 2015 due to big declines in coal use in both the United States of America and China. Fossil CO2 emissions, from both energy use and industry, dominate total GHG emissions and reached a record 37.5 GtCO2 per year in 2018, after growing 1.5 Emissions Gap Report 2019 4 per cent per year in the last decade and 2.0 per cent in 20184.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b95d7d6e-bae2-44bc-b9ce-d3ba288800af": {"__data__": {"id_": "b95d7d6e-bae2-44bc-b9ce-d3ba288800af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b020462deb7050289b28b8666533e8d0b84a48f8b6d2f6cfeb4c4d02148a8848"}, "2": {"node_id": "1d08cb19-dfd0-4429-abba-124b6d37ee88", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac7390800a92c47948ee21a17db9a966b614a09d92d5a8f835d0cf0a2f0fcfe4"}}, "hash": "4825e187487a9fe502059eeffd36cf45dba1e53730fb0cbb7d90647771011902", "text": "The growth in fossil CO2 emissions was due to robust growth in energy use (2.9 per cent in 2018).

We extend several aspects of that analysis to compare Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and non-OECD economies. Figure 2.2 shows a decomposition of the growth in economic activity (Gross Domestic Product, GDP), primary energy use, the energy use per unit of GDP, the CO2 emissions per unit of energy, and GHG emissions 4 In this report, CO2 emissions from fossil-fuels and industry grew 2.0 per cent in 2018, using EDGARv5 (Olivier and Peters 2019). The Global Carbon Budget estimates 2018 fossil-fuel and industry emissions to grow 2.1 per cent (Friedlingstein et al. 2019), while for combustion-related emissions only, the Institute of Economic Affairs estimated growth of 1.7 per cent (IEA 2019) and BP estimated growth of 2.0 per cent (BP 2019). from all sources, for OECD (blue) and non-OECD (orange) economies. Economic activity has been much stronger in non-OECD economies, growing at over 4.5 per cent per year in the last decade compared to just 2 per cent per year in OECD economies. Since the OECD (1.7 per cent per year) and non-OECD (2 per cent per year) economies have had similar declines in the amount of energy used per unit of economic activity, economic growth means that that energy use has grown much faster in non-OECD economies (2.8 per cent per year) than OECD economies (0.3 per cent per year). OECD economies already use less energy per unit economic activity, suggesting that non-OECD economies have the potential to accelerate improvements. Declining or flat energy use makes it easier for non-fossil energy sources, like wind and solar, to displace fossil fuels in the energy system. The flat energy use in OECD economies is one key reason that emissions have decreased in those regions (Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. 2019), with the declines accelerated due to a declining amount of CO2 emitted per unit of energy use (-0.8 per cent per year). In non-OECD economies, slightly more CO2 is emitted per unit of energy in the last decade (0.2 per cent per year growth), meaning that CO2 emissions have grown slightly faster than energy use. In non-OECD economies, the rapid deployment of solar and wind power has not been strong enough to displace fossil fuels, particularly in countries with growing energy use and Figure 2.1. Global greenhouse gas emissions from all sources Source: Olivier and Peters (2019), Houghton and Nassikas (2017) for land-use change emissions, and Friedlingstein et al. (2019) for updates from 2016 to 2018 Emissions Gap Report 2019 5 globally. In total, OECD economies have seen CO2 emissions decline by -0.4 per cent per year in the last decade, while non-OECD economies have seen emissions growing at nearly 3 per cent per year. In the near term, it is expected that energy use will continue to grow in non-OECD economies, but more rapid improvements in energy intensity, together with deployment of low-carbon energy sources, could lead to an earlier peak and then decline in CO2 emissions. GHG emissions are dominated by CO2, but the non-CO2 emissions represent over 34 per cent of total GHG emissions including LUC. OECD economies have only seen very limited growth in CH4 and N2O, but rapid growth in fluorinated gases, leading to an overall slight decline in GHG emissions. Non- OECD economies have seen strong growth in all non-CO2 GHGs, leading to an overall increase in GHG emissions of 2.5 per cent per year in the last decade. While CO2 dominates GHG emissions, reductions in other components can help achieve an earlier peak in GHG emissions. While global emissions statistics provide important information on collective progress, they mask the dynamics at the country level (figure 2.3). The top four emitters (China, EU28, India and the United States of America) contribute to over 55 per cent of the total GHG emissions over the last decade excluding LUC, the top seven (including Japan, Russia and international transport) account for 65 per cent, while G20 members contribute 78 per cent.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1273b8c2-9727-4136-90e6-83c45ba1a567": {"__data__": {"id_": "1273b8c2-9727-4136-90e6-83c45ba1a567", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77ece03f445309276f5b0ade9d13cf647a43ad65ddd4e904ccf53b7526b0fd25"}, "2": {"node_id": "6921dfa6-5ba6-4292-8b68-6d31e8b78156", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4129fe47c1c4be25206f95cec77172b1b9f6151abf23ed712bf4dc1c881e5b3"}}, "hash": "ec93bfb0d7caf0b7f191d4376a9b8f55e46d799f87537e8c2336001181c6f29e", "text": "China emits more than one-quarter (26 per cent) of global emissions (excluding LUC), and despite contributing significantly to the slowdown in global emissions from 2014 to 2016, emissions in the country are now rising again, growing 2.5 per cent in the last decade and 1.6 per cent in 2018 to reach a record high 13.7 GtCO2e in 2018.

The European Union emits 8.5 per cent of global GHG emissions and has had a steady decline of 1 per cent per year in the last decade and a decline of 1.3 per cent in 2018. India, accounting for 7 per cent of global emissions, continues to have rapid growth in emissions of 3.7 per cent per year in the last decade and 5.5 per cent in 2018. The Russian Federation (4.8 per cent) and Japan (2.7 per cent) are the next largest emitters, with international transport (aviation and shipping) representing around 2.5 per cent of GHG emissions. If LUC emissions were included, the rankings would change, with Brazil likely to be the largest emitter. The ranking of countries changes dramatically when considering per capita emissions (figure 2.3, right), but less so when allocating emissions to consumption (figure 2.4). Consumption-based emissions, also known as a carbon footprint, adjusts the standard territorial emissions. As figure 2.4 shows, developed countries import more emissions than they export, with the opposite holding true in developing countries. In the 2000s, there was a growing gap between consumption-based emissions in developed countries and their territorial emissions. This gap was larger than the reductions made under the Kyoto Protocol (Peters et al. 2011). Since the global financial crisis in 2008, the Figure 2.2.

China contributed to most of the growth in the 2000s, but also the stabilization in the 2010s (Pan et al. 2017). Consumption-based emission estimates allow policymakers to focus on different policy levers and may help deal with carbon leakage under stringent climate policies. 2.3 Assessment of G20 Member progress towards Cancun pledges and NDC targets GHG emissions projections were compiled and reviewed to assess the emission levels expected for G20 members under existing policies (\u201cCurrent policies scenario\u201d) and whether they would meet their respective emissions reduction targets for 2020 and 2030. We followed the methodology of den Elzen et al. (2019) to enable a fair comparison of projections from different data sources, including both official data sources published by the G20 governments as well as sources published by independent research institutions. Up-to-date emissions projections published since November 2018 were collected from countries\u2019 recently published National Communications, the third biennial reports of seven G20 members, several other new national studies and the independent global studies Climate Action Tracker (Climate Action Tracker 2019d), the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission (Keramidas et al. 2018) and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (Kuramochi et al. 2018) for the current policies scenario and NDC scenario projections (see appendix A, available online, for scenario definitions). Several studies on current policies scenario projections from the UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2018 data set were excluded, as these were concluded not to be representative of the policies implemented to date (mostly those published before 2017, depending on the G20 Member). All data sources are presented in appendix A. Current policies scenario projections from studies without NDC quantification were compared to official NDC emission values in absolute terms or \u2013 when official NDC emission values are not available \u2013 to the median estimates of NDC emission levels across independent studies.

According to the Paris Agreement, countries are obligated to regularly update and strengthen their NDCs. The assessment conducted in this section is based on current NDCs, recognizing that they are to be revised and should be strengthened considerably by 2020 to meet the climate goal of the Paris Agreement. Second, current policies scenario projections are subject to the uncertainty associated with macroeconomic trends, such as GDP and population growth and technology developments, as well as with the impact of policies. Some Cancun pledges and NDCs are also subject to uncertainty of future GDP growth and other underlying assumptions. It is also worth noting that the current policies scenario projections do not reflect the likely impact of all policies implemented to date for a number of reasons. First, there is always a time lag between the date a new policy measure was implemented and the date a scenario study that considered this new policy was published. Second, it often takes time for research institutions to assess whether a new policy measure would be effectively implemented to achieve its intended objective, resulting in an even larger time lag. Third, GHG emissions projection models have limitations on the types of policies they can incorporate, which may result in an under- or overestimation of projected emissions. On the progress of G20 economies towards their 2020 pledges, they are collectively (those who have Cancun pledges) projected to overachieve their Cancun pledges by about 1 GtCO2e per year based on the assessments from the Climate Action Tracker (Climate Action Tracker 2019d) and PBL (Kuramochi et al. 2018), the two studies that annually update both the 2020 pledge emission levels and current policies scenario projections. However, several individual G20 members (Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, Republic of Korea, South Africa, the United States of America) are currently projected to miss their Cancun pledges or will not achieve them with great certainty. In Australia, the Government projects that they would overachieve their 2020 pledge based on their carbon budget approach that accounts for cumulative emissions between 2013 and 2020 (Australia, Department of the Environment and Energy 2018). Argentina, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have not made 2020 pledges. On the progress of G20 economies towards their NDC targets, six members: China, the EU28, India, Mexico, Russia and Turkey, are projected to meet their unconditional NDC targets with current policies (table 2.1). Among them, the current policies scenario emissions projections for three countries (India, Russia and Turkey) are projected to be 15+ per cent lower than the NDC target emission levels. These results suggest that the three countries have room for raising their NDC ambitions significantly. The EU28 has introduced climate legislation that achieves at least 40 per cent GHG reductions and is projected by the European Commission (European Commission 2018b) to overachieve these, if domestic legislation is fully implemented (figure 2.5). Emissions Gap Report 2019 8 Figure 2.5. Greenhouse gas emissions (all gases and sectors) of the G20 and its individual members by 2030 under different scenarios and compared with historical emissions Figure 2.5a. The change in assessment results for the EU28 from our 2018 report is partially due to the differences in whether and how the new policy packages adopted in recent months were considered in GHG emissions projections (see also the EU28 section and an earlier paragraph in this section). All three independent studies (Climate Action Tracker, JRC and PBL) do not take the recently adopted policy packages into account. Also, along with official publications, the European Environment Agency (EEA 2018) projects emissions based on Member state-level policies5 and the third Biennial Report of 2017 (\u201cWith Current Measures\u201d scenario), which projects that the EU28 would remain short of achieving its NDC target, and does not cover policies implemented in last two years. By contrast, the reference scenario in the 2018 analysis produced by the European Commission supporting the long- term vision document, which reflects recent European Union (EU)-level policies and assumes their full implementation, projects that the EU28 could reduce its GHG emissions by 48 per cent from 1990 levels including LULUCF. For this reason, the EU28 has been classified as projected to overachieve its NDC target in table 2.1, even though the independent studies do not project the EU28 to achieve its NDC target (figures 2.5 and 2.6), as they are not fully updated. 5 Member States who are at different stages when", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d360e964-d0fe-4d50-abc4-64596cab0910": {"__data__": {"id_": "d360e964-d0fe-4d50-abc4-64596cab0910", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4540dbd1c2bf97009a4e833c65513c1a0dcbf9b409bcd88e893204919dc0cf06"}}, "hash": "4540dbd1c2bf97009a4e833c65513c1a0dcbf9b409bcd88e893204919dc0cf06", "text": "it comes to implementing domestic measures to meet EU legislation. It is logical that progression is achieved in these projections over time as Member States take additional actions. Seven G20 members require further action of varying degree to achieve their NDC targets: Australia, Brazil (new, changed compared to UNEP (2018)), Canada, Japan (new), Republic of Korea, South Africa and the United States of America. For Brazil, the projections from three annually updated publications were all revised upward, reflecting, among others, the recent turn of trends on deforestation. Japan\u2019s current policies projections have been on the borderline of achieving the NDC target for the last few years. Studies do not agree on whether Argentina, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia (new) are on track to meet their unconditional NDCs. For Argentina, a recent domestic analysis that reflects the most recent GHG inventory data up to 2016 (Keesler, Orifici and Blanco 2019) projects that the unconditional NDC target \u2013 which was revised in 2016 with a more ambitious one \u2013 will be achieved including scenarios that are less optimistic (see annex B for details), while two other international studies project that the country will fall short of achieving its unconditional NDC with existing policies. For Indonesia, the lack of agreement is mainly due to the uncertainty on land-use, LUC and forestry (LULUCF) emissions. For Saudi Arabia, the limited amount Emissions Gap Report 2019 9 of information on the country\u2019s climate policies did not allow for further assessments beyond the two studies reviewed. Some G20 members are continuously strengthening their mitigation policy packages, leading to a downward revision of current policies scenario projections over time. One example is the EU, where a noticeable downward shift in current policies scenario projections for 2030 has taken place since the 2015 edition of the UNEP Emissions Gap Report (see section on the EU28 below for recent policy developments). Figure 2.5 provides a detailed comparison of estimated emissions under current policies scenarios as estimated by official and independent sources and the NDC scenario for all G20 members except for the EU Member States, mapping these against 1990, 2010 and 2015 emissions. For each of the G20 members, average (median when more than five studies) GHG emission projections have been calculated for current policies and full implementation of the NDC, following the approach of den Elzen et al. (2019), the results of which were presented in the UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2018 (UNEP 2018) including climate change. Countries will meet again at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). As mentioned, average GHG emission projections are presented for the current policies scenarios in figure 2.5 and 2.6, whereas the assessment in table 2.1 is based solely on the number of independent studies that support a given country finding. As a result, some countries may be classified as projected to meet their NDC target according to the number of studies available (table 2.1), while they may be projected to miss their NDC Figure 2.5b. Notes: For reporting reasons, the emission projections for China, the EU28, India and the United States of America are shown in figure 2.5a and the other countries shown in figure 2.5b, using two different vertical axes. The current policies and NDC scenario estimates are based on average GHG emission projections. The findings regarding whether countries are projected to over- or underachieve their NDC targets under current policies may therefore differ from the assessment in table 2.1, which is based solely on the number of independent studies. As a conservative assumption, South Africa is not considered as having a firm commitment to peak, since there is no guarantee that the conditions upon which they made the pledge will be met. * For the United States of America, the unconditional NDC is for 2025. For Brazil, we refer to the indicative target for 2030. ** South Africa\u2019s NDC is based on an emissions trajectory with an emissions range of 398\u2013614 MtCO2e including LULUCF over the 2025\u20132030 period.

We find that nine G20 members, including China, are projected to emit more than 10 tCO2e per capita annually (approximately the levels in 2010 for EU28 and Japan) in 2030 under current policies and seven members could even achieve levels under unconditional NDC targets.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b09667a-450d-40b4-bbd2-823cd58dedb3": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b09667a-450d-40b4-bbd2-823cd58dedb3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c71b68547a7bb5bb095309e1201f409a387588be50291558576b1c1273c5f4c"}, "3": {"node_id": "7f48e0ed-6905-4b83-b409-0d7c683ee22f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "16dfbd8dc04a0ee88255b707fd7608ee79fbe200633fe38a0baf997c7b9257dc"}}, "hash": "513935578da9112e0846e3b6c985dd79d74674f195af4d066fdf096d389c6691", "text": "Among OECD members6, the EU28 performs well in both 6 Australia, Canada, the EU, Japan, Mexico, Republic of Korea, Turkey, the United States. absolute and per capita emission levels in 2030 and in their change rates compared to 2010 levels, even though the consumption-based emissions are considerably higher, as shown in figure 2.4. Mexico also performs well in terms of the projected development of per capita emissions under both current policies and NDC scenarios. As table 2.2 shows, emissions per capita annually in 2030 under the unconditional NDC targets are projected to decline between 2010 and 2030 in all G20 economies except China, India, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. There are also large differences in per capita emission levels. The per capita emissions of India are about half the G20 average, whereas Saudi Arabia reaches three times the G20 average. Table 2.1. Assessment of progress towards achieving the unconditional NDC targets for the G20 under current policies based on independent studies Notes: The assessment is based on the number of independent studies that support the findings (except for the EU28, see the note below and the section analysis). These are compared to the available studies, as indicated in brackets. 1. We also examined current policies scenario projections from official publications. The number of publications that support the above findings based on independent studies are Australia: 1 of 1; Canada: 2 of 2; Russia: 1 of 1; South Africa: 1 of 1; the United States of America: 1 of 1. For the EU28, three official publications disagree (see footnote 3). 2. The Climate Action Tracker indicates that upper-end projections would miss the NDC target range. 3.

Historical data based on the second Biennial Report. Emissions Gap Report 2019 12 Figure 2.6 presents the additional effort needed according to estimates based on independent studies and shows that the main contributions would need to come in particular from the United States of America. If we assume a linear interpolation between the NDC target year (2025) and the 2050 United States of America long-term target (80 per cent reduction below 2005 levels indicated in the longterm low-carbon development strategy (LTS) document \u2013 see section 2.5) to estimate an indicative 2030 target, the required additional emissions reductions would halve if the 2030 target remained at the same level as for 2025, instead of progressing linearly towards its 2050 target as assumed in our analysis. The three countries that are projected to significantly overachieve their unconditional NDC targets (by more than 15 per cent), i.e. India, Russia and Turkey, are expected to together exceed their NDC targets by about 1.5 GtCO2e in 2030 with current policies (compared to about 1 GtCO2e in the UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2018). By contrast, the emission gaps are noticeably larger than in the 2018 assessment for the two large LULUCF emitters, i.e. Brazil and Indonesia, reflecting the recent increase of historical emissions and the political uncertainties in the two countries. Overall, this study indicates that current policies of G20 members collectively fall short of achieving the unconditional NDCs. The total GHG emissions for G20 members are projected to be 41.0 GtCO2e/year (range: 35.1 to 47.6 GtCO2e/year), which is slightly lower than the projections by den Elzen et al. (2019) after correcting for different GWPs. G20 members as a whole will need to reduce their GHG emissions further by about 1.1 GtCO2e/year by 2030 to achieve unconditional NDC target emission levels and by about 2.9 GtCO2e/year to achieve conditional NDC target emission levels. If we exclude the 1.6 GtCO2e/year overachievement of unconditional NDCs by India, Russia and Turkey and assume that these countries will follow their current policies trajectory rather than that implied by their unconditional NDCs (as done in many NDC scenario projections from global models presented in chapter 3), then the G20 economies are collectively short of the unconditional NDCs by about 2.7 GtCO2e/year against unconditional NDCs and by about 3.7 GtCO2e/year against conditional NDCs in 2030. The estimated difference between the current policies scenario and NDC scenario projections for G20 members remains similar to that in the UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2018, but some G20 members (i.e. the EU and South Africa) have lower current policies projections than in the 2018 report (UNEP 2018), whereas others have higher projections (i.e. Brazil, and to a lesser extent, China). 2.4 Recent policy developments of G20 members This section presents selected policy developments observed recently in individual G20 members and their potential implications on GHG emissions, where information is available.

Comparing emission values across chapters To compare these G20 estimates with the G20 shares of the global greenhouse gas emissions estimates of the current policies scenarios and 1.5- and 2\u00b0C-consistent global emission levels, as presented in chapter 3, we need to discuss the LULUCF CO2 emissions.

The G20 total emissions projections for 2030 alone would be about 43 GtCO2e/year, after correcting for the anthropogenic sink, which would exceed the 2\u00b0C-consistent global emission levels of the integrated assessment models presented in chapter 3. This G20 projected emissions level in 2030 is about 72 per cent of global emissions of the current policies (60 GtCO2e) in 2030 seen in chapter 3, which is close to the 78 per cent share of G20 in the global emissions in 2018. It is lower in 2030, which was to be expected, given the increasing share of non-G20 and in-time international aviation and shipping emissions until 2030. Emissions Gap Report 2019 13 Argentina Unconditional NDC target projection: Uncertain or insufficient information Argentina submitted its first NDC in 2015 and a revised version in 2016 where the country unconditionally committed to emit no more than 483 MtCO2e/year in 2030. Since then, the country has established a National Climate Change Cabinet integrated by most of the ministries to design a low-carbon strategy and ensure the coherence of policies and measures. Under this institutional framework, the ministries have prepared a set of sectoral plans describing the mitigation policies and measures to be implemented to reach the NDC goals (Argentina, National Climate Change Cabinet 2019). Policies and measures in the energy sector include the construction of several large-scale hydropower plants, 7 One of these three nuclear power plants, Atucha II, is already operational. The other two are currently under development. three new nuclear power plants7, various types of large- scale renewable energy power plants such as wind, solar PV and biomass, smaller renewable energy systems for distributed generation and residential solar water heaters. Implementation of these actions is behind schedule (Compa\u00f1\u00eda Administradora del Mercado Mayorista El\u00e9ctrico S.A. [CAMMESA] 2019), mainly due to difficulties accessing financial resources (Gubinelli 2018). The weak infrastructure for electricity transportation is also a major barrier for the expansion of renewable, grid-connected power plants (Mercado El\u00e9ctrico 2019; Singh 2019). At the same time, the heavily subsidized exploitation of non-conventional fossil fuels from the Vaca Muerta reservoir is adding GHG emissions in a magnitude similar to the estimated emissions reductions of the renewable energy plan (Iguacel 2018). The initial exploration and future exploitation of offshore oil and natural gas is adding to the burden (Baruj and Drucaroff 2018; Bolet\u00edn Oficial de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina 2019). Figure 2.6. Additional emissions reduction effort required in 2030 per G20 Member to achieve NDC targets, based on current policies scenario projections of independent studies Note: The NDC scenario projections from global models presented in chapter 3 assume that the countries that overachieve their NDCs follow their current policies trajectory. The calculations for the United States of America are based on an interpolation between its 2025 NDC and the 2050 long-term target (80 per cent reduction from 2005 levels) and for Brazil, they are based on its indicative 2030 target. As the current policies estimates of the independent studies are based on average GHG emission projections, the findings regarding whether countries are projected to over- or underachieve their unconditional NDC targets may therefore differ from the assessment in table 2.1, which is based solely on the number of independent studies. Emissions Gap Report 2019 14 Policies and measures have been developed for the industry and transport sectors such as energy efficiency, recycling and reuse of waste, renewable energy generation for self-consumption, promotion of low-emission urban mobility and public transport, intercity railroad restoration and efficiency improvements in road and railway freight transportation. Some of these actions are being implemented (for example, the initial implementation of hybrid and electric buses in large cities and the use of alternative fuels in cement kilns), while some other actions are behind schedule. In relation to agriculture, forestry and land-use, the key sectors for Argentina in relation to their contribution to GDP and to GHG emissions, sectoral plans have been presented with policies and measures such as conservation and restoration of native forests, sustainable forest management and fire prevention, increasing the forested area and promoting bioenergy from different biomasses.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4dfdcd0b-5bce-47f3-812e-17e10e1418ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "4dfdcd0b-5bce-47f3-812e-17e10e1418ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6e915c8946e89f8aa6ba6cba11e166aa99f30ce436a17a72a023841f59fe84bb"}, "2": {"node_id": "db3cb1cf-fdd6-44cf-9b57-b3e61a1e1ea0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b8ba4672f8058c124ff52216ddfebff4926e2a8573bbb5482b2b6ecc42da6398"}}, "hash": "b805ba65a2a5f90d94200d274968ed6f94b43dca686e1c8e9e663467ebccb6bb", "text": "In addition to the measures proposed, Argentina urgently needs to revise the technologies and practices it has been using for decades in agricultural production to avoid further soil degradation and the impact on health of rural and suburban populations caused by using agrochemicals (Instituto National de Tecnolog\u00eda Agropecuaria (n.d).; Panigatti 2010).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c51d127-a8a4-4fe3-b487-2bc732a9214c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c51d127-a8a4-4fe3-b487-2bc732a9214c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "201bb60cb45e6dadf7016b4c44f33e31d58ed965f1a06da86b808f69b02ab8f5"}, "3": {"node_id": "6a2e2bd0-6187-4fe3-827a-eec1ba919d5d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f01d1cf591c6369a39e79c92e07757e1f4884d8f11f9569ac9d6ffe1d9ab74d5"}}, "hash": "f0a042d8f739321b046c5b9a8819cd3d3c6a352b3341aef003f0669fea3fba41", "text": "It also needs to provide the due amount of funding to finance the law that protects native forests and keep under control the rate of deforestation that increased in 2017 after several years of declination (Argentina, Ministerio de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sustentable 2018). Australia Unconditional NDC target projection: Emissions 0\u201315 per cent above target With the re-election of Australia\u2019s conservative Government in May, there has been no recent material change in Australian climate policy. This will make achieving its NDC of a 26 per cent to 28 per cent emissions reduction below 2005 levels by 2030 challenging. However, it appears that the Australian Government intends to use carry-over permits from the Kyoto Protocol to do so, and uses a carbon budget approach that accounts for cumulative emissions between 2021 and 2030 in order to assess progress against its NDC (Australia, Department of the Environment and Energy 2018). The dropping of the proposed National Energy Guarantee in 2018 and that the renewable energy target will not be raised for years after 2020 up to 2030 (Clean Energy Regulator 2018) leaves Australia with no major policy tool to encourage emission reductions from the electricity sector in the short to medium term. There has been a 1.4 billion Australian dollar commitment to a 2 GW expansion of the Snowy Mountains hydroelectric project; however, the emission reductions stemming from this project are not expected to occur until well after 2030 (Marsden Jacob Associates 2018). In 2017, the Government\u2019s advisory body, the Climate Change Authority, concluded that other policies would be needed to deliver the structural changes necessary for Australia to decarbonize (Climate Change Authority 2017). The latest projection published by the Government shows that emissions would remain largely unchanged up to 2030 (Australia, Department of the Environment and Energy 2018; Climate Action Tracker, 2019a). To date, much of the support from the Government\u2019s signature climate policy, the recently renamed \u201cClimate Solutions Fund\u201d, has gone to LUC projects (Clean Energy Regulator 2017). The current Government decided earlier in 2019 to provide an additional 2 billion Australian dollars to the Climate Solutions Fund. The Australian Government estimates that these measures will contribute to an additional 100 MtCO2e of emissions reductions by 2030 (Australia, Department of the Environment and Energy 2019). Brazil Unconditional NDC target projection: Emissions at least 15 per cent above target After the strong reduction in deforestation rates from 2004 (18,900 km2) to 2012 (4,656 km2), the deforestation rate grew again to 7,900 km2 in 2018 (+70 per cent). Preliminary numbers indicate that in the first semester of 2019 deforestation rates continued to grow relative to the same period of 2018. President Bolsonaro significantly reduced the Ministry of Environment\u2019s budget for climate- change related activities; transferred the body responsible for identifying, defining, and registering Indigenous Territory to the Ministry of Agriculture; relaxed the rules for converting environmental fines into alternative compensations; extended deadlines for adequacy to registries that supported enforcement measures; and abolished most committees and commissions for civil participation and social control in the Federal Government (Climate Action Tracker 2019b). Given the key role of the LULUCF sector in Brazil\u2019s NDC, which aims to reduce the country\u2019s GHG emissions by 37 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025 and to an indicative level of 43 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, and given the huge global importance of its forests for environmental services, biodiversity and carbon sequestration, the Brazilian Government urgently needs to strengthen mitigation action in this sector. Official projections still show a decreasing trend (Programa Despolui\u00e7\u00e3o de Bacias Hidrogr\u00e1ficas [PRODES] 2019), which is contrary to the observed trend. If environmental regulations and deforestation control policies are reversed or suspended, net emissions from deforestation could increase by 850-1,500 MtCO2e/year by 2030 (Rochedo et al. 2018). Despite the negative developments in climate policy and emissions regarding the forestry sector, Brazil has made progress in the energy sector. Market developments between 2015 and September 2019 seem to favour renewable energy over fossil fuels. Although fossil capacity was eligible in the latest auctions, no coal and only 4 GW of gas-fired power generation have been contracted since 2015 in comparison to 10 GW of renewables per cent. Wind has been the most competitive technology with concessions of 4 GW, followed by solar (3.3 GW), hydro (1.6 GW), and biomass (1.0 GW) (Brazil, Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency [ANEEL] 2019).

President Bolsonaro also signed the first concession for the rail transport sector in 10 years. The project allows cargo to be transported from the Midwest and flow through both the Port of Itaqui (in the north) and the Port of Santos (in the southeast) (Brazil, Investment Partnerships Program 2019). The Federal Government plans to significantly increase the share that railway transport constitutes in the next eight years (from 15 per cent to 29 per cent). Canada Unconditional NDC target projection: Emissions at least 15 per cent above target In its NDC, Canada pledged to reduce its GHG emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. With Royal Assent of the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act in December 2018, carbon pricing will be in place across all Canadian provinces and territories by September 2019, except the Province of Alberta, but is facing court challenges from a number of provinces (Climate Action Tracker 2019c). Alberta repealed its carbon tax in May 2019, however the federal carbon price will be applied to that Province in January 2020 (Province of Alberta Queen\u2019s Printer 2019; Vigliotti 2019). The adoption of performance standards on coal and gas-fired power stations at the end of 2018 means Canada is on track to meet its 2030 coal phase-out commitment, although it is expected that many coal-fired plants will be replaced with natural gas variants, creating a risk of future stranded assets (Climate Action Tracker 2017; Government of Canada, 2018b; 2018a). The 2019 federal budget included a 300 million Canadian dollar investment in zero-emission vehicles, while the Government has set sales targets of 10 per cent by 2025, 30 per cent by 2030, and 100 per cent by 2040 (Canada, Transport Canada 2019). According to Canada\u2019s Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollutant Emissions Projections (2018), when taking into account currently announced federal, provincial and territorial policies and measures, Canada\u2019s emissions in 2030 are projected at 592 Mt \u2013 or 223 Mt lower than what was projected before the adoption of the Pan-Canadian Framework for Clean Growth and Climate Change. China Unconditional NDC target projection: Overachievement of the target by less than 15 per cent China\u2019s NDC targets include capping CO2 emissions around 2030 and making an effort to cap them earlier, as well as a 20 per cent share of non-fossil fuels in the total primary energy demand (based on the conversion factor of the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics for renewable energy and nuclear power generation). Further targets include reducing the carbon intensity of its GDP by 60 per cent to 65 per cent below 2005 by 2030 and increasing forestry stock by 4.5 billion m3 by 2030 compared to the 2005 level. Since 2017, China\u2019s National Energy Administration (NEA) has developed a warning system for investment in coal power plants, which evaluates the risks of new coal power projects based on investment returns, electricity demand and environmental concerns. The system rates the feasibility of coal power projects in 38 regions as bad, moderate or good. New coal investment is banned, in principle, in regions with a bad rating. In April 2019, the NEA published the latest risk rating, which reduces the number of regions that ban new coal investment from 24 to 21 (NEA of China 2019). The change may encourage coal power development and slow down power sector decarbonization. China\u2019s renewable energy and new energy vehicle (NEV) has experienced exponential growth in the past decade, in part thanks to generous subsidies. As the costs of the technologies fall and markets mature, China has started to phase down relevant subsidies. The Government suspended the approval of all new subsidized solar PV projects in May 2018 (NEA, National Development and Reform Commission [NDRC]; Ministry of Finance [MOF] of China 2019) and issued new regulations to reduce subsidies for solar and wind projects in 2019 (NDRC of China 2019a; 2019b.). The country also slashed the subsidy standard of 50 per cent for new energy cars in 2019 and plans to stop subsidies by the end of 2020 (He and Cui 2019). In the short-term, the efforts would result in a rush to develop renewable power projects or purchase new energy cars before phase-out of subsidies. In the midterm, utility-scale solar PV and onshore wind power can reach grid-parity by 2021 (Hang 2019; Tu et al. 2019). In fact, China has already approved 21 GW of wind and solar projects without subsidy (Hill 2019).

In summary, the recent subsidy reform is a necessary step for the large-scale adoption of renewable energy and NEV in China. EU28 Unconditional NDC target projection: Overachievement of the target by less than 15 per cent The EU has adopted climate legislation to implement its NDC target of a 40 per cent reduction below 1990 levels by 2030. It has reviewed its EU emission trading system and increased its annual reduction of the cap. It has set national emission reduction targets for Member States for the sectors not covered in the EU emissions trading system. It has put in place legislation that ensures accounted LULUCF emissions are not resulting in a decrease of the EU\u2019s sink. Combined, these legislations meets the at least Emissions Gap Report 2019 16 40 per cent greenhouse gas reduction target of the NDC. In recent months, the EU has implemented a number of important accompanying measures that would lead to an overachievement of its NDC target. The adoption of the new renewable energy directive (Directive 2018/2002; RED II) and the new energy efficiency directive (Directive 2018/2002) (European Commission 2018c) with the respective goals of increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix and improving energy efficiency \u2013 if effectively implemented \u2013 would lead to emissions reductions of at least 45 per cent by 2030 relative to 1990 (European Commission 2018a). These two directives were parts of the package of measures called Clean Energy for all Europeans presented by the European Commission in November 2016. With the adoption of the Electricity Regulation and Electricity Directive by the Council in May 2019, European institutions finalized the work on this package, which also included a directive focusing on energy efficiency in the building sector (adopted in May 2018), and a Governance Regulation which obligates Member States to present National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) describing measures they are going to implement to contribute to meeting the EU\u2019s energy and climate goals. Collectively, the current draft NECPs are projected to fall short of both renewable and energy efficiency targets (European Commission 2019b). Final NECPs, taking on- board recommendations by the European Commission and featuring greater ambition where necessary, are due by the end of 2019. Significant progress has also been made in the transport sector in which the adoption of CO2 emissions standards for passenger cars and vans in December 2018 was followed by standards for new heavy-duty vehicles in early 2019. According to the legislation, average emissions from passenger vehicles sold by each manufacturer in 2030 will have to be 37.5 per cent lower for new cars and 31 per cent lower for new vans compared to 2021 levels (European Council 2019). Emissions from new heavy-duty vehicles should decrease by 15 per cent in the second half of the next decade and by 30 per cent in 2030 and beyond \u2013 in both cases in comparison to 2019 (European Commission 2019a). These regulations, however, may need to be strengthened after 2030 if net zero GHG emissions by 2050 as proposed by the European Commission (European Commission 2018a) are to be achieved. Furthermore, an increasing number of countries are committing to the phase-out of coal-fired power plants; Finland has agreed on a phase-out of coal-fired power plants by 2029 (Europe Beyond Coal 2019) and Germany is discussing a phase-out (a commission advised it to do so by 2038) (Germany, Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy [BMWi] 2019). Other Member States that committed to, or announced coal phase-outs, include Austria (2025), Denmark (2030), France (2021), Ireland (2025), Italy (2025), the Netherlands (2030), Portugal (2030), Sweden (2022) and the United Kingdom (2025) (Europe Beyond Coal 2019). India Unconditional NDC target projection: Overachievement of the target by more than 15 per cent, suggesting a weak target India\u2019s NDC has three numeric targets for 2030: reduce emissions intensity by 33 per cent to 35 per cent from 2005 levels, achieve an installed power capacity of 40 per cent from non-fossil fuel sources and create an additional carbon sink of 2.5\u20133.0 GtCO2e from forest and tree cover. India has continued its efforts towards achieving its renewable and intensity targets, though the previous year saw no substantial course change. In 2018, renewable deployment exceeded conventional fuels (Buckley and Shah 2019), though is projected to remain short of the 175 GW target by 2022 (Vembadi, Das and Gambhir 2018; Buckley and Shah 2019). The deployment of renewables has been let down by unclear, inconsistent taxation and import duty norms (Buckley and Garg 2019; Buckley and Shah 2019).

In addition, the National Clean Air Programme released in 2019 aims to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 25 per cent to 30 per cent, and provides additional motivation to shut down old coal power plants (India, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change [MoEFCC] 2019b). India has simultaneously continued its efforts to broaden energy access. India reported the 100 per cent electrification of households in early 2019 (India, Ministry of Power 2019), with likely implications for the future of India\u2019s energy demand. The Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (KUSUM) scheme launched in early 2019 is aimed at promoting solar energy in rural areas with the target to install 26 GW of solar agricultural pumps by 2022 (India, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs 2018). India also released an India Cooling Action Plan in 2019 to provide cooling services while keeping their GWP minimal by reducing energy and refrigerant demand (MoEFCC 2019a). India has also begun deliberating policies to electrify public and private modes of transport. The second phase of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles (FAME) was launched in 2019, aiming to support the uptake of electric two-wheelers, three-wheelers, four-wheelers and buses, with projected cumulative savings of 7.2 MtCO2e (India, Cabinet on Economic Affairs 2018). India is also deliberating upon targets to ban sales of all fossil fuel powered two-, three- and four-wheeler vehicles in the next decade. India also aims to electrify all its broad gauge railway routes by 2021\u20132022 (India, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs 2018). Indonesia Unconditional NDC target projection: Uncertain or insufficient information Indonesia\u2019s NDC sets an unconditional 29 per cent and a conditional 41 per cent (with sufficient international support) Emissions Gap Report 2019 17 reduction target on the country\u2019s GHG emissions below business-as-usual by 2030. The National Energy Policy referred to in Indonesia\u2019s NDC aims to increase the share of renewable energy in the total primary energy supply to 23 per cent by 2025 from the current 6.5 per cent (Republic of Indonesia, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources [MEMR] 2017), but this target will likely not be met and the country\u2019s heavy reliance on coal-fired power will likely continue under current policy measures (Climate Action Tracker 2019e). The new Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL) 2019\u2013 2028 adopted in January 2019 (Republic of Indonesia 2019) also envisages the installation of almost 40 GW of fossil-fired power plants, about 27 GW of which being coal-fired, in the next 10 years. It is estimated that this 27 GW of coal-fired power alone would annually emit up to 200 MtCO2e over the next 40 years, unless they are decommissioned before the end of their lifetime. In the land-use sector, Presential Instruction No 8 of 2018 (President of the Republic of Indonesia 2018) presents a three- year moratorium on the entire licensing process for palm oil plantations and an order for the relevant central Government ministries and regional governments to conduct a massive review of oil palm licensing data (Mongabay 2018). A recent Presidential Instruction also made the temporary moratorium on forest-clearing permits for logging and plantations issued in 2011 permanent, but the historical development of land- use GHG emissions casts doubt on the effectiveness of these measures (Jong 2019). Although the Global Forest Watch (2018) reported in 2017 that Indonesia was one of the few tropical nations to reduce its deforestation rates in 2017, this was likely due, in part, to the national peat drainage moratorium (Norway, Ministry of Climate and Environment 2016), in effect since 2016. Japan Unconditional NDC target projection: Emissions 0\u201315 per cent above target Under its NDC, Japan aims to reduce its GHG emissions by 26 per cent by 2030 from 2013 levels. Japan\u2019s total GHG emissions seem to have peaked in the fiscal year (FY) of 2013 before decreasing for four consecutive years. In the power sector, decarbonization efforts are being strengthened only incrementally. In March 2019, the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) announced three new actions to accelerate decarbonization progress in the power sector (MOE 2019), among which is stricter enforcement of environmental impact assessments on planned coal-fired power plants.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50d39624-7623-4f96-beb9-6177627cd7f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "50d39624-7623-4f96-beb9-6177627cd7f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "50eed0db79b2755c24aa5e0072b8cc5f4b3bf2b9469edf2141a58734744de1c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "32f7a8a5-a7e0-4117-9044-96af3bf02bbd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36e2b89cbd64b47a6b75e121dd4384692cb77654694b725d5a9ae741a18029a0"}}, "hash": "c7d8a844922314e84d68b7de7bb204e54dae2b7f8601c7d7dbd532867a04d7cf", "text": "However, the downsides are the overall limited effectiveness of the measures, as the MOE cannot veto the plans, and that coal-fired power plants already under construction will be unaffected by this action.

These new rules are likely to secure proper business disciplines for solar PV in Japan, despite curbing the speed at which large-scale solar projects can be deployed after the full installation of capacity with FIT approval. For wind power, the new law put into effect on 1 April 2019 (METI 2019a) allows offshore wind power developers to occupy a registered area up to 30 years after consultation with relevant ministries and local stakeholders. This will promote the development of offshore wind farms. For the transport sector, a panel under the METI published an interim report on the long-term strategy for car manufacturing (METI 2018), which establishes a long- term goal to reduce tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions by 80 per cent below 2010 levels by 2050 for all new vehicles produced by Japanese car manufacturers and by 90 per cent by 2050 for new passenger vehicles. The goal for new passenger vehicles assumes a near 100 per cent share of electrified vehicles (including hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles). With CEOs of major car manufacturers such as Toyota, Nissan and Honda all being members of the panel, the development of these long-term goals can be considered an important step towards decarbonization of Japan\u2019s transport sector. Mexico Unconditional NDC target projection: Overachievement of the target by less than 15 per cent Mexico\u2019s NDC makes an unconditional commitment to reduce GHG emissions by 22 per cent below business-as- usual in 2030, implying a net emissions peak from 2026, and a conditional commitment to reduce emissions by 36 per cent below business-as-usual in 2030. Mexico\u2019s new Administration has stalled years of progress in the energy sector with decisions that threaten to reverse progress made towards enhanced climate action through, for example, Mexico\u2019s General Climate Change law of 2012 (Mexico, C\u00e1mara de Diputados del H. Congreso de la Uni\u00f3n 2012) or its Energy Transition law of 2015 (Mexico, C\u00e1mara de Diputados del H. Congreso de la Uni\u00f3n 2015). The National Electricity Outlook (PRODESEN) 2019\u20132033 adopted in June 2019 (Mexico, Ministry of Energy 2019) limits deeper deployment of clean energy (including efficient cogeneration) beyond the 35.1 per cent by 2024 target (24.12 per cent in June 2018) by increasing fossil fuel-fired generation, reducing wind power and not increasing solar power growth rates. Furthermore, the Ministry has cancelled the 2018 long-term power auction and cut-off the transmission lines to evacuate renewable energy. There have been no announcements of further Emissions Gap Report 2019 18 auctions. Despite the recognition of the importance of reducing GHG emissions and increasing renewable energy deployment, the National Development Plan adopted in June 2019 (Mexico, Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n 2019) adds a new additional refinery with the aim to increase gasoline, diesel and fuel oil production. After postponing Mexico\u2019s 2018 long-term energy auction round \u2013 a policy scheme introduced in 2015 after the country\u2019s energy reform that aimed to increase its clean energy share \u2013 President Lopez Obrador cancelled the fourth auction round in January 2019 Mexico, Centro Nacional de Control de Energ\u00eda 2018). Although the first three rounds of electricity auctions had led to a substantial amount of new renewable energy projects (Notimex 2019), President Lopez Obrador\u2019s plans for the power sector include the modernization of gas and coal-fired power plants previously planned for retirement and the construction of a 700 MW coal-fired plant in the short and midterm (Sol\u00eds 2018a, 2018b). President Obrador has also presented a National Refining Plan aimed at \u201crescuing\u201d Mexico\u2019s oil industry and achieving energy independence through the rehabilitation of six oil refineries and the construction of a new one in Dos Bocas, Tabasco, and a plan for constructing a railroad in the Yucatan peninsula (known as the Maya Train project) (Government of Mexico 2019). These three infrastructure projects have faced national and international criticism (see, for example, Gurr\u00eda (2019)).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c4108a8-fb4d-4e8b-b1dc-2005b00045b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c4108a8-fb4d-4e8b-b1dc-2005b00045b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "74b3d0c7eb632440e0b82913df5045200d3847573be3be23dabf1d1f404ef428"}, "2": {"node_id": "0eb18580-bd25-4a52-9b7e-1dcddb896681", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1509eefbc4627e5f83e44018a047ab6dd98cdd5519b7e6e4620b1346cb9047cc"}}, "hash": "092895ffdfb8efe3ed38a4c9103fd3450f1eb0a4eefb56fd4353ead42a8ac193", "text": "Republic of Korea Unconditional NDC target projection: Emissions at least 15 per cent above target Dynamic discussions are taking place in the Republic of Korea in relation to the adequacy of its 2030 power sector emissions target.

However, the plan in the initial road map to procure 96 MtCO2e per year of international credits was subject to environmental integrity and economic feasibility-related criticism. In July 2018, the road map was amended, stating that 16 MtCO2e per year will be reduced by international credits rather than 96 MtCO2e per year (Republic of Korea, Ministry of Environment 2018). Another important change to the road map was that contemplated emission reductions from the power sector were reduced from 64.5 MtCO2e per year to 23.7 MtCO2e per year (Republic of Korea, Ministry of Environment 2018), which is mainly attributable to the Moon Jae- In Administration\u2019s nuclear policy, under which 8.8 GW of new nuclear power plant construction projects were cancelled. The amended GHG road map stated that an additional emission reduction requirement of 34.1 MtCO2e per year may be imposed on the power sector depending on further discussions, which mostly relates to how ambitiously the country will decommission its operational coal power plant fleet by 2030. The additional 34.1 MtCO2e per year reduction issue has become the centre of national climate and energy policy discussions and was one of most contentious topics when establishing the Third Energy Framework Plan, under which the country aims to increase its renewables share in total electricity generation from 7.6 per cent in 2017 to 35 per cent by 2040 and to phase down coal and nuclear power (KBS 2019). Air pollution concerns, originating from the South Chungcheong Province, where approximately 18 GW of coal power plants (half of the Republic of Korea\u2019s coal power fleet) are located, may expedite the speed of coal power plant retirements and lead to more ambitious reductions from the country\u2019s power sector. In early 2019, opposition from this Province led to the suspension of retrofits of 4.5 GW of coal power plants (Chosunilbo 2019; Chung 2019). If the retrofits were implemented, the life period of these power plants would have extended to until around 2040. The Governor of South Chungcheong Province has also committed to decommissioning coal power plants that are older than 25 years, which, if successful, will result in 14 units being decommissioned by 2026 (Powering Past Coal Alliance 2018). Russia Unconditional NDC target projection: Overachievement of the target by more than 15 per cent, suggesting a weak target Russia pledged to limit GHG emissions by 15\u201325 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020 and by 25\u201330 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030, and recently announced that it will ratify the Paris Agreement (United Nations 2019). While the ratification date is uncertain, a draft Decree of the President on a new 2030 emission reduction target is to be prepared by December 2019, with a draft implementation plan to achieve the 2030 target expected in the first half of 2020 (UNFCCC 2019b). The Russian Action Plan mandates the drafting of a \u201clow-carbon strategy until 2050\u201d by the end of 2019 (Sauer and Collett-White 2019). However, no mention of the preparation of this draft has yet been made. The fact that only draft documents are expected provides a weak basis for tracking and assessing progress, as they may just contain principles and approaches without concrete mitigation measures and GHG targets. In December 2018, the Government introduced new draft legislation that would establish a cap-and-trade system for major carbon emitters by 2025 (Sauer and Collett- White 2019). Saudi Arabia Unconditional NDC target projection: Uncertain or insufficient information In its NDC, Saudi Arabia commits to reducing emissions by up to 130 MtCO2e per year below business-as-usual Emissions Gap Report 2019 19 by 2030 through actions that contribute to economic diversification and adaptation. The country\u2019s actions to mitigate climate change are driven by its motive to diversify its economy (Al-Sarihi 2019). In 2016, Saudi Arabia published its Vision 2030, which included a renewable energy target of 9.5 GW by 2023 and a phase- out of fossil fuel subsidies (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 2016). However, the implementation of this vision has been delayed for both renewable energy and the fossil fuel price reform (Nereim 2017; Krane 2019).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2fe322a5-763a-4985-a575-d8c150ab6e7a": {"__data__": {"id_": "2fe322a5-763a-4985-a575-d8c150ab6e7a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36e7724105a40ad733d9e5346f6d501ab108de9dba544c9eac36b08fd042dbc3"}, "2": {"node_id": "e16f1002-7ff5-4d1a-9176-e7cc3f50b8a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e77af6bffb6b0e9fca170090b82226a6d4fed1ce1a2dff0baf5f5d246db64157"}}, "hash": "5dd5bdeecc1fac71f0472a260f98b328b920e84acfd731f8a59119977c6dad52", "text": "Most recently, in March 2018, Saudi Arabia and the SoftBank Group signed a memorandum of understanding to build a 200 GW solar plant, the largest single solar project worldwide, as part of Vision 2030 (Nereim and Cunningham 2018).

South Africa Unconditional NDC target projection: Emissions 0\u201315 per cent above target In its Cancun Pledge, South Africa aims to reduce its GHG emissions by 34 per cent below business-as-usual in 2020, and commits to achieving a peak, plateau and decline of GHG emissions in its NDC, with emissions peaking between 2020 and 2025, before plateauing at 398\u2013614 MtCO2e per year between 2025 and 2030. The South African Government released the long-awaited draft of its Integrated Resource Plan (Republic of South Africa, Department of Energy 2018) in August 2018. The revised plan aims to decommission 35 GW of Eskom\u2019s currently operational coal generation capacity (42 GW) by 2050, with 12 GW of this decommissioned by 2030, another 16 GW by 2040, and a further 7 GW by 2050 (Republic of South Africa, Department of Energy 2018). The 5.7 GW of coal capacity currently under construction would be completed and another 1 GW of new coal capacity would be commissioned by 2030. The significant volume of coal capacity to be decommissioned by 2030 and beyond marks a significant shift away from previous planning. The Government has not yet communicated a timeline for the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) update\u2019s final adoption as of September 2019. South Africa approved a carbon tax in February 2019, which covers fossil fuel combustion emissions, industrial processes and product-use emissions, and fugitive emissions (Reuters 2019). The tax has been implemented since June 2019, but a basic tax-free threshold for around 60 per cent of emissions and additional allowances for specific sectors means that tax exemptions will apply for up to 95 per cent of emissions during the first phase until 2022 (KPMG 2019). In addition, South Africa released a draft climate change bill in June 2018 for public comment (Republic of South Africa, Department of Environmental Affairs 2018), but the Government has not yet communicated a timeline for the law\u2019s final adoption as of July 2019. The draft law aims to establish a Ministerial Committee on Climate Change to oversee and coordinate activities across all sector departments. Under the proposed legislation, the Minister of Environmental Affairs together with the Ministerial Committee on Climate Change would have to set sectoral emission targets for each GHG emitting sector in line with the national emission target every five years. Turkey Unconditional NDC target projection: Overachievement of the target by more than 15 per cent, suggesting a weak target In its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), Turkey aims to limit its GHG emissions to 21 per cent below business-as-usual or to 959 MtCO2e per year in 2030 (excluding LULUCF). Turkey\u2019s current emissions are on this trajectory. The energy sector is at the centre of the country\u2019s low-carbon transition debate, representing more than 85 per cent of its total GHG emissions in 2017, with 40 per cent of all energy sectors emissions resulting from electricity generation. At the start of 2018, Turkey put in place an ambitious National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) for the 2017\u20132023 period, which aims to reduce the its total energy demand (in primary terms) by 14 per cent compared with the 2017 level. The six-year plan includes the six sectors that supply and demand energy, covering a comprehensive list of 55 actions. The renewable energy FIT mechanism that will still be available for new projects until the end of 2020 was successful in raising the wind and solar PV share in total electricity demand to 10 per cent (and around a third of the total demand supplied from renewables). Following the global trend, Turkey is diversifying its policy portfolio. Since 2017, three rounds of auctions have taken place for onshore wind (twice) and solar PV with favourable prices and local content requirements. The Government has indicated that auctions will be the key mechanism for renewable energy investments in the coming decade. The Government has set an ambitious plan for new coal- fired power plants, with purchase guarantees and subsidies to investors. Among the G20 members, Turkey ranks third for new coal-fired power plant capacity being planned (37 GW), following China and India (as at January 2019). This is twice as much as Turkey\u2019s current operational capacity. However, planned capacities are not being constructed due to a lack of financing, with around only 1 GW currently under construction. More than 40 GW in planned coal-fired power plant capacity was cancelled over the 2010\u20132018 period.

Emissions Gap Report 2019 20 United States of America Unconditional NDC target projection: Emissions at least 15 per cent above target The current NDC target for the United States of America is to reduce emissions by 26\u201328 per cent from 2005 levels by 2025. However, President Trump\u2019s Government is taking actions to move the country\u2019s emissions trajectory in the opposite direction, cutting environmental regulations in favour of giving more freedom to industry. The Trump Administration recently issued the final Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, its replacement for the Obama Administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which was meant to reduce emissions from power plants in order to achieve the country\u2019s NDC target. While the Clean Power Plan would have reduced power sector emissions by roughly 32 per cent, the ACE rule is expected to reduce them by roughly 1 per cent (Natural Resources Defense Council [NRDC] 2018). The Trump Administration has also frozen the vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks until 2026, meaning that the average fuel economy will remain at 35 miles per gallon (mpg), rather than rising to 54 mpg. According to analysis by the Rhodium Group, this will increase emissions from the transportation sector by 28\u201383 MtCO2e per year by 2030, with the ultimate amount dependent upon the effect of oil prices on consumption (Larsen et al. 2019). However, a group of automakers recently struck a deal with the state of California to strengthen standards for gas mileage and emissions from their vehicles (Van Sant 2019). However, despite the Trump Administration\u2019s actions, market trends have resulted in a significant drop in emissions over the past decade. The country\u2019s energy- related CO2 emissions fell by 14 per cent between 2005 and 2017, while the economy grew by 20 per cent (U.S. Energy Information Administration [EIA] 2018). Action at state and local levels has also grown significantly since President Trump\u2019s announcement that the United States of America would leave the Paris Agreement. A group of 25 governors representing over half of the country\u2019s population and US$11.7 trillion in GDP have joined the U.S. Climate Alliance, a coalition committed to reducing GHG emissions in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement (U.S. Climate Alliance 2019). 2.5 Preparation of long-term strategies and the way forward Another important ongoing policy process is the preparation of long-term low emissions development strategies under the Paris Agreement. As of October 2019, only seven G20 members (Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United States of America) had submitted their strategies to the UNFCCC and another two (the EU28 and South Africa) had published their draft strategies (UNFCCC 2019a). Of the seven long-term strategies submitted by G20 members to the UNFCCC, only Japan committed to achieving long-term net zero GHG emissions as early as possible in the second half of this century, though France and the United Kingdom have passed bills that commit to net zero GHG emissions by 2050. A few other members, including the EU28, are in the process of revising their domestic and international long-term goals. For non-annex I G20 members, there have been some indications to suggest that they would establish long-term strategies that contain timelines for achieving net zero GHG emissions. For comparison, to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C in 2100 with a 66 per cent chance, global total net CO2 emissions would need to be reduced to zero by around 2050 (IPCC 2018). There is an increasing number of countries that have set or are in the process of setting net zero emissions targets domestically (Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit 2019).

The chapter first presents the various scenarios used for the assessment of the emissions gap (section 3.2), that is, reference scenarios, NDC scenarios and scenarios consistent with limiting global warming to a specific temperature limit. The next section updates the 2030 emissions gap (section 3.3). This is followed by a discussion of the temperature implications of the emissions gap (section 3.4) and the potential impact of non-state actions on the gap (section 3.5). 3.2 Scenarios considered for the 2030 gap assessment This section will provide an update on the scenarios considered for the year-2030 gap assessment which comprise reference scenarios, NDC scenarios and least-cost mitigation scenarios consistent with specific temperature targets. 3.2.1 Reference scenarios and updates Reference scenarios are used as benchmarks against which progress in emission reductions can be tracked. Two reference scenarios are considered: the 2005 policies scenario and the current policy scenario. 1 This scenario is the same as the \u201cno policy scenario\u201d of previous reports. The 2005 policies scenario projects global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions assuming no new climate policies are put in place from around 2005 onwards1. For 2019, the data for this scenario are updated and based on projections from six modelling studies that are also used for the current policy scenario projections from the same data source (the CD-LINKS Scenario Database, version 1.0) to maintain consistency (McCollum et al. 2018). Data for this scenario was available from the following international modelling groups: International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA using the MESSAGE\u2013 GLOBIOM model), Joint Research Centre (JRC using the POLES model), National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES using the Asia-Pacific Integrated [AIM] model), PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL using the IMAGE model), Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK using the REMIND\u2013 MAgPIE model) and RFF\u2013CMCC European Institute on Economics and the Environment (RFF\u2013CMCC using the WITCH model). The current policy scenario projects GHG emissions assuming all currently adopted and implemented policies (defined as legislative decisions, executive orders, or equivalent) are realized and that no additional measures are undertaken. Updated data from eight modelling groups were available for this scenario. These include updated estimates from four modelling groups also considered in the UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2018 (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2018): Climate Action Tracker (CAT) (CAT 2019), JRC (Tchung-Ming et al. 2018), PBL (CD-LINKS Scenario Database) (McCollum et al. 2018), and the International Energy Agency (IEA) (2018). In addition, four new modelling groups (IIASA, NIES, PIK and RFF\u2013CMCC) provided data for this scenario, available in the CD-LINKS Scenario Database (McCollum et al. 2018). Emissions Gap Report 2019 22 3.2.2 NDC scenarios and updates The NDC scenarios estimate the levels of global total GHG emissions that are projected as a result of the implementation of the mitigation actions pledged by countries in their NDCs. In line with previous gap reports, two NDC scenarios are considered: the unconditional and the conditional NDC scenario. The unconditional NDC scenario assumes countries only implement the mitigation actions specified in their NDCs that have no conditions attached. Parties that do not have an NDC or solely have a conditional target in their NDC are assumed to follow their current policy scenario. The conditional NDC scenario assumes full achievement of Parties\u2019 mitigation pledges (both the conditional and unconditional actions listed as part of the mitigation contribution in their NDCs). Parties that do not have conditional mitigation targets in their NDC follow their unconditional target. Appendix A.1 (available online) provides a full overview of the studies considered for the reference and NDC scenarios. The NDC scenario of the 2019 report is based on updated data from the same data sources as the current policies scenario and is provided by 12 modelling groups.

Nevertheless, the impact of excluding studies published before 2015 is small. The projected global emissions levels of the NDC scenarios are very similar to the levels assessed in the 2018 UNEP Emissions Gap Report2. 3.2.3 Least-cost mitigation scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature limits and updates in light of the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C Estimates of where GHG emissions should be in the year 2030 in order to be consistent with a least-cost pathway towards limiting global warming to specific temperature limits are calculated from the scenarios that were compiled as part of the mitigation pathway assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report 2 Assuming 100-year global warming potential (GWP) values of the IPCC\u2019s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for both datasets. 3 More specifically, least-cost pathways are calculated with integrated assessment models (that is, models that combine representations of the energy, economic, land and environment systems), and distribute the emission reductions across regions, sectors and gases in such a way that the global discounted reduction costs are minimized over time and the climate target is achieved with varying probability (see also box 3.1 in the UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2017). on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C (IPCC SR1.5) (Rogelj et al. 2018), and are available online (Huppmann et al. 2018a; Huppmann et al. 2018b). Similar to the UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2018, least-cost mitigation pathways \u2013 or pathways that aim at limiting warming to specific temperature limits at the lowest overall cost3 \u2013 are selected and grouped into three temperature scenario groups according to their maximum cumulative CO2 emissions from 2018 onwards. This approach ensures that all scenarios in a specific temperature scenario group result in similar maximum warming and that there is limited overlap between the various groups. Moreover, this approach is consistent with the approach of the IPCC SR1.5 that groups scenarios in different categories based on their maximum temperature outcome (IPCC 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018). Peak warming is achieved around the time of net-zero CO2 emissions (Ricke and Caldeira 2014; Joos et al. 2013; Zickfeld and Herrington 2015) and current technical assessments of mitigation pathways show that some degree of carbon-dioxide removal (CDR) is required to compensate for ongoing emissions in sectors that are hard to decarbonize (IPCC 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018). After peak warming, global temperature rise could potentially be slowly reversed through the continued deployment of global CDR to achieve net negative CO2 emissions (Allen et al. 2018; Zickfeld, MacDougall and Matthews 2016; Tokarska and Zickfeld 2015). However, CDR deployment at such scales is associated with important risks, as highlighted in earlier UNEP Emissions Gap Reports (for example, UNEP (2010)) and other assessment (de Coninck et al. 2018; Roy et al. 2018; Fuss et al. 2018). The three temperature scenario groups describe a range of pathways that keep warming in the range of below 2\u00b0C\u20131.5\u00b0C and allow the identification of the consequences of strengthened or weakened action at various degrees of ambition, from limiting warming to roughly around 2\u00b0C over potential interpretations of \u201cwell below 2\u00b0C\u201d, to pursuing to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C, and their corresponding emission reductions (see table 3.1). Each scenario considers a least-cost climate change mitigation pathway that starts reductions from 2020. The temperature outcomes of these scenarios are estimated using the climate model set up used in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (Meinshausen et al. 2009; Meinshausen, Raper and Wigley 2011; Rogelj et al. 2014; Clarke et al. 2014). \u25b6 Below 2.0\u00b0C scenario: This scenario limits maximum cumulative CO2 emissions from 2018 until the time net-zero CO2 emissions are reached Emissions Gap Report 2019 23 (or until 2100 if net-zero is not reached before4) to between 900 and 1300 GtCO2, and cumulative 2018\u20132100 emissions to at most 1200 GtCO2. It is consistent with limiting end-of-century warming to below about 2.0\u00b0C with about 66 per cent or greater probability, while limiting peak global warming during the twenty-first century to below 2.0\u00b0C with about 66 per cent or greater probability.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1bd1d99e-fee3-497f-89df-055dd506fe68": {"__data__": {"id_": "1bd1d99e-fee3-497f-89df-055dd506fe68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad554b0e046dee406b36e54f32377e44653afb83449bd8c36a014a00b10d6257"}, "2": {"node_id": "bcf208c7-e42d-4f34-8ac8-69f80763d210", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a504100ebe751c8c934fcc0522855e8039b6a4c69df60b7cd448c736bf8dd5e1"}}, "hash": "d3bfc55b3c53a1fcc4c04082d133c39d10ca33b5e99b976bd97d87a7ab6bd412", "text": "The median estimate of 2030 GHG emissions for this scenario is 41 GtCO2e, which is consistent with the median 40 GtCO2e estimated for the \u201clower 2\u00b0C\u201d scenario category of the IPCC SR1.5 (see table 2.4 in (Rogelj et al. 2018)). \u25b6 Below 1.8\u00b0C scenario: This scenario limits maximum cumulative CO2 emissions from 2018 until the time net-zero CO2 emissions are reached (or until 2100 if net-zero is not reached before) to between 600 and 900 GtCO2, and cumulative 2018-2100 emissions to at most 900 GtCO2.

This scenario is included to provide additional, more granular information about how emissions reduction requirements in 2030 change with gradually increasing stringency of global mitigation action. \u25b6 Below 1.5\u00b0C in 2100 scenario: This scenario limits maximum cumulative CO2 emissions from 2018 until the time net-zero CO2 emissions are reached (all model realizations in this scenario reach net-zero before 2100) to below 600 GtCO2, and cumulative 2018\u20132100 emissions to at most 380 GtCO2, when net negative CO2 emissions in the second half of the century are included. It is consistent with limiting global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C in 2100 with about 66 per cent probability, while limiting peak global warming during the twenty-first century to 1.6\u2013 1.7\u00b0C with about 66 per cent or greater probability. This class of scenarios is consistent with the scenarios in the IPCC 1.5\u00b0C Special Report that limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot (as explained in box 3.2, UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2018; see also characteristics in table 3.1). The median estimate of 2030 emissions of 25 GtCO2e is well within the median estimate range of 22\u201328 GtCO2e of the IPCC SR1.5 for the 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot (see table 3.1). Table 3.1 shows the 2030 global GHG emission levels for the three scenarios. 4 If a scenario does not achieve net-zero CO2 emissions before 2100 while still holding warming to below a specific temperature threshold, it is assumed that global CO2 emissions will reach net-zero emissions immediately or shortly after 2100. 5 This change was made to be more in line with the decisions made at COP24 in Katowice, where the Parties agreed on AR5 for reporting reasons. A full switch to AR5 GWP was not yet possible because the literature is not yet up-to-date regarding this decision. 6 The numbers are based on the estimates of UNEP (2015) of 60 GtCO2e (range of 58\u201362 GtCO2e), assuming 100-year GWP values of the IPCC SAR. Here, these estimates are converted using 100-year GWP values of the IPCC AR4, leading to an adjustment of 1.5 GtCO2e. 3.3 The 2030 emissions gap In line with previous reports, the emissions gap for 2030 is defined as the difference between global total GHG emissions from least-cost scenarios that keep global warming to 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C with varying levels of likelihood and the estimated global total GHG emissions resulting from a full implementation of the NDCs. To allow for a more nuanced interpretation of the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature targets, this assessment includes a below 1.8\u00b0C scenario. This section updates the gap based on estimated levels of GHG emissions in 2030 for the scenarios described in section 3.2. Table 3.1 provides a full overview of 2030 emission levels for the seven scenarios considered in this assessment, as well as the resulting emissions gap. A change compared to 2018 is that all emission projections have been aggregated with the 100-year global warming potential (GWP) values of the IPCC AR45, whereas UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2018 used the GWP values of the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC SAR). The difference between SAR and AR4 GWPs leads to a difference in both scenarios for 2\u00b0C, 1.8 \u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C and current policy and NDC levels (typically 1\u20132 GtCO2e), so that the effect on the size of the emissions gap will be limited.

The remaining carbon budget as a tool for scenario classification The IPCC SR1.5 provided an updated assessment of the remaining carbon budget, that is, the total amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted if global warming is to be kept to a specific level relative to pre-industrial levels (Rogelj et al. 2018). Owing to advances and improvements in methods to estimate remaining carbon budgets, the IPCC SR1.5 reported median estimates that were larger than those reported five years earlier by the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (Stocker et al. 2013; IPCC 2014). Despite these larger estimates of the remaining carbon budget by the IPCC, the emission pathways corresponding to the Paris Agreement limits used in the UNEP Emissions Gap Reports did not require a strong adjustment. How can this be the case? The updates of the remaining carbon budget estimates in the IPCC SR1.5 were based on three main methodological advancements (Rogelj et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2019): (i) accounting for the latest estimates of anthropogenic global warming to date (Allen et al. 2018); (ii) a more formal description of the uncertainty in the ratio of global warming projected per cumulative ton of CO2 (Stocker et al. 2013); and (iii) a more precise estimate of the warming due to emissions other than CO2 at the time of peak warming (Rogelj et al. 2018; Huppmann et al. 2018a). However, each of these methodological improvements were to some degree already taken into account in the emission pathways of the UNEP Emissions Gap Reports, which previously used a reduced-complexity climate model set up (Meinshausen et al. 2009; Meinshausen, Raper and Wigley 2011; Rogelj et al. 2014; Clarke et al. 2014). This model set up applied the methodological improvements that formed the basis for updating the IPCC SR1.5 carbon budgets. Specifically, it (i) accounted for recent estimates of warming to date by expressing temperature projections relative to a recent reference period (the 1986\u20132005 period) (Clarke et al. 2014); (ii) had a better coverage of the uncertainty in the ratio of global warming to cumulative CO2 emissions by using an observationally constrained probabilistic climate model set up (Meinshausen et al. 2009); and (iii) used integrated assessment mitigation scenarios with internally consistent evolutions of all GHGs, also at the time of peak warming (Clarke et al. 2014). Previous UNEP Emissions Gap Reports were thus based on assumptions regarding temperature projections that were to some degree consistent with the methodological improvements implemented for the SR1.5 remaining carbon budget assessment, explaining why the emission pathways of the UNEP Emissions Gap Reports have not changed so much.

However, since this did not happen, the required cuts in emissions are now 2.7 per cent per year from 2020 to year- 2030 for the 2\u00b0C goal and 7.6 per cent per year on average for the 1.5\u00b0C goal. Emissions Gap Report 2019 27 3.4.2 Temperature implications Emissions until 2030 do not fully determine the warming until the end of the century, but the trend until 2030 can be used to project the warming, assuming this trend would continue until 2100. As in previous UNEP Emissions Gap Reports, this report uses internally consistent long-term emissions projections and relates the GHG emissions in the year 2030 to outcomes over the entire century (Rogelj et al. 2016). This approach provides temperature estimates for a wide range of 2030 GHG emissions levels (Jeffery et al. 2018) that are consistent with the wider integrated scenario literature. Assuming that climate action continues consistently throughout the twenty-first century, a continuation of current policies would lead to a global mean temperature rise of 3.5\u00b0C by 2100 (range of 3.4\u20133.9\u00b0C, 66 per cent probability). This corresponds roughly to a tripling of the current level of warming as assessed by the IPCC (2018). The current unconditional NDCs as assessed in this report are consistent with limiting warming likely to 3.2\u00b0C (range 3.0\u20133.5\u00b0C) by the end of the century (66 per cent probability). These values are reduced by about 0.2\u00b0C if both conditional and unconditional NDCs are implemented. It is clear that neither current policies nor NDCs are adequate to limit warming to the temperature limits included in the Paris Agreement. Temperature implications of the current NDCs can also be looked at from the perspective of the carbon budget that would be emitted until 2030 under the current NDCs. The 8 Note that the \u201cbelow 1.5\u00b0C in 2100\u201c scenario category applies a peak carbon budget limit of 600 GtCO2, which in itself is not sufficient to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C with a high likelihood, but it limits peak warming with greater than 66 per cent probability to no more than 1.7\u00b0C (see table 3.1). In addition, the \u201cbelow 1.5\u00b0C in 2100\u201d scenario category applies an end-of-century carbon budget limit of 380 GtCO2 to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C with a high likelihood. This reflects the 420 GtCO2 remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C with 66 per cent probability, which is further reduced by specific Earth system feedbacks. A value of about 40 GtCO2 is applied for this correction because the stringency of these scenarios suggest a lower impact of these processes than the 100 GtCO2 that was assessed for warming up to 2\u00b0C. IPCC SR1.5 reported that for limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C with 50 per cent probability, the remaining carbon budget from 2018 onward amounts to 580 GtCO2. This would be further reduced to 420 GtCO2 for having a 66 per cent probability of success of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C. Further taking into account reinforcing Earth-system components, such as permafrost thawing, could reduce these estimates by a further 100 GtCO2 8. Starting from a current level of global CO2 emissions of 41.6 GtCO2 in 2018 (Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. 2018) and assuming a straight trajectory to 2030, the current unconditional NDC scenario implies cumulative emissions of about 510 GtCO2 (range of 495\u2013528 GtCO2) until 2030. Therefore, current unconditional NDCs until 2030 already go beyond the carbon budget limits set for 1.5\u00b0C. Together with the knowledge that the current status of policies and measures that are being implemented by countries would lead to even more emissions, this leaves no doubt that the current NDCs are blatantly inadequate to achieve the climate goals of the Paris Agreement.

The Secretary- General\u2019s message echoed the growing popular movement for transformative, ambitious climate action. The focus on ambition and action is well founded, as illustrated by the gap assessment in Chapter 3. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of recent ambitious climate actions by national and subnational governments as well as non- state actors, and a detailed overview of policy progress and opportunities for enhanced mitigation ambition for selected G20 members. The objective is to inform the preparation of new and updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that countries are requested to submit by 2020. The chapter addresses the following questions: \u25b6 How has the global situation changed since the Paris Agreement was adopted and how does this affect opportunities to increase ambition? \u25b6 How many and what type of ambitious climate commitments have been adopted by national governments, as well as by cities, states, regions, companies and investors to date? 1 Using the latest inventory data for all G20 members in the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) (Olivier and Peters 2018) and latest reported national inventory data for each country for LULUCF emissions. \u25b6 Among selected G20 members, what progress has been made recently towards ambitious climate action and what are the key opportunities for additional action? The primary focus of this chapter is on ambitious climate targets and actions, which are defined as those that unambiguously contribute towards the transformations required to align global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pathways with the Paris Agreement goals. Section 4.2 summarizes the global opportunity to enhance ambition and action and provides an overview of the status of ambitious climate mitigation commitments made by G20 members as well as countries and non-state actors globally. As G20 members account for 78 per cent of global GHG emissions, they largely determine global emission trends and the extent to which the 2030 emissions gap will be closed. This chapter therefore also pays particular attention to G20 members, with section 4.3 focusing on progress and opportunities for enhancing mitigation ambition of nine selected G20 members: Argentina, Brazil, China, the European Union, India, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and the United States of America, which represented around 56 per cent of global GHG emissions in 2017.1 The selection of the G20 members was based entirely on the availability of expertise in the author team.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cde2d699-1b18-4130-9eb7-1365c168d864": {"__data__": {"id_": "cde2d699-1b18-4130-9eb7-1365c168d864", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36caaa5573ac716d6696269ea406bbeab3925733ed171e7e8d922eb68e5500b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "1f6711ff-de31-4a0d-aa85-e142aa93d224", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2337feda603928c150adf9cf2d5402fec08d3d6afcd17c43fb6e396577713deb"}}, "hash": "4d76b2adf4f7917b552d923fe4a795b93e59a1c24b22e44add1139512dee668c", "text": "Supplementing this chapter, annex B provides a detailed overview of the status of ambitious climate mitigation commitments made by G20 members as Emissions Gap Report 2019 29 well as countries and non-state actors globally, while annex C provides a detailed update of recent policy developments of the nine selected G20 members, considering ambitious climate actions, as well as actions that are incremental.

To align with the 2\u00b0C limit, global CO2 emissions would need to decline by about 25 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero around 2070. Under the Paris Agreement, countries are invited to submit long-term low GHG emission development strategies by 2020 and are requested to submit updated or new NDCs also by 2020. Considering the update of NDCs in the context of the development of long-term mitigation strategies is an important means to ensure consistency between short-term mitigation policies and targets and long-term goals. The IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C provides clear guidance on the economy-wide and sector transformations that are needed to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C by the end of the century (see also chapter 5). Although the time frame for global emission reductions consistent with the 2\u00b0C limit is slightly longer, the major long-term sectoral transformations needed to reach net zero GHG emissions globally are essentially the same and can be summarized under the following headings: \u25b6 Full decarbonization of the energy sector, based on renewable energy and electrification across sectors \u2013 this includes phasing out coal-fired power plants. \u25b6 Decarbonization of the transport sector in parallel with modal shifts to public transportation, cycling and walking. \u25b6 Shifts in industry processes towards electricity and zero carbon and substitution of carbon-intensive products. \u25b6 Decarbonization of the building sector, including electrification and greater efficiency. \u25b6 Enhanced agricultural management as well as demand-side measures such as dietary shifts to more sustainable, plant-based diets and measures to reduce food waste. \u25b6 Zero net deforestation and the adoption of policies to conserve and restore land carbon stocks and protect natural ecosystems, aiming for significant net CO2 uptake in this sector (IPCC 2018; UNEP 2017). Transformations in these areas will require major shifts in investment patterns and financial flows, as well as several sectoral and economy-wide policy targets. The ambitious climate targets considered in section 4.2.3 are based on these overall areas of transformation and important sub- targets. A full overview is provided in annex B. 4.2.2 Drivers of ambition have evolved since the Paris Agreement Compared with the run-up to the Paris Agreement in 2015, when countries prepared their intended NDCs, many drivers of climate action have changed, with several options for ambitious climate action becoming less costly, more numerous and better understood. Changes within three main categories in particular could facilitate greater NDC ambition today (UNEP 2018) including climate change. Countries will meet again at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). First, technological and economic developments present opportunities to decarbonize the economy, especially the energy sector, at a cost that is lower than ever. Second, the synergies between climate action and economic growth and development objectives, including options for addressing distributional impacts, are better understood. Finally, policy momentum across various levels of government, as well as a surge in climate action commitments by non-state actors, is creating opportunities for countries to enhance the ambition of their NDCs. The cost of renewable energy is declining more rapidly than was predicted just a few years ago. Renewables are currently the cheapest source of new power generation in most of the world, with the global weighted average purchase or auction price for new utility-scale solar power photovoltaic (PV) systems and utility-scale onshore wind turbines projected to compete with the marginal operating cost of existing coal plants by next year (International Renewable Energy Agency [IRENA] 2019. See also Chapter 6). These trends are increasingly manifesting in a decline in coal plant construction, including the cancellation of planned plants, as well as the early retirement of existing plants (Jewell et al. 2019; Smouse et al. 2018). Moreover, real-life cost declines are outpacing projections. The 2019 costs of onshore wind and solar PV power are 8 and 13 per cent lower respectively than IRENA predictions from just one year ago in 2018 (IRENA 2019). These cost declines, along with those of battery storage, are opening possibilities for utility-scale solar power.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60a47dc2-49d9-46e8-84d4-499c01f15040": {"__data__": {"id_": "60a47dc2-49d9-46e8-84d4-499c01f15040", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04c4b6184e0dcd5d413e3ad704124392980fd056299df73ca96ebb008473f75a"}, "2": {"node_id": "ed54868c-5bf4-4a1f-bb68-17ff0f5a44f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "86ea99c3be57feca07cf071455b8ced30620e035df98686df6b0cdc28c818bf1"}}, "hash": "3578f15e6e6620f7f651f5f7bc01c407707ceb7e776697baabf899514c9fdb46", "text": "Although technological progress has been uneven across sectors, with the industry and buildings sectors in particular lagging behind (International Energy Agency [IEA] 2019), the Emissions Gap Report 2019 30 benefits extend beyond power generation.

Aside from advancements in technology, a growing body of research has documented that ambitious climate action, economic growth and sustainable development can go hand-in-hand when well managed. Analysis by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate estimates that ambitious climate action could generate US$26 trillion in economic benefits between now and 2030 and create 65 million jobs by 2030, while avoiding 700,000 premature deaths from air pollution (The New Climate Economy 2018). Similarly, the IPCC (2018) found that, if managed responsibly, most mitigation options consistent with limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C could have strong synergies with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially those related to health, clean energy, cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, and oceans (IPCC 2018. See also chapter 5). Momentum at all levels of government and parts of the business sector increases the potential to reflect greater ambition in the NDCs. At the subnational level, for example, over 70 large cities housing 425 million people have committed to go carbon-neutral by 2050 or sooner (see table B-1). At the national level, 13 countries have communicated long-term, low GHG emissions development strategies to the UNFCCC (UNFCCC 2019), with many more under development or developed at the national level but not communicated internationally (WRI 2019). At the international level, the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol outlines phase-down schedules for production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Businesses are increasingly moving towards zero emissions, 100 per cent renewables and 100 per cent emission-free transport (see annex B). Taken together, cost-competitive technologies, potential synergies with development and economic growth, and strong action from the subnational to international levels provide a strong basis for more ambitious NDCs by 2020. 4.2.3 An increasing number of countries and regions are adopting ambitious goals in line with the transformation needed, but the scale and pace are far from sufficient Several national and subnational governments and non-state actors have embarked on ambitious climate action in different policy areas that can help initiate the transformational change required to meet the long- term goals of the Paris Agreement. Although recent developments send promising signals, the adoption of ambitious climate targets is far from the scale and rate urgently required. 2 For this reason, reference is made to \u2018zero emissions targets\u2019 and the reader is referred to annex B, table B-1 for further detail. This section presents an overview of the extent to which G20 members, as well as and countries and regions worldwide, have committed or are in the process of committing to ambitious climate targets and actions. These targets and actions are defined as unambiguously supporting a move towards the major long-term sectoral transformations required to meet the well-below 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C temperature limits of the Paris Agreement, as outlined in section 4.2.1. Expanding on the key types of policy targets and actions that would support such major transformations, this section provides an overview of the status of commitments to the following ambitious climate targets organized in six main categories (table 4.1). A detailed overview of commitments made as of October 2019 for the above targets by individual countries, regions, businesses and investors is provided in annex B. It should be noted that the overview of targets and commitments provided in this section and in the annex is not exhaustive. Rather, it builds on a broad range of literature to identify ambitious climate action in the different categories (Kuramochi et al. 2018), but given the scope of existing policies and rapid changes in policymaking, the overview may not be completely up-to- date. The list of targets is also incomplete. Notably, it is beyond the scope of this chapter to provide an overview of ambitious climate targets and commitments for agriculture. Finally, no attempt has been made to assess whether individual commitments are aligned with global least cost-effective emissions pathways to the 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C targets. Commitments differ in various respects, including the extent to which they are legally binding, the percentages and target years adopted, whether they refer to GHG or CO2 emissions and whether they are net targets.2 These specifications are important for a detailed picture of the individual commitments and are provided in annex B. Ambitious climate targets and actions adopted by countries and regions to date are prime examples of climate action that others can follow. Dynamics to adopt legally binding targets differ between target categories and sectors.

Zero emissions targets Emissions Gap Report 2019 33 illustrated in figure 4.1. To date, 71 countries and 11 regions, accounting for about 15 per cent of global GHG emissions in total3, have long-term objectives to achieve net-zero emissions, differing in scope, timing and the degree to which they are legally binding. Before the 2019 Climate Action Summit, the number of countries and states committing to zero emission targets was 21 and 8 respectively. Five G20 members have committed to long-term net-zero emissions targets, of which three (the European Union, and Germany and Italy, as part of the European Union) are currently in the process of passing legislation, with two G20 members (France and the United Kingdom) having recently passed legislation. The remaining 15 G20 members have not yet committed to net-zero emission targets. Economy-wide climate action remains extremely limited in other areas, such as a complete phase-out of fossil-fuel subsidies, comprehensive and ambitious carbon pricing and making finance flows consistent with the Paris Agreement. In 2009, the G20 members adopted a decision to gradually phase out fossil-fuel subsidies, though no country has yet committed to fully phasing these out by a specific year. Similarly, while carbon pricing is expanding, no country has established a comprehensive and ambitious system for this. At present, carbon tax and emissions trading system initiatives at the national and regional levels represent about 20 per cent of global GHG emissions (World Bank 2019). However, only 10 per cent of global emissions from fossil fuels are estimated to be priced at a level consistent with limiting global warming to 2\u00b0C (UNEP 2018). Furthermore, no country has explicitly committed to making their finance flows consistent with the Paris Agreement, though several multilateral development banks are currently working towards aligning their financing activities with the Paris Agreement goals (World Bank 2018). In terms of electricity production (figure 4.2), 53 countries have committed or are in the process of committing to a 100 per cent renewables target. The number of countries increased from 10 countries before the 2019 Climate Action Summit. However, these countries accounted for less than 1 per cent of global CO2 emissions from electricity generation in 2016.4 Five G20 members have also committed to long-term net-zero emissions targets and, in turn, to fully decarbonizing their electricity sectors. In addition, 33 states and regions, including California (by 2045), and accounting for around 1 per cent of global from electricity generation5, as well as an increasing number of cities and companies, have committed to 100 per cent renewable electricity targets. 3 The zero emission targets considered cover legally binding, legally binding but under consideration, and non-legally binding pledges and participa- tion in respective alliances. The share of these countries has been calculated on latest available EDGAR data and FAO data for LULUCF emissions (FAOSTAT 2018; Olivier and Peters 2018). For regions, their self-reported were used. 4 The share of these countries has been calculated on emissions data for CO2 emission from electricity generation provided by IEA\u2019s CO2 emission form fuel combustion dataset (IEA 2018). 5 The share of these regions has been calculated based on self-reported values.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0135bb90-f23f-4a05-ba38-893939abb185": {"__data__": {"id_": "0135bb90-f23f-4a05-ba38-893939abb185", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88685490fca9febb993a9d4ef09fa062d4b1b600a24eeb9cb2f6f6216b766695"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e6588fd-818e-419a-af56-a53252d2436d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "073d5607626bd99e3b08dde44176c010e96a7df5c1495099dd78681b5d80e557"}}, "hash": "e4083d11c7b16a1bcb1ceaabbbc89e6de62073ce30441ff870349f2c298e67c1", "text": "5 The share of these regions has been calculated based on self-reported values. 6 The share of these countries has been calculated on emissions data for CO2 emission from coal-based electricity generation provided by IEA\u2019s CO2 emission from fuel combustion dataset (IEA 2018).

A few non-state actors show high ambition, including 22 banks that have stopped direct financing to new coal mine projects and 23 banks that have stopped direct financing to new coal plant projects worldwide. An increasing number of countries, states and cities are pledging to phase out combustion engines for vehicles and initiate substantial modal shifts towards public transport, though to date, no such commitments have been made for aviation, shipping and freight transport (figure 4.3). However, there are several interesting examples of non-state actors committing to ambitious climate action for these transport modes, as the figure shows. For example, Norway is aiming to make domestic flights carbon-free by 2040 and several companies are working on zero-emission tanker and port infrastructure. At present, countries and states are largely refraining from ambitious target-setting in the heavy and extractive industry sector (see annex B). Six countries, including one G20 member (France), are currently committed to stopping new fossil-fuel explorations and production. In addition, a few European (re-) insurance companies have recently implemented policies to stop investments, insurance cover and underwriting for new and ongoing fossil-fuel projects. No countries have committed to zero fugitive emissions targets or to ensuring that all new installations are low-carbon or zero emissions and maximize material efficiency. Only Sweden has set a target for ambitious carbon pricing in the industry sector. Some major steel and cement producers have recently pledged to zero emissions by 2050 for their operations. Such commitments and technology road maps could serve as a starting point to define targets in the entire industry sector, following the frontrunners. The buildings sector shows only scattered policy action at high levels of mitigation ambition, mainly centred on policymaking in the European Union (see annex B). In addition, six states and more than 23 cities have recently committed to zero targets for the buildings sector as part of the World Green Building Council\u2019s Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment by 2050. In general, there is a lack of targets for phasing out fossil fuels in heating, zero emissions in the sector and deep retrofits of existing buildings. Emissions Gap Report 2019 34 Figure 4.2.

The G20 members could follow other national and subnational frontrunners driving ambitious climate action in several areas.

The selection of G20 members is based entirely on the availability of data and expertise of the author team. The country-specific opportunities represent possible next steps in the policymaking process based on the current situation. The list of actions is not exhaustive and other actions, including those identified in the previous section and in annex B, would also need to be implemented to achieve global emission reductions at the scale required to maintain progress towards achieving the targets set out in the Paris Agreement. Several steps were followed to identify the opportunities. First, an overview of the main policies affecting GHG emissions was generated for each country. Annex C, available online, provides a detailed update for each G20 member covered in this chapter.

No attempt has been made to provide mitigation potential per G20 member, as it is difficult to provide values that are comparable across members. Using the current policy situation in each country as a starting point, political areas that would be obvious to pursue for development of the next steps were identified. For example, consideration was given to whether policy proposals had already been put forward by relevant actors. Subsequently, the opportunities were checked against the major actions that must be taken to put the world on a path that is compatible with the Paris Agreement long- term temperature goal as summarized in section 4.2.3 and listed in annex B. Finally, the opportunities were cross- checked with several country experts. Table 4.2 provides an overview of selected opportunities for enhancing mitigation ambition identified for the seven G20 members considered in this publication. The selection is based on expert judgements regarding the extent to which these opportunities are in line with ambitious climate actions and targets as defined and outlined in section 2.3. The country sections provide additional examples of country-specific opportunities. We find that the G20 members have ample opportunity to increase the ambition of their climate and energy policies, considering where they are today. There are some common features. For almost all analysed countries, a logical next step would be to plan for a 100 per cent emission-free electricity sector and an associated phase-out of coal- fired power plants. All the analysed countries could also work on incentivizing modal shift in transport, supporting electric vehicles or working towards zero-emission buildings. In other areas, the logical next steps are very country-specific, for example, prohibiting new fossil fuel extractions, eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, enhancing action in industry or taking action to reduce deforestation. Emissions Gap Report 2019 39 Bridging the gap: Transformations towards zero-carbon development pathways Lead authors: Nebojsa Naki\u0107enovi\u0107 (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis and Vienna University of Technology, Austria), Charlie Wilson (Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, UK) Contributing authors: Bill Colglazier (American Association for Advancement of Science), Owen Gaffney (Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Germany), Dirk Messner (United Nations University), Narasimha Rao (Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, USA), Caroline Zimm (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Austria) 5 5.1 The great transformation towards net zero greenhouse gas emissions The previous chapters and the underlying studies of development pathways aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement indicate alarming inconsistencies between current nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and the long-term goal of reaching net zero emissions by mid-century. Closing the emissions gap in 2030 and reaching net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 will require unprecedented efforts to transform our societies, economies, infrastructures and governance institutions. By necessity, this will require profound change in how energy, food and other material-intensive services are supplied. These systems of provision are entwined with the preferences, actions and demands of people as consumers, citizens and communities. Deep-rooted shifts in values, norms, consumer culture and underlying worldviews are inescapably part of the necessary sustainability transformation. Such transformations are disruptive and cannot be achieved through an accumulation of incremental and gradual improvements, as Schumpeter indicates in his vivid example \u201cadd as many mail-coaches as you please, you will never get a railroad by so doing\u201d (Schumpeter 1935). Past and current mitigation efforts have been insufficient to slow the global growth of emissions. Chapter 2 showed that global GHG emissions increased by 2 per cent in 2018, which is almost exactly aligned with the long- term exponential growth rate since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. For many decades, science has made it clear that stabilizing temperatures at any level requires net zero emissions, as the global mean temperature is in the first approximation proportional to cumulative emissions (see chapter 3). Countries are exceedingly late for achieving pathways to close the emissions gap, with most policies and measures so far having been incremental and gradual. As a result, deep transformations are now needed to peak global emissions immediately and commence the rapid decline towards net zero emissions by 2050. This has been termed the \u2018carbon law\u2019 (Rockstr\u00f6m et al. 2017) for halving emissions every decade, starting with a 50 per cent decline by 2030 (Intergovenmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] 2018). Closing the gap in this way could, with proper policy design, also enhance the United Nations 2030 Agenda with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which provides a holistic vision of a sustainable future for all humanity within", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3127b48-0a4a-47b8-a14e-6e7e19383151": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3127b48-0a4a-47b8-a14e-6e7e19383151", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "765b95a836c3d2c857c8206c3c52247d8b928d07dc346206826d0f0d5e9bc00c"}, "3": {"node_id": "3e17d26e-31d8-46d4-87ff-6f2d51e99b7c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "87416ad8a6e50ea8cf97e73368a520e4f85f615c9c8d88233a672b587d2f3a76"}}, "hash": "75d5f51acb304636b9086918345aa1fa67026fea7a9c9803755dd4d7ccd1296a", "text": "planetary boundaries, and thus acts as a new social contract for the world. 5.2. Multiple co-benefits of closing the emissions gap for sustainable development There are thousands of pathways in the literature reviewed that show which strategies, policies and measures would enable fundamental transformations towards complete decarbonization. Constructing alternative pathways is an important way to understand inherent complexities and uncertainties of transformations and to develop robust strategies to navigate them. Multiple pathways could therefore be taken to achieve global decarbonization across spatial and temporal scales. Pathways can be generated by narrative storytelling, model- based quantification or a combination of both. Integrated modelling is particularly useful for characterizing and quantifying interlinkages between options for meeting SDGs (IPCC 2018; Naki\u0107enovi\u0107 et al. 2000; Riahi et al. 2017; The World in 2050 [TWI2050] 2018; TWI2050 2019; van Vuuren et al. 2017). Emissions Gap Report 2019 40 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently synthesized evidence on the sustainable development impacts of pathways which limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C (Rogelj et al. 2018). Figure 5.1 distinguishes interactions between SDGs and three sectoral climate change mitigation strategies: (a) energy supply (e.g. biomass and non-biomass renewables, carbon capture and storage with bioenergy or fossil fuels); (b) energy demand (e.g. fuel switching and efficiency in transport, industry, and buildings); and (c) land use (e.g. sustainable diets and reduced food waste, soil sequestration, livestock and manure management, reduced deforestation). Despite remaining uncertainty about the magnitude and likelihood of interactions in some areas, figure 5.1 provides two important insights. First, there are multiple benefits from achieving climate change goals for other SDGs, with these synergies being more pronounced than trade-offs, especially if implementation is holistic and concurrent (McCollum et al. 2018). Second, energy demand-related mitigation strategies are most consistently and strongly associated with broader sustainability benefits. The World in 2050 (TWI2050) reports demonstrate in more detail the synergies between achieving deep decarbonization and SDGs in unison (Sachs et al. 2019; TWI2050 2018; TWI2050 2019). The basic strategies for closing the emissions gap are clear. In the case of energy supply, a rapid \u2018exponential\u2019 transformation is required towards zero-emission energy resources, particularly renewables (Global Energy Assessment [GEA] 2012; Rockstr\u00f6m et al. 2017). In the case of energy demand, a rapid shift is required towards more energy and materially- efficient services that raise or maintain living standards (Grubler et al. 2018) (See also chapter 6 and chapter 7). In terms of land, sustainable agriculture and the \u2018return\u2019 of land to nature are important measures that can also result in net negative emissions. In all cases, advanced technologies and sustainable behaviours are essential for delivering the transformational change required. The digital revolution could become an important enabler of this transformation if it proves amenable to \u2018social steering\u2019 towards decarbonization (TWI2050 2019). The remainder of this chapter explores six exemplary entry points for closing the emissions gap through transformational change. These entry points are derived from the six major transformations developed in TWI2050 (2018): (a) air pollution, air quality, health; (b) urbanization; (c) governance, education, employment; (d) digitalization; (e) energy- and material-efficient services for raising living standards; (f) land use, food security, bioenergy. 5.3. Entry points for achieving SDGs with climate co-benefits 5.3.1 Air pollution, air quality, health Indoor air pollution is responsible for around 4 million premature deaths each year, with outdoor air pollution accounting for a similar number according to the World Health Organization (WHO) (2019). Clean cooking and universal access to electricity improves health and also reduces GHG emissions if traditional fuels are replaced by renewables, electricity, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or natural gas (see chapter 6). Fossil fuel-related emissions account for two thirds of the excess mortality rate attributable to outdoor air pollution.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e17d26e-31d8-46d4-87ff-6f2d51e99b7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e17d26e-31d8-46d4-87ff-6f2d51e99b7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "765b95a836c3d2c857c8206c3c52247d8b928d07dc346206826d0f0d5e9bc00c"}, "2": {"node_id": "b3127b48-0a4a-47b8-a14e-6e7e19383151", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "75d5f51acb304636b9086918345aa1fa67026fea7a9c9803755dd4d7ccd1296a"}}, "hash": "87416ad8a6e50ea8cf97e73368a520e4f85f615c9c8d88233a672b587d2f3a76", "text": "A global fossil fuel phase-out could avoid over 3 million premature deaths each year from outdoor air pollution, or well over 5 million premature deaths per year if other anthropogenic GHGs, including non-fossil emissions from agriculture and industry, are also controlled (Lelieveld et al. 2019). Transformational pathways show huge synergies between eliminating air pollution and limiting climate change, as well as improving energy security. One study found that the annual policy costs of achieving these three energy-related challenges together would be about 40 per cent lower than the sum of the policy costs for each challenge pursued independently (GEA 2012; McCollum et al. 2011). However, policy has to be done right as there are also significant trade-offs. Reducing air pollution from end- of-pipe particulate matter, sulfur and nitrous oxides can increase CO2 emissions. Small particles and sulfur aerosols also mask anthropogenic temperature rise.

Urbanization and settlements Urban areas are currently home to around 55 per cent of the world\u2019s population and 70 per cent of global economic output, though these figures are projected to grow to 70 per cent and up to 85 per cent respectively by 2050, particularly in small to medium-sized cities in the developing world (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division 2018). Cities are hotspots of the global carbon cycle, with considerable fossil fuel and cement-related emissions from the provision (9.2 GtCO2e) and use (9.6 GtCO2e) of urban infrastructure equivalent to around half of current GHG emissions (Creutzig et al. 2015). What happens in existing and emerging cities, towns and municipal regions will therefore determine the prospects for sustainable development and closing the emissions gap. Many rapidly growing urban areas are following the least sustainable model of all: urban sprawl (Grubler et al. 2012; Seto et al. 2014). Sustainable transformation is needed across all settlements, not merely in mega-conurbations, such as the Tokyo-Osaka corridor, Pearl River Delta or the Boston-Washington corridor.

Informal cities and slums account for a quarter of the urban population. The transformation to sustainable cities and communities requires an integrated set of actions in urban areas around the world. Transport, buildings and industry are the key sources of energy demand and emissions within city boundaries. Certain characteristics of urban transformation are likely to be shared widely. First, more compact urban form tends to reduce energy consumption and increase opportunities for more efficient district heating and cooling systems (Lucon 2014), transportation infrastructure and energy supply networks, and integrated management across different vectors (mobility, electricity, gas, heat). Second, low-carbon infrastructure, including emissions-free electricity, public transportation, broadband connectivity and efficient road networks, is essential for delivering high- quality, affordable and universally accessible public services from health care and education to security and utilities (power, water, connectivity). Third, short journeys account for two thirds of transport emissions in urban areas and could be replaced by active modes (Preston et al. 2013). Electrification of the vehicle fleet alongside mass transit and micromobility can replace diesel and petrol cars, making cities more liveable with lower pollution levels. These examples of urban transformations demonstrate that there are many opportunities for integrating climate protection with initiatives to improve human well-being. 5.3.3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43100d00-e288-4873-b961-9c9168512a97": {"__data__": {"id_": "43100d00-e288-4873-b961-9c9168512a97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3bf5f54629011a8eef52d07d55227a8d116ad66c685cfa660002ec9083e1a06"}, "2": {"node_id": "42653535-cbee-48b6-8d8e-a745ddbf89a6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b5f2717a6e1192b43b2ab2c31982c60a6315e38212aed149ce45f721d466ef5e"}}, "hash": "9dd1f7bcca5cf0e92f9aef6b2d1ce334009fb786771e78d9d6fb7b6cd22fdf51", "text": "5.3.3.

Road maps linking means to desired ends help create clear and stable expectations for the private sector and citizens alike, and therefore serve as coordination mechanisms within government to leverage systemic changes. Second, the legitimacy of sustainable transformation depends on equity, justice and fairness in the distribution of costs and benefits at an individual, sectoral or regional level (Sachs et al. 2019). A particular challenge for transformative governance is how to respond to disruptive changes in technologies, economic sectors and labour markets (TWI2050 2019). Disruption creates uncertainties, instabilities and losers as well as winners, who \u2013 if organized and powerful \u2013 can act as strong barriers to change. In other cases, safety nets are needed to manage adverse distributional effects until the transformation towards sustainability can be achieved for all. Third, new constellations of actors, partnerships and opportunities for citizens, cities, businesses and science are needed to drive proactive change and overcome inertias and path dependencies in incumbent systems. Large-scale transformation depends on social movements to build and reflect widespread public acceptance. This, in turn, depends on compelling visions of the multiple benefits of sustainable lifestyles, an area where research to-date has fallen short (Creutzig et al. 2016). These elements of transformative governance can create a virtuous cycle: social movements depend on a widening arc of public awareness and understanding in which effective science communication can play an important role. Widespread social and moral commitment to sustainable development challenges interests vested in the unsustainable status quo. Civic engagement and popular support underpin the strong national alliances needed for sustainable development. Likeminded cooperation- oriented actors \u2013 governments, city alliances, civil society organizations, scientific institutions \u2013 can scale up coordinated action, embed joint learning processes and support vulnerable populations impacted by climate change. Global governance beyond the local and national levels is also a necessity to achieve carbon neutrality globally by mid- century. Joint action and global rules are needed to stabilize planetary commons, such as the oceans, biodiversity and agricultural soil. Broad-based support for global governance comes from transnational alliances of pioneering actors of transformative change. 5.3.4. Digitalization and disruptive technological change Disruptive technological change can enable sustainable development with co-benefits for closing the emissions gap, but can also exacerbate unsustainable patterns of resource use. This is most clearly evidenced by the promises and risks of the digital revolution, constituted by ongoing advances in information and communication technologies, machine learning and artificial intelligence, connectivity, the Internet of Things (IoT), additive manufacturing (3D printing), virtual and augmented reality, blockchain, robotics and synthetic biology. TWI2050 (2018; 2019) analysed in depth the impacts of digitalization on consumption and production, and resulting GHG emissions. Three trends are particularly important. First, additional units of information-based services can be provided at an almost zero marginal cost, increasing Emissions Gap Report 2019 43 affordability for poorer segments of society. Virtual communication and interaction can also potentially replace a large fraction of long-distance and carbon-intensive business travel. Second, the possibility of matching supply and demand in real time through digital coordination platforms offers step- change improvements in asset utilization, improved quality of service and potentially lower emissions. This is also the underlying principle of a service-based economy in which \u2018ownership\u2019 of goods shifts to \u2018usership\u2019 of services (e.g. shared vehicle fleets and ride-sharing services, see chapter 7). Figure 5.2 illustrates the potential resource savings from displacing the ownership of many single-purpose analogue devices if equivalent services can be accessed through a single multifunctional interface. Third, global communication infrastructures and the next generation of virtual spaces can connect people around the globe, accelerate global learning processes and support transnational alliances for sustainable futures. Just as the printing press enabled learning, science, the era of enlightenment, democracy and the Industrial Revolution, digital infrastructures can pave the way towards a global sustainable society. However, as with all transformational strategies, digitalization also carries significant risks. A lack of access to digital infrastructure and services reinforces the digital divide, marginalization and inequality of opportunity. Conversely, cheaper and more accessible services could lead to \u2018take-back\u2019 (or economic \u2018rebound\u2019), which further increases in-service demand with resource impacts. Digitalization and automation also further reduce the need for human labour. Big data-driven applications and services raise privacy concerns and enable social control by governments or monopolistic technology providers. Clear governance and ethical and management strategies are needed to minimize these risks and avoid digital dystopias. Public policy is critical, particularly in the early formative phase of developing new technologies and business models, in terms of regulating standards, data access and privacy, competition, and, above all, infrastructure development, as well", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1137eb4a-f7d0-4195-851c-01846c895ae5": {"__data__": {"id_": "1137eb4a-f7d0-4195-851c-01846c895ae5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cba9b8431ee0b8c4a11f0bf1691a13399f26fab2320e8d7d8ecba2bd0fcb699a"}, "3": {"node_id": "f98b7466-82d7-4b19-a4f6-f827702aef04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60c0bebe9fe85277950b751bae3123edb9ad5113bfaad158ac46fc4fb08eb8b6"}}, "hash": "9475dc60273d8c8c60b1508e419b7db504fc0180a7d197aefaab91e75597dcd0", "text": "as ensuring equitable access.

Resource-efficient services for raising living standards A recent low energy demand (LED) scenario explored the potential for closing the emissions gap while raising living standards in the global South through radical changes in the type and efficiency of energy services (Grubler et al. 2018). Unlike other 1.5\u00b0C pathways, the LED scenario shows how the ambition of the Paris Agreement is reachable by lowering energy demand by 40 per cent, while at the same time increasing the provision of energy services without having to rely on negative emission technologies or carbon capture and storage (Rogelj et al. 2018). The LED scenario was found to have the strongest synergies with other SDGs. This is consistent with other analysis, which shows that energy, land and material-efficient pathways impose the fewest trade-offs with other SDGs (Bertram et al. 2018). The sustainable transformation described by the LED scenario is immensely challenging, with the same services and quality of life taken for granted in modern developed economies becoming available to more people. This depends on seven main strategies for resource-efficient development: (a) electrify energy end use, including vehicles and heat pumps to improve end-use efficiency; (b) digitalize energy-using products and services to optimize infrastructure and resource use; (c) converge onto fewer numbers of multifunctional goods to improve service quality and convenience; (d) shift from ownership to usership to reduce material needs; (e) utilize consumer goods, vehicles and physical infrastructures at higher rates to accelerate the introduction of improved alternatives; (f) innovate business models offering low energy services to appeal to consumers, while making sense commercially; and (g) tighten efficiency standards continually upward to deliver cost, performance, health and other benefits. The resulting expansion of energy services in the Global South would address historical inequalities created by GHG-intensive development in industrialized countries, where 2 billion people lack improved sanitation (World Health Organization [WHO] and United Nations Children\u2019s Fund [UNICEF] 2017), 800 million people go hungry every night (Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] et al. 2018), roughly the same number of people do not have access to electricity, and almost 3 billion cook and heat with solid fuels (International Energy Agency [IEA] 2018). This striking global inequality in living standards is reflected in the marked global inequality in GHG emissions (figure 5.3). Emissions Gap Report 2019 45 This emissions inequality has reduced slightly in recent history (1990-2015) and looks set to continue through the NDCs. Strengthened action to close the emissions gap can be consistent with social and economic development objectives, if the emissions-intensive development pathways of the top emitters can be avoided. 5.3.6. Sustainable land use, food security and bioenergy The biologist and naturalist E.O. Wilson has called for protecting half the Earth\u2019s land and seas, a project known as Half-Earth (Wilson 2016). Feeding humanity while mitigating human-caused environmental degradation must essentially occur on already transformed and existing agricultural land. This allows the remaining \u2018Half-Earth\u2019 to be safeguarded as natural forest and other ecosystems providing essential services, protecting biodiversity and ensuring resilience. The global sustainable transformation of agricultural systems and fisheries faces the challenge of providing more and healthier food through sustainable intensification on existing farmland and reducing food waste (TWI2050 2018).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f98b7466-82d7-4b19-a4f6-f827702aef04": {"__data__": {"id_": "f98b7466-82d7-4b19-a4f6-f827702aef04", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cba9b8431ee0b8c4a11f0bf1691a13399f26fab2320e8d7d8ecba2bd0fcb699a"}, "2": {"node_id": "1137eb4a-f7d0-4195-851c-01846c895ae5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9475dc60273d8c8c60b1508e419b7db504fc0180a7d197aefaab91e75597dcd0"}}, "hash": "60c0bebe9fe85277950b751bae3123edb9ad5113bfaad158ac46fc4fb08eb8b6", "text": "For land in agricultural use as croplands, pastures and managed forests, this means widespread adoption of agricultural practices that minimize environmental damage and maximize resilience, including: precision farming to economize on resource inputs while boosting yields; no- till farming to protect soil quality; agroecology to optimize the crop mix in order to sustain biodiversity and resist the dangers of pests and pathogens; and improved harvesting and storage practices to reduce post-harvest losses.

Healthier diets can be promoted by removing subsidies for harmful production techniques, public awareness campaigns and careful management of land use, oceans and other environmental resources (TWI2050 2018). This agricultural revolution, encompassing both production and consumption, must unfold alongside a massive programme of returning land to nature, including tree planting on degraded land (Bastin et al. 2019). For example, over the last 40 years, China has undertaken major projects to enhance soils and regenerate and reforest land (Bryan et al. 2018). To close the emissions gap, land use must transition rapidly from being a net source of emissions to a net sink. There are clear potential synergies between SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 13 (climate action). Strategies include increasing agricultural productivity, reducing forest clearance for agriculture and shifting diets to healthier, less land-intensive and lower carbon foods. Conversely, the singular pursuit of SDG 13 to close the emissions gap without pursuing sustainable development more holistically can lead to trade-offs. Conversion of agricultural and forest land for bioenergy crop production negatively impacts food security. Such tensions are a particular hallmark of climate mitigation pathways reliant on negative emissions from combining bioenergy combustion with carbon capture and storage.

This will necessitate a complete transformation of the way energy is produced and consumed. To illustrate the scale of the challenge, coal-fired power plants were the single largest contributor to emissions growth in 2018, an increase of 2.9 per cent compared with the previous year and surpassing annual total emissions of 10 GtCO2 (International Energy Agency [IEA] 2019a). The transformation will be challenged by the fact that demand for energy services will grow 30 per cent by 2040, according to the IEA (2018a). However, primary energy demand will grow by a lesser rate or actually fall, depending on the achieved rate of energy efficiency improvement. The current global energy system is still highly carbon- intensive with coal, oil and natural gas meeting 85 per cent of all energy needs (IEA 2019e). If the necessary transition does not occur, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will continue to increase year-on-year. In light of this, what needs to happen? Long-term scenarios all point to rapid upscaling of renewables and energy efficiency, in combination with electrification of many new end-uses, as the key ingredients of a successful energy transition driving down energy-related CO2 emissions (Gambhir et al. 2019; Bogdanov et al. 2019). This chapter reviews five key transition options, based on their relevance to a wide range of countries, clear co-benefit opportunities and potential to deliver significant emission reductions. Each transition corresponds to a particular policy rationale or motivation, namely: 1) Easy wins: expanding renewable energy for electrification 2) Broad policy consensus: coal phase-out for rapid decarbonization of the energy system 3) Large co-benefits: decarbonizing transport 4) Hard to abate: decarbonizing energy-intensive industry 5) Leapfrogging potential: avoiding future emissions and ensuring energy access 6.2 Options to decarbonize the energy sector The energy transition will include several elements, while approaches to transition will vary from one region and country to another. Transition strategies will need to be developed and adapted to fit the specific context, as few parts can be directly copied.

The basic technologies needed for expanding electrification based on renewable energy technologies already exist and thus represent a relatively \u201ceasy win\u201d for substantial short-term reductions of energy-related CO2 emissions.

Global investment in renewable energy capacity in 2018 was US$272.9 billion, which was about three times higher than investment in coal and gas-fired generation capacity combined. This allowed for renewable energy (excluding large hydropower) to raise its share of global electricity generation to 12.9 per cent in 2018, helping the world to avoid an estimated 2 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions (Frankfurt School-United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] Collaborating Centre and BloombergNEF [BNEF] 2019). Yet, renewables need to grow six times faster to meet climate targets (International Renewable Energy Agency [IRENA] 2019a). The main enabler for the accelerated deployment of renewable energy in the last decade has been the continued and rapid decline in capital costs. In most parts of the world today, renewables have become the lowest- cost source of new power generation and are generally competitive without incentives when directly compared with fossil alternatives. Since 2010, the global weighted- average levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) from solar photovoltaic, onshore and offshore wind projects, bioenergy and geothermal, have all reduced and are approaching the lower range of fossil-fuel-fired power generation costs (figure 6.1). Continued cost declines are expected during the following decades (IRENA 2019c). The key to integrating larger shares of variable renewable energy into the power supply is system flexibility. Electricity systems with large shares of renewables require investments to address the short- and medium-term variability of both solar and wind energy. There are several categories of power system assets that can be utilized to provide flexibility. Conventional power plants, gas-fired generation and hydropower with reservoirs are currently the predominant sources of system flexibility in modern power systems, but other options will increasingly become important such as electricity networks, battery storage, distributed energy resources and enhanced predictability. Studies show that the cost of flexibility to integrate variable renewable energy is generally quite small (+5 to +13 US$/MWh), with higher values for inflexible systems with dominant shares of coal or nuclear generation (Agora Energiewende 2015). However, beyond enhanced power infrastructure, measures to support power system flexibility can be readily applied and adapted to power systems. These include modifications to \u201cenergy strategies, legal frameworks, policies and programmes, regulatory frameworks, market rules, system operation protocols, and connection codes\u201d (IEA 2019c). There are now several examples of countries that have achieved 100 per cent renewable energy electricity for short periods of time (days), with large shares of variable solar and wind (for example, Costa Rica, Denmark, Ireland and Uruguay). Figure 6.1. Global LCOE of utility-scale renewable power generation technologies, 2010-2018 Source: International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) (2019c). Emissions Gap Report 2019 48 Harnessing the synergy between low-cost renewable power and enhanced end-use electrification is key to driving down energy-related CO2. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), renewable energy and electrification can deliver 75 per cent of the required emission reductions to bring the temperature rise to the well-below 2\u00b0C climate goal (IRENA 2019a). This means that by 2050, 86 per cent of electricity generation would need to be renewable and that the share of electricity in final energy would increase from just 20 per cent today (IRENA 2019a) to almost 50 per cent by 2050. The share of electricity consumed in industry and buildings would need to double (mainly through electric heating and cooling), with transport seeing potentially the largest transformation (see section 6.2.3). The electrification of the energy system creates the need for enhanced digitalization of end-use technologies, large- scale electrical and heat storage technologies and the need to develop \u201celectro fuels\u201d with green electricity, to be able to substitute liquid fossil fuels (IRENA 2019b). All these technologies exist and are rapidly spreading, especially within Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) economies, and also serve to mitigate the risk of blackouts caused by unfavourable weather. 6.2.2 Broad policy consensus: coal phase-out for rapid decarbonization of the energy system The combustion of coal currently accounts for 30 per cent of global CO2 emissions (IEA 2019a).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e10c466-0890-45a0-8f58-5ff5c4ed1f18": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e10c466-0890-45a0-8f58-5ff5c4ed1f18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "651081a427d7d8d2ce55441a60e8971c02cb83a3a5067a9b72c76f20a2d443f0"}, "2": {"node_id": "224fc98b-815a-4f4f-9c08-4fd36d3ca772", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf5c59708114b714e2a52c7e53a54640cc91f9b00ee709ff8c2bba084ab593ea"}}, "hash": "dc919183db79dcb98cce0135798f7b1f6c0e0f1cc15fe785538290dab54806aa", "text": "Behind these figures is the reality that globally, about 27 per cent of primary energy needs are met by coal, including around 40 per cent of all electricity generation (BP 2019).

If operated until the end of their lifetime and not retrofitted with carbon capture and storage (CCS), \u201ccommitted emissions\u201d from existing coal-fired power plants, built before the end of 2016, are estimated to emit roughly 200 GtCO2 by 2050 (Rogeli et al. 2018). Coal-based power plants that are planned or under construction would add a further 100\u2013150 GtCO2 (Edenhofer et al. 2018), effectively using up a large share of the remaining carbon budget to stay below two degrees. Therefore, one of the main challenges for the required energy sector transformation will be to find nationally appropriate solutions for the fast and socially responsible reduction in coal-fired power generation by 2030 and a phase-out by 2050 (Rogeli et al. 2018). Box 1 illustrates the complexity of such a phase-out process, using the experience of Germany. Box 6.1. Germany\u2019s coal phase-out Despite growing its share of renewables in electricity generation from 20 per cent in 2011 to 37.8 per cent in 2018, Germany is Europe\u2019s largest coal consumer, accounting for 35 per cent of total power sector emissions in 2018, with 42.6 GW of lignite and hard coal-fired power generation capacity. This means that Germany will most certainly not reach its national target of 40 per cent GHG reduction by 2020 compared with 1990 levels (Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety [BMU] 2018). In January 2019, following a long consultation process, a Government-appointed commission proposed a total phase-out of coal in Germany by 2038 (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy [BMWi] 2019). The proposed decommissioning road map foresees a net reduction of 12.5 GW of coal capacity by 2022. By 2030, total coal power capacity should be reduced to a maximum of 17 GW, equal to a total reduction of 25.6 GW compared with 2017. Reviews are proposed for 2023, 2026 and 2029 to take stock of progress and to address concerns over security of supply, especially since Germany has committed to decommission all nuclear power by 2022. The most important proposed measures to implement the coal phase-out are to cancel the industry\u2019s CO2 certificates issued within the European Emission Trading Scheme and to ensure the expansion of renewable electricity to a share of 65 per cent by 2030. The phase-out plan includes a \u20ac40 billion economic package offered to affected coal regions, including alternative industry investment projects and state aid for coal workers. The Commission\u2019s proposal is now in the legislative process. The federal Government has already decided on the law for financing structural change in the coal regions and will officially adopt the decision to phase-out coal by 2038 in November (Cabinet of Germany 2019) Emissions Gap Report 2019 49 Policy challenge Example policy approach Supply side Demand side Importance of the coal sector as a (regional) employer and generator of added value Importance of export revenues from coal export Economic and technological aspects of substitution to move away from coal use Regional diversification plans or coal sector restructuring plans Economic diversification strategies Payments for closure of coal plants; carbon pricing; renewables support schemes Table 6.1. Framework of policy challenges related to coal transition Source: Spencer et al. (2018) Policies should also look beyond the demand-side considerations to include supply-side interventions (Spencer et al. 2018; table 6.1). Supply-oriented considerations are critical given the importance of the coal mining sector in terms of employment, revenues and its place within broader regional economies. Hence, managing coal transitions means not just focusing on \u201cstranded assets\u201d, as relating to physical or financial capital in the demand-side policy literature, but also to paying attention to the notion of \u201cstranded regions\u201d where workers, regional governments and the regional economy more broadly are dependent on the coal sector (Spencer et al. 2018). This holistic vision is at the heart of a \u201cjust transition\u201d that considers the impact of technological change on workers and communities (Caldecott et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f085bceb-34fd-4fa3-9912-752698dae847": {"__data__": {"id_": "f085bceb-34fd-4fa3-9912-752698dae847", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8029ec3bed0d6bf635c96824b98388af83555b9f2816d3430750693509740ba1"}, "2": {"node_id": "583ab406-0cd6-4c15-a74a-a72d9a595fdc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5bf924cfe6b6be25690c001299018c1ffcb921d0e493ed021e7ee484a42e8f44"}}, "hash": "327068f7e21a8ee38f14449ed5b7b633e8995a6f050eaafdeb73df768eceabda", "text": "2017), as well as the coal owners and industry, as a way to negotiate a politically feasible reduction in coal power generation, and eventually phase it out altogether (Jordaan et al. 2017). 6.2.3 Large co-benefits: decarbonizing transport Transport accounted for 28 per cent of global final energy demand and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba586a92-cc0d-413e-96bc-dd9ead2f07b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba586a92-cc0d-413e-96bc-dd9ead2f07b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c7b40b96b566f865d68ecb2b074daab0c9b59fb6b3fe01c09ec624c38323bc3b"}, "3": {"node_id": "28bbfcdb-de63-4093-bf79-f28e6ea19642", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "661d016ca2869a3d94c0e7b5f519c2ceedbf771cd06c326397edac3d9eda9f4a"}}, "hash": "181b4a726468b4ba5a71b04ae92450fa8f183e4d52de288103ca3c3a75a6808f", "text": "23 per cent of global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2014 (IEA 2017b). Transport sector emissions are growing rapidly and increased by 2.5 per cent annually between 2010 and 2015 (Rogeli et al. 2018), largely driven by economic growth, behavioural changes and population increase. The sector accounts for about 65 per cent of global oil demand, with 92 per cent of final transport energy demand consisting of oil products, making it the least diversified of the major energy end-use sectors. Deep decarbonization of the transport sector will require a radical shift in the nature and structure of transport demand, major improvements in energy efficiency, changing vehicle types and significant and rapid transitions in the energy mix used (see also chapters 4 and 7). Aggressive action now would lay the foundation and maintain a healthy momentum towards the longer-term goal. Some of the transport-related climate change mitigation actions that can yield substantial decarbonization as well as economic benefits include: i) compact urban planning; ii) reducing passenger travel demand; iii) shifting passenger travel modes and expanding public transit; iv) improving passenger car efficiency and shifting to electrical engines; v) improving freight logistics; and vi) improving freight vehicle efficiency and electrification (Dhar, Pathak and Shukla 2018; Gouldson et al. 2018). One of the key technical mitigation options, namely electrification of the transport sector, is projected to play a major role in meeting ambitious climate targets. Rapid growth in electric passenger vehicles (EVs) across the members of the G20 has been occurring since 2010, with global cumulative sales of light-duty plug-in vehicles exceeding 5 million units at the end of December 2018 (Vieweg et al. 2018; Watson 2019). This amounts to a market share of 2.1 per cent (compared with less than 1 per cent in 2016). China has the largest fleet of EVs with over 2.2 million units, while Norway leads in terms of the market share for new cars, approaching 60 per cent (Williams 2019). In road freight transport (trucks), systemic improvements (for example, in supply chains, logistics, and routing) would also benefit from these innovations, but would need to be combined with efficiency improvement of vehicles. Shipping and aviation account for 40 per cent of all transport-related emissions but will be significantly more challenging to decarbonize and electrify than road transport (Martinez Romera 2016). Both modes will see high demand growth and would need to pursue ambitious efficiency improvements and use of low-carbon fuels. This would mean the use of advanced biofuels and low-carbon liquid fuels (synthetic fuels) in the near and medium term, with hydrogen fuel for shipping a likely solution in the longer term (IRENA 2019a; IEA 2017b). While progress has been made, it is far from the scale required to decarbonize transport. Specifically, it will Emissions Gap Report 2019 50 require the share of electricity in final energy for transport to increase from just 1 per cent today to 40 per cent by 2050 (IRENA 2019a)1. At the same time, decarbonizing transport can deliver multiple significant co-benefits and is one of the sectors in which there are strong links between local and global pollution and human well-being. Specifically, the transportation sector is a major source of particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone and nitrogen dioxide concentrations, which are major causes of premature deaths. In 2015, emissions attributed to transport contributed to 385,000 premature deaths out of which 114,000 and 74,000 were in China and India, respectively (Anenberg et al. 2019). With vehicle numbers projected to double by 2040, the costs associated with premature mortality are likely to increase in both these countries. However, some solutions are beginning to emerge. For example, there is significant potential for electric two- and three-wheelers as a short-distance transport solution in India, which could enable India to develop a large EV industry and stimulate investment in charging infrastructure that can facilitate diffusion of larger EVs (Dhar, Pathak and Shukla 2017; see also chapter 7). 6.2.4 Hard to abate: decarbonizing energy-intensive industries Energy-intensive industries, such as steel and cement, account for about 17 per cent of total CO2 emissions from energy and industrial sources (Energy Transitions Commission [ETC] 2019).

Competitiveness pressures and the importance of energy as an input have, however, driven significant energy efficiency improvements, but this has not been enough to move towards decarbonization of these sectors. For example, while the CO2 intensity of global electricity production has declined by 9.3 per cent between 2000 and 2016, the CO2 intensity of global crude steel production has increased by 2.8 per cent in the same period3. This is concerning because the significant demand for materials will continue, as countries like India and many African countries develop the infrastructure and housing required as a result of their development. Without further 1 This is consistent with REN21 (2018) as the bulk of renewable energy used in the sector is biogasoline at 2.5 per cent; biodiesel at 1.4 per cent; and renewable electricity at 0.3 per cent of demand in 2016. 2 For an excellent summary of the challenges of mitigation in the energy intensive industries, see Bataille et al. (2018). 3 Calculated on the basis of data from Enerdata (2019) and World Steel Association (2018). 4 For a comprehensive survey of cement mitigation options, see Scrivener et al. (2018). policy, emissions from the heavy industry sectors could increase from 17 per cent of global emissions today to 20 per cent by 2050 (ETC 2019). Mitigation of energy-intensive industries requires going beyond incremental improvements in energy efficiency and moving towards more fundamental mitigation options. Broadly speaking, these options can be broken down into three categories. The first is demand reduction through recycling, materials substitution and dematerialization (see chapter 7). An example of the latter would be lightweighting of automobiles while improving fuel economy and downsizing the powertrain, in order to reduce steel consumption. Significant potential exists to reduce virgin material demand, which could cut emissions from heavy industry by 40 per cent by 2050, compared with a business as usual (BAU) case (ETC 2019; also discussed extensively in chapter 7). This can have the benefit of reducing reliance on more costly mitigation options like carbon capture and storage/use (CCSU) (IEA 2019b). The second category involves mitigation of emissions in the context of the existing industrial process, the archetypal example of which is the deployment of CCSU. While alternatives to CCSU are emerging in some heavy industry sectors, the deployment of CCSU is likely to be necessary in the cement industry, even given aggressive deployment of clinker substitutes and the development of currently non-commercial alternative cement technologies4. The third category of options entails a fundamental transition in the industrial process itself, an example of which would be the substitution of coking coal as a fuel and reducing agent in steel manufacture with hydrogen produced from zero-carbon electricity (Vogl et al. 2018). Therefore, what are the prospects for energy-intensive industry mitigation? The first point to note is that the available technological options are currently at a low level of commercial readiness, necessitating significant progress in research, demonstration and commercialization. Secondly, unlike in other sectors where zero-carbon options may be economically competitive with their fossil alternatives (for example, renewable electricity or electric vehicles), decarbonization of energy-intensive industry appears likely to entail net costs. These costs are likely to be negligible at the level of the macroeconomy and the end-consumer, but significant at the producer level (ETC 2019). This raises questions of managing the implementation of stringent policies to decarbonize heavy industry in the absence of stronger global climate policies and a level playing field. Some form of trade protective measures, such as border adjustments, may be required. Finally, a comprehensive portfolio of policies is likely to be required, ranging from carbon pricing and research and demonstration Emissions Gap Report 2019 51 funding to standards and regulation, for example, to promote material demand reduction. For all of this to occur, the salience of energy-intensive industry decarbonization needs to increase in global and national policy discussions. 6.2.5 Leapfrogging potential: avoiding future emissions and ensuring energy access The issue of energy access and energy poverty is now on top of the global policy agenda. Among Least Developed Countries (LDCs), over 60 per cent of the population have no access to electricity with the figure rising to 80 per cent for people in rural areas (Least Developed Countries Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Initiative for Sustainable Development [LDC REEEI] 2019). In non-LDC developing countries, the figure is still significant, at 10 per cent of the population. Those who do have access to electricity often endure problems of unreliable access and frequent blackouts. Beyond electricity, nearly three billion people rely on traditional fuels (such as wood or charcoal)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "838e508b-f4b2-479b-8b7b-f24f9306d42e": {"__data__": {"id_": "838e508b-f4b2-479b-8b7b-f24f9306d42e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "551806d4d7f4797c40f8f6abfc98f8529b2e799bc275b2aea29957572bed0ddc"}, "3": {"node_id": "8b70052f-bbf8-4e21-8a8d-989182312a57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b44ee6d385580563913fa1af198d6cd01ddc03b22a6d44ea734b9c6f5d7dacdf"}}, "hash": "bf421cddd4a9700e6d47e371afb57cca8cbf0e8019e95c24dccda554eee1b8a3", "text": "and technologies for cooking and heating. This has severe implications for health (especially the health of women and children), economic livelihoods and the environment, both at a global and local level (Batchelor et al. 2019). The burning of non- renewable biomass fuels5 alone generates a gigaton of CO2e per year (Bailis et al. 2015), about a 2 per cent share of global emissions (see chapter 2). Box 2 discusses the GHG emissions associated with cooking and potential trends for the future. 5 To imply the extraction of biomass from a land area is not sustainable where carbon stocks on the land area decrease over time. 6 The NPS accounts for current and planned policies with a high likelihood of being implemented, including the GHG- and energy-related compo- nents of the NDCs pledged under the Paris Agreement. The SDS combines the fundamentals of sectoral energy policy with three closely associated but distinct policy objectives related to the SDG 7 (energy access), SDG 3 (air pollution) and SDG 13 (climate action). Improving access to reliable energy services for households and for productive purposes is thus a central policy objective in many LDCs and developing countries. This is explicitly recognized by United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) that calls for action to \u201censure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all\u201d, which include targets on renewable energy and energy efficiency. As such, there is evidence of synergies between about 85 per cent of the SDG targets and efforts to achieve SDG 7, as well as some evidence of trade-offs between SDG 7 and about 35 per cent of the SDG targets (Fuso-Nerini et al. 2018). However, despite the energy sector\u2019s large share of global GHG emissions, achieving universal access to modern energy does not lead to increases in global GHG emissions (Dagnachew et al. 2018; IEA et al. 2019). Using two scenarios, the New Policies Scenario (NPS) and the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS)6 derived from the IEA\u2019s World Energy Outlook, reflect the simultaneous pursuit of universal access in sub-Saharan Africa for both electricity and clean cooking solutions yielding net savings of GHG emissions amounting to 45 MtCO2e and 200 MtCO2e, respectively. Going beyond addressing energy for basic human needs (i.e. lighting and cooking) to pushing mechanical power, mobility and energy for other productive uses required to drive development and transformation will generate increasing Box 6.2. Clean cooking as an important mitigation option The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on 1.5\u00b0C (IPCC SR1.5) states that lack of access to clean and affordable energy for cooking is a major policy concern in many countries where major parts of the population still rely primarily on solid fuels for cooking (Roy et al. 2018). The amount of fuelwood burned across Africa is estimated to be over 400 million m3 a year (May- Tobin 2011), releasing over 760 million tons of CO2e into the atmosphere*, and globally non-renewable biomass fuels alone account for significant emissions. This will continue to increase with the rise in population, as the population of sub-Saharan Africa is projected to double by 2050 (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs [UN DESA] 2019). Black carbon from residential solid fuel burning is estimated to add the equivalent of another 8\u201316 per cent of the global warming caused by CO2 (Bailis et al. 2015). It is also important to recognize the complexity associated with accounting in terms of the time it takes for replacement trees to sequester the CO2 emitted by burning a felled tree, and the rate of change in CO2 sequestration as trees mature. Clean cooking solutions address the most basic needs of the poor. Furthermore, reducing black carbon, methane and other short-lived climate pollutants would have substantial co-benefits on health and local air quality, but can in the short-term contribute significantly to limiting global warming to 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C (de Coninck et al. 2018; Batchelor et al. 2019). A key driver is the trajectory of costs that show \u201cclean\u201d cooking (i.e. with electric or gas) has the potential to reach a price point of affordability with associated reliability and sustainability within a few years. * Burning 1 kg wood emits 1.9 kg of CO2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b70052f-bbf8-4e21-8a8d-989182312a57": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b70052f-bbf8-4e21-8a8d-989182312a57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "551806d4d7f4797c40f8f6abfc98f8529b2e799bc275b2aea29957572bed0ddc"}, "2": {"node_id": "838e508b-f4b2-479b-8b7b-f24f9306d42e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf421cddd4a9700e6d47e371afb57cca8cbf0e8019e95c24dccda554eee1b8a3"}}, "hash": "b44ee6d385580563913fa1af198d6cd01ddc03b22a6d44ea734b9c6f5d7dacdf", "text": "* Burning 1 kg wood emits 1.9 kg of CO2.

Poor but fast-growing countries in east and south-east Asia have traditionally deployed emissions- intensive coal to meet this demand. However, for countries and regions that host the world\u2019s energy-poor, there remains significant scope to shape their energy transitions as they are yet to be locked into a particular pathway (Mulugetta, Ben Hagan and Kammen 2018). Moreover, rapid technological progress in renewable energy is opening up an unprecedented opportunity for a wide range of applications and business models, including electrification through decentralized generation and mini-grids, with rapidly declining costs for photovoltaic modules, batteries, LEDs, smart metering, mini-grids and pay-as-you-go technology (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] 2017). Policymakers in developing countries understand that making a rapid transition sometimes relies on a much slower process of technological and organizational change, for example, to build capacities and knowledge about the technologies required to \u2018leapfrog\u2019. Moreover, the quality of the transition matters in terms of creating additional value beyond the provision of energy such as good quality jobs and building industrial capacity. For example, while the growth in solar PV markets across Africa is to be welcomed from an energy delivery perspective, a significant proportion of the global value chain for PV has been captured elsewhere, for example, in manufacturing (principally China), as well as financing and engineering services, often provided by institutions in OECD countries (Byrne, Mbeva and Ockwell 2018; Lema et al. 2018; Ockwell et al. 2018). More broadly, effort is required to actively connect private business leaders with government-led and donor-backed forums to communicate and unlock new commercial opportunities in PV systems, as has occurred successfully in Kenya and Uganda (Bhamidipati, Haselip and Hansen 2019). However, this requires building innovation systems with the mission to strengthen knowledge and skills base, raise patient capital and mobilize technical assistance, to build strong partnerships with financial providers and domestic entrepreneurs with a deep interest in new and clean technologies (Truffer, Murphy and Raven 2015; Wieczorek 2017).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e84ce23-dbb4-4466-b423-f823d4fcc8fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e84ce23-dbb4-4466-b423-f823d4fcc8fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1bb38b9768343cc00163dcbf9db20b2f6fbf739bec601a2309c3e59fefc64c05"}, "2": {"node_id": "d8ef0f5b-af96-4bf3-9fa7-c372dcc35013", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45e54da78774907bf4602d7cf5ef606e5b83b81a560c1977f4f53a886ce70697"}}, "hash": "085d82c79887e4935de2c4f7f6df3690145db0a984e85d5dc3c36d93915b314c", "text": "6.3 Beyond technical measures: pursuing system-wide transformation There is a qualitative difference between past energy transitions and the necessary future transition.

In terms of total energy use, the trends have more accurately reflected energy \u201cadditions\u201d as all forms of energy rise to meet growing energy demand. Today we consume more coal, gas, oil, nuclear and renewables than ever before. Reducing emissions, however, requires that total hydrocarbon use decline with great expansion of renewable energy (along with technologies to capture or remove their emissions) (University of Columbia Center on Global Energy Policy 2019). The depth of technological and institutional lock-in of the incumbent energy system is so profound it creates major obstacles or inertia, holding back much needed structural change (Jackson 2016). The rapid and systemic changes needed are radically different from what institutions are accustomed to withstanding. For example, switching to EVs requires multiple changes in the socio- technical system, which involve multi-actor processes of interactions across and between energy and transport regimes. Given the need for these complex and systemic changes, a sector-focused or silo approach will need to give way to decisions and policies that reach across sectoral, geographical and political boundaries. One way to do this is through mission-oriented policies, defined as systemic public policies that draw on frontier knowledge to attain specific goals, often to address \u201cbig problems\u201d such as climate change that demand radical innovations and a multi-actor coordination (Mazzucato 2018). This also recognizes the catalytic role that governments can play in creating policies that can shape markets and direct them to meet major societal goals. Given that energy is an enabler, and thus cuts across sectoral boundaries, low-carbon energy transitions can be well served by being directly linked to opportunities in other sectors such as electrifying transport and heating (including cooking) and decarbonizing energy-intensive industries. Equally important will be linking transitions with their associated co-benefits and costs and how these can be evaluated to provide supplementary information to serve as additional impetus for policymakers, decision makers and civil society to co-own and build consensus around the options (table 6.2). The sheer scale of investment needed for accelerating energy transitions is very large. Global renewable energy investment in 2018, excluding large hydroelectric projects, exceeded the US$250 billion for a fifth successive year Frankfurt School-UNEP Collaborating Centre and BNEF 2019). However, climate policies that are consistent with the 1.5\u00b0C target require upscaling of energy system supply- side investments (resource extraction, power generation, fuel conversion, pipelines/transmission and energy storage), reaching levels of between US$1.6\u20133.8 trillion per year globally on average over the 2016\u20132050 time frame (McCollum et al. 2018). The call to redirect investment to low-carbon energy systems raises a number of issues. Firstly, the high upfront capital outlay and low operating costs of Emissions Gap Report 2019 55 renewables is a new terrain in finance where further innovation is required. Secondly, while the historically low interest rates over the past 10 years have provided a very conducive environment for investment in renewable energy technologies (RETs), energy investment was mostly concentrated in high and upper-middle income countries (IEA 2019d). Thirdly, the high investment requirement in developing countries is being hampered by the high perception of risk, little opportunity for patient capital, and unstable political and regulatory regimes. To this end, multilateral, regional and national development banks could play a major role in leveraging larger finance by helping to de-risk investments. However, this would need to be co-developed where country policymakers play a deeper role by creating stable policy and regulatory conditions to encourage investment. This would also mean appealing to the immediate concerns of decision and policymakers, for example, integrating transport policy with air quality and climate policy and with vehicle emissions regulation. Policies should be harmonized wherever possible to take advantage of interdependencies and prevent undesirable outcomes such as CO2 \u201cleakage\u201d from one sector to another.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6aa84d40-a9cb-4144-9955-d158e135a180": {"__data__": {"id_": "6aa84d40-a9cb-4144-9955-d158e135a180", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3c7f4258ab523b99bc1cbc95bafd4ee6a13356cc7718f24758ca7fa4e0255995"}, "2": {"node_id": "1ac1f3c9-e217-4b61-aa6c-a4125404364d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "23c54ca69a3c9ef60f60c84eb42dc35e59a70971fb94199484f369e5e73d45bc"}}, "hash": "b2e77dc230737c462773e71c4db5621b0de553aead130aa9232a1151a98f8fd8", "text": "Emissions Gap Report 2019 56 Bridging the gap: Enhancing material efficiency in residential buildings and cars Lead authors: Edgar Hertwich (Norwegian University of Science and Technology), Reid Lifset (Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, USA), Stefan Pauliuk (Faculty of Environment and Natural Resources, University of Freiburg, Germany), Niko Heeren (Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, USA) Contributing authors: Saleem Ali (University of Delaware, USA), Peter Berrill (Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies USA), Tomer Fishman (Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya, Israel), Qingshi Tu (Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies USA), Paul Wolfram (Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, USA) 7 7.1 Introduction The production of materials is a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (figure 7.1).

The largest contribution stems from bulk materials production, such as iron and steel, cement, lime and plaster, other minerals mostly used as construction products, as well as plastics and rubber (figure 7.1). Two thirds of the materials are used to make capital goods, with buildings and vehicles among the most important (figure 7.1). While the production of materials consumed in industrialized countries remained within the range of 2\u20133 GtCO2e in the 1995-2015 period, there was rapid growth in material-related emissions among developing and emerging economies (Hertwich 2019). Growth in investments is associated with a strong growth in metal consumption. Developing countries have stronger growth in metal consumption with gross domestic product (GDP) than industrialized countries, as a higher share of their GDP comprises investments (Zheng et al. 2018). Options to mitigate emissions from materials production include supply-side measures, such as improved energy efficiency in production processes, the use of alternative production routes and raw materials with lower embodied GHG emissions, a shift towards cleaner energy sources and reductants, and CO2 capture. Reducing the demand for materials is also an option to mitigate emissions and can be achieved through improving their efficiency (International Energy Agency [IEA] 2019a; Worrell et al. 2016). Recent efforts have been made to evaluate the potential contribution of material efficiency to meet climate targets more broadly. In the Clean Technology Scenario of the International Energy Agency (IEA), compared with the baseline, steel demand is reduced by 24 per cent, cement by 15 per cent and aluminium by 17 per cent, which in total comprises around 30 per cent of the combined emission reductions for these materials. Other emission reductions were due to energy efficiency, innovative processes, cleaner energy and CO2 capture and storage (IEA 2019a). Despite their effectiveness, material efficiency strategies have been systematically overlooked in climate policies (Hernandez et al. 2018). Research on and development of demand-side material efficiency and substitution strategies has progressed substantially in the past decade (Allwood et al. 2017; Worrell et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2018). Such research addresses the specific technical application of materials in buildings and other structures (Serrenho et al. 2019; Dunant et al. 2018), machinery (Milford et al. 2013) and vehicles (L\u00f8vik et al. 2014). Recent research combining insights from several bottom-up studies across different applications has identified that material efficiency could reduce emissions from steel production by half (Milford et al. 2013). Material efficiency and substitution strategies affect not only energy demand and emissions during material production, but also potentially the operational energy use of the material products. Analysis of such strategies therefore requires a systems or life cycle perspective. Several investigations into material efficiency have focused on strategies that have little impact on operations, meaning that trade-offs and synergies have been ignored. Many energy efficiency Emissions Gap Report 2019 57 Figure 7.1. GHG emissions in GtCO2e associated with materials production by material (left) and by the first use of materials in subsequent production processes or final consumption (right) Note: The data excludes emissions from land-use change and credits for carbon storage. Source: Based on Hertwich et al. (2019). strategies have implications for the materials used, such as increased insulation demand for buildings or a shift to more energy-intensive materials in the lightweighting of vehicles. While these additional, material-related emissions are well understood from technology studies, they are often not fully captured in the integrated assessment models that produce scenario results, such as those discussed in this report (Pauliuk et al. 2017). In this chapter, focus is placed on residential buildings and cars, which are the most important individual products in terms of materials and energy use. Material efficiency strategies are reviewed with quantitative results presented of a recent modelling exercise for the implementation of such strategies in the G7 members (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America), China and India, based on findings from an International Resource Panel study (International Resource Panel forthcoming). These countries were selected because they represent individually significant economies with varied development levels. The following demand-side strategies for increased material efficiency in product design and manufacturing, use and end of life are considered for both residential buildings and cars (Allwood et al. 2011) 1) Product lightweighting and material substitution of high-carbon materials with low-carbon materials to reduce material-related GHG emissions associated with product production, as well as operational energy consumption of vehicles. 2) Improvements in the yield of material", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31790dc3-5f14-40c0-9a19-fb54cfd83972": {"__data__": {"id_": "31790dc3-5f14-40c0-9a19-fb54cfd83972", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0bf79d204707a73b58cde3a813442bcc9c44c6f04aae8c82662a49cff02778fc"}}, "hash": "0bf79d204707a73b58cde3a813442bcc9c44c6f04aae8c82662a49cff02778fc", "text": "production and product manufacture, thus reducing the share of material that becomes waste in the production process. 3) More intensive use, lifetime extension, component reuse, remanufacturing and repair as strategies to obtain more service from material-based products. 4) Enhanced recycling and reuse so that secondary materials reduce the need to produce more emission-intensive primary materials. 7.2 Material-efficient housing Global construction of buildings and infrastructure and the associated material supply caused 7 GtCO2e of GHG emissions in 2015, of which 4 GtCO2e were associated with the use of materials in construction (Hertwich 2019). In comparison, direct CO2 emissions from fuel combustion in buildings were 3 GtCO2, while emissions associated with the production of electricity consumed in buildings were 6.5 GtCO2 (IEA 2019b). Although current statistics do not disaggregate construction- related emissions into residential and commercial buildings or consider infrastructure at a global scale, country-level results and material-use data suggest that residential buildings contribute 50\u201365 per cent of such emissions (Hertwich et al. 2019). In 2015, about 70 per cent of construction-related emissions were from developing countries (Hertwich 2019). Emissions Gap Report 2019 58 Despite this, studies of material efficiency options almost exclusively focus on industrialized countries, with just a few studies addressing China. Housing demand, construction style and building lifetimes are important drivers for material- related emissions of residential buildings. Research provides insight on the scope of various material efficiency strategies for residential buildings. 7.2.1 Product lightweighting and material substitution Buildings often contain more energy-intensive materials such as concrete, steel and glass than technically required. There is a documented tendency for overdesign in larger steel- frame structures of around 20\u201330 per cent (Dunant et al. 2018). Cement, a major building material, is often used more than necessary in various applications, including concrete mixing, where fillers and other cementitious materials can substitute part of the cement with fewer emissions (John et al. 2018; Shanks et al. 2019). Finally, instead of using reinforced cement, masonry or steel frames, timber, bamboo and other plant fibres can be used as building materials, which has the potential to significantly reduce lifecycle GHG emissions in materials production and carbon storage, even when considering a potential trade-off with operational energy use (Heeren et al. 2015). New technology allows for a wider use of timber, even for tall structures. In some regions, building codes are being adapted to recognize these advances and facilitate the increased use of wood in buildings (Mahapatra et al. 2012). Large-scale use of wood as construction material necessitates that the forests from which the timber is obtained are managed sustainably (Kane and Yee 2017; Oliver et al. 2014). The International Resource Panel (forthcoming) estimates that through lightweighting structures, 8\u201310 per cent of GHG emissions related to materials in residential building construction in the G7 and China can be saved, with an even larger share in India (figure 7.2). An increased market penetration of wood could also reduce emissions or sequester carbon, corresponding to 10 per cent of GHG emissions from residential building materials, with savings reaching up to 30 per cent in India. At present, the country hardly uses timber in construction and lacks local resources and expertise. Building codes, which have long been used to improve energy efficiency, present a potential model and platform for developing policies that support lighter-weight structures, the reuse of components and timber-based construction. The rapid growth of certification systems for construction and building, such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), and their adoption into building codes by governments worldwide has been an important policy driver for changes in construction practices (de Wilde 2014; Doan et al. 2017; Menezes et al. 2012). At present, certification is more widely applied to commercial buildings than to residential dwellings. However, the spread of certification systems and their use in building codes presents an opportunity to introduce or enhance material efficiency policies for homes that might not otherwise be politically feasible. The details of such certification systems therefore need to be monitored and evaluated and explicit attention should be given to the use of building codes as a policy instrument for material efficiency. At the residential level and particularly for single family homes, minimum standards for energy efficiency, such as the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) in the United States of America (International Code Council [ICC] 2012), have great potential to reduce operational energy consumption at the cost of increased material use. However, increased energy efficiency in buildings is achieved by adding additional or better insulation material and additional building technology, such as heat exchangers in ventilation systems.

Some suggestions have been made to include embodied carbon in codes for new construction, with a focus on cement in concrete in California as one example (King 2018). Although it is unclear how quickly such stipulations will be adopted globally, they could significantly enhance reduced material use and the utilization of low-carbon materials. 7.2.2 Improvements in the yield of material production and product manufacturing The use of building information systems and of prefabrication can reduce waste in the construction process, thus reducing the amount of primary materials required (Hertwich et al. 2019). 7.2.3 More intensive use and lifetime extension Housing demand tends to increase with a growing income, but varies widely across similar GDP/capita levels, from 34 m2 per person in the United Kingdom to 68 m2 in the United States. Such demand is influenced by tradition, planning rules, tax laws and available space. Multifamily and urban residences tend to be smaller than single family, suburban and rural residences. In most countries, the trend is shifting towards a smaller household size, which is leading to an increase in required space as facilities are shared between fewer people. Several studies show that future floor area demand is a crucial variable for GHG emissions and that more intensive use can result in significant reductions of both material and energy related emissions (Serrenho et al. 2019; Cao et al. 2018; Pauliuk et al. 2013). Such a reduction might be the result of urbanization (G\u00fcneralp et al. 2017), with populations moving from single family rural and suburban residences to multifamily houses in denser urban areas, increases in household size or cohabitation, the smarter design of buildings that allow resizing and tax or other incentives that encourage residents to downsize their residence after changes in family size (Lorek and Spangenberg 2018). The International Resource Panel (forthcoming) suggests that reducing per capita floor space by 20 per cent compared with a scenario that converges an industrialized-country\u2019s Emissions Gap Report 2019 59 floor space could reduce the emissions associated with the production of building materials for homes in G7 members by 50\u201360 per cent by 2050, given the already existing building stock. It would also reduce heating and cooling demand by up to 20 per cent, pending the retrofitting of existing buildings. Policies that support homeownership may have the undesirable effect of subsidizing large residences through tax breaks and other measures. In some locations, spatial planning prevents the construction of multifamily residences and locks in suburban forms at high social and environmental costs. A reform of planning rules could bring about multiple benefits in this regard (Jones et al. 2018). One mechanism to increase the intensity of use is to strengthen incentives for older residents to downsize when children move out. Property taxes as well as an elimination of taxes on property transactions, such as the stamp duty in the United Kingdom, can have such an effect. There is a wide variation in building lifetimes, from less than 25 years in some East Asian countries to more than 100 years in Europe. Extending building lifetimes can therefore have widely different effect. In China, extending the lifespan of buildings to 50 years could reduce CO2 emissions by 400 Mt per year or about 20 per cent of construction-related emissions (Cai et al. 2015). In Europe, new buildings have lower energy use due to improvements in building standards and technology, with lifetime extensions resulting in higher total emissions compared with replacement buildings, unless the building are retrofit to a high energy standard (Serrenho et al. 2019). If only new, efficient buildings have Figure 7.2. Annual emissions from the construction and operations of buildings in the G7 and in China and India, in a scenario that follows Shared Socioeconomic Pathway SSP1 to mitigate emissions to below 2\u00b0C Source: International Resource Panel (forthcoming). Emissions Gap Report 2019 60 their lifetime extended, more modest savings will be had (figure 7.2) (International Resource Panel forthcoming). Policies requiring energy retrofit during building renovations, such as those of the European Union, could alleviate the trade-off between emissions savings from lifetime extension and operational energy use (International Energy Agency 2019b), though optimal strategies can only be identified on a case-by-case basis (Itard and Klunder 2007). 7.2.4 Enhanced recycling and reuse Recycling of valuable materials is already widespread; reuse of building components is less common. When I-beams are reused, GHG savings can be significant, though there is the substantial logistical challenge of matching supply and demand, with reuse practices currently in decline (Densley", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a03c024c-c39e-4c33-ba21-82b66a72e2bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "a03c024c-c39e-4c33-ba21-82b66a72e2bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d279b8f5997145393ec643e3464c4bc292ae513fea09f210b1a88fe01481c0b7"}, "3": {"node_id": "a3e2d1ea-c00f-4997-b8e4-d81354b0dc7a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33879a1ea6a47b0916f615ba6bad1d947879557af6f4ba6f8996a868c52071fa"}}, "hash": "190fa890747bc9cbc56034f20d3326f00f067cde92380c870051ea3a67163422", "text": "Tingley et al. 2017). The recycling of construction and demolition waste from residential buildings offsets about 13\u201319 per cent of GHG emissions from building-material production in the G7. Metals are widely recycled and there is some recycling of timber and plastics. The use of concrete and other minerals as aggregates can still be improved, but emission savings are less. Some policy levers are both well-studied and subject to overt policy worldwide. As is the case for recycling of construction and demolition waste (Brantwood Consulting 2016; Deloitte 2017), many are regulated to achieve other social or environmental goals (for example, limits on short- term lodging in residences), though some are still largely at the exploratory stage (disassembly of buildings). 7.3 Material-efficient cars In 2015, light-duty vehicles (LDVs) contributed around 14 per cent or 7.5 GtCO2e to global GHG emissions. Of the emissions, 4.7 GtCO2e occurred during the operation of the vehicles (International Transport Forum 2019), 1.4 GtCO2e was associated with the production of fuels and another 1.4 GtCO2e was associated with the production of the vehicles (Hertwich 2019). Only about half of new vehicles replaced retired vehicles, with the remainder reflecting a growth in vehicle stock. G7 members were responsible for close to 40 per cent of the LDV-related GHG emissions, with the United States of America representing one quarter of global LDV emissions. 7.3.1 Product lightweighting and material substitution Under a business-as-usual scenario, lightweighting vehicles with materials such as high-strength steel, aluminium or carbon fibre offers significant emission reductions of 3\u20136 per cent, if proper recycling of these materials can be instituted (L\u00f8vik et al. 2014; Milovanoff et al. 2019). The relative emission reductions from lightweighting are smaller for electric vehicles due to their lower operational emissions. Fuel-efficiency standards, fuel taxes and registration fees tied to the fuel economy are policy instruments that support vehicle lightweighting. Downsizing the average size of vehicles is another important opportunity. In recent years, there has been a trend towards larger, heavier vehicles, such as sports-utility vehicles (SUVs) and pick-up trucks, which require more materials and higher operational energy use. Reversing that trend would reduce emissions substantially. Reducing the share of SUVs and light trucks in the United States of America from the current 53 per cent to 32 per cent by 2050 would reduce emissions from the production and operation of cars by 10 per cent. Registration fees tied to CO2 emissions in some European countries have successfully reduced the CO2 emissions rating of the average new vehicle, in part through shifting demand to smaller vehicles (D\u2019Haultf\u0153uille et al. 2016; Yan and Eskeland 2018). Fleets of shared vehicles tend to be smaller, but still provide users with transport capacity when it is needed. Encouraging collective rather than individual vehicle ownership could therefore help reduce vehicle mass and with this both material-related and operational emissions. 7.3.2 Improvements in the yield of material production and car manufacturing Improvements in the yield of material production and car manufacturing can contribute modest reductions in material use and associated emissions (Milford et al. 2013). 7.3.3 More intensive use and lifetime extension Car sharing, ride sharing and other measures to reduce individual automobility in favour of shared and collective transport can substantially reduce material use (Shaheen and Cohen 2019). Early evidence suggests that car sharing reduces household vehicle ownership and the average vehicle size (Chan and Shaheen 2012; Nijland and van Meerkerk 2017), though it also attracts users of public transport (Becker et al. 2018). There is also evidence to suggest that ride-hailing services, such as Uber and Lyft, can have an adverse effect and lead to increased traffic and vehicle size (Schaller 2017; Yin et al. 2018). Policies that discourage low-occupancy shared vehicles or penalize the increased congestion resulting from ride hailing, such as priority lanes for cars with three or more occupants or congestion pricing, can improve their environmental impact and material efficiency (Schaller 2018). The International Resource Panel (forthcoming) estimates that having 25 per cent of drivers shift to car sharing would reduce emissions by 10 per cent, while shifting 25 per cent of trips to shared rides would reduce emissions by 20 per cent (figure 7.3).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3e2d1ea-c00f-4997-b8e4-d81354b0dc7a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3e2d1ea-c00f-4997-b8e4-d81354b0dc7a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d279b8f5997145393ec643e3464c4bc292ae513fea09f210b1a88fe01481c0b7"}, "2": {"node_id": "a03c024c-c39e-4c33-ba21-82b66a72e2bb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "190fa890747bc9cbc56034f20d3326f00f067cde92380c870051ea3a67163422"}}, "hash": "33879a1ea6a47b0916f615ba6bad1d947879557af6f4ba6f8996a868c52071fa", "text": "In some rich countries, car ownership is already starting to reduce, especially among younger urban populations, a trend that can be furthered by tax policies, parking fees and regulatory and institutional support for shared mobility.

Much vehicle reuse is connected to the export of vehicles from wealthier to poorer countries, where vehicle recycling is not as well established or sophisticated. In such cases, reuse may meet unmet needs but at the expense of increasing material-related emissions. In the future, it is anticipated that individual car ownership may be replaced by fleets of self-driving vehicles (Greenblatt and Saxena 2015; Jones and Leibowicz 2019), which could result in a decrease in the number of vehicles needed and an increase in the use of such vehicles. If unregulated, such a trend will also likely increase driving distances which would impact emissions and may move people away from using more efficient public transport. With a policy that discourages individual ownership and enhances interoperability among public transport systems, self-driving cars could offer more ride-sharing services and be used as last-mile solutions in public transport systems (Hertwich et al. 2019). 7.3.4 Enhanced recycling and reuse Current recycling of metals from end-of-life vehicles (ELV) is well established. The International Resource Panel (forthcoming) estimates that recycling of ELV offsets about half of the emissions in the primary production of the materials used to make the vehicle. Strengthening the reuse of components also offers significant savings (International Resource Panel forthcoming; Milford et al. 2013). Within policies, recycling is typically measured in terms of recycling rates and landfill diversion rather than GHG emissions (Sawyer\u2010Beaulieu and Tam 2006). Adjusting ELV policies to incorporate considerations of embodied carbon warrants attention. The recovery of vehicle parts Figure 7.3. Annual emissions from the manufacturing and use of passenger vehicles in the G7 and in China and India, in a scenario that follows the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway SSP1 to mitigate emissions to below 2\u00b0C Source: International Resource Panel (forthcoming). Emissions Gap Report 2019 62 and the alloy-specific (closed-loop) recycling of metals may have a larger emissions pay-off than current shredding practices (Ohno et al. 2017; Sato et al. 2019). This could be achieved by developing reuse regulations and through more standardization across manufacturers. Some GHG reduction potential is missed because much of the steel in cars is downcycled to uses that are tolerant to copper contamination generated in the shredding of ELVs, such as, for example, reinforcing bar (Daehn et al. 2017). If the mixing of steel and copper in the recycling process were reduced, recycled steel could be used for higher value uses, such as car bodies, thereby reducing GHG emissions. 7.4 Summary and link to policy Research has shown that demand-side material efficiency offers substantial GHG mitigation opportunities that are complementary to those obtained through an energy system transformation (see chapter 6). The potential of purely technical strategies is limited, but considered relatively easy to achieve, whereas the more intense use of housing and vehicles has larger potential, though it would impact social structures and lifestyles. Demand-side material efficiency widens the spectrum of emissions mitigation strategies and may therefore reduce the need for other risky, contested, unproven or expensive technologies. Knowledge gaps regarding the link between material efficiency and climate change mitigation continue to exist, especially regarding the efficacy of policies where the focus of material efficiency has largely been confined to the end-of-life stage, such as targets for increased recycling. Socioeconomic transformations are crucial to harnessing the full potential of material efficiency, as, for example, greater intensity of use implies significant changes in use patterns or car ownership. The feasibility of and pathway towards such transformations in a carbon- constrained world requires further investigation. More intensive use is likely have a rebound effect, with money saved on car ownership being used for vacation travels or other high-emission activities (Makov and Font Vivanco 2018; Underwood and Fremstad 2018). Carbon pricing is a policy tool that can help minimize a rebound effect. It is important to gain a better understanding of other products and the coupling of sectors and cascading of materials, including implications to material quality resulting from increased reuse and recycling. Furthermore, the influence of the urban form, land-use planning and policies on service demand and consumption patterns need to be better understood. Demand-side material efficiency and related reductions in energy consumption and GHG emissions could be achieved through a number of policies, including carbon taxation on bulk materials (Neuhoff et al. 2016), eco-design laws (Official Journal of the European Union 2009), green public procurement (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Economic Development [OECD] 2015) or circular economy strategies (Material Economics 2018), as well as sector- specific approaches, such as changes", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7aac311-9687-4751-aec7-1dd3d9b153fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7aac311-9687-4751-aec7-1dd3d9b153fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "807ddb05c1287d6859379351e829801f09f24d4ba6c7667d31217c470286fd69"}, "3": {"node_id": "f3b93b58-4e6e-4740-8bd7-480bd127c099", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82e33faa0ef690b289374d2766e35b819f64b919dd3f7f31619824b4d6895d17"}}, "hash": "8102ef6db9cc36123b9c2a9f1d8124268753321c680157b7b4cc2a46e681b4d1", "text": "in building codes (ICC 2018). However, not all policies aimed at resource efficiency or circular economy automatically have co- benefits with climate change mitigation. For example, a prolonged product lifetime as a result of policies may under certain circumstances actually delay the introduction of more efficient products, thus leading to higher system- wide emissions. Use of life cycle assessments and related forms of systems measurement, as well as careful and integrative policy design and evaluation are necessary for the more efficient use of resources, which will also lead to reduced emissions.

Lessons from a decade of emissions gap assessments. United Nations Environment Programme, Nairobi. https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/ emissions-gap-report-10-year-summary 1 This publication has been prepared by the scientific editors of the UN Environment Emissions Gap Reports: John Christensen (UNEP DTU Partnership) and Anne Olhoff (UNEP DTU Partnership). UN Environment warmly thanks all the authors, the members of the steering committee and the reviewers of the emissions gap assessments over the past 10 years for their invaluable contributions. This year, UN Environment will publish the tenth edition of the annual Emissions Gap Report. To mark the 10-year anniversary and as a contribution to the United Nations Secretary-General's Climate Action Summit, this publication revisits the gap rationale and how it has evolved, comparing the expectations following the Copenhagen Accord with the reality 10 years later. The findings are Lessons from a decade of emissions gap assessments sobering. Despite a decade of increasing political and societal focus on climate change and the milestone Paris Agreement, global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have not been curbed, and the emissions gap is larger than ever. The challenges for the United Nations Secretary-General\u2019s Climate Action Summit and for international climate change negotiations in 2019 are clear. Unless mitigation ambition and action increase substantially and immediately in the form of new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by 2020 and are reflected in ambitious long-term GHG development strategies, exceeding the 1.5\u00b0C goal can no longer be avoided, and achieving the well-below 2\u00b0C temperature goal becomes increasingly challenging. These and other key lessons emerging from a decade of Emissions Gap Reports are summarized under the 10 headings of this publication. The Copenhagen Accord of 2009 and the Cancun Pledges of 2010 \u2013 the origin of the 2020 emissions gap assessments The Copenhagen Accord declared that \u201cdeep cuts\u201d in global emissions were required \u201cso as to hold the increase in global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius\u201d and called for an assessment that would consider strengthening the long- term goal, including in relation to \u201ctemperature rises of 1.5 degrees Celsius\u201d. Since December 2009, 140 countries have endorsed the Copenhagen Accord. Of these, 85 countries have pledged to reduce their emissions or constrain their growth up to 2020. The pledges and the temperature targets referred to in the Copenhagen Accord were formalized by the 2010 Cancun Agreements and gave rise to a central question: will there be a gap in 2020 between emissions expected under full implementation of pledges and the level consistent with the 2\u00b0C target? This was the central question addressed in the Emissions Gap Reports from 2010 to 2014 (UNEP 2010; UNEP 2011; UNEP 2012; UNEP 2013; UNEP 2014).

Consequently, the Emissions Gap Reports operated with four pledge cases for 2020 (Figure 1). To estimate the 2020 emissions gap, the emissions under the pledge cases were compared with a median estimate of global emissions in 2020 consistent with a pathway to 2\u00b0C in 2100 (with at least 66 per cent chance). This approach has been applied consistently over all the years, with a shift to 2030 as the focal year as it became the target for the Paris Agreement. Over the 2010\u20132014 period, the gap estimates for 2020 ranged from a low of 5 GtCO\ufffde according to the most ambitious pledges and measured under strict accounting rules (UNEP 2010) to a high of 13 GtCO\ufffde in 2020 according to the least ambitious pledges and more lenient accounting rules (UNEP 2012). As pledges and accounting approaches became clearer, the gap estimate converged towards between 8 and 10 GtCO\ufffde (UNEP 2014). 2 Figure 1 \u2014 The emissions gap in 2020 Source: UNEP (2011) The Paris Agreement \u2013 strengthened temperature goals and a shift to the 2030 emissions gap The Paris Agreement, adopted by 195 countries at Conference of the Parties (COP) 21 in December 2015, represents a major step forward on global climate governance. It sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2\u00b0C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C, the two formal temperature goals of the agreement. Nationally determined contributions (NDCs) are at the heart of the Paris Agreement and the approach adopted in favour of its long-term goals. NDCs represent national climate plans that embody efforts by each country to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. At the time of writing, 184 Parties have communicated their first NDCs. Acknowledging that a voluntary bottom-up political process is unlikely to be very ambitious from the outset, the Paris Agreement is designed with a five-year review and new submission cycle, making it possible to collectively ramp up ambitions over time. With the Paris Agreement, the focus of the gap assessment shifted from 2020 to 2030 as the new target year, and started to include the 1.5\u00b0C limit of the agreement, as shown in Figure 2. In line with the 2020 emissions gap, the 2030 emissions gap is estimated as the difference between projected global emissions in 2030 under full implementation of conditional and unconditional NDCs respectively and the emissions levels that scientific projections indicate are consistent with limiting global temperature increase in 2100 to below 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C respectively.

Global GHG emissions grew at an average of 1.6 per cent per year during the period from 2008 to 2017, reaching a record 53.5 GtCO\ufffde in 2017, including emissions from land-use change. Preliminary findings from the Emissions Gap Report 2019 indicate that global GHG emissions continued to grow in 2018, breaking the 2017 record. Countries with declining emissions have so far been unable to offset the growth in emissions in other countries and in sectors not covered by national accounting, such as aviation and shipping.

The current level of global GHG emissions is by now almost exactly at the level of emissions projected for 2020 under the business-as-usual, or no-policy, scenarios used in the Emissions Gap Reports (see Figures 1 and 2), which are based on the assumption that no new climate policies are put into place from 2005 onwards. In other words, essentially there has been no real change in the global emissions pathway in the last decade. The effects of climate policies have been too small to offset the impact of key drivers of emissions such as economic growth and population growth. 4 This rather bleak", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a96cd3a2-95ee-4e9d-b09f-08d193f106e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "a96cd3a2-95ee-4e9d-b09f-08d193f106e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-10-year-summary", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 10 year summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-10-year-summary", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4024b2e1cb6281dfeb40be1d0c1bb7f8fae5aa94f840114c7c2fa9df119f24c1"}, "3": {"node_id": "8538edd0-768f-49e4-9590-eb3e6ec5fd5e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-10-year-summary", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "848c7482bfbfd8c9716bf27124635c42adaf44b32256e213c94b92da72148a33"}}, "hash": "b0c723e022cfae72ca87306bbaf32213c9ca9c5358c733b750c9ae6d4f002787", "text": "fact hides many nuances in terms of, for example, policy progress in individual countries and declines in energy and carbon intensities. The Emissions Gap Reports assess that collectively G20 members are on track to achieve the mid-level of the Cancun Pledges, although some G20 members are projected to miss their pledges, or there is uncertainty as to whether they will achieve them. Acknowledging the importance of achieving of the Cancun Pledges, the fact remains that at the global scale we have failed to bridge or even narrow the 2020 emissions gap, as assessed in the Emissions Gap Reports from 2010 to 2014. The Emissions Gap Reports have consistently emphasized the importance of enhanced pre-2020 action and pledges and warned that unless urgent action is taken, there will be a number of consequences, including (UNEP 2016): \u25cf Significantly higher rates of global emission reductions are required in the medium- and long-term to meet the well-below 2\u00b0C target. The order of magnitude of these rates has no historic precedent. \u25cf The \u2018solution space\u2019 and options available to society to achieve stringent emission reductions is reduced. \u25cf Greater lock-in of carbon- and energy-intensive infrastructure in the energy system and society, as a whole, which will simultaneously be a disincentive for the short-term learning and technology development that is essential in the long-term. \u25cf Greater dependence on negative emissions technologies in the medium term \u2013 technologies that so far are unproven on a larger scale. \u25cf Increased costs of mitigation and adaptation in the medium- and long-term, and greater risks of economic disruption. Importantly, delaying action is associated with greater risks of failing to meet the well-below 2\u00b0C target and is incompatible with meeting a 1.5\u00b0C target. The implication is clear: if the Paris goals are to be kept viable, the world cannot afford to lose another decade. Concerns about the current level of both ambition and action are amplified in the 2018 report and the forthcoming 2019 report. As shown in Figure 2, the 2018 report estimates the emissions gap in 2030 between emission levels with full implementation of conditional NDCs and levels consistent with least-cost pathways to the 2\u00b0C target to be 13 GtCO\ufffde. If only the unconditional NDCs are implemented, the gap increases to 15 GtCO\ufffde. The gap in the case of the 1.5\u00b0C target is 29 GtCO\ufffde and 32 GtCO\ufffde respectively. The gap numbers have increased compared with 2017, mainly as a result of the more detailed and diverse literature on 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C pathways prepared for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on global warming of 1.5\u00b0C . This literature made it possible to assess the gap compared to pathways associated with a \u201clikely chance\u201d (at least 66 per cent) of meeting the 1.5\u00b0C target, the same probability used for the 2\u00b0C gap assessment. Due to the lack of available studies that could achieve 1.5\u00b0C with a likely chance, earlier reports only considered the gap associated with a \u201cmedium chance\u201d (50 to 66 per cent) of limiting temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C in 2100. The emissions gap is larger than ever 3 Updated analysis for the forthcoming 2019 Emissions Gap Report reiterates that progress on national commitments under the Paris Agreement is limited and that the current pace of national action is hugely insufficient for achieving the Paris Agreement long-term temperature goal, and even for achieving the emissions reductions implied by the current NDCs. Increased emissions and lagging action means that the gap numbers in the 2019 report will be larger than ever. Considering the entire decade of Emissions Gap Reports, three main factors contribute to the growing emissions gap. First, the failure to bridge the original 2020 emissions gap has led to a larger 2030 gap. Whereas the 2020 gap for 2\u00b0C was 8 to 10 GtCO\ufffde in the 2014 report, the 2030 gap is in the order of 13 to 15 GtCO\ufffde. In other words, the 2030 gap is about 50 per cent larger than the 2020 gap. Second, the strengthened temperature targets of the Paris Agreement of well below 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C imply an increase in the emissions reductions needed by 2030. Third, over time and as scientific knowledge has improved, the pathways for especially the 1.5\u00b0C target have become more stringent. Altogether, ambition and action over the past decade have simply been inadequate, so action now needs to be faster and more transformational.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8538edd0-768f-49e4-9590-eb3e6ec5fd5e": {"__data__": {"id_": "8538edd0-768f-49e4-9590-eb3e6ec5fd5e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-10-year-summary", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 10 year summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-10-year-summary", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4024b2e1cb6281dfeb40be1d0c1bb7f8fae5aa94f840114c7c2fa9df119f24c1"}, "2": {"node_id": "a96cd3a2-95ee-4e9d-b09f-08d193f106e1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-10-year-summary", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0c723e022cfae72ca87306bbaf32213c9ca9c5358c733b750c9ae6d4f002787"}}, "hash": "848c7482bfbfd8c9716bf27124635c42adaf44b32256e213c94b92da72148a33", "text": "5 The Emissions Gap Reports show that nations must triple the level of ambition reflected in their current NDCs to get on track towards limiting warming to below 2\u00b0C, while at least a fivefold increase is needed to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17546189-9ba7-4b2d-9b0d-5bdc54276f51": {"__data__": {"id_": "17546189-9ba7-4b2d-9b0d-5bdc54276f51", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-10-year-summary", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 10 year summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-10-year-summary", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ac322b6029b9b972fbd6d6a669a925aa4576452ac2daa5d95a865fff50700f1"}, "3": {"node_id": "28d2c502-be94-4283-aac4-bd29a81aff64", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-10-year-summary", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3495d0cf4e12c6a8d267cbcc58fff85ab651720d4c6b409b420de4bd5e347953"}}, "hash": "b852205c56ce7eba378b9d9561bd032729c38219689f65a159ca893c467bf730", "text": "align global climate action and emissions with limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C by the end of this century (see also Figure 2). For this to be realistic, new and enhanced NDCs need to be agreed by 2020 and the implementation of existing actions accelerated. The defining challenge for the United Nations Secretary-General's Climate Action Summit in 2019 and for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations over the coming year is to bring about this giant leap in ambition and to accelerate action. As Figure 4 shows, enhanced mitigation ambition can take many forms and options must be pursued in all categories and by all countries to meet the challenge. The year 2020 will be defining. Given the time lag between developing policies and achieving emission reductions, enhanced ambition of NDCs cannot wait until the global stocktake planned for 2023. The global challenge \u2013 the ambition level of current NDCs needs to be tripled to get on track to 2\u00b0C and increased fivefold to align with 1.5\u00b0C 4 The Emissions Gap Reports conclude that a continuation of current policies would lead to a global mean temperature rise of between 3.4\u00b0C and 3.7\u00b0C by 2100 relative to pre-industrial levels, and continuing thereafter (UNEP 2016). Implementing the current unconditional NDCs, and assuming that climate action continues consistently throughout the twenty-first century, would lead to a global mean temperature rise of between 2.9\u00b0C and 3.4\u00b0C by 2100 relative to pre-industrial levels, and continuing thereafter. Implementation of the conditional NDCs would reduce these estimates by 0.2\u00b0C in 2100 (UNEP 2016; UNEP 2017; UNEP 2018). These numbers are currently being updated for the forthcoming Emissions Gap Report, and will likely become even more dramatic.

Declare policies policies policies Increase Increase long-term implementation Declare modalities sectoral sectoral sectoral sectoral sectoral 6 To assess whether the emissions gap can be bridged, the Emissions Gap Reports have regularly assessed sectoral emission reduction potentials. The 2017 report provided a detailed updated systematic assessment of sectoral mitigation options in 2030, which shows that the emissions gap can be bridged before 2030 if countries quickly adopt proven and cost-effective technologies and management practices. A substantial part of the economic and technical potential can be realized through scaling up and replicating existing, well-proven policies that simultaneously contribute to key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The 2017 assessment showed that by considering only proven technologies and adopting relatively precautionary assumptions, emissions could be reduced by 33 GtCO\ufffde per year by 2030 (uncertainty range of 30\u201336 GtCO\ufffde), which is sufficient to get on track to well below 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C. This 'basic' potential is illustrated in Figure 5. Remarkably, a large part of this potential is available in just six areas: solar energy, wind energy, efficient appliances, efficient The gap can still be bridged, but unprecedented and immediate action is required 5 passenger cars, afforestation and stopping deforestation. These six areas present a combined potential of up to 21 GtCO\ufffde per year by 2030, which is more than sufficient to get on a pathway to well below 2\u00b0C. If areas where estimates of potentials are relatively new, and the feasibility of realizing these in 2030 is more uncertain, are also considered, the total emission reduction potential is 38 GtCO\ufffde per year (uncertainty range of 35\u201341 GtCO\ufffde). The underlying assumption is that all countries will act quickly and implement the most cost-effective measures in their national contexts. This is evidently a very idealistic assumption, but it underlines the fact that the policies and technologies needed to bridge the gap are readily available and at limited costs. While new innovation will be needed for full decarbonization, there is no excuse for inaction now.

Despite the huge potential of carbon pricing to reduce GHG emissions, it is still only just emerging in many countries and is generally not applied at a sufficient level to facilitate a real shift towards low-carbon societies. Even when considering energy-specific taxes together with explicit carbon pricing policies, half of the emissions from fossil fuels are not priced at all, and only 10 per cent of global emissions from fossil fuels are estimated to be priced at a level consistent with limiting global warming to 2\u00b0C. If all fossil-fuel subsidies were phased out, it would lead to a reduction of global carbon emissions of up to about 10 per cent by 2030. In this and other areas, ensuring political viability and handling distributional impacts of the transition to development paths in line with the Paris Agreement is often key, as illustrated by Figure 6. Figure 6 \u2014 Key issues for making fiscal reforms politically viable (upper part) and solutions and measures to address them (lower part) Source: UNEP (2018), Figure 6.3. 8 Reducing short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) is another area that is attracting attention. These agents have a relatively short lifetime in the atmosphere \u2013 from a few days to a few decades \u2013 but are potent GHGs with a significant short-term warming influence on the climate. The main SLCPs are black carbon, methane, tropospheric ozone and some hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Reducing these pollutants will limit the rate of short-term warming and, when sustained and combined with carbon dioxide (CO\ufffd) reductions, will help limit long-term warming, which is the ultimate aim of closing the emissions gap (UNEP 2017). One significant development is the phasedown of HFC use and associated emissions as a result of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which could reduce global hydrofluorocarbon emissions by 0.7 GtCO\ufffde per year by 2030, and by up to 2.7 GtCO\ufffde per year by 2050. Additional indirect CO\ufffd mitigation is likely through parallel improvements in the energy efficiency of refrigeration and air-conditioning appliances and equipment. Previous phase- outs under the Montreal Protocol have catalysed significant improvements in the energy efficiency of appliances \u2013 by up to 30 per cent in some subsectors. UN Environment is currently undertaking a separate scientific assessment of these effects. It is worth noting that in its 2018 assessment, the Scientific Assessment Panel for the Montreal Protocol concluded that \u201cThe Kigali Amendment is projected to reduce future global average warming in 2100 due to hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) from a baseline of 0.3\u20130.5\u00b0C to less than 0.1\u00b0C. The magnitude of the avoided temperature increase due to the provisions of the Kigali Amendment (0.2 to 0.4\u00b0C) is substantial in the context of the 2015 Paris Agreement\u201d (World Meteorological Organization 2018). Some of the other key action areas covered in recent Emissions Gap Reports are highlighted under the subsequent headlines. CO\ufffd emissions from fossil-fuel use in the energy and industry sectors dominate total GHG emissions. Following a period of stabilization from 2014 to 2016, emissions started to rise again in 2017 and 2018. At the same time, energy needs are projected to grow by approximately 30 per cent by 2040. This increasing demand is stimulated by economic growth and the accompanying trends of urbanization, industrialization, infrastructure growth, and a growing global middle class. As the challenge for the energy sector is therefore immense, transforming the way in which energy is produced and consumed will be key to reaching the Paris Agreement goals. The forthcoming Emissions Gap Report examines key elements of the required energy transformation, which combined with findings from previous reports stress the urgency of accelerating energy efficiency across the board and of rapidly expanding renewable energy supply and use. Decarbonizing energy supply and transport is key for transformational change 6 Enhanced energy efficiency is required across the board with a strong focus on heating and cooling, appliances and lighting, industrial processes and motors, and transport. Many policy options exist in key sectors and have been documented in previous Emissions Gap Reports. For example, the 2016 Emissions Gap Report highlighted a small number of successful policies that have already been implemented or are under implementation in many countries that can be rapidly replicated and scaled up (Figure 7). The transport sector can be treated either as a subset of energy consumption or separately as an important individual sector for mitigation interventions. There is an increasing focus on electrification as a major mitigation option in transport. Such a transition would bring significant local air pollution benefits, and in the transport sector in particular", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c47d6a9b-2a6b-46ba-996d-b5396918f3a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "c47d6a9b-2a6b-46ba-996d-b5396918f3a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-10-year-summary", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 10 year summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-10-year-summary", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb66a841ca621e78ded650df706d4841c6dfacd61e7dcb4168a74eb52404ddb0"}}, "hash": "cb66a841ca621e78ded650df706d4841c6dfacd61e7dcb4168a74eb52404ddb0", "text": "there is a need for an integrated approach. 9 Figure 7 \u2014 Examples of proven sectoral energy efficiency policies Source: UNEP (2016), Figure ES.7. Almost all NDCs include mitigation in the energy sector as a key area and around 75 per cent include actions on transport focusing on three concepts: (1) To avoid and reduce the need for motorized transportation, (2) To shift to more environmentally friendly modes of transportation, and (3) To improve the energy efficiency of transport modes. The transition requires rapid expansion of renewable elec- tricity supply, establishment of smarter and more flexible electricity grids, and huge increases in the numbers of products and processes that run on electricity in build- ings, transport and industry. The renewables expansion has already become increasingly market driven. Stable and conducive policies and regulatory frameworks are, however, important preconditions along with access to the necessary private sector finance. Overall capacity additions in 2018 were around 50 gigawatts for wind power and more than 100 gigawatts for solar photovoltaic (PV) power. For the seventh successive year, the net additional power generation capacity of renewable sources exceeded that of non- renewable sources. Growth rates in renewable power have averaged 8\u20139 per cent per year since 2010. Renewable energy investment continues to increase, although it is slightly down from 2017 (UNEP forthcoming). This trend over the last decade is encouraging, but it will need to be accelerated even further, as described above and illustrated in Figure 8.

The existing stocks, in combination with what is currently planned and being built (assuming standard lifetimes and usage rates) alone account for a significant share of the available carbon budget for a 2\u00b0C target, and would plausibly make a 1.5\u00b0C target infeasible, as illustrated in Figure 9. Facilitating a transition away from coal for power production will therefore be essential to successful global mitigation efforts. Avoiding further lock-in through new coal-fired power plants is therefore a major and urgent requirement, followed by a gradual phasing out of existing coal plants. Figure 9 \u2014 Emissions committed to the atmosphere from coal-fired power plants (existing, under construction and planned) and other economic sectors, by region Phasing out coal is indispensable, but requires a balanced transition 7 Source: Based on UNEP (2017), Figure 5.1. While coal is widely used, only around 10 or 11 large countries have very significant coal emissions. For all these countries, a transition away from coal presents a major political and economic challenge that will take time. Removing domestic subsidies and including pricing of externalities will be important, with the latter helping generate revenue to address the societal challenges a transition will encounter. This will include addressing impacts on affected workers and communities, as well as the coal owners and industry, balancing energy prices for different social groups and energy-intensive industries, to mention a few (see also Figure 6). 1.5\u00b0C budget with >50% probability 560-660 GtCO\ufffd from 2016 2\u00b0C budget with >66% probability 1150-1250 GtCO\ufffd from 2016 11 The Climate Action Summit uses the term \u2018nature- based solutions\u2019 as the convening theme for a broad set of issues related to the enhanced used of natural systems for improving mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The main categories include: \u25cf Forests and other terrestrial ecosystems \u25cf Agriculture and food systems \u25cf Marine and coastal ecosystems Not all aspects of nature-based solutions have been covered in the Emissions Gap Reports. However, mitigation potentials and options in forestry, including REDD+, were assessed in the 2012, 2015 and 2017 reports, agriculture options in the 2013 and 2017 reports, and nature-based CO\ufffd removal options in the 2017 report. The Emission Gap Report findings are aligned with the information in the recently released IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land and the fifth assessment report of the IPCC. Most mitigation options are quite well known, but often difficult to implement in practice due to challenges related to limited access to financing, poverty issues, institutions, ecological issues, and barriers concerning technological development, diffusion and transfer.

Non-State and subnational action plays an important role in delivering NDCs. Since 2015, the Emissions Gap Reports have included assessments of the role of such action and the 2018 report included a special focus on non- State and subnational actors. The 2018 report documents the rapid increase in the number of actors participating in climate action: more than 7,000 cities from 133 countries and 245 regions from 42 countries, along with more than 6,000 companies with at least US$36 trillion in revenue, have pledged mitigation action. Commitments cover large parts of the economy and are gradually expanding in terms of regional coverage. Many of the actors are engaging in \u2018international cooperative Non-State and subnational actors are essential, but the current mitigation impacts are still limited and poorly documented 9 initiatives\u2019, which are characterized by multi-country and multi-actor engagement. The numbers are impressive, but there is still huge potential for expansion. Based on available data, less than 20 per cent of the world population is represented in current national and international initiatives, and many more of the over 500,000 publicly traded companies worldwide still can, and must, act. Assessing the emission reduction potential from non- State and subnational action is challenging and must take into account overlaps with national action. The Emissions Gap Reports find that the potential could ultimately be significant, allowing countries to raise their ambition, but the current impacts are limited and poorly documented (Figure 10). 12 Figure 10 \u2014 The range of estimated potential emission reductions in various non-State and subnational action studies Source: UNEP (2018), Figure 5.4. Combining innovation in the use of existing technologies and in behaviour with the promotion of investment in new technologies and market creation has the potential to radically transform societies and reduce their GHG emissions. However, it will not happen by itself. Five principles are likely to be key in the design of policies and programmes to accelerate low-carbon innovation (UNEP 2018): 1. Public organizations must be willing to take on the high, early-stage risk that private organizations shy away from. 2. At the mid-stage of the innovation chain, public organizations must be able to nurture feedback effects among different parts of the innovation landscape and help de-risk private investment in commercial-scale projects. Innovation and new solutions are needed for long-term carbon neutrality 10 3. Green policies must set a direction for the whole economy, not for each sector separately. 4. Mission-oriented innovation is useful for stimulating investment and innovation across different parts of the economy to reach concrete, target-specific goals by a specific date. 5. Policy instruments need to be structured to mobilize actors through bottom-up exploration and participation. All these policies benefit from a long- term design horizon that creates certainty for private finance to be crowded in. 13 CO\ufffd removal is one of many areas where innovation and new solutions are needed. Most of the global modelling scenarios that analyse different pathways to achieving the Paris Agreement goals of 1.5\u00b0C or well below 2\u00b0C include elements of \u2018negative emissions solutions\u2019, that is, options that actively reduce CO\ufffd in the atmosphere. In the 2017 Emissions Gap Report, the various options for CO\ufffd removal were therefore assessed. CO\ufffd removal and the deployment of negative emissions approaches must be employed in addition to other mitigation options. In other words, CO\ufffd removal is concerned with the management of overshoot, in the event that all relevant mitigation options have been pursued. Figure 11 provides an overview of the various CO\ufffd removal options and strategies. Natural removal options have already been mentioned as part of the nature-based solutions and currently constitute the main and most cost- effective options for CO\ufffd removal. The combined options focus on increased use of bioenergy, especially for power production, combined with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Studies indicate a significant mitigation potential but there are many unresolved issues around the land and water resources required for large-scale biomass for energy production and currently CCS is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4118990-11ca-4edf-b741-8b4fdd41efb6": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4118990-11ca-4edf-b741-8b4fdd41efb6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-10-year-summary", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 10 year summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-10-year-summary", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71a049d039ee5ce9c26e754b5daa03600c8956f972e757a6a382c53e78f136be"}}, "hash": "71a049d039ee5ce9c26e754b5daa03600c8956f972e757a6a382c53e78f136be", "text": "too costly for large-scale deployment. Human-made technologies to remove CO\ufffd from the air have been in use for many years, mostly in submarine, aerospace and medical applications. Only recently have these technologies been considered as global-scale carbon removal agents. They offer specific benefits in that they use very little land or water, they do not emit non-CO\ufffd GHGs and they have very high levels of certainty regarding the flux and long-term fate of the CO\ufffd removed. Some approaches also produce materials that can be used commercially, for example, cements and aggregates. However, many approaches are very expensive and may have numerous, as yet unknown, side effects that may have repercussions for societies. Most have not been deployed at scale and have a low level of technical readiness. Nonetheless, increased investment in developing these options could, over time, change the situation. Precaution is recommended, and pros and cons need to be assessed, before any full-scale deployment could happen. The United Nations may have a role to play in ensuring an overarching intergovernmental policy approach that can help ensure no one is left behind, if such technologies are to be deployed widely.

The scientific understanding of both the consequences of inadequate action and the available options for rapid and cost-effective emission reductions has also improved significantly. Bending the emissions curve and bridging the emissions gap, while presenting an unprecedented challenge, is still possible. It will require the full utilization of all emission Looking ahead \u2013 the next decade will be defining reduction options and policies to support these, replication and scale-up of current best practices, a shift in investments to bring about the transformations and innovations needed in the longer term, and careful management of the interests of the economic and societal sectors that might be affected during the transition to a zero-carbon and climate-resilient future.

.....................................................................................................................................................................47 References ...............................................................................................................................................................................48 vii vii The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Glossary Glossary This glossary is compiled according to the Lead Authors of the Report drawing on glossaries and other resources available on the websites of the following organizations, networks and projects: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Switzerland), Non-State Actor Zone for Climate Action (Germany), United Nations Environment (Kenya), United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (Germany) and World Resources Institute (United States). Adaptation: The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In some natural systems, human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects. Avoid Shift Improve: A framework proposed for mitigation from the transport sector. Avoid refers to the need to improve the efficiency of the transport system such as through integrated land-use planning. Shift involves servicing demand using low-carbon modes like using public transport instead of motorized private vehicles. Improve relies on vehicle efficiency improvement or alternative vehicle technologies to reduce emissions such as using a vehicle powered by alternative fuels. Baseline/reference: The state against which change is measured. In the context of transformation pathways, the term \u2018baseline scenarios\u2019 refers to scenarios that are based on the assumption that no mitigation policies or measures will be implemented beyond those that are already in force and/or are legislated or planned to be adopted. Baseline scenarios are not intended to be predictions of the future, but rather counterfactual constructions that can serve to highlight the level of emissions that would occur without further policy effort. Typically, baseline scenarios are then compared to mitigation scenarios that are constructed to meet different goals for greenhouse gas emissions, atmospheric concentrations or temperature change. The term \u2018baseline scenario\u2019 is used interchangeably with \u2018reference scenario\u2019 and \u2018no policy scenario\u2019. In much of the literature the term is also synonymous with the term \u2018business as usual (BAU) scenario\u2019, although the term \u2018BAU\u2019 has fallen out of favour because the idea of \u2018business as usual\u2019 in century-long socioeconomic projections is hard to fathom. Bottom-up model: In the context of this assessment, a model that represents a system by looking at its detailed underlying parts. Compared to so-called top-down models, which focus on economic interlinkages, bottom-up models of energy use and emissions can provide greater resolution with regards to sectors or mitigation technologies. Cancun Pledge: During 2010, many countries submitted their existing plans for controlling greenhouse gas emissions to the Climate Change Secretariat and these proposals were formally acknowledged under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Developed countries presented their plans in the shape of economy-wide targets to reduce emissions, mainly up to 2020, while developing countries proposed ways to limit their growth of emissions in the shape of plans of action. Carbon dioxide budget (or carbon budget): For a given temperature rise limit, for example a 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C long- term limit, the corresponding carbon budget reflects the total amount of carbon emissions that can be emitted for temperatures to stay below that limit. Stated differently, a carbon budget is the area under a carbon dioxide (CO2) emission trajectory that satisfies assumptions about limits on cumulative emissions estimated to avoid a certain level of global mean surface temperature rise. Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e): A way to place emissions of various radiative forcing agents on a common footing by accounting for their effect on climate. It describes, for a given mixture and amount of greenhouse gases, the amount of CO2 that would have the same global warming ability, when measured over a specified time period. For the purpose of this report, greenhouse gas emissions (unless otherwise specified) are the sum of the basket of greenhouse gases listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol, expressed as CO2e assuming a 100-year global warming potential. Carbon intensity: The amount of emissions of CO2 released per unit of another variable such as gross domestic product, output energy use or transport. viii viii The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Glossary Carbon offset: See Offset. Carbon price: The price for avoided or released CO2 or CO2e emissions. This may refer to the rate of a carbon tax or the price of emission permits. In many models that are used to assess the economic costs of mitigation, carbon prices are used as a proxy to represent the level of effort in mitigation policies. Carbon sequestration: The process of removing carbon from the atmosphere and depositing it in a reservoir. Carbon stock: The quantity of carbon contained in a carbon pool or reservoir.

Because virtually all of the carbon in fossil fuels is ultimately emitted as CO2, a carbon tax is equivalent to an emission tax on CO2 emissions. Co-benefits: The positive effects that a policy or measure aimed at one objective might have on other objectives, without yet evaluating the net effect on overall social welfare. Co-benefits are often subject to uncertainty and depend on, among others, local circumstances and implementation practices. Co-benefits are often referred to as ancillary benefits. Conditional INDC: INDC proposed by some countries that are contingent on a range of possible conditions, such as the ability of national legislatures to enact the necessary laws, ambitious action from other countries, realisation of finance and technical support, or other factors. Conference of the Parties (COP): The supreme body of the Convention. It currently meets once a year to review the Convention\u2019s progress. Current policy trajectory: This trajectory is based on estimates of 2020 emissions considering projected economic trends and current policy approaches including policies at least through 2012. Estimates may be based on either official data or independent analysis. Double counting: In the context of this assessment, double counting refers to a situation in which the same emission reductions are counted towards meeting two countries\u2019 pledges. Emissions gap: The difference between the greenhouse gas emission levels consistent with having a likely chance (>66 per cent) of limiting the mean global temperature rise to below 2\u00b0C/1.5\u00b0C in 2100 above pre-industrial levels and the GHG emission levels consistent with the global effect of the INDCs, assuming full implementation from 2020. Emission pathway: The trajectory of annual greenhouse gas emissions over time. Global warming potential: An index representing the combined effect of the differing times greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere and their relative effectiveness in absorbing outgoing infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases: The atmospheric gases responsible for causing global warming and climatic change. The major greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Less prevalent, but very powerful, GHGs are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). Gross domestic product: The sum of gross value added, at purchasers\u2019 prices, by all resident and non-resident producers in the economy, plus any taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of products in a country or geographic region for a given period, normally one year. Gross domestic product is calculated without deducting for depreciation of fabricated assets or depletion and degradation of natural resources. Integrated Assessment Models: Models that seek to combine knowledge from multiple disciplines in the form of equations and/or algorithms in order to explore complex environmental problems. As such, they describe the full chain of climate change, from production of greenhouse gases to atmospheric responses. This necessarily includes relevant links and feedbacks between socio-economic and biophysical processes. Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC): Submissions by Parties which identify actions each national government intends to take under the Paris Agreement. INDCs are, in effect, the basis of post-2020 global emission reduction commitments included in the Paris Agreement. International Cooperative Initiatives (ICIs): Initiatives outside the UNFCCC aimed at reducing emissions of climate forcers by, for example, promoting actions that are less greenhouse gas intensive, compared to prevailing alternatives. Cooperative initiatives also involve national and sub-national partners (they are often referred to as, simply, \u2018cooperative initiatives\u2019). Kyoto Protocol: An international agreement, standing on its own, and requiring separate ratification by governments, but linked to the UNFCCC. The Kyoto Protocol, among other things, sets binding targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by industrialized countries. Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF): A greenhouse gas inventory sector that covers emissions and removals of greenhouse gases resulting from direct human- induced land use, land use change and forestry activities. Likely chance: A likelihood greater than 66 per cent chance. Used in this assessment to convey the probabilities of meeting temperature limits. Lock-in: Lock-in occurs when a market is stuck with a standard even though participants would be better off with an alternative. Medium chance: A likelihood of 50\u201366 per cent chance.

Montreal Protocol: The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is an international treaty that was designed to reduce the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances in order to reduce their abundance in the atmosphere, and thereby protect the Earth\u2019s ozone layer. Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC): By its decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 22, the Conference of the Parties (COP) invited Parties to communicate their first NDC no later than when the Party submits its respective instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession of the Paris Agreement. In the same paragraph, the COP further stated that if a Party has communicated an INDC prior to joining the Agreement, that Party shall be considered to have satisfied the provision of decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 22, unless that Party decides otherwise. Non-state actor: In the context of climate action, \u2018non-state actor\u2019 includes companies, cities, subnational regions and investors. More broadly, non-state actors have been defined as entities that participate or act in international relations. They are organizations with sufficient power to influence and cause a change even though they do not belong to any state institution. Offset (in climate policy): A unit of CO2e emissions that is reduced, avoided, or sequestered to compensate for emissions occurring elsewhere. Party: A state (or regional economic integration organization such as the EU) that agrees to be bound by a treaty and for which the treaty has entered into force. Pledge case: This case identifies the maximum level of greenhouse gas emissions that each country or Party could emit in 2020 and still meet its pledge \u2013 without considering the use of offsets. Scenario: A description of how the future may unfold based on \u2018if-then\u2019 propositions. Scenarios typically include an initial socio-economic situation and a description of the key driving forces and future changes in emissions, temperature or other climate change-related variables. Source: Any process, activity or mechanism that releases a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas or aerosol into the atmosphere. Sustainable development: Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Tipping point: A level of change in system properties beyond which a system reorganizes, often abruptly, and does not return to the initial state even if the drivers of the change are abated. For the climate system, it refers to a critical threshold when global or regional climate changes from one stable state to another stable state. The tipping point event may be irreversible. Top-down model: A model that applies macroeconomic theory, econometric and/or optimization techniques to aggregate economic variables. Using historical data on consumption, prices, incomes, and factor costs, top- down models assess demand and emissions for goods and services from main sectors, such as energy conversion, transportation, buildings, agriculture and industry. Uncertainty: A cognitive state of incomplete knowledge that can result from a lack of information or from disagreement about what is known or even knowable. It may have many types of sources, from imprecision in the data to ambiguously defined concepts or terminology, or uncertain projections of human behaviour. Uncertainty can therefore be represented by quantitative measures (for example a probability density function) or by qualitative statements (for example reflecting the judgement of a team of experts).

This year\u2019s data shows that overall emissions are still rising, but more slowly, and in the case of carbon dioxide, hardly at all. The report foresees further reductions in the short term and increased ambition in the medium term. Make no mistake; the Paris Agreement will slow climate change. The recent Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol will do the same. But not enough: not nearly enough and not fast enough. This report estimates we are actually on track for global warming of up to 3.4 degrees Celcius. Current commitments will reduce emissions by no more than a third of the levels required by 2030 to avert disaster. The Kigali Amendment will take off 0.5 degrees Celcius, although not until well after 2030. Action on short-lived climate pollutants, such as black carbon, can take off a further 0.5 degrees Celcius. This means we need to find another one degree from somewhere to meet the stronger, and safer, target of 1.5 degrees Celcius warming. So, we must take urgent action. If we don\u2019t, we will mourn the loss of biodiversity and natural resources. We will regret the economic fallout. Most of all, we will grieve over the avoidable human tragedy; the growing numbers of climate refugees hit by hunger, poverty, illness and conflict will be a constant reminder of our failure to deliver. None of this will be the result of bad weather. It will be the result of bad choices by governments, private sector and individual citizens. Because there are choices. This report highlights plenty of them. For example, it shows how UN Environment can help governments to ensure that every dollar they invest and every regulation they introduce will help to increase the scale and speed with which those choices deliver results. Even beyond government, the report shows many regions, cities and industrial sectors are choosing to target emissions reductions above those pledged by governments. Investors and bankers are choosing a more inclusive green economy. Authorities and legislators are choosing to improve energy efficiency, building codes and operating standards. While small scale businesses, farmers and families are choosing better production and consumption habits, like less waste and smarter travel. So, the choices are ours. The historic deals of last year are within reach, but we must redouble our effort. That\u2019s why today, as the Paris Agreement legally enters into force, we sincerely hope this report will be a wakeup call to the world. The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Foreword xii xii The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Executive summary Executive summary 1. The strengthened long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement require even stronger actions than previously identified, calling for accelerated efforts pre-2020, as well as increasing the ambition of the Nationally Determined Contributions. The Paris Agreement has very specific language about the long-term goals and how to get there, including: \u2022 A long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) above pre-industrial levels. \u2022 An aim to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C, as this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. \u2022 The need for global emissions to peak as soon as possible, followed by a rapid decline \u2013 recognising that this will take longer for developing countries. Compared to the 2\u00b0C goal that was the reference point of earlier Emissions Gap Reports, these new objectives require stronger short-term action and deeper cuts in the medium and longer term, as the remaining carbon dioxide budget is now considerably lower. Against the background of the large emissions gap that was identified in previous reports, this further amplifies the need for ambitious early action that accelerates and strengthens the Nationally Determined Contributions of countries. Enhanced pre-2020 and pre-2030 action will reduce the so-called transitional challenges associated with the necessary shift in emissions pathways, and: \u2022 Reduce the lock-in of carbon and energy intensive infrastructure in society and the energy system, encourage the rapid deployment of state of the art technologies, and spur near-term learning and development of technologies that will be essential in the long term. \u2022 Reduce the overall costs and economic challenges during the transitional period, for example, in terms of upscaling energy investments. \u2022 Reduce future dependence on unproven technologies, including negative emissions technologies, and increase the options to achieve stringent emission reductions. \u2022 Reduce climate risks, for example, by reducing the pace of the global temperature increase. \u2022 Realise immediate co-benefits through enhanced early action on climate change mitigation, such as improved public health as a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "818377df-e636-42eb-a0b9-1ea02231c980": {"__data__": {"id_": "818377df-e636-42eb-a0b9-1ea02231c980", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2fde0e3e9e3140be41b9be859ddabf870a5e3eee286374f9b16999a1e2b75b4"}}, "hash": "d2fde0e3e9e3140be41b9be859ddabf870a5e3eee286374f9b16999a1e2b75b4", "text": "result of lower air pollution, improved energy security, and reduced crop yield losses. Additional early action will be essential to keeping the door open to limit warming to below 1.5\u00b0C by 2100. 2. Record speed of entry into force of the Paris Agreement signals strong commitment to action The adoption of the Paris Agreement on climate change by 195 countries and the global agreement on the Sustainable Development Goals, made 2015 a landmark year. The Paris Agreement is the first climate deal with universal contributions to mitigation action. With ratification having surpassed the agreed minimum of 55 countries, representing at least 55 per cent of global emissions, the Agreement will enter into force before the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Marrakesh (COP 22). This sends a strong signal that countries are committed to action. The need for urgent action has been reinforced by the fact that 2015 was the hottest year since modern record keeping began. Although high temperatures were exacerbated by the effect of El Ni\u00f1o, it is notable that 10 of the warmest years on record have occurred since 2000, and the trend continues, xiii xiii The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Executive summary with the first six months of 2016 all being the warmest ever recorded. 3. Focus of the 2016 Emissions Gap Report The United Nations Environment (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report 2016 provides an authoritative assessment of the extent to which the current and planned national emissions reductions, as specified in the submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, will contribute towards the Paris Agreement goals. It does so by providing an estimate of the additional reductions \u2013 the Gap - required by 2030 to be on a least-cost path that is likely to ensure the global temperature goals. The assessment focuses on the 2\u00b0C goal, as well as on the implications for limiting the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C. The key new features and results of the 2016 Report are: \u2022 The assessment is based on Intended Nationally Determined Contributions submitted by almost all countries in the world, and a large number of studies supporting robustness of the estimates. \u2022 The key quantitative results stay within the ranges presented in the 2015 assessment. \u2022 The results underpin the urgency of immediate and strong action, and the need to build on the momentum of the entry into force of the Paris Agreement. Since the results are not likely to change in the next two years, enhanced action need not wait for the facilitative dialogue in 2018. \u2022 The report identifies where solutions are available to deliver low-cost emission reductions at scale, including three major areas of action: contributions by non-state actors, energy efficiency acceleration, and synergies with achievement of the sustainable development goals. The report has been prepared by an international team of leading scientists who assessed all available information, including those reviewed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its fifth assessment report, as well as more recent scientific literature. The assessment production process has been transparent and participatory, and governments of the countries with specific mention in the report have been invited to comment on the assessment findings before finalisation. 4. Global greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase Total global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue to show a steady increase, reaching approximately 52.7 gigatonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) in 2014. There have been small variations around this longer trend. Notably, the rate of global greenhouse gas emissions increase during the period 2000 to 2010 was faster (2.2 per cent per year) than during the period 1970 to 2000 (1.3 per cent per year), increasing in 2010 and 2011 (3.5 per cent per year) and then slowing in 2012 to 2013 (1.8 per cent per year). Global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use and industry seem to stabilise Global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion, cement production and other industrial processes are the major source of total global greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, they account for about 68 per cent of total global greenhouse gas emissions, and were estimated to be 36.2 0 10 20 30 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 40 GtCO2/year USA EU India Japan Russian Federation Other OECD countries* China Other G20 countries** Other big countries and areas*** Remaining non-OECD countries International transport Figure ES1: Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel use and industry. * Other OECD countries include Australia; Canada; Mexico; Republic of Korea and Turkey. ** Other G20 countries include Argentina; Brazil; Indonesia; Saudi Arabia; South Africa and Turkey. *** Other big countries and areas include Egypt;", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3b35eec-be4b-4d56-af98-5d1efd5a986f": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3b35eec-be4b-4d56-af98-5d1efd5a986f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba1102aa6f9fa7b20ff27ad47fffc925ecde5d2f8a256b027f5512d921018e3f"}}, "hash": "ba1102aa6f9fa7b20ff27ad47fffc925ecde5d2f8a256b027f5512d921018e3f", "text": "Iran; Kazakhstan; Malaysia; Nigeria; Taiwan, Province of China; Thailand and Ukraine. xiv xiv The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Executive summary GtCO2 in 2015. Figure ES1 presents a detailed overview of the development in global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use and industry for the period 1970 to 2015. In 2015, global carbon dioxide emissions from these sources stagnated for the first time and showed signs of a weak decline. Prior to 2015, global carbon dioxide emissions increased by roughly 1.3 per cent per year for the period 2012 to 2014, which was significantly slower than that of the 12 preceding years, where the average increase was 2.9 per cent per year (2000-2011), but higher than the average growth rate of around 1 per cent per year during the 1990s. These findings are in line with other studies on trends in global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. In summary, global greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow, and while the indications are encouraging that the growth rate of global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use and industry is slowing, it is still too early to say whether this is likely to be permanent. The continued growth of global emissions and the underlying trends show that the world is not yet on a trajectory that allows for a transition to stringent low emissions development pathways consistent with the stated temperature goals. 5. Collectively, members of the G20 are on a likely track to meet their Cancun Pledges for 2020, but these pledges do not deliver the necessary early emission reductions From a global perspective, early action is especially important for the major economies of the world; crucially these countries, as members of the G20, account for approximately three quarters of global emissions. Most of the G20 members at COP 16 in Cancun formalised the emission reduction pledges they had put forward as a follow up to the Copenhagen Accord. Since then, the annual Emissions Gap Reports have consistently assessed the progress countries are making towards delivering on these pledges, as they represent the main formalised early action commitment, and their timely achievement will send very positive signals to other countries. It should be noted that not all pledges demand the same level of effort. A country currently on track to achieve its pledge has not necessarily made a greater effort to mitigate emissions than a country not yet on track. The projections assessed are subject to the uncertainty associated with macroeconomic trends, such as changes in gross domestic product, and population trends, as well as the impact of each country\u2019s climate policy action. The emission trajectories analysed here do not quantify the potential impact of using offsets to achieve pledges, which is considered to be quite limited. The assessment shows that according to all available estimates three of the G20 members \u2013 China, the European Union, and India \u2013 are on track to meet their pledges without purchasing offsets. Three more \u2013 Brazil, Japan, and Russia \u2013 are on track according to most estimates. According to both government and independent estimates, Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America are likely to require further action, possibly supplemented by purchased offsets, in order to meet their pledges. Mexico\u2019s Cancun Pledge is conditional on the provision of adequate financial and technological support from developed countries as part of a global agreement, and the fulfilment of this condition has not been assessed. Government and independent sources have found a gap between Australia\u2019s projected 2020 emissions and its target level for that year. However, Australia\u2019s latest official projections find that for the budget period, and including carry-over from its first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, the country is now on track to meet its Kyoto target. According to independent analysis, the Republic of Korea will also require further action to meet its pledge. This cannot be verified using available official projections. The Republic of Korea has domestically abandoned its 2020 target, replacing it with the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions target in the amended Green Growth Act. However, its earlier pledge has not been officially withdrawn. Sufficient information is currently unavailable to determine whether Indonesia and South Africa are on track to meet their pledges. In the case of Indonesia, independent projections span a wide range, and official projections reflecting current policies are unavailable. Finally, Argentina, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have not made greenhouse gas reduction pledges for 2020.

It must be underlined that, collectively, these pledges are not ambitious enough to have a better starting point in 2020 to meet the 2030 levels of global greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the longer-term goals of below 2 or 1.5\u00b0C. The urgency of enhancing pre-2020 mitigation action is, therefore, indisputable: \u2022 It strengthens the likelihood that countries will meet and exceed their Cancun Pledges. \u2022 It provides a more solid foundation for implementing the Nationally Determined Contributions from 2020, and for continuously strengthening their ambition. \u2022 It supports the transition towards a least-cost emissions reduction trajectory after 2020 that is consistent with the 2\u00b0C goal. \u2022 It is likely the last chance to keep the option of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C in 2100 open, as all available scenarios consistent with the 1.5\u00b0C goal imply that global greenhouse gas emissions peak before 2020. xv xv The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Executive summary 6. Pathways for staying well below 2 and 1.5\u00b0C require deep emission reductions after, and preferably also before, 2020 and lower levels of emissions in 2030 than earlier assessed 2\u00b0C pathways. The central aim of the Paris Agreement is to keep the global temperature increase by the end of the century to well below 2\u00b0C compared to pre-industrial levels, with an ambition to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5\u00b0C. While these global goals are quite clear, there is a need to interpret what they mean. For example, what if the global average temperature exceeds these goals during the century, but is below the goals by end of it? Similarly, it is necessary to define an acceptable probability for achieving the goals, which in the end is a political rather than scientific question, as it requires value judgments about what is acceptable and desirable to society. In line with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s definition of \u201clikely\u201d, this report generally uses a 66 per cent or higher probability. A large body of literature is available on least-cost pathways that limit warming to below 2\u00b0C with a 66 per cent or higher probability. This issue has been covered extensively by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and earlier Emissions Gap Reports. For a 1.5\u00b0C goal, the body of literature is much more sparse and there are no published scenarios that meet the 1.5\u00b0C limit permanently with more than 66 per cent probability. Therefore, the studies assessed operate with a 50 per cent probability, which in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change terminology is considered \u201cabout as likely as not\u201d. The 2018 Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will provide a more comprehensive picture as it will cover new studies. Table ES1 presents the pathway characteristics for achieving the two different temperature goals, showing the median acceptable emission levels for key years between 2020 and 2100. As in the earlier Emissions Gap Reports, it is important to highlight that most scenarios that are available in the literature, and that limit warming to below 2 or 1.5\u00b0C, assume the use of so-called negative emissions technologies in the second half of the century -- that is the active and permanent removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This can be achieved, for example, through sustainable afforestation and reforestation, enhanced soil carbon absorption, biochar, and the combination of bio-energy with carbon capture and storage. Important challenges have been identified for large-scale application of negative emissions technologies. For example, with biomass there is a challenge to produce enough biomass without harming biodiversity and a potential for competition between energy and food production over land and water resources.

These studies find that this is only possible by reducing emissions more steeply in the very near-term that is over the coming 5 to 15 years.

The emissions gap for 2030 is 12 to 14 GtCO2e compared with 2\u00b0C scenarios, for 1.5\u00b0C the gap is three GtCO2e larger. Even if fully implemented, the unconditional Intended Nationally Determined Contri- butions are only consistent with staying below an increase in temperature of 3.2\u00b0C by 2100 and 3.0\u00b0C, if conditional Intended Nationally Determined Contributions are included. In the period up to COP 21 in Paris, United Nations Environment had, as part of the preparation of the Emissions Gap Report 2015, engaged a team of independent experts to assess the mitigation impacts of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. The results were presented as a key part of the Emissions Gap Report and covered the 118 countries having submitted an Intended Nationally Determined Contribution by 1 October 2015. This year, new international studies are available that include the 160 Intended Nationally Determined Contributions submitted, representing 187 out of 195 Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The assessment is based on 10 different global level Intended Nationally Determined Contribution studies that all provide analysis of the unconditional contributions and six that cover both conditional and unconditional pledges. The scenarios presented describe the following cases: \u2022 The baseline scenario reflects emission projections that assume no additional climate policies have been put in place from 2005 onwards. \u2022 The current policy trajectory scenario reflects the best estimates of global emissions taking into account currently adopted and implemented policies. \u2022 The Intended Nationally Determined Contribution describe how global", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "12a6aa6c-455f-4423-9cf5-b0f6898d8d45": {"__data__": {"id_": "12a6aa6c-455f-4423-9cf5-b0f6898d8d45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40ff62bc2cf2d96dccaf99afa5b836d813bc31d7af320c4c0b4c513585336ad7"}, "3": {"node_id": "00888f99-27e1-4488-8aed-3bfdfc7818f0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d4f73f58a9e5520eca2f140e6b48623a4926151746722dcd213bba027b6c92d4"}}, "hash": "3a180ccd56e4f53b8f672a343ba8299101bb245ec08a22e57d09d8e59d0f0137", "text": "greenhouse gas emissions might evolve under full implementation of two Intended Nationally Determined Contribution cases: \u00b0 Unconditional Intended Nationally Determined Contribution case: assuming full implementation of unconditional Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. \u00b0 Conditional Intended Nationally Determined Contribution case: assuming full implementation of both unconditional and conditional Intended Nationally Determined Contributions.

Comparing the unconditional Intended Nationally Determined Contribution scenario with the 1.5\u00b0C scenario would further increase the gap by three GtCO2e, as shown in figure ES2. If countries were to fully implement the conditional Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, the estimated global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 would be about 2.4 GtCO2e (range: 1.2\u22124.8) lower in 2030 compared to the unconditional Intended Nationally Determined Contribution scenario case. This leaves a gap in 2030 of 12 (range: 8\u201313) GtCO2e between the conditional Intended Nationally Determined Contribution scenario and the cost-optimal 2\u00b0C scenario. When comparing with the 1.5\u00b0C scenario, the gap would increase by an additional three GtCO2e. Interestingly, a number of countries have Intended Nationally Determined Contribution targets suggesting emission levels in 2030 above their estimated no-policy baseline or current policy scenario. These countries are, thus, assumed to overachieve on their Intended Nationally Determined Contribution targets, and the different model teams treat this issue in different ways, which adds an uncertainty of * For USA unconditional INDC is for 2025.

In summary, the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions represent a first start to initiate the required transition, but are far from being consistent with the agreed upon long-term temperature goals. The full implementation of the unconditional Intended Nationally Determined Contributions is consistent with staying below an increase in temperature of 3.2\u00b0C (median, range: 2.9\u20133.4\u00b0C) by 2100 relative to pre-industrial levels with greater than 66 per cent probability. This is lower than current policies, which imply staying below warming of 3.6\u00b0C (median, range: 3.4\u20133.7\u00b0C) by 2100 with greater than 66 per cent probability. Full implementation of the conditional Intended Nationally Determined Contributions would lower the temperature projections relative to the unconditional Intended Nationally Determined Contributions by about 0.2\u00b0C. Under the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution scenarios, the carbon dioxide budget estimated by the xix xix The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Executive summary Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for limiting warming to below 2\u00b0C with at least 66 per cent probability will be close to depleted by 2030, and the similar budget aligned with limiting warming to below 1.5\u00b0C with at least 50 per cent probability will already be well exceeded by 2030. Figure ES3 shows the cumulative carbon dioxide emissions implied by the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution scenarios. 8. Assessments of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions from individual G20 members show ambition, but also reveal that for some countries current policies are estimated to deliver greater reductions than the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. This indicates that there might be room for strengthening the ambition of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, noting that the analytical uncertainties are fairly large. Reflecting on the dominant share of global emissions coming from the G20 members, this year\u2019s Emissions Gap Report presents a more detailed assessment of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions from this group of countries. The calculation of the G20 members\u2019 median emission projections resulting from full implementation of the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution is based on the same data as the 2015 Emissions Gap Report, complemented with: a) the data from two new studies, and b) the estimates for the three G20 economies, Argentina, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, that were not included in the previous report. Results of this assessment are presented for all the individual countries and the European Union in figure ES4, noting that data is not available for all countries. The figure shows that for many countries the implementation of the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution would lead to lower emissions than the current policies scenario that is additional policies would have to be implemented to meet the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution. It is interesting to note that for some countries the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution is above the current policies scenario, indicating that it should be possible to enhance ambition quite easily. However, additional research is necessary because for many countries the uncertainty ranges overlap, and the number of studies for the current policies and Intended Nationally Determined Contribution cases vary significantly.

Non-state actor initiatives could likely reduce emissions in 2020 and 2030 with a few additional gigatonnes. It is difficult to assess the overlap with Intended Nationally Determined Contributions as these are often not detailed enough. State and non-state actions can both overlap and mutually reinforce each other.

During COP 20 in 2014, the Non-state Actor Zone for Climate Action was launched \u2013 an online platform to showcase non-state climate actions, both by individual and cooperative entities. It currently contains more than 11,000 commitments, mostly from individual actors. The Lima-Paris Action Agenda was also launched in 2014, by Peru, France, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat and the office of the United Nations Secretary General, and was given a prominent position during COP 21 to showcase the commitment of both state and non-state actors. These initiatives have now been integrated, for COP 22, as part of a new Global Climate Action Agenda to boost commitments and cooperative action between governments, cities, businesses, investors and citizens to cut emissions and help vulnerable nations adapt to climate impacts and build their own clean energy Figure 4.2: 4.2 Figure Figure 4.2a: Regional distribution of initiatives in percentage Figure 4.2b: Sectoral distribution of initiatives 5 3 4 Africa West Asia Asia and the Paci\ufb01c Global Latin America and the Caribbean North America Europe6 6 6 Figure 4.2c: Permanent secretariat Figure 4.2d: Regular reporting Figure 4.2e: Type of commitment Agriculture Buildings Cross-sectoral Energy Finance Forestry Industry Other Transport Urban 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 generic energy e\ufb03ciency renewable energy Note: Some initiatives cover more than one sector. 26 37 31 37 20 18 12 10 8 4 13 2 22 70 Figure ES5: Overview of sectoral distribution of 203 mitigation-focused International Cooperative Initiatives. and sustainable future. More emphasis is put on increasing transparency, tracking results and demonstrating credibility of non-state action. Some open questions remain, for example how can the international process best formally recognise, support, and catalyse non-state action? Equally important will be how non-state action relates to national governments\u2019 efforts to implement their Nationally Determined Contributions, and to the development of future Nationally Determined Contributions. National action and Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, on the one hand, and non-state actions, on the other, can reinforce each other and together create a virtuous cycle of increasing ambition. Many initiatives address issues like financing, technology deployment and capacity building that may have important indirect effects on emissions. They can go hand-in-hand with policies of national governments. In relation to the emissions gap, the interest is focused on the potential and actual contribution of actions by non-state actors to enhance global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A growing number of studies are available, estimating the potential contribution from actions by non-state actors to global efforts of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Figure ES6 illustrates the results from eight different studies. The data still has significant gaps concerning actual impacts, overlaps and relation with Intended Nationally Determined Contributions; the figure is, therefore, only indicative of information about the potential of non-state action. The arrows showing the emission reductions potential start at different levels, because the individual studies use different baselines, and the last three studies explicitly estimate the impact additional to Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. xxi xxi The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Executive summary The data indicates that the aggregated impact of the initiatives are in the order of a few GtCO2e in 2030 beyond the current Intended Nationally Determined Contributions that is potentially a significant contribution to closing the gap, if the initiatives reach their stated goals and if these reductions do not displace actions elsewhere. At the same time, many initiatives, in addition to their direct actions and contributions, provide political momentum and exercise pressure on governments to take further action. 10. Ambitious action on energy efficiency becomes more urgent given that the long- term objective in the Paris Agreement is more stringent. Well-documented opportunities exist to strengthen national policies and deliver deeper reductions through more effective delivery of energy efficiency policies. When examining the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, it is evident that 167 countries have included energy efficiency as one of their priority action areas. It is also important to note that despite generally declining fossil energy prices, global investments in energy efficiency increased by six per cent to US$221 billion in 2015, indicating that action is already happening. Energy efficiency has been included in earlier Emissions Gap Reports reflecting the significant potential for emission reductions. This year\u2019s report presents policies that have proven to accelerate energy efficiency gains in three key sectors: buildings, industry and transport (see figure ES7). About 40 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions are generated from direct energy use in these three sectors, while an additional 25 per cent are related to the power generation providing electricity to these end users.

Sector-specific estimates of emission reduction potentials are highly dependent on the underlying assumptions and approaches. Studies based on the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change show that for a cost range of between US$20 and 100 per tonne of carbon dioxide, the estimates of both direct and indirect emissions reduction potentials in 2030 are (in GtCO2e): 5.9 for buildings, 4.1 for industry and 2.1 for transport. The study notes that these estimates are conservative and the real potential in each sector is likely bigger. A more recent analysis by the International Energy Agency indicates that the cumulative direct and indirect emissions estimates to 2035 are (in GtCO2e): 30 for buildings, 22 for industry and 12 for transport. The two studies are not comparable due to basic differences in approaches, but, collectively, illustrate the significant potential in the three sectors. Beyond mitigation, improved energy efficiency also offers many other benefits like reduced air pollution and local employment. Energy efficiency is an integral part of Sustainable Development Goal seven, which aims to \u2018ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all\u2019. The energy efficiency target is to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030, from 1.3 per cent per year to 2.6 per cent. The achievement of this goal will be important for achieving many of the other goals. Figure ES6: Illustration of impact of initiatives by study.

(2016) xxii xxii The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Executive summary Many policy options exist in the three sectors; this assessment has focused on a small number of policies already implemented or under implementation in many countries where good results have been achieved. Not all mitigation options can be associated with individual sectors, and it is important to consider the wider energy system as an integration between different elements. For example, design of housing efficiency needs to be closely integrated with the selection of heating and cooling techno logies and lighting. While most emissions in cities originate from the building, industry and transport sectors, a sizeable share of these emissions could be avoided through city-level mitigation options, such as spatial planning, improving transit options, increasing and co-locating employment and residential densities, and increasing green spaces. More sustainable lifestyles, behaviours, cultures and consumption patterns are equally important to consider when designing policies \u2013 for example, for transport, building and appliance efficiency. While traditional policymaking has focused on technological and economic solutions, changes in energy behaviour are increasingly recognised as a key focus area when aiming for transformative action. 11. The Paris Agreement defines the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) on climate change. Making the right choices in implementing all goals will be crucial to achieving the Paris Agreement objectives and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in 2015, defines the international development agenda of the next 15 years. The 2030 Agenda expressly recognizes the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change as the authoritative body for defining the sustainable development goal thirteen on climate change, providing a direct link between the Paris Agreement and the goal on climate change. Climate action is not only a sustainable development goal in its own right; it also directly affects and is affected by efforts to achieve many of the other goals. In some cases, interactions between the different goals may be mutually reinforcing, or path-aligned, while in other cases they may be conflicting, or path-contingent. This means that strategic choices matter. Successful implementation of both the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Sustainable Development Goal agendas will, therefore, depend on the ability of national governments to develop and implement a set of national targets that serve both agendas, optimise benefits, exploit synergies, and reconcile trade-offs.

Encouragingly, the report additionally finds that achieving universal access to energy is compatible with emission reduction targets, as this is associated with low energy demands and, in most cases, best achieved through expansion and reliance on low-carbon distributed technologies. For the path-contingent goals, there is often general or even specific knowledge of how to overcome many of the challenges, as well as longstanding experience of particular policies and practices that can help to minimize trade-offs and maximize synergies between different interests. While it is too early to provide an assessment of the quantitative emissions implications of pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals, and vice versa, emerging results from integrated assessment models provide insights into the available \u201csolution space\u201d that allows for simultaneous achievement of multiple goals and targets. An emphasis on measures that reduce energy and other consumption demands generally benefits overall development concerns by freeing up the solution space for other goals, for example, food security and infrastructure.

Moreover, the Agreement accentuates the urgency of action and the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication. The Paris Agreement builds on the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted by countries in advance of COP 21 as requested in the Lima Call for Climate Action (UNFCCC, 2014). The 2015 Emissions Gap Report (UNEP, 2015) undertook a thorough assessment of the aggregate effect of the INDCs on global greenhouse gas emissions in 2025 and 2030, based on the INDCs submitted by 1 October 2015. It concluded that while the INDCs represent a real increase in ambition compared to global greenhouse gas emission levels resulting from a projection of current policies, the contributions are far from what is required for an emissions pathway consistent with staying below 2\u00b0C. More specifically, the 2015 Emissions Gap Report estimated that full implementation of both unconditional and conditional INDCs would imply an emissions gap of 12 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) in 2030 between what the INDCs contribute and the least-cost emission level for a pathway to stay below 2\u00b0C. This estimate is in line with the findings of the synthesis report of the aggregate effects of the INDCs by the UNFCCC (2015b). Recognising the need to bridge the significant gap between the ambition levels in the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) and the level of ambition required to meet the Paris Agreement goal of staying well below 2\u00b0C and pursuing a 1.5\u00b0C target, Article 4 of the Paris Agreement specifies that \u201cEach Party shall communicate a nationally determined contribution every five years\u201d (UNFCCC 2015a, p. 23) and, furthermore, that \u201cEach Party\u2019s successive nationally determined contribution will represent a progression beyond the Party\u2019s then current nationally determined contribution 1.1 The Emissions Gap Reports Since 2010, United Nations Environment (UNEP) has produced annual Emissions Gap Reports based on requests by countries for an independent scientific assessment of how actions and pledges by countries affect the global greenhouse gas emissions trend, and how this compares to emissions trajectories consistent with the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d402e012-8aec-490c-b48f-e33993bf89d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "d402e012-8aec-490c-b48f-e33993bf89d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a66dfdf072a1b0bd69402273b3c1e209e5d153584e3d70853c887c31fd8343b"}}, "hash": "3a66dfdf072a1b0bd69402273b3c1e209e5d153584e3d70853c887c31fd8343b", "text": "long-term goal of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The difference has become known as the emissions gap. In addition to estimating the emissions gap, the reports focus on key options for achieving the emissions reductions necessary to bridge the gap, and provide an assessment of how these can be accelerated and scaled up. Countries have found these emissions gap assessments useful in informing the political process. This seventh Emissions Gap Report is based on requests by countries for an update that focuses on some of the key issues emerging with the adoption of the Paris Agreement and its specific long-term temperature goal. 1.2 The context of the 2016 Emissions Gap Report The adoption of the Paris Agreement \u2013 the first agreement on climate change with universal contributions on mitigation \u2013 at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) to the UNFCCC has been called a landmark in international efforts to address climate change. The objective of the Paris Agreement of \u201cholding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\u201d (UNFCCC, 2015a, p. 22) translates directly into urgency of enhanced and immediate mitigation action. The Paris Agreement has been ratified with record speed and will enter into effect on 4 November 2016, 30 days after the threshold of more than 55 Parties, representing at least 55 per cent of global emissions, ratified or otherwise joined the agreement. This threshold was achieved on 5 October 2016. Lead authors: Anne Olhoff (UNEP DTU Partnership) and John Christensen (UNEP DTU Partnership) 2 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Introduction and reflect its highest possible ambition\u201d (UNFCCC 2015a, p. 22). The Agreement also decides to convene a facilitative dialogue among Parties in 2018, \u201cto take stock of the collective efforts of Parties in relation to progress towards the long-term goal\u2026and to inform the preparation of nationally determined contributions\u201d (UNFCCC 2015a, p. 4). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was invited to produce a special report by 2018 on the impacts of global warming of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways. The facilitative dialogue and special report by the IPCC means that 2018 presents important opportunities to strengthen the nationally determined contributions and the global mitigation ambition by 2020. Two recent events have provided additional momentum to the acceleration of global mitigation efforts. Under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, governments, with the support of industry, and civil society representatives have agreed in early October on a new global market-based Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, which will begin with a pilot phase from 2021 through 2023, followed by a first phase from 2024 through 2026. A few weeks later, the 197 governments meeting as parties to the Montreal Protocol reached an agreement on the so-called Kigali Amendment, under which developed countries will start to phase down the use of hydrofluorocarbons by 2019. Developing countries will follow with a freeze of consumption levels in 2024, with some countries freezing consumption in 2028. By the late 2040s, all countries are expected to consume no more than 15-20 per cent of their respective baselines. Studies on the impact of these agreements on emissions and future temperature increase are still scarce. However, early indications are that the contributions will be significant; although with the stipulated timeframes for implementation the short-term impacts on the 2030 emissions gap will be limited. The two agreements do, however, send strong signals on the willingness to take political action. 1.3 Aim, key questions, and approach of the report In line with previous reports, the objective of the 2016 Emissions Gap Report is to provide an up-to-date scientific assessment of the global progress towards the emissions reductions required to be on track to meet the long-term goal of the UNFCCC. In particular, this year the report emphasizes the implications of the Paris Agreement\u2019s strengthened goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels for immediate and longer-term mitigation action (Chapters 2 and 3). In line with previous years, the report assesses actions in selected areas that can contribute to bridging the emissions gap, and how these can be accelerated and scaled up. Previous reports have covered a wide range of areas, including agriculture, forestry, and renewable energy. The areas selected this year are non-state action (Chapter 4); energy efficiency (Chapter 5); and the nexus between the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e028fde-1ceb-4364-9c82-bc174fc2697b": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e028fde-1ceb-4364-9c82-bc174fc2697b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "16ae7ff4254604b79ed06ce6bdc292a82dbbd5c6f6bd41925e60ea40dd271dd8"}}, "hash": "16ae7ff4254604b79ed06ce6bdc292a82dbbd5c6f6bd41925e60ea40dd271dd8", "text": "Sustainable Development Goals and climate change mitigation (Chapter 6). Non-state action and energy efficiency have been examined in earlier reports, but increased political focus on these options and availability of new studies that provide better understanding of their large emissions reduction potential, in combination, provides a strong rationale for revisiting these options. The report asks four principal questions: 1. What is the current status of pre-2020 mitigation action? 2. What is the gap between the estimated level of global emissions in 2030 if the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions are fully implemented, and the range consistent with the well below 2oC or 1.5oC temperature goal? 3. What are the possible emissions reduction contributions of non-state action and increased energy efficiency, and how can action in these areas be accelerated to enhance the ambition of nationally determined contributions? 4. What do we know about the nexus between the Sustainable Development Goals and mitigation, and areas of alignment and conflict between the two? This year, the assessment is based on submissions of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions by almost all countries in the world, and more international studies now support the robustness of the Gap estimates. The conclusion is that the results remain within the ranges of the 2015 assessment, and that countries should not wait for further evidence but start to act immediately. As in previous years, the report adopts an assessment approach and has been prepared by a wide range of scientists from around the world. This year, 34 scientists from 18 institutions in 17 countries have contributed to the report. United Nations Environment hopes that this seventh edition of the Emissions Gap Report will help inform discussions at COP 22 and support the enhanced and accelerated mitigation ambition required to meet the goal of the Paris Agreement. 3 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Pre-2020 action: trends, progress and urgency Chapter 2 2.1 Introduction The strengthened language of the Paris Agreement of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre- industrial levels translates into a need for even stronger and more immediate mitigation action than previously assessed. This chapter looks into pre-2020 action, focusing on trends, progress and urgency. It provides an overview of the state of play of global emission trends and progress towards achieving the Cancun Pledges by G20 members as two key indicators of the level of pre-2020 action. Trends in current performance and progress are, furthermore, likely to influence the extent to which parties are positioned to implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and transition to the stringent least-cost emissions reduction trajectories after 2020, required to reach the temperature target of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The chapter presents an update, based on the latest available scientific literature, on the following critical topics: \u2022 Do emissions show signs of peaking? Section 2.2 gives an overview of current trends in total global emissions of greenhouse gases, and of energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuels and industry as a major driver of total greenhouse gas emissions. \u2022 Are G20 members on track to meet their Cancun Pledges? Section 2.3 provides an update of the 2015 assessment (UNEP, 2015), based on current policy portfolios of G20 members, and plausible assumptions regarding macroeconomic trends and offsets. \u2022 What are the implications for urgency of action? Based on the two preceding sections, Section 2.4 reiterates the urgency of immediately enhancing mitigation actions to facilitate a transition towards least-cost emission reduction trajectories after 2020 that are aligned with 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C targets. 2.2 Trends in current global emissions Total global greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase. In 2014, they reached approximately 52.7 gigatonnes CO2e (GtCO2e) (range: 47.9-57.51) (UNEP, 2015).2 Over the past decades the trend in global greenhouse gas emissions has been one of steady increase with small variations around this longer-term trend. Notably, global greenhouse gas emissions increased at a faster rate (2.2 per cent per year) during the period 2000 to 2010 than they did during the period 1970 to 2000, where the growth rate was 1.3 per cent per year (IPCC, 2014b). Considering the period from 2010, the emissions growth slowed to 1.8 per cent on average in 2012 to 2013, from a 3.5 per cent increase in 2010 and 2011 (JRC/PBL, 2014). Global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry3 are the major source of total global greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, they account for about 68 per cent of total global greenhouse gas emissions, and were estimated at a total of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa1449de-b5af-4b2c-a682-068dd9be9760": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa1449de-b5af-4b2c-a682-068dd9be9760", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "97cb661bc05b74679c128aaad9e4da9c21cd1027556d7d601fb042dc39d64a18"}, "3": {"node_id": "598d9a39-26b6-4523-9c9c-2e069e8ee3d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f948543a0c4667a9739564aec305efe6510334be5176976e5e177e0c18c84ca3"}}, "hash": "85cab18b7a8bfb415b890c5e48dd66442edeb917e62184fbff4c528e8ca422f4", "text": "36.2 GtCO2 for 2015 (range: 32.7-39.9) (Olivier et al., 1 90 per cent confidence interval based on the uncertainty range assessed in The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group III (IPCC, 2014b). 2 Data for this year is available from EDGAR and PRIMAP.

Three cases are considered: a pledge case, based on official data; a current policy trajectory case, based on official data; and a current policy trajectory case, based on independent analysis. These three cases are further described in box 2.1, while the findings are presented in table 2.1. 6 The members of the G20 are: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK, the United States of America (USA), and the European Union (EU). In our analysis, the EU including all its Member States (regardless of G20 status) is considered as a single Party, and EU Member States are not considered individually. In general, evaluating the pledges of other countries is limited by a lack of data. 7 In 2012, these parties accounted for 77 per cent of global emissions, excluding land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), and 75 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, including LULUCF (CAIT WRI, 2015). forthcoming).4 Given their share of total greenhouse gas emissions, it is relevant to look more closely at the trend in CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry. Figure 2.1 shows the development in global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry for the period 1970 to 2015. In 2015 global CO2 emissions stagnated for the first time and showed signs of a weak decline compared to 2014 (-0.1 per cent). This was preceded by a slowdown in the growth rate of CO2 emissions, from 2.0 per cent in 2013 to 1.1 per cent in 2014 (Olivier et al., forthcoming).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "598d9a39-26b6-4523-9c9c-2e069e8ee3d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "598d9a39-26b6-4523-9c9c-2e069e8ee3d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "97cb661bc05b74679c128aaad9e4da9c21cd1027556d7d601fb042dc39d64a18"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa1449de-b5af-4b2c-a682-068dd9be9760", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85cab18b7a8bfb415b890c5e48dd66442edeb917e62184fbff4c528e8ca422f4"}}, "hash": "f948543a0c4667a9739564aec305efe6510334be5176976e5e177e0c18c84ca3", "text": "These findings are in line with the studies of the Global Carbon Project on trends in global energy-related CO2 emissions (Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al., 2015; Jackson et al., 2016).5 Global CO2 emissions increased by roughly 1.3 per cent annually for the period 2012 to 2014, a pace significantly slower than that of the 12 preceding years, where the average annual increase was 2.9 per cent (2000-2011), but higher than the average annual growth rate of around 1 per cent during the 1990s. In summary, global greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow, and while there is an encouraging indication of a halting of the growth rate of global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry, it is still too early to say whether this is likely to be permanent. 4 These results are based on IEA (2016) statistics and preliminary estimates based on the latest BP statistics, including the recent", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90e5cb27-662b-41e4-944e-3653ec24c2f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "90e5cb27-662b-41e4-944e-3653ec24c2f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9eabf31eda130bf3b3b8ba3759e6d1864e571ff3196a2cc1fd00fa7a4bd440d1"}}, "hash": "9eabf31eda130bf3b3b8ba3759e6d1864e571ff3196a2cc1fd00fa7a4bd440d1", "text": "revision of coal statistics in China. 5 The changes in the growth rate of global CO2 emissions in 2015 compared to 2014 comprise very different growth rates and show differences amongst top CO2 emitters.

Pledge case (official data): Identifies the maximum level of greenhouse gas emissions that each country or Party could emit in 2020 and still meet its pledge \u2013 without considering the use of offsets. If a pledge is presented as a range (Australia, Brazil, China, India), the less ambitious end of the range is adopted as the official pledge estimate. If a country has both a conditional and an unconditional pledge (Indonesia), only the unconditional pledge is used. If a country has only a conditional pledge (Mexico, South Africa), the conditional pledge is used. For countries whose pledges are framed relative to a baseline scenario, it is assumed that baselines are not adjusted in the future. For countries whose pledges are framed as greenhouse gas intensity targets, economic growth consistent with official projections is assumed.8 Where available, the 2020 emission level described by the country or Party as the pledge level is used; alternatively, these levels are calculated working from official base-year or baseline data. 2. Current policy trajectory case (official data): Identifies official estimates of 2020 emissions, considering projected economic trends and current policy approaches, as identified by each modelling study cited in our analysis, including policies at least through 2012. 3. Current policy trajectory case (independent analysis): Similarly identifies estimates of 2020 emissions considering the best current estimates of projected economic trends and current policy approaches, but is based on independent analysis rather than official data. Figures are drawn from the Climate Action Tracker (CAT, 2015) and den Elzen et al. (2015) for all countries, as well as other country-specific sources, where noted. Current policy trajectory (independent analysis) supplements the official sources described in point two by providing data that aims for consistency across countries and political independence. Projections considering only a limited subset of sectors and gases, for example CO2 emissions from fossil fuels, are omitted, as they cannot be compared to projections and targets that include the full set of greenhouse gases across the entire economy.

Summary of progress of G20 members9 According to the assessment presented in table 2.1, six G20 members are on track to meet their Cancun Pledges according to the most available analyses. Four members are likely to require further action, to purchase offsets or use a combination of the two to meet their targets. For two 20 members there is currently insufficient information to assess whether they are on track to meet their pledges, 8 For China, the gross domestic product is assumed to reach 61.6 trillion yuan in 2020, consistent with China\u2019s National Communication (People\u2019s Republic of China, 2012). For India, the gross domestic product is assumed to reach 120.41 trillion rupees (2006\u20132007 rupee value) in 2020, consistent with the average of the scenarios presented in Planning Commission Government of India (2014). 9 This section builds on Section 2.3.2 of UNEP (2015). Updates are included where these are available. illustrating that better data is necessary to adequately track progress in some countries. For another member, no conclusion is drawn due to differing interpretations of what would constitute pledge attainment. The three remaining G20 members have no Cancun Pledges. Further details are provided below. As highlighted in box 2.2, three important caveats should be kept in mind when assessing country progress towards the Cancun Pledges.

All other sources use global warming potentials from IPCC (1995); the NCCS (2013) also uses a previous methodology. 15 Due to conflicting information, Australia is placed under the category \u201cG20 members for which no conclusion is drawn regarding Cancun Pledge alignment\u201d. 16 The INDC baseline is based on a revised national inventory that shows significantly lower 2010 emissions than those shown in the National Communication and assumed by other studies cited here. See BAPPENAS (2015) for a comparison of 2010 emissions. 8 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013Pre-2020 action: trends, progress and urgency 2015; den Elzen et al., 2015).19 The Republic of Korea has domestically abandoned the 2020 target by replacing it with the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) target in the amended Green Growth Act (The Law National Information Center, 2016). As of August 2016, the country\u2019s 2020 mitigation target submitted to the UNFCCC has not been withdrawn. G20 members for which no conclusion is drawn regarding pledge attainment Government and independent sources also find a gap between Australia\u2019s projected 2020 emissions and its target level for that year. In accordance with the Kyoto Protocol, Australia uses a carbon budget approach that accounts for cumulative emissions over the period of 2013 to 2020 in order to assess progress against its target. Australia\u2019s latest official projections (Department of Environment Australia, 2016) find that for the budget period, including carry-over from its first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, Australia is now on track to meet its Kyoto target. Insufficient information is currently available to determine whether Indonesia and South Africa are on track to meet their pledges. In the case of Indonesia, independent projections span a wide range, and official projections reflecting current policies are unavailable. The Ministry of Environment and Forestry Indonesia (2015) identifies baseline 2020 emissions as 2.95 GtCO2e, and the abatement necessary to achieve the unilateral 26 per cent reduction target as 0.767 GtCO2e. It further identifies a suite of mitigation activities both under and outside of Perpres No. 61/2011. A subset of these activities has reported abatement of 46.38 MtCO2e (of which 41.29 MtCO2e occurred under Perpres No. 61/2011) from 2010-2012, or an average of 15.46 MtCO2e per year.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f755724-d5ba-444e-aeee-fc2c7b168a90": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f755724-d5ba-444e-aeee-fc2c7b168a90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "624735cd198f113c3756628aaf242a242deca045a47b6c9a44fc9f468964aab2"}, "2": {"node_id": "daf593cf-c2b2-4d3e-917c-e36717d7fc05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d23f487b874cf45fdd7f6080dc25525e29b418878e233ba611eec436a8feee4"}}, "hash": "9992ea0ec0272773cab0435f5d701825f97da00ee7059f17dcf6b929f2ae0fe0", "text": "The remainder of the activities, however, have not reported their emissions reductions, nor have future emissions reductions been forecast.

In addition, Turkey has submitted a Biennial Report including its projected emissions for 2020 (Republic of Turkey Ministry of Environment and Urbanisation, 2016). 19 It has been reported that the 2020 target was abandoned domestically (Carbon Pulse, 2016), but to date there is no report that the Republic of Korea abandoned its pre-2020 Pledge made under the UNFCCC. 10111213141516 G20 members that are on track to meet their Cancun Pledges Three of the G20 parties \u2013 China, the EU, and India \u2013 are on track to meet their pledges without purchasing offsets, according to all available analyses. Three more \u2013 Brazil, Japan, and Russia \u2013 are on track, according to most estimates. China and India\u2019s pledges are framed in terms of greenhouse gas intensity reductions from 2005 levels, and several sources indicate that both countries are currently on track to achieve them. Studies indicate that China, which pledged a reduction of 40-45 per cent in emissions intensity, is on track to achieve a reduction of at least 42 per cent (CAT, 2015; PBL, 2015; Sha et al., 2015). India reports that it achieved a 12 per cent reduction in emissions intensity from 2005 to 2010 (Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change India, 2015), while Garg et al. (2014) show a 17 per cent reduction from 2005 to 2012 (out of a pledged reduction of 20\u201325 per cent from 2005 to 2020). The CAT (2015) and PBL (2015) show India on track for intensity reductions of 36 per cent and 28 per cent by 2020, respectively.17 Japan announced an adjustment to its pledge in November 2013 from a 25 per cent reduction on 1990 levels to a 3.8 per cent reduction on 2005 levels \u2013 similar to an increase of about 6 per cent on 1990 levels. There is no official current policy projections available, but CAT (2015) shows Japan on track to meet its revised pledge, whereas den Elzen et al. (2015) estimates a range in 2020 from slightly below to slightly above the pledge level. Japan\u2019s actual trajectory, however, will depend significantly on the respective roles of nuclear power and coal-fired power to meet future needs.18 G20 members that are likely to require further action or purchased offsets Canada, Mexico, and the United States are likely to require further action and/or purchase offsets in order to meet their pledges, according to government and independent estimates. Mexico\u2019s Cancun Pledge is conditional on the provision of adequate financial and technological support from developed countries as part of a global agreement (Government of Mexico, 2015). According to independent analysis, the Republic of Korea will also require further action to meet its pledge, but this cannot be verified based on publicly available official projections.

The cumulative impact of the progress of G20 members towards achieving their Cancun Pledges is not calculated, as there is limited information on the CO2 emission projections for the current policies scenario. However, as Chapter 3 shows, 2020 emissions under current global policy trajectories \u2013 which take progress by the G20 members into account \u2013 roughly align with those associated with implementation of the high end of the estimated 52\u201354 GtCO2e emissions range of the Cancun Pledges (UNEP, 2014). 2.4 Amplified urgency of enhanced pre-2020 action The strengthened long-term objective of the Paris Agreement amplifies the urgency of enhancing early mitigation action.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "367f8773-7b2b-42f5-9243-23e1282b22eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "367f8773-7b2b-42f5-9243-23e1282b22eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "479a17bf071ff44e34d149c9ee78b9afc7217dc1f1e642bf33df7472afd5c760"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf252d6c-bfc8-47f2-8b9c-179c15021d76", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05ede06f67e072346ac9d629082d7332c9d8979c2287a28ae5d308ea973d0150"}}, "hash": "4c3969a5cce08b285e0f0f380d2f8d334e92609ee49dc4b64dc99beb00f35919", "text": "Enhanced early action facilitates a transition to the stringent, long-term emission reductions required to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels (Rogelj et al., 2013; Clarke et al., 2014).

Total global greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, and although the growth in global CO2 emissions \u2013 a major contributor to total global greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 has shown encouraging signs of levelling out over the past two years, it is too soon to tell whether this is likely to be permanent. G20 member countries and states continue to make progress towards achieving their Cancun Pledges, but current trends indicate that, overall, the continuation of current levels of action is likely to result in total global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 that are in line with the weakest Cancun Pledge scenario considered in previous Emissions Gap Reports (see for example UNEP (2013)). The urgency of enhancing pre-2020 mitigation action is, thus, indisputable: \u2022 It bolsters the likelihood that countries meet and exceed their Cancun Pledges. \u2022 It provides a more solid foundation for implementing the Nationally Determined Contributions and for continuously strengthening their ambition. \u2022 It supports the transition towards a least-cost emissions reduction trajectory after 2020 that is consistent with the well below 2\u00b0C target. \u2022 It is likely the last chance to keep the option of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C in 2100 open, as all available scenarios consistent with the 1.5\u00b0C target imply that global greenhouse gas emissions peak before 2020. In addition to these critical aspects of pre-2020 action, enhanced early action (both pre-2020 and pre-2030) is associated with a number of other important outcomes and a wide range of additional economic, technological, societal, and climate outcome benefits. For example, enhanced early action will reduce climate risks and impacts. It will, furthermore, enable the realisation of near-term co-benefits of climate change mitigation, including health-related benefits associated with lower air pollution; improved energy security; and reduced crop yield losses. These, and other benefits and trade-offs between immediate and delayed mitigation action, have been assessed in detail in previous Emissions Gap Reports (UNEP, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015). Building on these, the most important implications of failing to respond to the increased urgency of early action include: \u2022 Delaying action implies that significantly higher rates of global emission reductions are required in the medium- and long-term to meet the well below 2\u00b0C target. The order of magnitude of these rates is without historic precedent. \u2022 Delaying action reduces the \u2018solution space\u2019 and options available to society to achieve stringent emission reductions. \u2022 Delaying action will result in greater lock-in of carbon- and energy-intensive infrastructure in the energy system and society, as a whole. It will also be a disincentive for near-term learning and technology development that will be essential in the long-term. \u2022 Delaying action translates into greater dependence on negative emissions technologies in the medium- term \u2013 technologies that so far are unproven on a larger scale. \u2022 Delaying action increases the costs of mitigation in the medium- and long-term, and implies greater risks of economic disruption. \u2022 Importantly, delaying action is associated with greater risks of failing to meet the well below 2\u00b0C target and is likely to be incompatible with meeting a 1.5\u00b0C target. 10 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 2030 trends and ambition 2030 trends and ambition Chapter 3 Lead authors: Michel den Elzen (PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency), Niklas H\u00f6hne (NewClimate Institute) and Joeri Rogelj (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis) Contributing authors: Taryn Fransen (World Resources Institute), Mark Roelfsema (PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency) and Sebastian Sterl (NewClimate Institute) 3.1 Introduction The Paris Agreement aims at limiting global average temperature increase to well below 2\u00b0C relative to pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to further limit global average temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C.

Therefore, all results in this report are accompanied by unambiguous descriptions of the quantitative temperature goals they inform, acknowledging that other interpretations are possible and valid. In line with last year\u2019s Emissions Gap Report (UNEP, 2015), the scenarios considered are least-cost pathways starting in 2020 that limit warming to below 2\u00b0C, with at least 66 per cent probability by 2100 (never resulting in a probability of below 60 per cent), and which return warming to below 1.5\u00b0C with at least 50 per cent probability by 2100, respectively (table 3.1). A large body of literature is available on pathways that limit warming to below 2\u00b0C with 66 per cent or higher probabilities. This has been covered extensively by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Clarke et al., 2014) and earlier Emissions Gap Reports. Summary statistics for least-cost pathways starting from 2020, in line with limiting warming to below 2\u00b0C with at least 66 per cent probability, are provided in table 3.1. The Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC also covered 1.5\u00b0C pathways to a limited extent (IPCC, 2014a; IPCC 2014b). These included least-cost pathways starting from 2010 in line with a 66 per cent probability of limiting warming to below 1.5\u00b0C in 2100.1 Currently, there are no scenarios available that assume least-cost pathways starting from 2020 that can return warming to below 1.5\u00b0C by 2100 with at least 66 per cent probability. Therefore, this report describes the characteristics of scenarios that assume least-cost pathways starting from 2020 and return warming to below 1.5\u00b0C in 2100 with a lower, 50 per cent probability. Following the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC, a dedicated review of the 1.5\u00b0C scenarios appeared in the literature (Rogelj et al., 2015), and other reports, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Synthesis Report on the Aggregate Effect of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) (UNFCCC, 2016e), have additionally provided more specific information about global emission pathways in line with 1 The IPCC reports that global CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions in these 1.5\u00b0C scenarios are reduced by 70-95 per cent and 110-120 per cent below 2010 levels in 2050 and 2100, respectively. CO2 equivalence in the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC was computed using 100-year Global Warming Potentials reported in the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC. CO2e emissions include all greenhouse gases and are derived from Integrated Assessment Model scenarios which also include consistent evolutions of radiatively active air pollutants. 11 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 2030 trends and ambition 1.5\u00b0C. Each of these publications draws upon scenarios published earlier (Luderer et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2013a; Rogelj et al., 2013b). More literature is forthcoming and will be assessed in the framework of a Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways by the IPCC. This report will be finalized by 2018, in time to inform the facilitative dialogue under the UNFCCC. Based, on the available literature, it is possible to identify four key characteristics of 1.5\u00b0C scenarios that start a least- cost pathway from 2020 and limit warming to below 1.5\u00b0C in 2100 with greater than 50 per cent probability. These are: (1) Immediate mitigation action: all available scenarios consistent with this definition, peak global greenhouse gas emissions around 2020. (2) The rapid up-scaling of the full portfolio of mitigation technologies: this includes widespread adoption of renewables, the phase-out of unabated fossil fuels, and the use of negative emissions technologies that allow for the active removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. (3) Development along a low-energy demand trajectory. (4) Temperature overshoot: almost all available scenarios consistent with this definition, temporarily exceed the 1.5\u00b0C limit during the 21st century. The issues of negative emissions and temperature overshoot are discussed in more detail in the following. A large proportion of the scenarios that limit warming to below 2\u00b0C, available in the literature, assume the use of so-called negative emissions technologies (Tavoni and Socolow, 2013; Williamson, 2013; UNEP, 2014; UNEP, 2015; Smith et al., 2016) \u2013 the active removal and permanent sequestration of CO2 from the atmosphere.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d89d9354-845a-4a96-8bd0-2cac35d3642d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d89d9354-845a-4a96-8bd0-2cac35d3642d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "84076a1a34872a96267bd4cce4efb3dea2b5fd50b0d3f2d9e4a3d868dc4657af"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f619741-21dc-447d-9f08-a4623da86c8d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2bfdfe2ad2469ac7872f7c413e93f07e664f8f335030ab8e09b7b71d8a8040df"}}, "hash": "a00b502303f050b81737367a8c2861776907528ed87f210fd38b2cf013a1a49e", "text": "This can be achieved, for example, through the combination of bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (Obersteiner et al., 2001).

For this to happen at the scale and rate required, global negative emissions are required. A large overshoot can be avoided through strong near-term action. Important challenges have been identified for negative emissions technologies (Smith et al., 2016) which have to be addressed, for example, the potential competition between biomass and food production over land and water (Bonsch et al., 2016). In most cases, the amounts of bio-energy assumed in scenarios limiting median warming to below 1.5\u00b0C in 2100 are within the assessed limits of estimated sustainable biomass production, that is, they do not impede on sufficient global food production (Creutzig et al., 2015; Bonsch et al., 2016). However, this can change over time, for example, if local climate impacts happen to be more severe than currently anticipated.

These studies focus on a 2\u00b0C temperature goal, but found that a limitation or absence of bio-energy with carbon capture and storage significantly limits the feasibility of keeping temperature rise to low levels. At the same time, hedging against a strong reliance on bio-energy with carbon capture and storage in the long-term is possible by reducing emissions more steeply in the very near-term, that is, over the coming 5 to 15 years. Further research that explores the trade-offs and synergies of negative emissions technologies in relation to limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C would be extremely valuable. Box 3.1: Integrated Assessment Models\u2019 strengths and opportunities. The IPCC defines Integrated Assessment as \u201ca method of analysis that combines results and models from the physical, biological, economic, and social sciences, and the interactions among these components in a consistent framework to evaluate the status and the consequences of environmental change and the policy responses to it\u201d (IPCC, 2014b). Integrated Assessment Models are the models used in such a scientific exercise. For the study of climate change mitigation scenarios, Integrated Assessment Models often include a representation of:", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa34823e-5895-4eed-acc9-81e4f6489887": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa34823e-5895-4eed-acc9-81e4f6489887", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "458c392d9b0bf8a4d597408d9c2f2cb3f015793b0ea6c2c09a8bc8485d95a0a1"}}, "hash": "458c392d9b0bf8a4d597408d9c2f2cb3f015793b0ea6c2c09a8bc8485d95a0a1", "text": "(1) the socioeconomic driving forces, (2) the level of climate change mitigation and, (3) the physics of the climate system to estimate the impact on global temperature rise. To systematically explore socioeconomic driving forces, the research community recently developed a set of five narratives that describe worlds with very differing adaptation and mitigation challenges. These are referred to as the \u201cShared Socioeconomic Pathways\u201d (O\u2019Neill et al., 2014; O\u2019Neill et al., 2015). Subsequently, these narratives are used to explore if and how stringent mitigation targets can be reached (Riahi et al., in Press). Most commonly, Integrated Assessment Models are used to create scenarios, which attempt to achieve global mitigation at minimum cost. Such \u201ccost-optimal\u201d (or \u201cleast-cost\u201d) scenarios let the model decide when (now, in a decade, or at the end of the century) and where (in which geographical region and/or in which sector) emissions are reduced. The model user can also add additional constraints regarding which mitigation technologies are available in the model. Ultimately, the model chooses between different alternatives based on their relative cost, and the social discount rate, which makes investing in the near-term more expensive than in the longer term. Integrated Assessment Models are powerful tools, which allow the assessment of trade-offs and synergies between various mitigation options. Importantly, Integrated Assessment Model scenarios provide the costs of reducing emissions, for example, the costs to transform the energy system or limit the emissions from land-use and land-use change. However, they typically do not cover the economic and social costs of avoided climate change impacts or side effects. Recent studies have shown that these benefits can be significant and easily outweigh the costs of reducing emissions (West et al., 2013). Furthermore, Integrated Assessment Model scenarios provide detailed technological transformation pathways that allow keeping emissions within a specific limit. Such transformation is often based on our understanding of transformations that took place in the past, like the transition of horse carriages to cars. However, Integrated Assessment Models typically do not contain much information on how to achieve the required pace of transformation in the future. Social science research can help to further understand the determinants and the key steps required to achieve a global low-carbon transition (Geels et al., 2016). 13 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 2030 trends and ambition 3.3 The 2030 emissions gap 3.3.1 Overview of scenarios To assess the impact of the INDCs2 on future global greenhouse gas emissions, global greenhouse gas emissions in 2025 and 2030 are compared under four scenarios (Rogelj et al., 2016). The assessment draws on multiple individual scenarios from the published literature. Each scenario is global in scope, reflecting possible actions from all countries. \u2022 The baseline scenario reflects emission projections that assume no additional climate policies are put in place from 2005 onwards. It is the medium projection estimate from around 180 baseline scenarios from the scenario database that accompanied the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC (Clarke et al., 2014). \u2022 The current policy trajectory scenario reflects the best estimates of the global emissions \u2013 taking currently adopted and implemented policies into account. Current policy trajectory scenarios assume that no additional mitigation action is taken beyond current climate policies \u2013 regardless of whether this results in 2020 Pledges not being achieved or being overachieved. Current policy trajectories reflect all adopted and implemented policies, which for the purpose of this report are defined as legislative decisions, executive orders, or their equivalent. This implies that publicly announced plans or strategies alone would not qualify, while individual executive orders to implement such plans or strategies would qualify. Ultimately, however, these definitions may be interpreted differently in the different underlying studies. This assessment is bound by the interpretations used by individual research groups. The current policy trajectory scenario is based on the current policies scenarios from four3 of the ten available global INDC analyses that provide such current policy trajectory scenarios, as detailed in table 3.2. \u2022 The INDC scenario portrays how global greenhouse gas emissions might evolve under full implementation of INDCs. It is sourced from ten global INDC analyses, which updates the work of UNEP (2015), and is described in more detail in Rogelj et al. (2016). The number of INDCs considered by the studies that were assessed here ranges from the 118 INDCs submitted by 1 October 2015 to the 160 INDCs submitted by 12 December 2015 (UNFCCC, 2015a) (table 3. 2). These 118 to 160 INDCs cover emissions from 145 to 187 out of 195 Parties to the UNFCCC, which in turn were responsible for roughly 88 to more than 96 per cent 2 INDCs were submitted before", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4bae450d-9180-442d-b42c-9b0f94e2bdce": {"__data__": {"id_": "4bae450d-9180-442d-b42c-9b0f94e2bdce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b33decc0bc78e86be1a15c4545109d073bf954648cc98cb28d6575622179a0b"}, "3": {"node_id": "43c5d757-d630-4637-b39f-8d7cf73e669c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3713b2f7093be590ba918b2470b0a74cb9d82894cea80517dfbb7be05e709d36"}}, "hash": "1722a053ad52eddda6ccd42fca200f731b3d365cbb4c197253df8abbeb8ef879", "text": "the Paris summit; under the Paris Agreement, future mitigation contributions will be referred to as National Determined Contributions (NDCs), without the \u2018Intended\u2019. 3 These four groups with current policy scenarios are: (i) the Climate Action Tracker by Climate Analytics, NewClimate Institute, Ecofys and Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research; (ii) International Energy Agency; (iii) Joint Research Centre; and (iv) PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency. The groups from London School of Economics and Danish Energy Agency also have current policy scenarios that are calibrated at the International Energy Agency current policies scenario. of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2012 (JRC/PBL, 2014). Here, the INDC scenario draws on individual INDC scenarios from the ten global analyses (table 3.2). The resulting composite INDC scenario comprises the median, 10th percentile, and 90th percentile global estimates for 2025 and 2030 from all of these sources. Compared to the previous Emissions Gap Report (UNEP, 2015), three new studies have been included (JRC, PNNL and the UNFCCC synthesis Report \u2013 see table 3.2), while global estimates of the official or independent country-specific sources have been excluded, since for many countries there was no data available. The official or independent country-specific sources are now only used for the national estimates (Section 3.4). The INDC scenario comprises unconditional and conditional INDC cases. As discussed in the 2015 Gap Report (UNEP, 2015), some countries place conditions on all or part of their INDCs. Of the INDCs submitted by 12 December 2015, roughly 45 per cent came with both conditional and unconditional components; about a third was conditional only and the remainder did not specify conditions (WRI, 2015). Consequently, two cases are explored in this assessment: unconditional INDCs and conditional INDCs. In the unconditional INDC case, Parties with INDCs are assumed to implement only those portions of their targets without conditions, while Parties that solely have a conditional target are assumed to follow a current policy trajectory. In the conditional INDC case, all Parties with INDCs are assumed to implement their conditional targets, and Parties that only have an unconditional target are assumed to implement that target. In both the unconditional and conditional INDC cases, it is assumed that for any traded international offsets, each unit is counted towards the INDC of a single country only \u2013 either the buyer or the seller.4 \u2022 The 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C scenario represent least-costs global scenarios consistent with a likely chance of limiting warming to below 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C above pre- industrial levels. The 2\u00b0C scenario comprises the subset of scenarios from the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC scenario database (Clarke et al., 2014) that: (i) have a greater than 66 per cent chance of keeping global temperature increase to below 2\u00b0C by 2100 compared to pre-industrial levels, (ii) are consistent with full implementation of 2020 Pledges that are anchored in the Cancun Agreement, and (iii) distribute emission reductions across regions, gases and sectors after 2020 in such a way that global mitigation costs of necessary reductions are minimised. The 1.5\u00b0C scenario data is selected from the literature and comprises scenarios which: (i) have a greater than 50 per cent chance of keeping 4 This is in line with the intention of countries not to double the count of offsets, which is consistent with the Paris Agreement. 14 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 2030 trends and ambition global temperature increase to below 1.5\u00b0C by 2100 compared to pre-industrial levels, (ii) have emissions in 2020 above 53 gigatonnes CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e) per year, and (iii) distribute emission reductions across regions, gases and sectors after 2020 in such a way that global mitigation costs of necessary reductions are minimised (Rogelj et al., 2015). The studies from which the current policy trajectory scenario and the INDC scenario are drawn differ in a number of ways, such as: conditional versus unconditional INDCs; assumptions regarding non-covered sectors and gases; treatment of land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) and surplus emission units; different bases for calculating Global Warming Potentials (table 3.2). The methodological differences between the groups cannot be fully harmonized, which leads to some uncertainty as indicated in the results presented in Section 3.4, where the implications of the differences between studies are also further explored.

Comparing these cost-optimal 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C scenarios to the unconditional INDC projections shows a large discrepancy. More specifically, there is a gap in 2030 of 14 GtCO2e (range: 10-16) between the unconditional INDC scenario and the 2oC scenario. Comparing the unconditional INDC scenario with the 1.5 C scenario further increases the gap by three GtCO2e, which is in the same order as found in UNFCCC (2016e). In comparison, if countries were to also fully implement the conditional INDCs, estimated global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 would end up about 2.4 GtCO2e (range: 1.2\u22124.8) lower in 2030 compared to the unconditional INDC scenario case. This leaves a gap in 2030 of 12 (8\u201313) GtCO2e between the conditional INDC scenario and the cost-optimal 2oC scenario. Comparing the conditional INDC scenario with the 1.5oC scenario increases the gap by three GtCO2e. For a number of countries, the INDC targets suggest emission levels above their estimated no-policy baseline or current policy scenario. These countries are, thus, expected to overachieve their INDC targets (see Section 3.4 for further details on G20 members). Different model teams treat these surpluses in different ways, which adds an uncertainty of one GtCO2e (range: 0-1) by 2030 to the estimated INDC and gap projections here. The gap calculations assume that there is no double counting of reductions. In other words, transferred reductions are only counted towards the achievement of one country\u2019s INDCs, not towards both the country buying and selling. However, as the Paris Agreement allows the possibility of voluntary use of \u201cinternationally transferred mitigation outcomes\u201d, it is possible that a system of trading offset credits will be developed and used. This could imply a risk of double counting, which could increase the global emissions by 2030 by 0.8 GtCO2e in the unconditional and conditional INDC case.6 3.3.3 The carbon budget implications of INDCs To give an indication of the carbon budget implications of the INDC scenarios, figure 3.2 shows the cumulative CO2 emissions implied by the INDC scenarios until 2030. Figure 3.2 shows that under the INDC scenarios, the IPCC CO2 budget for limiting warming to below 2\u00b0C with at least 66 per cent probability will be close to depleted by 2030, and the IPCC CO2 budget in line with limiting warming to below 1.5\u00b0C with at least 50 per cent probability will already be well exceeded by 2030. The figure also illustrates the limited CO2 budget 5 The gap numbers and ranges in the text are rounded to the nearest gigatonne. 6 Consistent with the earlier analysis of double counting in the UNEP 2014 Emissions Gap Report, for the INDC cases it is assumed that international emission offsets could account for 33 per cent of the difference between current policies trajectory and emission levels for the INDC cases by 2030 for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. This is an arbitrary, conservative estimate, as many Parties have yet to specify any limits to the use of transferable units. implications of the INDC scenarios compared to the current policy scenario. If the CO2 budget is exceeded, negative emissions at a global scale are required to capture the excess CO2. As highlighted in Section 3.2, limitations or absence of negative emissions technologies would significantly limit the feasibility of keeping temperature rise to low levels in 2100. Steep emission reductions would be required over the coming 5 to 15 years to hedge against a strong reliance on negative emissions technologies later in this century. 3.3.4 The global temperature effect of INDCs Estimates of what level of temperature increase the implementation of the INDCs would result in depends on the assumptions made about what happens after 2030, and the probability assigned to the temperature increase.

The projections of the latter two indicators are influenced by many factors. For example, economic and population growth will generally result in an increase in emissions, while energy intensity improvements in the global economy and reductions of carbon intensity in energy production will generally result in a decrease in emissions. The population and the gross domestic product projections are based on the medium UN population scenario and the International Energy Agency World Energy Outlook Report 2014 (IEA, 2014) -- if available for the selected countries -- and the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways database (scenario SSP2) (Dellink et al., 2016), which is consistent with the current policies scenarios. Figure 3.4a illustrates the change in emissions by 2030 compared to different historical years -- 1990 and 2010, the most recent year for which comprehensive data is available. It indicates that the various countries have had different phases of rapid emissions increase. Figure 3.4b illustrates the wide range of likely per capita emissions in 2030. It also illustrates a general trend that countries starting from a lower base level in 2010 tend to increase more by 2030. Figure 3.4c shows the emissions intensity of the economies. This is useful as an indicator of the extent to which INDCs lead to a convergence in emissions intensity among countries, and to a decoupling of economic growth and emissions. As figure 3.4b shows, emissions per capita are projected to decline between 2010 and 2030 in all G20 economies except Argentina, China, India, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, as a result of the implementation of unconditional INDCs.

Due to the path- dependence of technology and the risk of lock-in, the earlier these targets are enhanced, the easier and less costly it will be to achieve them. The more ambitious early mitigation is, the less the world will have to rely on socially contested negative emissions technologies and high-cost emission reduction options in the future. The estimates of the emission levels that would be realised under full implementation of the INDCs have not changed significantly compared to last year\u2019s report. Countries show wide differences in the need to implement additional policies to meet their INDCs. In general, differences of per capita emissions and emission intensity narrow (with some exceptions), but these levels are still well above the global average level needed to be compatible with a 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C temperature target. However, a number of recent studies attempt this task using a range of different effort-sharing allocations according to different equity principles (Climate Action Tracker, 2015; Climate Equity Reference Project, 2015; Meinshausen et al., 2015; Hof et al., 2016). These include studies that explicitly draw on the data from the IPCC effort-sharing allocation database (H\u00f6hne et al., 2014), which comprises data from many effort-sharing studies reviewed for the IPCC. 3.5 Summary of findings The decisions of the Paris Agreement on \u201cwell below 2\u00b0C\u201d and \u201cpursuing efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C\u201d requires a redefinition of the emissions gap. Moving from 2\u00b0C to 1.5\u00b0C increases the gap by around three GtCO2e in 2030 with significantly more stringent emissions reductions required afterwards. INDCs are a first start to initiate this required transition, but are still far from being in line with the agreed long-term goals. Ambition of the existing INDCs, with target years through 2030, would have to be increased. Continuing on the emissions trajectory implied by the current INDCs would mean that the budget for 1.5\u00b0C is already overspent by 2030, 23 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Bridging the gap \u2013 the role of non-state action Bridging the gap \u2013 the role of non-state action Chapter 4 Lead authors: Niklas H\u00f6hne (NewClimate Institute) and Philip Drost (United Nations Environment Programme) Contributing authors: Fatemeh Bakhtiari (UNEP DTU Partnership), Sander Chan (German Development Institute), Ann Gardiner (Ecofys), Thomas Hale (University of Oxford - Blavatnik School of Government), Angel Hsu (Yale University - Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies), Takeshi Kuramochi (NewClimate Institute), Daniel Puig (UNEP DTU Partnership), Mark Roelfsema (PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency) and Sebastian Sterl (NewClimate Institute) 4.1 Introduction Global climate change governance is becoming increasingly diverse, with many actors, other than national governments, undertaking climate change management actions.

(Andonova et al., 2009; Bulkeley et al., 2012; Bulkeley et al., 2014).2 While they unarguably played a key role in putting climate change issues firmly on the international agenda, their place within the international climate regime has long been limited to roles as observers and lobbyists.3 Over the years, the role of non-state actors in international climate change negotiations has shifted towards a more structural, long-term engagement. 4.2.1 Non-state actor actions in recent years Early efforts include the Momentum for Change campaign by the UNFCCC secretariat, to \u201cshine a light on the enormous groundswell of activities underway across the globe that are moving the world toward a highly resilient, low-carbon future\u201d (UNFCCC, 2016c).4 The Peruvian government, in collaboration with the UNFCCC secretariat, launched the Non-State Actor Zone for Climate Action, an online platform to showcase non-state commitments, both by individual and cooperative entities. The Non-State Actor Zone for Climate Action provides the broadest overview of non-state and subnational climate action to date, and includes data from multiple partner organisations (UNEP, 2015).5 2 These efforts go back at least 25 years, with the launch of the Rainforest Alliance in 1980, and fall under the broader pattern of international governance schemes, which emerged in the mid-1970s, partly as a result of the increasing globalisation spurred by the liberalisation of international financial markets. 3 In some instances, representatives from non-state actor initiatives have joined a UNFCCC party delegation team. This may have helped raise awareness among UNFCCC Parties about the breadth of actions undertaken by non-state actors. 4 Additional information about the campaign is available online at: http:// unfccc.int/secretariat/momentum_for_change/items/6214.php [Accessed 11 October 2016] 5 The Non-State Actor Zone for Climate Action database is available online at: http://climateaction.unfccc.int/ [Accessed 11 October 2016] 24 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Bridging the gap \u2013 the role of non-state action The so-called Technical Examination Process on Mitigation, a multi-stakeholder forum within the UNFCCC negotiation process, was started in 2014 and expert meetings have been organized around specific themes such as transport, renewable energy and land use. Relevant non-state actors are engaged in the process.6 At the UNFCCC COP 20 in Peru, the host government, the government of France (as host of the 2015 conference), the UNFCCC secretariat, and the office of the UN Secretary- General launched the Lima-Paris Action Agenda.7 Focusing on 12 thematic areas, the Agenda seeks to: (i) mobilize \u201crobust global action towards low carbon and resilient societies\u201d, (ii) provide \u201cenhanced support to existing initiatives\u201d, and (iii) mobilize \u201cnew partners\u201d and provide \u201ca platform for the visibility of their actions\u201d (UNFCCC, 2016b). France declared the Lima-Paris Action Agenda to be the \u2018fourth pillar\u2019 of the Paris climate conference, together with a universal legal agreement, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) from UNFCCC Parties, and finance and technology.8 4.2.2 The Paris outcomes and beyond There is little doubt that the growing engagement of non- state actors has contributed to the successful conclusion of the Paris Agreement (Jacobs, 2016).9 Section IV of the decision that accompanies the Paris Agreement (decision 1/ CP.21) illustrates the growing institutionalisation of non-state actor engagement within the climate regime. Addressing pre-2020 action, the decision introduces changes on previous ad hoc mobilization efforts, with a view to ensuring a more structured engagement (UNFCCC, 2016h). The main changes are: \u2022 The Non-State Actor Zone for Climate Action platform is anchored in the decision (paragraph 117). \u2022 High-level events for state and non-state climate action until 2020 are expected to further ensure the visibility and recognition at the highest level of non-state climate actions (paragraph 121). \u2022 The Technical Examination Process on mitigation is maintained (paragraph 109), with a view to broadening the interface between state and non-state actors within the UNFCCC process.10 \u2022 UNFCCC Parties and non-party stakeholders are encouraged to continue catalysing efforts to strengthen climate change action (paragraph 118). 6 Additional information about the forum is available online at: http://unfccc.", "start_char_idx": null,

2009, the [international climate change] regime has been shifting from a \u201cregulatory\u201d model of binding, negotiated emissions targets to a \u201ccatalytic and facilitative\u201d model that seeks to create conditions under which actors progressively reduce their emissions through coordinated policy shifts.\u201d He further suggests that \u201cthe December 2015 Paris Agreement and related

(paragraph 121). Building on the above decision, and drawing on the multiplicity of previous efforts it echoes, a Global Climate Action Agenda was launched in May 2016.11 The Global Climate Action Agenda has two priorities:12 \u2022 Engage with interested parties and non-party stakeholders, including furthering the voluntary initiatives of the Lima-Paris Action Agenda. \u2022 Provide guidance to the UNFCCC secretariat on the organisation of technical expert meetings focused on specific policies, practices and actions, and coordinate annual high-level events. The process around COP 21 has brought a much higher level of recognition than before to the role of non-state actors\u2019 in the intergovernmental climate change process. However, many open questions remain related to how the international process can best recognise, support, and catalyse non-state actor actions. Furthermore, how do non-state actor actions relate to national governments\u2019 efforts to implement their NDCs, and to the development of future NDCs? Regarding the latter question, it has been argued that some kind of formal coordination mechanism could be implemented (Betsill et al., 2015). 4.3 Overview of initiatives Non-state climate action comes in many forms. One category that has attracted particular attention is the so-called International Cooperative Initiatives (ICIs). The reason is that the high number of participants in ICIs can lead to a considerable emission reduction impact. There is no single definition of what constitutes an ICI.13 What is clear, however, is that over the past two decades the number of ICIs has grown significantly, and has experienced a renewed impetus ahead of COP 21.14 11 The Road Map for Global Climate Action is available online at: http:// newsroom.unfccc.int/media/658505/high-level-champions-climate-action- roadmap.pdf [Accessed 11 October 2016] 12 The climate change champions will present a report of their work at the 2016 Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC. 13 Most often, ICIs are characterised as initiatives outside the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change aimed at reducing emissions of climate forcers by, for example, promoting actions that are less GHG intensive, compared to prevailing alternatives. Cooperative initiatives also involve national and sub-national partners. 14 Note, for example, that between September 2014 and December 2015, the number of local government signatories to the Compact of Mayors increased from 228 to 428 (and up to 568 when this report went to press). Similarly, between May 2015 and December 2015, more than 400 investors, representing US$25 trillion in assets, joined the Investor Platform for Climate Action. 25 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Bridging the gap \u2013 the role of non-state action Table 4.1: Overview of features of 203 mitigation-focussed ICIs. Features Observed trends Sectoral focus Some initiatives (37) focus on more than one sector. For single-sector ICIs, the dominant sectors are transport (31), agriculture (22), and energy (20). Geographic scope Most initiatives (163) are global in scope. By region, the number of ICIs is highest in Europe (15), and Asia and the Pacific (14), and lowest in West Asia (7), and Latin America and the Caribbean (6). Permanent secretariat Most initiatives (178) have a permanent secretariat. In many instances the secretariat is hosted by a related, larger organisation. Regular reporting15 The extent to which initiatives report regularly on their activities is unclear in half (102) of the initiatives. Regular reporting occurs in 73 instances (and irregular reporting in 28). Type of commitment Only some initiatives (61) have quantitative commitments. Twice as many (128) have qualitative commitments. The nature of the commitment is unclear in all other instances (14). Type of activities16 Climate Initiatives Platform registers three types of activities: technical dialogue, political dialogue, and implementation. Many initiatives conduct more than one such activity. Implementation is the most common activity (125), followed by technical dialogue (109), and political dialogue (49).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77411855-fcf7-47e0-b3b7-50218610f177": {"__data__": {"id_": "77411855-fcf7-47e0-b3b7-50218610f177", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf22d3f292b6eb65f6a7fe64324727857849fa6a762e5538652e0a68e2bf5e62"}, "2": {"node_id": "66a0aaef-7693-4221-bcdf-720f0d16056d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7961a12548e8bb435ce3ac520eb4f4d4100010d5806d7b0332b59f4d707318ea"}}, "hash": "36499b5da90d57461a90e3d82a3ad305eb3960a0f676ef17acdf0a870f8bd7f3", "text": "Type of membership Industry is involved in over half (112) of the initiatives, followed by intergovernmental organisations (94), national-level government agencies (91), non-governmental organisations (78), subnational-level government agencies (51), and academia (37).

The Non-State Actor Zone for Climate Action platform currently records over 11,000 climate commitments, mostly from individual cities, regions and companies, but also from investors, civil society organisations, and cooperative initiatives. A number of databases collect information on ICIs. Because definitions vary, the various databases record very different numbers of entries.17 On the basis of their own set of criteria 15 Regular reporting refers to planned reporting, irrespective of its periodicity 16 Implementation refers to actions that directly lead to emission reductions (as opposed to the indirect impact on emissions that technical or political dialogues are expected to have). 17 The purpose of the database and the level of effort devoted to keeping it up- to-date are further reasons why the number of entries differ. which an ICI database should meet, Widerberg and Stripple (2016) identified and reviewed five such databases.18+19 These are: the Non-state Action Zone for Climate Action, the Climate Initiatives Platform,20 the Portal on Cooperative 18 The criteria used by Widerberg and Stripple require that the database: (i) collects information on ICIs and their participants, (ii) focus on transnational initiatives, and (iii) focus on initiatives that have climate change mitigation as their main focus (Widerberg and Stripple, 2016). 19 The databases were created for different purposes and, therefore, differ in their criteria for including a specific initiative. For example, the Non-state Action Zone for Climate Action database intends to showcase the breadth of non-state actor actions, whereas the Transnational Climate Change Governance database was created for academic purposes, to analyse a well- defined, small selection of initiatives. The Global Aggregator for Climate Actions serves a dual, political and academic purpose. 20 The Climate Initiatives Platform database is available online at: http:// climateinitiativesplatform.org/index.php/Welcome [Accessed 11 October 2016] 26 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Bridging the gap \u2013 the role of non-state action Figure 4.2: 4.2 Figure Figure 4.2a: Regional distribution of initiatives in percentage Figure 4.2b: Sectoral distribution of initiatives 5 3 4 Africa West Asia Asia and the Paci\ufb01c Global Latin America and the Caribbean North America Europe6 6 6 Figure 4.2c: Permanent secretariat Figure 4.2d: Regular reporting Figure 4.2e: Type of commitment Agriculture Buildings Cross-sectoral Energy Finance Forestry Industry Other Transport Urban 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 generic energy e\ufb03ciency renewable energy Note: Some initiatives cover more than one sector. 26 37 31 37 20 18 12 10 8 4 13 2 22 73 178 25 28 102 yes quantitative Non-speci\ufb01c qualitative yes no no unclear 128 61 14 70 Figure 4.2: Overview of features of 203 mitigation-focused ICIs. 27 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Bridging the gap \u2013 the role of non-state action Initiatives,21 initiatives collected in the context of the Transnational Climate Change Governance22 project, and the Global Aggregator for Climate Actions23.

Some of the initiatives that report regularly on their activities entail industry-only partnerships of European or global reach, in which members impose reporting duties on themselves. In these partnerships, reporting is seldom verified by a third party.29 A small number of the initiatives that report regularly on their activities are long-established efforts that were created with a very specific purpose, climate change mitigation only being an ancillary benefit of the activity. Typically, they are organisations with well-developed governance mechanisms, which require regular reporting beyond financial reporting.30 4.4 Estimated emission reductions of non-state actor actions A growing number of analyses are available, which seek to estimate the potential and actual contribution of non-state actor action to the global effort of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the evidence base remains fragmented, as outlined in this section. National action, Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) and non-state actions may reinforce each other and, together, create a virtuous cycle of raising ambition. Many initiatives address issues like financing, technology deployment, and capacity building, which may have important indirect effects on emissions. However, for analysing the overall global impact it is important to analyse the ambition level of both actions to 29 Examples include the Airport Accreditation initiative and the Ultra-Low CO2 Steelmaking initiative. 30 Examples include the Forest Stewardship Council and the Global Reporting Initiative.

While doing so is analytically challenging, a number of studies have made some inroads (see, for example, H\u00f6hne et al., 2015; Graichen et al., 2016).31 Tables 4.2 and 4.3 and figure 4.3 provide overviews of the estimates available. The studies vary significantly in scope, in particular which kind of impact they analyse. We identified several categories of impact, but studies are not always clear about which impact they estimate: Individual commitments: Reductions that would occur if all participants of the initiatives (individual companies, cities, etcetera) fulfil their individually set targets. Initiatives\u2019 goals: Reductions that would occur if the initiatives achieve their stated collective goals (in terms of participants of companies and cities). 31 Analyses of the actual performance of non-state actor actions (as opposed to simply analysing the targets, in the assumption that they will be met) are emerging, but remain limited in number (see, for example, Khan and Sovacool, 2016).

Studies on the actual performance of non-state actors in meeting their voluntarily set targets (not only analysing the targets themselves) are emerging, but are very limited in number (for example Khan and Sovacool, 2016). Moreover, to the authors\u2019 knowledge, additional reductions that can potentially be delivered by initiatives through supporting measures by national governments have not been studied to date. The compilation of available studies shows: \u2022 Aggregated impact of individual non-state action, initiatives, and national efforts cannot yet be estimated with precision. More studies are available compared to last year, in particular on cities, but large data gaps remain as not all sectors are sufficiently studied, and the overlaps and relation with INDCs are still unclear. Key data shortcomings include: \u00b0 While emissions reductions are published, assumptions about greenhouse gas emission baseline scenarios are often missing, as are Figure 4.3: Illustration of impact of initiatives by study. Note: The arrows showing the emission reductions potential start at different levels because the individual studies use different baselines (the last three studies explicitly estimate the impact additional to INDCs). 30 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Bridging the gap \u2013 the role of energy efficiency the baseline scenario projections. This makes comparisons across studies challenging. \u00b0 All studies assume full implementation. This assumption leads to overestimates, if full implementation is not achieved (Khan and Sovacool, 2016). It follows that transparent data on implementation levels, and the capacity to verify the data, are needed (IVM and FORES, 2015). \u2022 The evidence available suggests that both activity levels and actual emission reductions are increasing. This trend is especially marked in the area of cities, and ambitious plans of company initiatives are also emerging. \u2022 The limited evidence available indicates that the aggregated impact of the initiatives to closing the emissions gap can be in the order of a few gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (GtCO2e) in 2030. This would represent a major contribution, if the initiatives reach their stated goals and the emission reductions do not displace actions elsewhere. 4.5 Issues for the future This section summarises a number of issues where additional research is needed. 4.5.1 Integrate state and non-state action To capture the full impact of non-state actor action, and to maximise complementarity action, national governments should take into account the potential impact of non-state actor actions and initiatives. This would help national governments obtain a better understanding of the size of the mitigation opportunities, while promoting heightened ambition and capacity to realise those opportunities.32 In areas where state and non-state actions overlap, non-state actor actions may be able to \u201creinforce, implement, and give credibility to the national pledges\u201d (Hale, 2016, p. 20). The reverse may also be true: non-state actor actions could benefit from enhanced national government support \u2013 for example through the removal of barriers, and supportive legislation.33 32 Not least, non-state actor actions can also serve as important vehicles for policy experimentation and knowledge diffusion. 33 Development of guidance is underway, to help governments and initiatives engage with each other more effectively (see, for example, the Initiative for Climate Action Transparency, available online at: http://www. climateactiontransparency.org/ [Accessed 11 October 2016]). 4.5.2 Increase data on non-state action, in particular on targets and impact More data and analysis are needed to fully understand the scope of non-state actions. More and better greenhouse gas and energy-use inventories for cities, companies and other non-state actors would be especially useful.34 A clearer definition of the goals and targets of the initiatives is needed, ideally indicating levels of ambition and additionality in relation to other actions. Less than a third of the initiatives have quantitative targets. Analysing the emission reductions potential of initiatives that only have qualitative commitments is even more challenging.35 The Global Climate Action Agenda calls on non-state actor initiatives to set targets that are consistent with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement, and to achieve the commitments they make.36 Monitoring, reporting and verification procedures are instrumental in this process, but they vary widely among initiatives. Only a small, but increasing, number of initiatives evaluate their impact.37 One-third of the initiatives registered in the Climate Initiatives Platform regularly report on progress toward meeting their goals and targets. For most of the initiatives, the extent to which regular reporting of implementation occurs is unclear.38 Nonetheless, the trend appears to be a positive one, and some non-state actor actions apply what could be qualified as good practice in reporting.39 4.5.3 Further issues Studies of the lessons learned from the initiatives are scarce (see,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77a06b13-ed07-4134-b938-3176fa92a49a": {"__data__": {"id_": "77a06b13-ed07-4134-b938-3176fa92a49a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae742dbafaafee25ba37e6040532150dc03ad59df5f8e944134b410304037932"}, "3": {"node_id": "c538c851-9cd8-46d1-8078-58ccd506168c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c53229e7f73940d6c814bfc89131df816e9b8f2e8f4a53aa085946045ee9aefd"}}, "hash": "df72ccd82c20b2879e2fa952f601635d6f70fa1ffb7860810c70688d0edbd9ce", "text": "for example, CISL and Ecofys, 2015). Both new and existing initiatives could benefit from this kind of analysis in the formulation of commitments and the establishment of effective governance structures. Further research is needed to understand the reasons behind the geographic imbalance in non-state action leadership. At present, the focus is on short-term mitigation potentials. Chan et al. (2016) emphasize the importance of smaller-scale innovative solutions that \u2013 initially \u2013 may only offer limited mitigation potential, but have large mitigation potential in the longer term \u2013 that is, 2050 and beyond. 34 The Global Reporting Initiative has made some headway toward achieving this. 35 It is worth noting that the emission reductions potential of non-state actor actions with qualitative commitments may, in principle, be large. 36 Additional information about the Global Climate Action Agenda is available online at: http://newsroom.unfccc.int/climate-action/global-climate-action- agenda/ [Accessed 11 October 2016] 37 It is worth noting that such evaluations are challenging to undertake, particularly in the case of initiatives involving multiple diffuse sources of emissions. 38 It is worth noting that what constitutes \u2018good reporting practice\u2019 may be very different from one sector to another. 39 For example, Graichen et al. (2016) find that the Bonn Challenge, the New York Declaration on Forests and RE100, among others, follow above-average reporting practices. They provide detailed descriptions of the initiatives, and the members\u2019 activities and targets, in addition to preparing their own estimate of impact, and making available reporting guidance for potential new members. 31 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Bridging the gap \u2013 the role of energy efficiency Bridging the gap \u2013 the role of energy efficiency Chapter 5 Lead Authors (alphabetical): Subash Dhar (UNEP DTU Partnership), Timothy Clifford Farrell (UNEP DTU Partnership), Rana Ghoneim (United Na- tions Industrial Development Organization) and Diana Urge-Vorsatz (Central European University) Contributing authors (alphabetical): Elisabeth Boles (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Benigna Boza-Kiss (Central European University), Marco Matteini (United Nations Industrial Development Organization), Jyoti Painuly (UNEP DTU Partnership), Minal Pathak (CEPT University), Ksenia Petrichenko (UNEP DTU Partnership), Bettina Schreck (United Nations Industrial Development Organization) and PR Shukla (Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad) 5.1 Introduction Improving energy efficiency is essential to meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement and is a greenhouse gas mitigation option offering many economy-wide benefits (IEA, 2014; IPCC, 2014; von Stechow et. al., 2015). Out of the 189 countries that submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), 168 countries included energy efficiency as one of their priorities (Fenhann, 2016). Countries that already have strong energy efficiency policies can testify to the multiple benefits, including improved air quality, increased social welfare, competitiveness and the creation of jobs (IEA, 2014; Puig and Farrell, 2015). Investments in energy efficiency have shown a positive net return for governments, businesses and households. Importantly, end-use energy efficiency investments release upstream cost reductions in power supply systems, with examples of: 300 per cent return on investments from national benefits in appliance standards and labelling programmes (4E, 2016); electricity companies achieving 240 per cent return on customer energy efficiency investments from reduced upstream costs in generation, transmission and peak supply costs (IEA, 2014). Despite falling global oil, gas and coal energy prices, global investments in energy efficiency increased by six per cent to US$221 billion between 2014 and 2015 (IEA, 2016a). If access to credit and bond markets is increased, and transaction costs are lowered, even more investment will be mobilized, especially if the climate benefits can also be capitalized upon in the investments, such as through climate financing or internalized cost of carbon (for example, reinvested carbon taxes). Energy efficiency policies struggle to work effectively against a context of energy price subsidies, as low energy prices undermine the essential economics of energy efficiency. Global fossil fuel subsidies were estimated at US$490 billion in 2014 (IEA, 2015a), with a growing number of countries committing to reforming these subsidies. Some countries with direct or indirect energy subsidies should explore options to shifting subsidies from energy supply to end-use services.

Sector-specific estimates of emission reduction potentials are highly dependent on the underlying assumptions and approaches. Therefore, studies often result in different estimates of the potentials offered by energy efficiency options. Numbers from two studies have been included to illustrate the scale of the possible reductions for each sector. The Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) shows that for a cost range of between US$20 and 100 per tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2), the estimates of both direct and indirect emissions reduction potentials in 2030 are (in GtCO2e) 5.9 for buildings, 4.1 for industry and 2.1 for transport (\u00dcrge-Vorsatz and Novikova, 2008). The authors note that these estimates are conservative and the real potential in each sector is likely bigger. A more recent analysis in the World Energy Outlook\u2019s (IEA, 2012) 32 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Bridging the gap \u2013 the role of energy efficiency efficient world scenario1 indicates that the cumulative direct and indirect emissions estimates in 2035 are (in GtCO2e) 30 for buildings, 22 for industry and 12 for transport. The two studies are not comparable due to basic differences in approaches, but collectively illustrate the significant potential in the three sectors. Efficiency gains are evidently also possible in the energy supply sector with, for example, more efficient generators, transmission, and distribution systems. This chapter does, however, focus on end-use efficiency because emissions reductions are generally more cost-effective for demand-side investments. The chapter first assesses experience with key policy options in the three sectors: buildings, industry and transport. These are then followed by sections focusing wider on systems thinking and integration, and emerging opportunities. In addition to the mitigation effects, improved energy efficiency offers other important benefits, for instance by playing an important role in the achievement of many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Goal seven specifically aims to \u2018ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and 1 The core assumption in the Efficient World Scenario is that policies are put in place to allow the market to realise the potential of all known energy efficiency measures which are economically viable. This scenario includes the full range of available energy efficiency policies and measures but no carbon price is expressed in the results (IEA, 2012). These estimates aren\u2019t potentials (like \u00dcrge-Vorsatz and Novikova (2008) based on a carbon price) but rather scenarios of what is achievable under the economic conditions the World Energy Outlook runs. modern energy for all\u2019, and includes an energy efficiency target (to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030). Achievement of goal seven impacts the delivery of many other goals, such as good health and well being, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, and climate action. This is further discussed in Chapter 6. As an example of the importance of energy efficiency in the implementation of the various goals, the benefits of energy efficiency related to goal eleven, sustainable cities and communities, are presented in box 5.1. 5.2. Building Sector The building sector offers major opportunities to bridge the emissions gap, due to its large share in global energy use, the dynamics of population growth, urbanisation and housing needs, and its large cost-effective mitigation potentials (IEA, 2013; IPCC, 2014). In 2013, the 212 billion square metres (m2) of global building stock accounted for almost 125 Exajoules of final energy use (IEA, 2016b), up from 102 Exajoules in 2000 (IPEEC, 2015). Thermal energy uses, including heating, cooling, and water heating, comprise the largest energy service, with 55 per cent of total building energy use (IEA, 2016b). Top-down estimates, obtained using integrated assessment models, often show limited potential for energy savings up to 2050. Conversely, bottom-up studies conclude that major savings (up to 75 per cent in 2050, compared to a reference Box 5.1: Examples of the multiple benefits of energy efficiency that support SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities).

The difference between these two types of analysis lies in the coverage of mitigation options, and the assumed rate of up-take. Bottom-up estimates are mainly driven by technical and economic potentials, whereas top-down estimates mostly reflect assumed market adoption rates for certain technologies and investment dynamics. With the sector orientation here, focus is on bottom-up studies where well-designed policy packages are critical to achieving the stated potentials combining building energy codes, building energy certification programs, together with appropriate incentives and information campaigns (Boza-Kiss et al., 2013a). 5.2.1 Building energy codes Building energy codes and standards are among the most cost-effective instruments for reducing building-related emissions (Boza-Kiss et al., 2013b). These regulatory tools set minimum requirements for parameters determining building energy demand, such as energy performance or resource use in new and/or existing buildings (Boza-Kiss et al., 2013b; Becqu\u00e9 et al., 2016). A strong and well implemented building energy code will take the building stock to a higher energy performance, and will be able to avoid locking-in obsolete solutions and high-emitting technologies, especially in rapidly developing regions (Becqu\u00e9 et al., 2016). Building energy codes are increasingly being applied worldwide.

For instance, the European Directive on the Performance of Buildings requires energy performance improvements for major retrofits throughout the European Union (EU) (European Parliament, 2010).3+4 Building energy codes have also been expanding in their coverage of requirements \u2013 moving towards more complex, whole-building approaches, and requiring the integration of renewable energy generation (IEA, 2013). 2 California provides an excellent example of how building energy codes can drive emission reductions. Between the 1970s and 2016 the state\u2019s thermal building energy use (and thus the corresponding emissions) has been reduced by more than 90 per cent. California continues to increase the stringency of its building regulations aiming at achieving zero net energy performance by 2020 for new residential buildings, and by 2030 for new non-residential buildings (Shirakh et al., 2015). 3 However, countries such as Germany also set energy performance requirements for minor retrofits (CA EPBD, 2015). Hong Kong also uses similar requirements to upgrade the energy performance of existing buildings undergoing major retrofits (Chan et al., 2014). 4 There are also building energy codes for \u201cretro-commissioning\u201d, which require periodic mandatory audits, followed by obligatory improvement of energy performance for low-performing buildings. Such a regulation (Local Law 87) is in place in New York City, where buildings over 50,000 gross square feet must undergo selected measures as part of a retro-commissioning process (Becqu\u00e9 et al., 2016). Austin, Texas also requires efficiency improvements in the case of low-performing multi-family buildings. However, the existence of a building energy codes alone does not guarantee emission reductions. To ensure their effectiveness, the following principles need to also be adopted: \u2022 Compliance monitoring and enforcement are essential (Boza-Kiss et al., 2013a; GBPN, 2014).5 Typically, limited human and financial resources for this activity will be a key barrier to the successful implementation of building codes. \u2022 The design of building energy codes should follow a holistic approach, covering energy performance, quality and safety, and utilisation of renewable energy (Boza-Kiss et al., 2013b). \u2022 The stringency of building energy codes should be regularly revisited and strengthened. Leapfrogging to very high efficiency performance standards have also been demonstrated and avoid lock-in. Building energy codes are a key policy instrument, but may not be sufficient in overcoming all the barriers to thermal energy efficiency improvements in buildings. Capacity building activities, supply-chain development, and other policy instruments \u2013 like credible building performance information or energy certification and financial incentives \u2013 all complement building codes. In fact, more integrated policy packages can often better overcome the many diverse barriers prevailing in this sector (Brown and Sovacool, 2011). 5.2.2 Building information and energy performance certification Certification of building energy performance is currently being used in at least 35 countries, worldwide (IEA, 2016d).6 Labelling schemes enable policy makers to tailor incentive schemes and other policy instruments, fostering a market transformation towards high-energy performance building stock. Certification may exist with or without a label, and can be combined with the provision of a set of recommendations for improvement (Boza-Kiss et al., 2013a). Mandatory schemes are expected to have a higher overall impact, while voluntary schemes can be considered as information measures. Voluntary schemes may enhance the effectiveness of other policies, or be a transitional step towards a mandatory system. The effectiveness of certification and labelling schemes also depends on effective monitoring and enforcement, which should be an integral part of their design. Many countries have developed their own building energy performance certification schemes, like the Home Energy Rating (Chile), Greenship (Indonesia) and Green Mark (Singapore). Many other countries have adapted international certification systems to the local conditions. However, many of these schemes were developed before 5 Nevertheless, compliance is often problematic. For instance, in some states of the USA the compliance rate was as low as 20 per cent, and in Japan about 30 per cent (Liu et al., 2010). Even in established building energy codes regimes, such as the EU, compliance rate ranges between 60-97 per cent for new buildings and 45-93 per cent for retrofits (ICF, 2015). 6 Most of these schemes are voluntary.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74e73057-ef3d-407c-9ed9-8ca202315fb9": {"__data__": {"id_": "74e73057-ef3d-407c-9ed9-8ca202315fb9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4e60086532e126670a2560bef66a8c40d96dd7485ef6676cf9d933f3b3531856"}, "2": {"node_id": "1ab5bc38-ecf3-4aa0-9111-07eea87cc048", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8045060686349c14dba4edcf037bcbdddc132b57f0ae5f2f2ec4e523e3cb7f6d"}}, "hash": "608ab2565512952efb3f2a2cf14f19700adae361f25d7cba5e90e7ed07343194", "text": "6 Most of these schemes are voluntary.

Therefore, it is important that countries, before adopting energy performance certification programmes for buildings developed in the past, carefully examine their stringency from the perspective of carbon lock-in, and the energy and emissions performance requirements are brought as close to the state-of-the-art as possible (Boza- Kiss et al., 2013b). 5.2.3. Highly energy efficient buildings The passivehaus standard. In terms of energy performance, one of the most ambitious building energy certification schemes is the so-called \u201cPassivehaus\u201d standard.7 This standard encourages very low-energy buildings from a heating and cooling perspective, with low thermal losses and optimized thermal gains (Schnieders, 2003; Feist et al., 2005). The Passivehaus standard has been adapted to different climate zones worldwide and further developed with the common target that annual final energy use for heating and cooling \u2013 not exceeding 15 kilowatt hour (kWh) per m2 per year.8 This target represents a reduction of up to 90 per cent in energy demand for heating and cooling for most existing buildings (Feist et al., 2005). The standard has become popular in several countries, and is experiencing a dynamic market adoption in several regions. The global floor area of Passivehauses has grown from 10 million m2 in 2010 to 46 million m2 in 2016, with the most activity occurring in Europe (personal correspondence: Passive House Institute and Gunter Lang). Presently, the price premium for new Passivehauses in several countries is comparable to standard construction costs (Treberspurg and Djalili, 2013). Net-zero energy buildings. The minimal remaining energy needs of highly efficient buildings can often be supplied with on-site renewable energy, thus creating a net zero energy building (Torcellini and Crawley, 2006). The global market of this type of building reached US$630 million in 2014, and is expected to continue its growth, to reach US$1.4 trillion by 2035 (Navigant Research, 2014). Numerous examples of net zero energy buildings exist around the world (IEA, 2013; Erhorn and Erhorn-Kluttig, 2014; New Buildings Institute, 2016). 9 Energy positive (or e+) buildings. These are buildings that generate more (renewable) energy on-site than they use. Examples can be found in a number of countries, including Australia, France, Germany, Norway, the UK and the USA. These highly efficient buildings can play an important and more active role in the overall energy system, since they can act as potential micro-energy hubs, supplying energy to local neighbourhoods through peer-to-peer networks. This offers opportunities to generate and store renewable energy (both 7 Passivehaus originated in Germany, with the pilot project launching in 1990 (Ebel and Feist, 1997). 8 The average building stock levels in most developed countries score well above 100-150 kWh per m2 (Schnieders et al., 2015). 9 The concept can also be applied at a scale that is greater than individual buildings. For example, in 2015 California established its first net zero energy community (\u2018Sierra Crest\u2019), consisting of 20 NZEBs (Movellan, 2015). thermal and electric) on-site, as well as deliver significant distributed demand response(De Groote et al., 2016).10 Recognizing the promise of highly energy efficient buildings and their societal co-benefits (Treberspurg Djalili, 2013; Schnieders and Hermelink, 2006), some jurisdictions are now recommending or mandating them as standards for different building types. For instance, since 2010, in Brussels (Belgium) all new public buildings are mandated to be built to the Passivehaus standard, and as of January 2015 it is a mandatory requirement for all new buildings and major retrofits (EnEffect, 2014). Hanover, Germany does not have mandatory Passivehaus policies, however the local housing market has transformed to offer high efficiency as a standard option, and approximately one-third of all new construction voluntarily conforms to the Passivehaus standard (Passive House Institute, 2015). 5.3. Industry Industrial energy demand, leading to 2030, is expected to increase at a rate of 1.3 per cent annually, primarily in emerging economies (IEA, 2015a). Decision making priorities differ significantly between the building and industry sectors where short-term energy prices for industries often have a large impact on energy efficiency decisions, particularly at the point of in-plant investment (Steinbuks and Neuhoff, 2014).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "665a86f1-9946-4c41-915e-246160ad4802": {"__data__": {"id_": "665a86f1-9946-4c41-915e-246160ad4802", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e78b554ab1b84f2513a4f2bebda6470f5b10ebb8febb0d8514114ddef693e9c0"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb5020b3-d75d-4ebf-bda2-909a25da48e5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c1993cb6ffbe220c9cb786d3cad505aed461f61593b19d7cd3aa4b891a2933d6"}}, "hash": "d1c4234583561889a0de5270bba5283c246b5ba31696b89dc92016e7c19db343", "text": "5.3.1 Energy Management, ISO 50001 and Energy Performance Monitoring Energy management systems help to reduce energy use by optimizing energy consumption across the entire production process through a suite of procedures and practices that ensure systematic tracking, analysis, and planning of energy use.

Many governments mandate large energy end-users to implement energy management systems.11 The recent Clean Energy Ministerial meeting in June 2016 put forward the aspirational goal of achieving global ISO 50001 certifications by 2020,12 providing a new momentum to the promotion of energy management. Early pilot implementation of ISO 50001 showed that for companies with no existing energy 10 Demand response is the ability to shift energy demand by reducing peak consumption and grid imbalance. 11 Most countries in Europe have made energy management central in their energy efficiency programmes. In Germany, companies implementing energy management and obtaining ISO 50001 may apply for a tax reduction. This has driven the adoption of ISO 50001 by the German industry, which accounts for more than 50 per cent of the 6,778 certificates issued in 2014 (ISO, 2014). 12 The CEM estimates that the worldwide implementation of ISO 50001 by large energy-using organizations could achieve cumulative energy savings of 62 Exajoules by 2030, cost savings of US$600 billion, and 6,500 Mt of avoided CO2 emissions (CEM, 2016). 36 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Bridging the gap \u2013 the role of energy efficiency management system, the average energy performance gains in the first one-to-two years ranged between 10 and 20 per cent of baseline consumption (UNIDO, 2015). 5.3.2 Energy performance standards for industrial equipment Many industrialized countries already have mandatory minimum energy performance standards in place for a range of energy consuming equipment within industry. Emerging economies are following suit with the introduction of similar standards for motors and boilers (box 5.2). 13 While individual efficient components may often only bring about gains of up to five per cent, system optimization measures can attain more durable average efficiency gains of 20 to 30 per cent. The payback period for operational energy efficiency projects is often less than two years (UNIDO and UN Energy, 2010). This broader potential requires policy support, such as awareness raising, technical support and capacity building, which can break down the barriers for optimizing energy efficiency in the design, operation and maintenance of industrial systems. 5.3.3. Delivering industrial energy efficiency through energy service companies An energy service company is a business that provides a range of energy services, including implementation of energy efficiency technologies and projects. In the industry sector, the most significant energy service company activities tend to focus on buildings. Utility programmes for industrial energy efficiency provide an additional avenue for identifying projects that energy service companies could implement.14 A good example is in Denmark, where utilities are responsible for actively seeking projects improving the energy efficiency of their end-users.15 13 Electric motors use two-thirds of the electrical consumption in industry (IEA, 2011), whereas steam generation represents 30 per cent of global final industrial energy use (UNIDO, 2014). 14 Unlike the ratepayer-funded programmes that are popular for households and commercial users, a utility programme for industrial energy efficiency should: (i) provide low-cost technical assistance in terms of training, networking and sharing of knowledge and best practices; (ii) offer a package of incentives providing both technical and financial support to industrial users; and (iii) develop long-term relationships/agreements with the industrial users to deliver sustained energy improvements. 15 Large industrial end-users are obliged to conduct energy audits and implement all energy efficiency projects with a payback period of up to four years. The Danish Energy Agency provides links to approved consultants and standards for the audits. It also compiles and shares best practice case studies. 5.4. Transport In developed countries, passenger transport demand grows with income, until a certain income threshold has been reached (Dhar and Shukla, 2015), while freight transport demand appears to grow as a function of the type of commodity concerned. Demand for both passenger and freight transport in developing countries is likely to follow a similar trend. To date, transport has relied almost
