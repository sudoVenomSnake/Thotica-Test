Is there any policy at national level that addresses plastic waste entering the oceans (waste disposal)? \u2022\ufffd The following existing measures mentioned in the Dutch MSFD Programme of Measures are national level policies and regulations that are related to waste management and disposal: o National litter policy that was established for the mainland in 2016. This policy includes, for example, an action plan for pilot projects with an innovative return bonus or reward system for small PET bottles and Producer Responsibility. o National Waste Management Plan 1 and 2.124 o Dutch Framework Agreement 2013-2022 on packaging (FAP ) with", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6cf6e703-6280-45f8-aca9-63769ca1dec4": {"__data__": {"id_": "6cf6e703-6280-45f8-aca9-63769ca1dec4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/national-marine-plastic-litter-policies-eu-member-states", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National marine plastic litter policies in EU Member States", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/national-marine-plastic-litter-policies-eu-member-states", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c5b2632844ad13c533266eafcebc4dbdeaa7d50fd431e4abc1d46ee6f49fe975"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f71dba1-0483-4781-b836-0d038ea57d65", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/national-marine-plastic-litter-policies-eu-member-states", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba7117b9dd0cafe60f56372129230e28c391f63f95d3d80652451ef4e5f6f591"}}, "hash": "25b49166fb86e7f663b01e8bbd8e4ef6bf0a06ad1f2a474b5ecbeaa2dfba5576", "text": "manufactur- ers to reduce and to recycle packaging. o Packaging Management Decree laying down rules for packaging and packaging waste. o Landfill ban. o Ban on the discharge of garbage by ships (MARPOL Annex V). \u2022\ufffd In the MSDF Dutch Programme of Measures it is explained that the Green Deal for Ship Generated Waste includes concrete agreements to close the maritime waste cycle by means of waste prevention during provisioning, further optimisation 123 https://www.government.nl/binaries/government/documents/ policy-notes/2016/09/14/a-circular-economy-in-the-netherlands- by-2050/17037+Circulaire+Economie_EN.PDF 124 http://rwsenvironment.eu/subjects/from-waste-resources/ national-activities/national-waste/ of supervision, optimisation of waste delivery in seaports and recycling of plastic maritime waste ashore. This deal has two objectives: o By 2017, 50% of the ships that depos- it plastic waste will have separated that waste prior to depositing it at the Dutch ports where separated collection and pro- cessing are possible. This is 75% of the ships of ship owners who are affiliated with the Royal Association of Netherlands Ship- owners (KVNR). o By 2017 all the separated plastic delivered is also collected, removed and processed separately by the members of the Associ- ation of Environmental Services Enterprises for Shipping (VOMS). 100% of the (\u2018clean\u2019) plastic waste collected by the members will be recycled or processed into fuel. They will re-sort as much of the deposited mixed plastic as possible so as to recycle as much of that plastic as possible. \u2022\ufffd In the MSDF Dutch Programme of Measures it is explained that in the Green Deal for Fishing in Support of a Clean Sea the fishing industry, together with the Ministry of I&E, ports, waste processors and other parties, is seeking ways to close the waste cycle and thus prevent waste ending up in the sea. This Green Deal tackles the main waste streams of fishery: operational ships\u2019 waste (nets, ropes, dolly rope) and domestic waste. 4. Is there any policy at national level that addresses plastic waste already polluting the marine and coastal environment? \u2022\ufffd In the MSDF Dutch Programme of Measures it is explained that Green Deal for Clean Beaches provides insight into how different parties go about cleaning up the Dutch North Sea beaches and keeping them clean. This Green Deal has 3 objectives: o Permanently cleaner beaches: Less litter is found on the Dutch North Sea beaches by 2020. o Good cooperation and coordination be- tween parties: By 2020 all Dutch coastal municipalities are united in the Green Deal for Clean Beaches. The number of partic- ipating beach operators, NGOs and other companies and organisations increases an- nually between 2015 and 2020. o Proper attitude and behaviour of beach go- ers: By 2020 beach goers leave less waste behind on the Dutch North Sea beaches. 48 National marine plastic litter policies in EU Member States: an overview ANNEX II: EU Countries Factsheets on marine litter related policies \u2022\ufffd Fishing for Litter Programme which is currently the only OSPAR measure in place for reducing marine litter. \u2022\ufffd In the catchment areas, various parties are working together on implementing cleaning campaigns in the rivers and on exchanging knowledge about litter.

They are nocturnal predators that feed on crustaceans and small \ufb01sh using ambush techniques. Similar to their terrestrial namesake, Parrot\ufb01sh are vibrantly colored with a beak-like jaw of fused teeth. They can reach up to 2 meters and they feed on coral and limestone substrates, making them a major contributor to the \ufb01ne, white sand on beaches.

They are incredibly diverse, armored insects with a soft inner body. They have jointed limbs, often with pincer-like claws. Coral reefs are one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, following only rainforests in the number of species that they host. Corals around the world are currently dying at an unprecedented rate due to human activities, such as overfshing and land based development, and global issues such as climate change and ocean acidifcation. Locally, proper management and reef conservation can increase coral cover, and active reef restoration can aid in recovery of lost corals. Phuket Marriott Resort and Spa, Merlin Beach has collaborated with the International Union of the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and Sea Bees Diving to work together to conserve and restore the unique reef ecosystem in front of the hotel. The \u201chouse reef\u201d is one of the healthiest nearshore coral reefs in Phuket, with high coral cover and diversity, which recruits a range of fsh species and other reef-dependant organisms.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89a7bf3d-25ec-40cd-8129-604234914f04": {"__data__": {"id_": "89a7bf3d-25ec-40cd-8129-604234914f04", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/house-reef-marine-guide", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "House reef marine guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/house-reef-marine-guide", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6875ed9709395d5484932d6c42e732da78dbc3b0482dfd5e33e7fd0cd52b7a43"}, "2": {"node_id": "a076c10d-5d6c-408b-9abf-93447743a4e5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/house-reef-marine-guide", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ffd39acc7517cbe214714dafdabb0f2df66452406617e29f389b2d3e05860489"}}, "hash": "e1b33d1649167898c88d59dd5c460163441b5417b7285fab4338d99d48945924", "text": "Despite this, one of the main threats to coral and fsh on the reef is discarded fshing gear, left behind by local fshermen, or washed up from ofshore activities.

The animals were all still alive, and released back to the reef, while the net was taken to land to prevent further damage. Weekly reef surveys and fshing gear removal can decrease the damage done, and raise awareness about the efects of fshing on these ecosystems. 25 27 Coral are also susceptible to physical damage from boat anchors and walking on the reef. Boats that anchor on the reef, for either \ufb01shing or snorkeling, drop anchors that can destroy corals, which may have taken more than 50 years to grow to such sizes. Our team works to educate hotel guests about their e\ufb00ects on corals, and encourages guests to go swimming only at high tide, and to be careful when snorkeling with long \ufb02ippers. ABANDONED ANCHOR ON THE REEF ACROPORA CORAL THAT WAS LIKELY DAMAGED BY ANCHORING 28 When broken into many pieces, whether by anchors or feet, coral fragments will usually die unless they are quickly secured back on to the reef. While diving, we will look for broken coral fragments, which can be easily wedged into holes on the reef, and will reattach and grow over time. This is an easy way to increase coral cover on the reef, because without these actions, the broken fragments will quickly die.

Background and introduction The Bonn Challenge target to bring 150 million hectares of the world\u2019s deforested and degraded lands into restoration by 2020 was launched by world leaders at a ministerial roundtable in Bonn, Germany, in September 2011. This global target was subsequently extended to 350 million hectares by 2030 by the New York Declaration on Forests, issued at the UN Climate Summit in 2014. Underlying the Bonn Challenge is the forest landscape restoration (FLR) approach, which aims to restore ecological integrity at the same time as improving human wellbeing through multi-functional landscapes. More information about FLR can be found at: www.InfoFLR.org and www.forestlandscaperestoration.org. The Bonn Challenge is an implementation vehicle for national priorities such as water and food security, disaster risk reduction and rural development, as well as for international commitments such as Aichi Biodiversity Target 15, the UNFCCC REDD+ goal, and the Rio+20 land degradation neutrality goal now embodied in the Sustainable Development Goals. More information can be found at: www.bonnchallenge.org. The 1st Asia Bonn Challenge High-Level Roundtable was held on the 9th and 10th of May 2017 in Palembang, South Sumatra. The event was organised by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia and the Provincial Government of South Sumatra, with the support of IUCN. It was a two-day event, beginning with a field visit to a restoration site at Sepucuk on the first day, followed by the roundtable discussions themselves on the second day.

Objectives The 1st Asia Roundtable sought to raise the ambition for FLR in the region, as a key approach for enhancing the wellbeing of both people and nature. The specific objectives of the roundtable were to: \uf0b7 Share regional experiences of FLR, the challenges faced during implementation, and ways of addressing these; \uf0b7 Discuss strategies and approaches for unlocking the financial resources required for restoration; \uf0b7 Consider ways of capturing and reporting on restoration progress.

The list of participants is given in Annex 2. 3. Opening session H.E. Alex Noerdin, Governor of South Sumatra, welcomed all participants to Palembang. He noted that South Sumatra has had a long history of environmental conservation, as evidenced by the famous Talang Tuwo inscription of 684 A.D., which called upon the local population to plant trees and manage water resources. Forests are a priority concern for Sumatra. The island has some of the most bio-diverse forests on earth, and is the only place in the world where elephants, rhinos, tigers and orangutans naturally co- exist. However, forest conservation faces many challenges, as evidenced by the devastating fires that swept across the province in 2015, impacting some 736,000 hectares. 2 It has been estimated that US$ 1.2 billion will be required to support the restoration effort in South Sumatra. In response, the provincial government is pursuing a \"people-public-private partnership (P4)\u201d, as its strategy for managing the landscape of South Sumatra. Success will require long-term commitments, clear land tenure arrangements, the adoption of a landscape approach and sustainable financing. In closing, H.E. Alex Noerdin presented copies of the South Sumatra Green Growth Programme and the South Sumatra Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan to Dr. Hadi Daryanto, the senior representative from the Ministry of Environment and Forests. He also formally announced the launch of the Sumatra Green Growth Forum, which will bring together all the provincial governors of Sumatra in support of sustainable development. Mr. Zhang Xinsheng, IUCN President, explained that IUCN is a union of more than 1,300 State and non-State members, including the Ecosystem and Natural Resources Conservation Directorate General of Indonesia. As the world\u2019s largest and oldest environmental network, IUCN is uniquely able to work on all aspects of restoration, from the generation of knowledge to influencing policies and programmes, and from putting trees in the ground to tracking progress: \u201c360 degree restoration\u201d. Mr. Zhang highlighted that the Bonn Challenge is an implementation vehicle for domestic priorities such as food security and rural development, while simultaneously contributing to the achievement of international climate change, biodiversity and land degradation neutrality commitments. At the time of his speech, there were 40 commitments to the Bonn Challenge, totalling more than 148 million hectares. Asia has played a pioneering role in many aspects: India, for example, was the first BRIC country to contribute to the Bonn Challenge, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) Province in Pakistan was the first sub-national jurisdiction to do so. Mr. Zhang noted that IUCN is currently partnering with many different countries in Asia on their FLR strategies and programmes, including China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar and Viet Nam. With the support of the German Ministry of the Environment, IUCN is also developing a progress-tracking protocol called the Bonn Challenge Barometer. Mr. Zhang drew attention to the Global Partnership on Forest Landscape Restoration (GPFLR), which is building global political support for restoration and providing policy and technical assistance for the implementation of restoration commitments. These efforts include FAO\u2019s Forest and Landscape Restoration Mechanism, regional technical collaboration platforms such as AFR100 in Africa, and IUCN\u2019s Regional Restoration Hubs. In closing, Mr. Zhang expressed IUCN\u2019s appreciation for the support of the German Environment Ministry and the Norwegian Climate and Forest Initiative, both of which are advancing restoration in many countries. He also noted that there is increasing interest in restoration from multilateral donors as well. For example, the Global Environment Facility is supporting The Restoration Initiative (TRI), which IUCN is leading in partnership with UNEP and FAO. Ms. Hilde Solbakken, Deputy Chief of Mission and Charge d'Affaires, Royal Norwegian Embassy, Jakarta, noted that just reducing carbon emissions is not sufficient; we must also seek actively to remove it. Large-scale carbon capture will be needed, and the Government of Norway is investing in both the use of, and research into, this technology. In the meantime however, it is important not to forget nature's own carbon capture mechanism - trees. Protecting forests is the best, cheapest and most effective option we have. Forest restoration is a good second choice.

Ms. Solbakken stated that the world now needs to do two things: 1) reduce emissions from degradation and deforestation; and 2) increase the uptake of carbon dioxide through FLR. Conventional wisdom is that the environment and economic growth are in competition with each other. However, we know better now. Renewable energy, for example, is generating thousands of 3 new jobs.

Ms. Solbakken noted that nearly 150 million hectares have now been pledged under the Bonn Challenge. The next step will be to ensure that restoration takes place on the ground. She noted that \u201cwe need to do things right \u2013 not only do the right things\u201d. Restoration works best when it involves local people, and when technical solutions are tailored to suit the ecological challenges and economic issues that are of concern to local communities. There is also a need to scale up, by working on a landscape level and by engaging with the private sector. In closing, Ms. Solbakken commended Indonesia's national and provincial leadership, including its efforts to combat peat and forest fires through the systematic restoration and re-wetting of Indonesia\u2019s vast peatlands. She reiterated Norway\u2019s commitment to assist with this endeavour, and noted that Indonesia is now economically and politically positioned to make a transformative shift to a green economy \u2013 one in which restoration of degraded lands plays a major role.

He welcomed the launch of the roundtable process in Asia, and noted that this is now the third regional track of the Bonn Challenge, following similar regional processes in Central America/the Caribbean and Africa. He congratulated Mr. Noerdin for his long engagement with the Bonn Challenge, noting that he had been present when the Bonn Challenge had been launched in Germany in 2011. Mr. Jochen Flasbarth, State Secretary, Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety, Germany, with the IUCN President, Mr. Zhang Xinsheng \u00a9 IUCN/Sandra Caya Mr. Flasbarth said that, from his perspective, \"The Bonn Challenge is the masterpiece of our 2030 agenda for sustainable development.\" It addresses many of the issues that need to be addressed in order to achieve sustainability and keep society within planetary boundaries. FLR provides multiple benefits. It supports the Paris Agreement and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets; it helps to protect soil and 4 water resources; it creates social and economic benefits; and \u2013 if implemented properly \u2013 it can be part of the development of inclusive societies. However, Mr. Flasbarth cautioned that the concept of FLR is only meaningful if we stop deforestation. This will be a huge challenge for many countries, not only in the Asian region, but in many other parts of the world. It is similar to the challenge faced by Western countries in reducing the use of fossil fuels. He noted that stopping deforestation and phasing out the use of fossil fuel are two sides of the same coin \u2013 and progress on both counts has been too slow. The world is continuing to lose forests at a rate of millions of hectares a year; if we continue to fail to stop deforestation, then we will fail to achieve all our sustainability targets. Mr. Flasbarth commended the Indonesian Government for its leadership, including its moratorium on new palm oil plantations and its decision to protect its remaining peatlands. He also thanked Norway for its longstanding leadership and commitment to REDD+. He noted that Germany has also accorded high priority to the FLR agenda, and that it has already spent 120 million Euros on Bonn Challenge related activities, including support for some 40 projects around the world. In closing, Mr. Flasbarth announced that Germany intended to provide a further 80 million Euros in support to FLR by 2020. He said that Germany believes this to be the right investment in the future, and that, \u201cAfter 200 years of forest destruction, we must enter a new century of forest landscape restoration.\u201d Dr. Hadi Daryanto, Director General of Social Forestry and Environmental Partnership, Indonesia, formally opened the roundtable on behalf of the Minister of Environment and Forestry, H.E. Dr. Siti Nurbaya Bakar.

Summary of roundtable discussions 4.1 Roundtable discussion 1: Achieving Bonn Challenge targets This session was co-chaired by Dr. Hadi Daryanto, Director General of Social Forestry and Environmental Partnership, Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Indonesia, and Mr. Malik Amin Aslam, IUCN Vice-President and Chair, Billion Tree Tsunami Afforestation Project, KPK Province, Pakistan. Participants were invited to share their experiences of identifying restoration opportunities and addressing the challenges to implementation, with particular reference to the following issues: \uf0b7 How are restoration opportunities identified and prioritised? \uf0b7 What are the challenges in moving from assessing restoration opportunities, to developing concrete restoration plans, to implementing these plans? \uf0b7 What is the role of national and provincial/state governments in providing an enabling policy environment to facilitate and incentivise forest restoration? \uf0b7 How do challenges and opportunities differ based on the specific national context \u2013 policies, regulations, the role of the private sector, etc.? \uf0b7 What are the strategic relations between the Bonn Challenge and related global initiatives, such as the Paris Agreement? The session began with a short overview of the Bonn Challenge and FLR by Mr. Stewart Maginnis, Global Director, Nature-Based Solutions Group, IUCN. Mr. Maginnis emphasised that forest degradation has enormous economic repercussions, with some countries now experiencing economic losses of up to 10 and 11 per cent of GDP. The Bonn Challenge is a platform to help deliver existing national and international commitments, such as the Paris Agreement and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. The Bonn Challenge can be used by countries to gain additional profile and recognition for their FLR work. It is also a mechanism for exchanging and sharing experiences among countries. Mr. Maginnis concluded by saying that there is now a need to move beyond commitments to implementation. It will also be important to scale up, while ensuring that approaches remain tailored to local situations. Representatives from Germany, Norway, India, Pakistan, Mongolia, Thailand and China were then invited to speak. Among the key points to emerge from the session were the following: \uf0b7 The scale of the challenge is huge. Although excellent work is being done in many places around the world, there is an urgent need to scale up. \uf0b7 Among the practical challenges identified by countries across the region were the following: fire; damage by livestock; the need to move beyond tree planting to ecosystem restoration; and the difficulties of implementing FLR in the face of increasing demand for land from commercial interests (e.g., for rubber and coffee) and from growing populations. \uf0b7 A key factor underlying FLR success is political support. Public-private partnerships will also be key. There is a need to introduce a profit motive in FLR in order to encourage the involvement of the private sector. There is also a need for innovation, in the same way that the world has witnessed tremendous innovation in the renewable energy sector. \uf0b7 National restoration policies and plans can provide important guiding frameworks and support.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a00389b7-722b-47cc-9db1-8cfe8b0b4669": {"__data__": {"id_": "a00389b7-722b-47cc-9db1-8cfe8b0b4669", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/1st-asia-bonn-challenge-high-level-roundtable", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1st Asia Bonn Challenge High-Level Roundtable ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/1st-asia-bonn-challenge-high-level-roundtable", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "81b543dd2a5797df762b1f89f9945e9cf04fe5fa9fc924bc0f337f5f95ff0e02"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d30c378-205d-429d-a32e-f600b1636865", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/1st-asia-bonn-challenge-high-level-roundtable", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a025cb11f179ca820670bd24d81bbd01ea9189be56a83e06c8fe700c8546e8ae"}}, "hash": "8eb5a6d6b3ea300e96598240cf047781bfe5930bda486e5776c96b526d8f4498", "text": "\uf0b7 National restoration policies and plans can provide important guiding frameworks and support.

China\u2019s new five-year plan (2016-2020) seeks to bring 43.33 million hectares into restoration. o India has a policy goal to achieve 33 per cent forest cover, which will require that restoration be carried out far beyond the boundaries of forest reserves. It has made a commitment under the Bonn Challenge to bring 13 million hectares into restoration by 2020 and a further eight million hectares into restoration by 2030. Through the National Mission for Green India (GIM), the new national agroforestry policy and other initiatives, India is well positioned to meet these commitments. o Indonesia has formally recognised its ratification of the Paris Agreement within Indonesian law, and is now focused on achieving its NDC. It has taken many steps to strengthen forest conservation and restoration, including: the development of a National Forestry Plan; the creation of the Peatland Restoration Agency in 2016; the issuing of Presidential Decree No. 1 on peatlands (which placed a moratorium on clearing, draining or converting currently unopened peatlands), and the setting aside of 12 million hectares of peatland for the creation of protected areas. o Mongolia has committed to expand its forest cover from 7.9 per cent to 9 per cent by 2020, but faces a range of unique challenges (see text box). The challenge of FLR in Mongolia Mongolia has a unique history, socio-economic conditions and ecology, and successful FLR will require a different approach from that used in other countries in Asia. Mongolia\u2019s forest cover currently stands at 7.9 per cent. It has large coniferous forest areas, located on the southern edge of the great Siberian forests. Although these boreal forests are very resilient, the annual mean temperature in Mongolia has increased three times faster than that of the global average; as a result, the country\u2019s forests have increasingly been experiencing drought- related stress. Mongolia has also gone through huge social change in recent years, as it has moved from a centrally planned economy to a free market system. During this transition, Mongolia lost some 467,000 ha of forests as a result of unregulated logging, fire and forest pests. In the regional context, the land degradation problems experienced in Mongolia are also impacting other countries, such as China, the Republic of Korea and Japan. A collective response will be required. Mongolia has made a commitment under the Sustainable Development Goals and multilateral environmental agreements to increase forest cover to 8.3 per cent by 2020. However, Mongolia has traditionally been a nomadic society and it has limited experience of restoration. To date, the focus has been largely on tree planting, rather than ecosystem restoration. Livestock grazing has also inhibited natural forest regeneration processes. Mongolia requires a professional forest restoration assessment to identify priority restoration sites, as well as technology and training on the restoration of ecosystem functions. The Bonn Challenge provides a particularly valuable opportunity to learn from other countries, in order to help achieve these goals. 7 o Pakistan has initiated the \u201cGreen Pakistan Programme\u201d, which seeks to plant 100 million trees over the next five years. o Thailand\u2019s forests have come under increasing threat from an expanding human population and rising demand for land. As a result, forest cover has fallen from 53 per cent in 1961 to 32 per cent at present. To help counter these trends, Thailand has been engaged in forest restoration efforts for over 100 years. A new national restoration plan for the period 2016-2036 has been developed, with the aim of achieving 40 per cent forest cover. There is a focus on the restoration of degraded lands in forest reserves, mangrove areas, and watersheds. Priority is also being accorded to the creation of \u201ceconomic forests\u201d that will benefit local communities. \uf0b7 Many countries in the region are using the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) to identify and prioritise restoration options at national and sub-national levels. \uf0b7 Effective restoration requires working beyond forest reserves, across entire landscapes, and the use of agroforestry and other approaches in addition to conventional forestry techniques. Natural regeneration can also be very effective. \uf0b7 However, it must also be recognised that there are many different approaches to FLR; there is no \"one size fits all\" approach. That is why regional roundtables such as those facilitated by the Bonn Challenge are so important as a means of sharing experience.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95134ef3-3e2f-4a2a-ba55-c0ddd31e208b": {"__data__": {"id_": "95134ef3-3e2f-4a2a-ba55-c0ddd31e208b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/1st-asia-bonn-challenge-high-level-roundtable", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1st Asia Bonn Challenge High-Level Roundtable ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/1st-asia-bonn-challenge-high-level-roundtable", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0124a8e527a9e0b8a3269ed13b1feff8590c1a823dc63aabe0e47b66a74af602"}, "2": {"node_id": "5567d1e8-3ed1-46d7-9bd0-1d2d19f0a85b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/1st-asia-bonn-challenge-high-level-roundtable", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d1857ed058562a71f4290a3f3d1805d3a303ddabb6a8f29a1cc43832848604e7"}}, "hash": "2866d32a641666c8d69226e84ec88b0c8d3bacd0db12533137f030806a3ba087", "text": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u2019s \u201cBillion Tree Tsunami\u201d The \u201cBillion Tree Tsunami\u201d in Pakistan\u2019s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) Province is seeking to restore 384,000 hectares of forest, a goal which it has registered as a formal commitment to the Bonn Challenge.

The first pillar has been achieved through the provincial government\u2019s investment of US$ 110 million in the creation of a network of tree nurseries and the provision of loans and purchase agreements for tree saplings. In total, some 13,000 government and private nurseries have been established, producing both native and non-native tree species. These will account for approximately 40 per cent of the trees need for the restoration effort, with the remainder coming from natural regeneration. The second pillar has been achieved by recruiting WWF International to carry out an independent annual performance audit. Detailed information about the restoration programme, including maps and audit reports, is also made publicly available through a website. The third pillar has been achieved through the creation of some 500,000 \u201cgreen jobs\u201d, such as community forest guards and nursery workers. The final pillar has entailed enforcing a complete ban on tree felling in KPK\u2019s forest reserves, carrying out a satellite-based demarcation survey of forest land, the dismantling of over 600 saw mills, the arrest of over 300 offenders, and the seizure of over 100,000 cubic feet of illegal timber. The programme has met with remarkable success and is now expected to achieve its billion tree goal by the end of 2017. 8 4.2 Roundtable discussion 2: Financing restoration This session was co-chaired by H.E. Anuradha Jayarathne, Deputy Minister for Mahaweli Development and Environment, Sri Lanka, and H.E. Iqbal Zafar Jhagra, Governor, KPK Province, Pakistan. Roundtable participants were invited to speak about their experiences of accessing funding for restoration activities, with particular reference to the following issues: \uf0b7 How can the Bonn Challenge serve as a platform to facilitate greater access to financing for restoration? \uf0b7 What motivates different actors to engage in and finance restoration? What results are they seeing in line with these motivations/expectations? \uf0b7 How can domestic resources be mobilised or redirected to better support restoration of forest landscapes? Representatives from Germany, Norway, India, Indonesia (Peatland Restoration Agency), Pakistan, Cambodia, the Netherlands, PT Rimba, the World Bank and the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) were invited to speak. Among the key points to emerge from this session were the following: \uf0b7 FLR cannot be achieved by public finance alone. There is a need to create diverse partnerships and to engage the support of both the private sector and local communities. Costs will also need to be shared among different levels of government. In Pakistan, for example, where a commitment has been made to plant 100 million trees, 50 per cent of the costs will be borne by the federal government, and the balance of 50 per cent will be met by the provinces. \uf0b7 It is critically important that countries create the right enabling environments to encourage and support national, international and private sector investments in FLR. In particular, there is a need for policy reforms that can make risky investments in FLR viable and to find ways of making natural forests attractive to capital. Although it is relatively easy to raise finances for restoration that will lead to timber and wood products, it is much more difficult to raise funds for other types of FLR. One private sector representative noted that \"restoration is simply not a profitable business at this time.\" \uf0b7 In order to encourage private sector involvement, it is important to have investable projects at different scales, ranging from projects requiring only a few thousand dollars to projects that need US$ 30 to 50 million.

The Bonn Challenge also needs to become a platform for innovation. Financial instruments should also be used to promote research and development. \uf0b7 Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) can be an effective mechanism for encouraging forest conservation and restoration. In Viet Nam, for example, a PES policy has been in place since 2010. Some five million hectares are now covered by PES schemes, in which forest owners receive payments for the provision of ecosystem services. This now represents between 10-20 per cent of total investment in the forest sector. \uf0b7 Assisted natural regeneration can be a powerful approach to reducing the costs of FLR. In Pakistan\u2019s KPK Province, for example, regeneration took place at twice the rate that had been anticipated, and as a result, the costs of the FLR programme were much less than originally estimated. The Challenge of Restoring Peatland in Indonesia The particular challenges associated with the restoration of peatland were highlighted by Indonesia's Peatland Restoration Agency. The agency was created just over one year ago, and has been charged with restoring two million hectares of degraded land. Restoration of peatland is a particular challenge, since it involves not only reforestation, but also hydrological restoration and water management. Mapping must be very detailed, using a 1:2000 scale and with 50 cm accuracy. Sixty per cent of the costs of peatland restoration in Indonesia are currently being met by the State, with the balance of 40 per cent coming from international partners, including Norway, Germany, the EU, USA, Australia, Canada, the Republic of Korea and Japan. However, there is a need to promote greater private sector engagement, for example, by demonstrating that investing in peatland is an effective carbon investment, and by enabling restoration that permits 50 per cent of the land to be used for cultivation, while protecting the remaining 50 per cent. The Peatland Restoration Agency is currently implementing a suite of case studies to ascertain what mixtures of crops are best suited to growing on peatland. The Agency is also building on the experience gained from Indonesia's ecosystem restoration concessions, although there is recognition that there may be a need for a simpler system. The Sepucuk pilot restoration site, South Sumatra \u00a9 IUCN/Sandra Caya 10 \uf0b7 The importance of communicating the benefits of FLR in order to unlock funding support was highlighted. For example, national governments will require public support if they are to invest in the Bonn Challenge and FLR. In urban areas, this support can be generated by communicating the environmental benefits of restoration. In rural communities, the focus should be on highlighting the potential of FLR to create jobs. \uf0b7 It was noted that FLR is a high priority for many bilateral and multilateral agencies. Germany, for example, has already invested over 120 million Euros in FLR and created a special climate initiative. The World Bank representative noted that the bank is fully supportive of the Bonn Challenge, and that it is trying to leverage its funding in support of others. She highlighted that forest degradation has huge economic impacts, and that the poor are the most severely affected. 4.3 Roundtable discussion 3: Capturing and reporting on progress This session was co-chaired by H.E. Abdullah Al Islam Jakob, Deputy Minister, Ministry of Environment and Forests, Bangladesh, and Mr. Malik Amin Aslam, IUCN Vice-President and Chair, Billion Tree Tsunami Afforestation Project, KPK Province, Pakistan. Roundtable participants were invited to speak about their experiences of monitoring and verifying restoration efforts, with particular reference to the following issues: \uf0b7 How can progress on implementation of Bonn Challenge commitments be effectively captured and reported upon? What indicators, tools and approaches are available to assist with monitoring? \uf0b7 How can this be done in a way that is credible yet does not impose an additional burden?

There is a need for public platforms that can be easily used by communities and Civil Society Organisations. Credible monitoring systems also require transparency and good data sharing mechanisms agreed by all stakeholders. \uf0b7 Countries and sub-national jurisdictions in the region have adopted a range of approaches to FLR monitoring. For example: o Monitoring in KPK Province, Pakistan is carried out at three different tiers: 1) by the Forest Department within Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation; 2) by the Strategic Unit in the Ministry of Planning (because the restoration initiative is considered to be a large, strategic project); and 3) by an independent auditor (WWF International), who provides a yearly report on parameters such as the number of trees planted, the survival rate and the natural regeneration rate. There is also a website with a GIS map of all the planting and regeneration sites, which is open to the public. The experience in KPK Province has highlighted the importance of monitoring the number of 11 jobs created through FLR. Overall, monitoring has revealed that the benefits of FLR have greatly outweighed the cost of investment in restoration. o South Sumatra has identified 1.1 million hectares as having high potential for restoration. Landscape restoration activities began in 2016, with an initial focus on document preparation, capacity building, socialisation and mapping. On-the-ground activities were started in 2017. A Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting System (MERS) has been developed with support from the Zoological Society of London and other partners. Monitoring of fire, deforestation, illegal logging, biodiversity, illegal poaching, water levels and restoration activities (tree care) is being planned, based on Indonesia\u2019s One Map. There are also plans to establish a multi-stakeholder forum, involving the government, Civil Society Organisations, the private sector, community groups and indigenous people. The forum will seek to build agreement regarding land boundaries and land-use, in order to accelerate the implementation of the One Map policy and sustainable development at the sub-national level. o Myanmar is developing a monitoring and evaluation system for all its restoration activities. This includes: monthly and annual reports to the head office; Forest Department regular monitoring and evaluation reports; and monitoring by regional and national audit offices. Survival rate is one key indicator; this should be 85 per cent or higher. A new vision for restoration is being launched through the National Restoration Programme 2017-2026, which seeks to make use of a broad array of restoration approaches, including: plantations; regeneration; conservation; community forests; etc. A total budget of US$ 500 million will be required. Some 800,000 ha are to be established in Year 1 of the programme. \uf0b7 A number of different FLR monitoring tools and packages are now available or are under development. These include a smallholder monitoring toolkit designed by UN-REDD and the Bonn Challenge Barometer of Progress, being developed by IUCN with the support of Germany (see text box). New approaches to monitoring are also being developed through initiatives such as Restore+, a new initiative involving the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), WRI, WWF-Indonesia and others. Global Forest Watch was also identified as a valuable source of information on forest status and trends. 12 5. New commitments and pledges At the close of the third roundtable session, countries were invited to make new commitments and pledges to the Bonn Challenge: \uf0b7 Bangladesh announced its commitment to establish 750,000 ha of plantations on degraded land; \uf0b7 Mongolia reconfirmed its commitment to combatting degradation and pledged to bring 600,000 hectares into restoration as a contribution towards the Bonn Challenge as part of its target of bringing 8.3 per cent of its land area under forest cover by 2020; \uf0b7 Pakistan reaffirmed its national commitment to plant 100 million trees, equivalent to 100,000 ha; \uf0b7 Sri Lanka pledged to bring 200,000 ha into restoration by 2020, as committed to the United Nations as part of its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).

The Barometer will help track progress along three dimensions: 1) the policy and legal frameworks that have been put in place to create an enabling environment for FLR; 2) on-the-ground achievements in restoring degraded land; and 3) technical capacity to plan, implement and monitor FLR. Six pilot countries have been identified for the first phase. By providing a responsive and effective feedback loop, the Barometer will enable Bonn Challenge contributors to identify emerging opportunities and anticipated bottlenecks, and communicate to partners and potential collaborators the areas in which they need support in order to accelerate progress. It will help donors and international organisations to pinpoint the nature and timing of opportunities for engaging with and supporting these restoration leaders. It will also enable decision makers to prioritise restoration actions that can simultaneously contribute to the achievement of climate change mitigation, land degradation neutrality and biodiversity targets. Investors will receive accurate information about opportunities and enabling conditions, and the confidence to invest that comes from evidence of political and stakeholder support, and credible reporting on the progress of restoration efforts on the ground. In its yearly Spotlight reports, the Barometer will highlight how restoration efforts contribute to international commitments including the Sustainable Development Goals and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

Focus on South Sumatra This final session was chaired by H.E. Alex Noerdin, Governor of South Sumatra, and had a particular focus on the FLR-related activities underway in South Sumatra. The following initiatives were highlighted: \uf0b7 Prof. Damayanti Buchori, from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), spoke about KELOLA Sendang, a partnership for sustainable landscape management in the Sembilang-Dangku landscape. Situated between Berbak-Sembilang National Park and Dangku Wildlife Reserve, this landscape encompasses an area of some 1.6 million hectares, including important watersheds and peatlands. The aim of the project is to develop a model of FLR, by: supporting the management of landscape databases; strengthening policy and governance; and piloting restoration activities on the ground involving both public and private land managers as well as community-managed areas. At the end of her presentation, Prof. Buchori read out a statement from a consortium of community groups in Sumatra, emphasising the importance of involving local communities in restoration efforts and of ensuring that environmental and social safeguards are applied. The statement also urged that the Bonn Challenge not be used to \u201cgreen wash\u201d the environmental record of private sector companies. \uf0b7 The Forest and Landscape Restoration Assessment (FLORAS) project is a joint initiative of WRI, ICRAF and Forum DAS Sumsel. It seeks to increase the capacity of stakeholders to implement FLR through informed, inclusive and integrated planning processes in two targeted landscapes: the Musi Watershed (7.7 million ha) in South Sumatra and the Batanghari Watershed (4.4 million ha) in Jambi.

A particular focus is placed on strengthening FMU management systems, operational procedures/processes, customer orientation and knowledge management. The project is working in four different ecosystems (peatlands, lowland forests, mangroves and montane forests), located in four different districts (Banyuasin, Musi Banyuasin, Musi Rawas, and Musi Rawas Utara). Among other challenges in the project area, the damage inflicted by repeated peatland fires has been particularly severe.

Law enforcement to maintain and protect canal blocks from illegal activities has been found to be central to successful FLR. Villagers also need to be rewarded for their efforts and engaged in co-benefit arrangements (e.g., payments based on the number of trees planted and growing). \uf0b7 Dr. Jatna Suprianta gave a presentation on the Belantara Foundation\u2019s restoration and protection programmes. The foundation is currently supporting multi-stakeholder forums and Sustainable Landscape Management in ten priority landscapes in five provinces across Indonesia, including three landscapes in South Sumatra. He noted that some 1,100 villages are located near conservation areas, more than 900 villages are around Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) concessions, and that more than 95 villages are situated between conservation areas and concessions. This highlights the need to take a partnership approach. In South Sumatra, the Belantara Foundation is supporting a range of activities, including re-wetting through canal blocking, forest fire mitigation, forest restoration, mangrove restoration, sustainable farming and community livelihoods. \uf0b7 Mr. Fitrian Ardiansyah gave a presentation on behalf of IDH, the Sustainable Trade Initiative, about restoration and protection through innovative community business models. IDH is a public- private partnership facility, supported by the Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland and Norway. It works on 15 commodity chains in 50 countries, involving over 300 companies and 30 international NGOs. In South Sumatra, IDH is collaborating with London Sumatra (IndoAgri) to obtain sustainable palm oil certification for some 6,000 smallholders. It is also working with the provincial government, the Crude Palm Oil (CPO) Fund and other partners to support five Fire-Free Villages. In the highlands, IDH is collaborating with corporate partners to improve the productivity of some 4,500 small coffee farmers. It is also supporting the district government of Musi Banyuasin to develop bio-energy. 7. Conclusion The 1st Asia Bonn Challenge High-Level Roundtable was a landmark event that brought together senior government representatives from 12 Asian countries, as well as representatives from sub- national jurisdictions, national and international NGOs, donor agencies, international organisations, and the private sector. It significantly increased awareness in the region of the benefits of FLR and the role that the Bonn Challenge can play as a platform for accelerating restoration, meeting national priorities and fulfilling international commitments. The roundtable also led to new pledges totalling 1.65 million hectares, making it an historic occasion at which the total commitments to the Bonn Challenge surpassed the 150 million hectare milestone, reaching a total of 150.03 million hectares. It is clear that there is enormous potential for FLR in the Asia region. Looking to the future, the priorities now will be to: 15 \u2022 Build on the momentum of the roundtable to seek further pledges to the Bonn Challenge from countries in Asia; \u2022 Use more strategic and structured approaches to identify restoration opportunities and priorities at the national and sub-national levels, by applying methodologies such as ROAM; \u2022 Move from planning and pledging to implementation. There is a need to accelerate the pace of restoration on the ground, by learning from the many FLR projects across the region and elsewhere, developing new financial partnerships that harness the power of the private sector, and finding innovative and creative ways to scale up successful existing initiatives; \u2022 Strengthen monitoring systems to ensure that Bonn Challenge commitments remain credible, for example, through the use of new tools such as the Bonn Challenge Barometer of Progress.

Conventions cooperate to protect human health and the environment from the negative effects of hazardous pollutants. This Environment and Gender Information (EGI) platform analysis explores how women are represented as delegates to the Conferences of the Parties (COPs), members and observers of Conventions\u2019 Subsidiary Bodies, and national focal points. It investigates how gender equality considerations are included in Parties\u2019 reporting mechanisms to the BRS Conventions, including initial National Implementation Plans (NIPs) to the Stockholm Convention and the most recent National Reports to the Basel and Stockholm Conventions. This study also explores how gender considerations are included in the Rotterdam Prior Informed Consent (PIC) Circular. As key stakeholders reflect upon the progress being made toward meeting the objectives of the BRS Gender Action Plan (BRS-GAP), the results of this study are encouraging, particularly with respect to women\u2019s participation in key decision-making processes and the inclusion of gender considerations within initial NIPs. A staggering number of initial NIPs (91%) contain at least one women and/ or gender keyword\u2014indicating recognition to some extent of gender considerations and, most commonly, to the differentiated impacts of chemicals and pollutants on women and men. This study finds that there are many available entry points for enhancing gender mainstreaming to achieve the objectives of the BRS-GAP. However, Parties are not yet fully integrating or mainstreaming gender considerations within their planning and reporting documents.

Therefore, this report in partnership with the BRS Secretariat aims to bridge that gap by developing gender indicators and gathering baseline data on how women are participating in key decision making processes and bodies and how gender considerations are being included in the reporting mechanisms of the Parties to the BRS Conventions. The baseline data collected will be essential to measure the future progress in the integration of gender considerations within the BRS Conventions and help develop evidence-based actions to mainstream gender. The indicators developed for this study, and the baseline results of these indicators, can be used by the BRS Secretariat to develop targets, and actions Parties can take towards reaching those targets, in order to progress on these issues. 1 The Environment and Gender Information (EGI) platform The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Environment and Gender Information (EGI) platform aims\u2014through data and analysis\u2014 to convey the value of gender responsive environmental conservation and sustainable development. By providing new evidence-based information and knowledge products, the EGI platform guides action toward a more just world. From its inception in 2013, the EGI has evolved into a source for new knowledge creation and dissemination\u2014and for revealing progress and challenges in meeting commitments to women\u2019s empowerment and gender equality in environmental spheres. This EGI report examines how women and gender considerations are included in the texts and the work of Parties to the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions (BRS Conventions), including through their national reports and national implementation plans, participation at Conferences of the Parties (COPs), membership of Conventions Committees, and designation of national focal points and contacts. 2 Background on the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions Emerging awareness of the potential risks of hazardous chemicals, such as pesticides, and wastes in the 1970s and 1980s tightened the environmental legislation in many industrialised countries, escalating the costs of chemical disposal, particularly for hazardous wastes. These regulations and increased costs pushed some corporations and governments of industrialised countries to seek less expensive solutions. In some cases, this meant that hazardous chemical waste was shipped to countries in Eastern Europe, Africa and other regions lacking regulations and enforcement mechanisms. This waste management system, including transboundary movement and often-unregulated disposal, negatively impacted the environment and contributed to health problems for communities in the receiving countries.I This new scenario raised concerns among environmental organisations and practitioners and incentivised governments to advance negotiations and address these concerns. From 1989 to 2001, three major international conventions were adopted: the Basel Convention, the Rotterdam Convention and the Stockholm Convention. Though separate conventions, BRS Conventions share a common objective of protecting human health and the environment from hazardous chemicals and wastes. In 2006, the three Conventions started a process to enhance their cooperation and coordination while maintaining their legal autonomy. The respective COPs adopted the first synergy decisions in 2008 and 2009 to strengthen their implementation at national, regional and global levels; provide coherent policy guidance; and enhance their support of the Parties by reducing their administrative burden and advancing an efficient and effective use of resources.II The Conventions provide for subsidiary bodies and maintain specific committees to guide and monitor implementation and reporting mechanisms and requirements, as noted below; analysis of these informs the datasets presented in this report. 3 THE BASEL CONVENTION The Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, known as the Basel Convention, was adopted in 1989 in Basel, Switzerland, and entered into force in 1992. As of June 2017, 186 Parties, including the European Union (EU), have ratified the Convention and subscribed to the objectives of reducing the generation of hazardous and other wastes, promoting environmentally sound management techniques and regulating transboundary movements to restrict those that do not respect the principle of environmentally sound management.III The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) provides the Secretariat for the Basel Convention. In order to support the implementation of the Convention, COP 6 established a Committee for Administering the Mechanisms for Promoting Implementation and Compliance\u2014known as the Implementation and Compliance Committee (ICC)\u2014in 2002.IV The 12th COP (2015) elected Committee members in accordance with the terms of reference (ToR) set out in the appendix to decision VI/12 for a term ending at the close of the 14th COP (2019).

The reporting is done through a questionnaire on the Electronic Reporting System (ERS) hosted via the Secretariat.VI THE ROTTERDAM CONVENTION The Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, known as Rotterdam Convention, was adopted in 1998 in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and entered into force in 2004. A key aspect of the Rotterdam Convention is the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedure, a mechanism for collecting and disseminating decisions, introduced by UNEP and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in 1989. As of June 2017, 157 Parties, including the EU, have ratified and are legally bound to the Rotterdam Convention. The Rotterdam Convention aims to advance the shared responsibility and cooperative efforts among Parties in the international trade of certain hazardous chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment from potential harm. The Convention also promotes the environmentally sound use of those hazardous chemicals by facilitating information exchange about their characteristics, providing a national decision-making process on their import and export and disseminating these decisions to Parties.VII The Rotterdam Convention is jointly administered by the FAO and UNEP.VIII Article 18, paragraph 6 of the Rotterdam Convention establishes the creation of the Chemical Review Committee (CRC). This 4 subsidiary body of the Convention includes experts in chemical management who have the responsibility to review Parties\u2019 formulations on the ban or restriction of certain chemicals and offer recommendations as to the inclusion of these substances in the list of chemicals subjected to the PIC procedure (Annex III of the Convention). The CRC is composed of 31 members1 nominated by governments and appointed by the COP with an equitable geographic distribution, including a balance between developed and developing Parties. The CRC ToR notes that members of the Committee must be experts in chemical management and shall be appointed to an initial term of either two or four years and subsequent terms of four years for no more than two consecutive terms. Recommendations by the CRC should be made by consensus when possible but may be made by a two-thirds majority when consensus cannot be reached. The Rotterdam Convention does not have a periodic reporting system, but Parties are required to inform on whether they will allow the import of each of the chemicals listed in Annex III of the Convention, and they must notify on any new decision. The Secretariat of the Rotterdam Convention informs all Parties on the import status of each chemical every six months through a PIC Circular.IX THE STOCKHOLM CONVENTION The Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), known as the Stockholm Convention, was adopted in 2001 in Stockholm, Sweden, and entered into force in 2004 with the aim of 1 Only 23 members attended the 2016 CRC meeting included in this study. restricting and/or eliminating the production, trade, use, storage and release of POPs, as well as ensuring the environmentally sound management of existing POPs stockpiles and wastes. As of June 2017, 181 Parties have ratified the Stockholm Convention.X UNEP provides the Secretariat for the Stockholm Convention. POPs are carbon-based organic chemical substances that are long lasting; can be distributed globally, particularly through air; and bio-accumulate in the fatty tissue of humans and wildlife, posing a risk to their health. The effects of POPs can cause cancer, birth defects, endocrine disruption and dysfunction of the immune and reproductive systems.XI The Stockholm Convention, pursuant to Article 8, established the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee (POPRC), a subsidiary body responsible for reviewing the chemicals proposed by Parties for inclusion in the lists of elimination, restriction and/or unintentional production.XII Members of the POPRC are nominated by Parties and confirmed by the COP. The COP identifies which Parties will nominate Committee members for each term, ensuring an equitable geographic distribution and balance of developed and developing Parties. In accordance with Article 7 of the Stockholm Convention, Parties are required to develop a National Implementation Plan (NIP). The NIP has to be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect the progress made by the Party and to include new obligations adopted by the COP. Similar to the Basel Convention, the Stockholm Convention 5 established an ERS to support Parties with transmitting national reports, in compliance with Article 15 of the Convention.

The Stockholm Convention is the only one of the three leading Conventions on chemicals and waste management that includes gender considerations in its initial Convention text. A key reason for this is the recognition of the potential impacts of POPs on human health, particularly on women, including pregnant and breastfeeding women. The preamble to the Stockholm Convention states that it is \u201caware of the health concerns, especially in developing countries, resulting from local exposure to persistent organic pollutants, in particular impacts upon women and, through them, upon future generations.\u201dXV In addition, the Stockholm Convention acknowledges the important role and contribution of women\u2019s groups, and advances the inclusion of women in activities. In Article 7, the Convention advises countries to cooperate with and \u201cconsult their national stakeholders, including women\u2019s groups and groups involved in the health of children,\u201d while Article 10 promotes the \u201cdevelopment and implementation, especially for women, children and the least educated, of educational and public awareness programmes on persistent organic pollutants.\u201dXVI The first step in advancing gender equality as an important issue for all three conventions was in 2012 with the establishment of a Gender Task Team to mainstream gender internally within the BRS Secretariat and externally with Parties and stakeholders. The development of the Gender Task Team was in response to previous discussions on gender equality and the impact of hazardous chemicals and wastes on vulnerable groups such as women and children. The BRS Gender Action Plan (BRS-GAP), originally developed in 2013 and updated in 2016, envisions gender equality as \u201can integral part of the implementation of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions, including the secretariat activities\u201dXVII and aims at implementing gender- mainstreaming activities within the Secretariat and with partners.XVIII The original BRS-GAP was provided for Parties\u2019 consideration at the 2015 COPs as an information document. 6 The five objectives of the BRS-GAP are as follows: 1. Developing an understanding among and support from BRS staff on the issue of gender equality, particularly in the context of BRS operations and activities; 2. Developing a baseline on gender-related issues and measuring progress in achieving BRS- GAP objectives and implementing activities; 3. Ensuring that the Secretariat\u2019s programmes and projects are planned and implemented from the gender equality perspective; 4. Promoting the consideration of gender issues in hazardous chemicals and wastes management at the national and regional levels; and 5. Supporting staff in achieving a sustainable work-life balance.XIX The BRS-GAP is the guiding framework to ensure that gender concerns are mainstreamed throughout the work of the BRS Conventions. The second objective calls for gender indicators and baseline data, specifically with regards to participation and representation of women and gender concerns in the context of Parties\u2019 compliance with the Conventions. This EGI report aims to provide information for this objective as well as support the broader goals of the BRS-GAP. 7 Methodology 2 The documents and participation/membership lists analysed for this study are available and accessible through the BRS Conventions website.

The inclusion of gender considerations in the most recent PIC Circular to the Rotterdam Convention. 8 DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS This study includes two primary types of analyses: reviews of gender parity within participation lists and a study of gender mainstreaming within documents. The first involves determining the gender identity of individuals listed as delegates, observers, Committee members, or country contacts. In the case of the BRS Conventions, participation lists include a prefix for each individual. The EGI methodology follows social conventions for surnames in English, Spanish and French (i.e. an individual with the prefix Mr. is coded as a man, Ms. or Mrs. as a woman, etc.). For individuals with a gender neutral prefix\u2014such as Doctor, Honourable or Attorney\u2014the gender identity of the individual is confirmed through other research means, including reputable sources like news articles or press releases, personal biographies and professional online profiles.6 6 If the gender identity of an individual cannot be confirmed via the participation list or another reputable source, that individual is not included in the final results (this is discussed in relevant sections to follow). 7 Keywords were excluded if they were found in acronym lists, table of contents, citations or as directly copied text from the Convention texts or the MDGs. For example, Articles 7 and 10 of the Stockholm Convention, which include the keyword women, were excluded if they were merely listed, but if the Party mentioned either of these articles as one of its objectives or activities, or provided further explanation of why the article was important or how they planned to address it, the keyword was included. 8 This report excludes analysis of 31 additional gender keywords grouped into four additional categories, male, men, man, and boy, as the inclusion of these words did not show that gender considerations are being included. The results reported only reflect analysis of the 95 keywords and eight categories listed above. For the analyses of gender considerations within documents, the following methodology was followed. A keyword analysis to identify the inclusion of gender keywords was conducted for 162 National Reports to the Basel Convention, 121 National Reports and 150 NIPs to the Stockholm Convention and the PIC Circular from December 2016. The qualitative data analysis software MaxQDA was used to identify gender keyword mentions in all the documents, which were reviewed individually for context to confirm their relevance to this study.7 IUCN GGO\u2019s gender keyword dictionary includes a set of 95 terms in English, Spanish and French that are grouped into eight broad categories: gender, sex, female, woman, women, girl, equity and equality.8 The gender keyword dictionary includes multiple forms and all the variations of keywords to ensure counting of every mention; for example, the terms gender, genders, gendered and gender-based were included in the search, among others, to capture all instances of discussion related to gender. 9 STOCKHOLM CONVENTION ARTICLES PERTAINING TO GENDER CONSIDERATIONS AND WOMEN\u2019S PARTICIPATION STOCKHOLM CONVENTION ARTICLE 7 (2): IMPLEMENTATION PLANS The Parties shall, where appropriate, cooperate directly or through global, regional and subregional organisations, and consult their national stakeholders, including women\u2019s groups and groups involved in the health of children, in order to facilitate the development, implementation and updating of their implementation plans.

A few documents were excluded due to language barriers. \u2022 A few documents were excluded due to technical reasons. \u2022 The most recent National Reports from each Party to the Stockholm and Basel Conventions are included; however, many Parties have not updated these documents recently (e.g. Basel Convention National Reports in this study range from 2001 to 2015) and as such, they may not provide up-to-date information on how Parties are incorporating gender into their work. \u2022 At the time of this study, the submission of the 2015 National Report to the Basel Convention is still on-going. Therefore, the 2015 National Reports include only those transmitted by 15 March 2017. \u2022 The Rotterdam Convention does not have a reporting mechanism for Parties that could be analysed for this study. 11 Total members: 12 Total observers: 9 42% Women 58% Men 11% Women 89% Men Indicator 1: Current membership of Convention Committees BASEL CONVENTION ICC This study includes an analysis of the participants of a recent Basel Convention ICC meeting that took place in Nairobi, Kenya, on 4-6 June 2016; this was the 12th meeting of the ICC.

As Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s NIP explains, women are more vulnerable to hazardous chemicals because they generally have a higher proportion of fatty tissue, which is where dangerous chemicals are stored, and because of the biological structure of their reproductive system. The Stockholm Convention acknowledges women\u2019s vulnerability to POPs in the preamble of the Convention text and many Parties have reflected it in their initial NIPs. Tanzania\u2019s NIP notes that, \u201cit is well documented 23 that women and children are mostly affected by POPs\u201d and explains that children are exposed directly or indirectly through their mothers, which may affect their development. Acknowledging women\u2019s vulnerability to POPs is essential toward the adoption of gender- responsive actions, which include as a first step identifying and responding to the different needs of men and women at all levels. Of the 62 countries\u2019 NIPs that identify women as vulnerable, 38 include activities to address gender gaps that are often systemic, mainly targeting women in educational and public awareness programmes on POPs (this will be further discussed later in the report). In a significant number of NIPs, pregnant and nursing women are considered as a sub-group of women because they are even more vulnerable to the adverse effects of POPs. Fetuses and babies are particularly vulnerable, and women can transfer POPs through the placenta and their breast milk. As the NIP from Nauru explains, women tend to accumulate POPs more readily than men, in part because \u201cpregnancy and breast-feeding draw on maternal bodily fat reserves, so POPs are readily transmitted to infants.\u201d As a recommendation, the NIPs from Denmark, Finland and Sweden, advise women of childbearing age, pregnant women and nursing mothers to limit their consumption of fish, which can contain high quantities of POPs such as dioxins. Women as beneficiaries The NIPs from 49 countries (33%) consider women as beneficiaries of actions in the management of POPs. As previously mentioned, the Stockholm Convention encourages the implementation of educational awareness programmes for women, children and the least educated on POPs management and effects of POPs on health, explicitly identifying women as one of the beneficiaries of these programmes. Reflecting on the Stockholm Convention, many countries identify women as one of the target groups of such actions and include actions and programmes on educational and public awareness, including the creation of informative leaflets, training workshops and audio-visual education programmes. Examples of the identification of women as beneficiaries include the following: Mali\u2019s NIP remarks that the strengthening of all the actors relevant to POPs will be done with environmental information and education, as well as formal and informal training for all the social strata, particularly women and young people, with the aim of obtaining their support and active participation in the implementation of environmental protection actions. 24 The NIP from the Philippines mentions the Pesticide Safety Awareness Symposium for Farm Women that took place in different regions during 2012. Women were the primary participants and benefited from the symposium about the safe and prudent management of pesticides and food safety control. Women as stakeholders Fifty-two countries\u2019 NIPs (35%) identify women as stakeholders in the management of POPs. Based upon the Stockholm Convention, many countries\u2019 NIPs mention Article 7, which encourages Parties to consult national stakeholders, including women\u2019s groups, in all phases of the implementation process. Following the requirements of the Convention, many Parties have appointed women\u2019s organisations, associations and/or ministries as implementing agents of specific activities and programmes of the NIP, and others have included these entities in the planning of the NIP (this will be further discussed in the section on gender equality integration in the NIPs). The recognition of women and women\u2019s groups as stakeholders in the decision making process has been included by some countries. For example: Bolivia remarks that gender equality is a national priority and a cornerstone for the NIP implementation, as women\u2019s participation has been taken into account in the development of the NIP.

The organisations and ministries are generally listed in the annexes or in the background section of the NIP. The Parties have listed these organisations as stakeholders in the developing process of the NIP but many do not specify their roles in the process. Sixteen countries\u2019 documents (11%) identify women\u2019s organisations or ministries as implementing partners of NIPs activities (Figure 20). Many of the Parties identify women\u2019s organisations as the only partner of specific activities, sometimes within a section on the role of NGOs. For example: Zambia includes the organisation Women for Change that advocates for \u201cpolicies and practices that are gender sensitive, just and effectively respond to the plight of the vulnerable in society.\u201d The Dominican Republic highlights the role of a women\u2019s organisation, Mujeres Dominicanas en Desarrollo (MUDE), which works towards the empowerment of low-income communities, especially women, by offering environmental capacity building and other services that include information on the effects of pesticides. Between 1997 and 1999 this organisation implemented the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)/Global Environment Facility (GEF)/ Small Grants Programme (SGP) Pesticides Pollution Project in two regions, conducting workshops to create awareness on the need to protect the environment from pesticide pollution. Based on their initial NIPs, OECD and non-OECD Eurasia are the only regions from which no Parties include women\u2019s organisations or ministries as implementing agencies. Women\u2019s empowerment and gender equality inclusion in objectives and goals Twelve countries\u2019 documents (8%) include women\u2019s empowerment or gender mainstreaming as part of a larger goal or objective in their initial NIP (Figure 20). Parties mainly identify women as a vulnerable group that should be a recipient of education, awareness and training programmes. For example: Egypt\u2019s NIP identifies as a priority raising the awareness of women and children on POPs and the training of several groups, including women.

At the international level, the Stockholm Convention is the flagship on the advancement of gender equality in the chemical field. Sixty-two countries (41%) mention or quote international policy frameworks in their initial NIP, mainly Articles 7 and 10 of the Stockholm Convention. A few of them include references to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), specifically MDG5 on the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women, and recognise how NIPs contribute to their achievement. However, most of these documents only quote the Convention text or the MDG target and do not explain further the relation between these texts and the advancement of gender equality. Twenty-nine documents (19%) mention national gender policies or other national policies or plans that include a gender aspect in the context of the NIP. The incorporation of national plans and policies that include women and/or gender equality indicates there may be a provision for the mainstreaming of gender within the implementation of the NIP and illustrates that the NIP is not created in a vacuum, but it is interlinked with other action plans. Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s NIP is the only one to include an entire section on the importance of mainstreaming gender. This section introduces Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s Law on Gender Equality and highlights the importance of advancing gender and conducting gender analyses before planning activities, in order to develop a gender responsive NIP. While it indicates commitment to mainstream gender in the activities, Bosnia and Herzegovina clarifies that the lack of sex-disaggregated data has limited the activities focused on gender, a gap that will be improved in the updates of the NIP. Activities to support gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment As previously mentioned, the Stockholm Convention recommends that Parties consult their national stakeholders, including women, for the development, implementation and updating of their NIP, and encourages the development of education and public awareness programmes on POPs for women, children and those who are the least educated. This analysis examines whether or not a NIP includes activities that aim to advance gender equality, keeping in mind the articles of the Stockholm Convention. Fifty-eight NIPs (39%) include at least one activity that aims to empower women and/or mainstream gender equality. Most of the activities follow Article 10 of the Stockholm Convention and include women as one of the recipients of 28 education and public awareness programmes, which include training, awareness raising workshops and information campaigns on POPs. For example: Egypt incorporates several activities to raise awareness on POPs, especially targeting women and children, and to train different groups, including women\u2019s organisations, on how to deal with these pollutants. One of these training workshops for women was conducted by the National Women Council in 2004 and dealt with the health impact of POPs. In this case, women are characterised as beneficiaries and stakeholders in the implementation of Egypt\u2019s NIP. A few countries\u2019 NIPs identify as an activity the analysis of POPs accumulation on women to create a baseline and assess the impact of chemicals on human beings; for example, Bulgaria includes several activities on conducting research on the accumulation levels of POPs in women. Despite that 35% of the Parties\u2019 NIPs identify women as stakeholders, as previously presented, fewer countries consider them as stakeholders of the activities actually proposed in the NIP. For example, Mexico\u2019s NIP includes an activity that advocates for the inclusion of a gender perspective when involving the public and private actors in the implementation of the NIP. In some cases, women\u2019s organisations are the implementing agencies of specific activities. For example, the organisation Women Environment Preservation Committee (WEPCO) in Nepal is responsible for the empowerment of women to manage solid wastes in their communities. Budgeting of gender- or women-focused activities Seventeen countries (11%) allocate a budget to gender- or women-focused activities in their initial NIP. The budgeted activities include education and awareness raising projects, assessment of women\u2019s needs, training and investigations on the accumulation of POPs on women. Examples of activities with allocated budget include: Pakistan\u2019s NIP incorporates an activity to develop and implement strategic interventions to address the capacity needs of women\u2019s groups, among others, and facilitate awareness-raising activities. Sudan, more specifically, aims to create a new alternative project to replace current cooking facilities and practices in the household, including women\u2019s organisations, universities and research institutions in the process.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11912f7a-abcd-4c88-8676-41bf79ffe42a": {"__data__": {"id_": "11912f7a-abcd-4c88-8676-41bf79ffe42a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/womens-participation-and-gender-considerations-country-representation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women\u2019s participation and gender considerations in country representation, planning and reporting to the BRS Conventions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/womens-participation-and-gender-considerations-country-representation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c537a11bf8376d970a0f25a6ddc354aa8a03e3f06c00ab7671fca3032d4e65fe"}, "2": {"node_id": "2c1d3c17-f0a5-4d52-bdf0-d44603ca3639", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/womens-participation-and-gender-considerations-country-representation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a61e80f175d47b9d73b7a17d62fd637324948be312514c9adf1206e22eb991d"}}, "hash": "a803165baec76b81272e5ec9cfb076cb85e835e01421e6334d546f9ab159175d", "text": "Monitoring and evaluation efforts in gender- or women-focused activities Two countries include M&E mechanisms in their initial NIP, both of them related to the existence of POPs in humans and their harmful effects.

Gender analysis This category refers to whether or not the NIPs mention the need for a gender analysis and whether or not they conducted one for the development of the NIP. Two countries acknowledge the need for the inclusion of a gender analysis but none of them has included an analysis in its initial NIP. Ghana lists gender analysis as one of the areas of expertise needed for the implementation of the national priorities regarding the implementation of the NIP. Bosnia and Herzegovina explains in detail in its NIP the characteristics and phases of a gender analysis, using as a reference the guidelines for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment from the United Nations International Development Organization (UNIDO). The country includes gender analysis of laws, strategies and action plans as one of the commitments of its Law on Gender Equality and its Gender Action Plan. Gender indicators and sex-disaggregated data The majority of Parties (70%) use sex- disaggregated data in some way in their initial NIP. Twelve NIPs include data on the number of women that have participated in POPs analyses and/or the percentage of women affected by determined hazardous chemicals. However, most of the Parties use sex-disaggregated data in relation to demographics and background information of the country. These include disaggregated breakdown of general population, expected lifespan by sex, fertility rates, pregnancy rates, education and enrolment rates by sex, and employment breakdown by sex. Four countries\u2019 NIPs (3%) have gender indicators to measure the outcome of the activities proposed in the document. All of them are directly related to Article 10 of the Stockholm Convention and refer to activities to educate and create public awareness, especially for women, on the impact of POPs. Two of these indicators only include the sub-group of pregnant and nursing women. Latvia\u2019s indicators include pregnant women informed about the potential risks of consuming fatty fish from the Baltic Sea during pregnancy. Lithuania\u2019s indicators similarly include information to pregnant and nursing women on the harmful effects of POPs and the methods to prevent exposure. Malawi\u2019s NIP includes as an indicator the existence of specific media education programs, including for women and children. Morocco includes the sensitisation of women and other groups regarding POPs as an indicator in its initial NIP. 30 60% Do not include mention of POPs and women\u2019s health 40% Include mention of POPs and women\u2019s health CROSSCUTTING THEME: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION ON POPS AND WOMEN Key findings: \u2022 40% of NIPs analysed (60 countries\u2019 documents) include references to health impacts of POPs on women \u2022 16% of NIPs analysed (24 countries\u2019 documents) mention specific cases where women are in direct contact with POPs As noted, POPs bioaccumulate in fatty tissues, and it is scientifically proven that the most vulnerable groups, without considering the exposure factor, are women, children and fetuses. This section discusses the crosscutting theme of the health impact of POPs on women as noted in initial NIPs, especially in cases where women are in direct contact with these chemicals due to their gender roles and livelihoods. As discussed in many NIPs, clinical tests on women\u2019s breast milk, blood and fatty tissues are indicators of how POPs are affecting humans in different communities. Figure 21: Percentage of 150 initial NIPs that mention effects of POPs specifically on women\u2019s health 31 Sixty countries (40%) include references to the impacts of POPs on women\u2019s health in their initial NIPs. In this context, countries acknowledge the existence of POPs in humans and highlight their harmful effects, especially on women. Some Parties mention prior analyses of POPs and women, while others aim to conduct future studies as part of their NIP\u2019s activities. For example: Kyrgyzstan explains in its NIP that breast milk of women living in the region of Osh tested positive for four different POPs in 35% of samples in 1992 and in 56.4% of samples in 2001; the concentration of these pesticides was up to 10 times higher in summer.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ea456de-aaa7-47ea-9841-f3d062e5eafa": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ea456de-aaa7-47ea-9841-f3d062e5eafa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/womens-participation-and-gender-considerations-country-representation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women\u2019s participation and gender considerations in country representation, planning and reporting to the BRS Conventions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/womens-participation-and-gender-considerations-country-representation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43f451753ede20cdff51aba2a140bc66b19a234bd3c5ca018ab82068e365618a"}, "2": {"node_id": "529892de-e98b-4535-a94a-5fe240892950", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/womens-participation-and-gender-considerations-country-representation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "185d97d367138d91cacc6f1ad9de57e69ed0ed98f6ca616722b98d69e076e83c"}}, "hash": "66addd5c9ebbe403319905cd0b1cfd6416adff34683126eccac62ca15b5c3096", "text": "They associate this increase with the fact that the Osh population is growing vegetables and fruits for consumption on the land, in the land where cotton and tobacco plantations were until 1995.

Croatia points out in its NIP that samples must be representative of both men and women and must be taken in all regions of the country. INDIGENOUS PEOPLES OF THE ARCTIC Despite the small population living in the Arctic and the limited industrial production, POPs have been found in the region. The persistence of POPs over a long period of time and their ability to be transported by air and water contribute to their spreading on a global scale. In Canada, indigenous people from the north are more vulnerable due to their consumption of traditional food. \u201cScientific evidence show that\u201d breast milk of Inuit women contains up to nine times higher levels of POPs than breast milk of women living in southern Canada. Due to POPs biomagnification process, animals at the top of the food chain accumulate more pollutants, posing a significant hazard for humans who are at the top of that chain. 32 POPs released into the environment can be transported by air and water currents and affect ecosystems situated far away, with increased impact on women and children. In addition to the exposure of POPs in the environment, women are in direct contact with POPs through their jobs and/or gendered division of labour. Twenty-four NIPs (16%) identify cases in which women are in direct contact with POPs in their communities. Nine countries\u2019 documents (6%) identify women as resource managers, mainly in agriculture, often noting that women\u2019s direct exposure to POPs is related to their role as agriculture (particularly fish smoking) managers. As Bosnia and Herzegovina explains, women are exposed to chemicals in the health sector due to their professional roles as nurses and pharmacists. In many cases, women are unknowingly in contact with these hazardous chemicals. In Benin, women\u2019s role in smoking fish contributes to the inhalation of fumes, partly because of poor infrastructure and indoor air pollution. The lack of awareness on the harmful effects of POPs makes practices such as smoking fish or burning wires\u2014which, in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, is mainly done by women and children\u2014common among these vulnerable groups. 33 Indicator 6: National Reports to the Stockholm Convention The National Reports prepared and transmitted by Parties to the Stockholm Convention report on actions associated with Convention texts and decisions and update on the progress of the National Implementation Plan (see section above). National reporting is supported by questionnaires and guidance supplied by the Conventions Secretariat. The First National Report questionnaire template does not include any questions directly asking about inclusion of gender considerations. For the Second and Third National Reports, the questionnaire template asks specifically about activities proposed under Article 10 of the Convention, including the \u201cdevelopment and implementation, especially for women, children and the least educated, of educational and public awareness programmes on persistent organic pollutants, as well as on their health and environmental effects and on their alternatives.\u201dXX This study analyses how many Parties responded to that particular question, as well as any other instances of women and/or gender keywords. In this dataset, only the most recently transmitted National Report from each Party is included. From the 121 Parties that transmitted at least one National Report, this analysis thus includes, as the most recent from each: 89 Third National Reports, 30 Second National Reports and two First National Reports. INCLUSION OF GENDER KEYWORDS Only those countries reporting via the questionnaire associated with the Second or Third National Report, as indicated above, had the option of \u201cchecking\u201d the box associated with the gender-specific question, i.e. marking that they have taken measures towards the implementation of Article 10 of the Stockholm Convention regarding the development and implementation of educational and public awareness programmes on POPs, especially directed to women, children and least educated. Figure 22 is a flow-chart illustrating the questionnaire process, indicating that there is only one question on social issues, explicitly pertaining to Article 10, and that question must be answered affirmatively before Parties are asked specifically about the inclusion of gender considerations in their work. 34 Article 10.

Fifteen Parties\u2019 reports (12%) did not, whether because their most recent report is the First National Report (i.e., with the First National Report questionnaire; only 2 Parties), or because they did not implement Article 10 in their NIP (13 Parties). Out of the 106 countries that noted compliance with Article 10 in their national reports, 45 Parties\u2019 reports (37% of the total of National Reports) confirmed to have implemented educational and public awareness programmes on POPs, especially for women, children and the least educated, characterising women as beneficiaries. None of these countries\u2019 reports included further references to women and/or gender, either because they did not give further explanations or they did not mention women and/or gender keywords in the comments. Serbia\u2019s Third National Report to the Stockholm Convention is the only report analysed that mentions the keyword gender. Serbia explains that it received funding from the GEF to review and update its National Implementation Plan, with the help of UNIDO, and identifies the consideration of gender aspects in POPs management as one of the overall objectives. 35 Indicator 7: National Reports to the Basel Convention INCLUSION OF GENDER KEYWORDS The National Reports prepared and transmitted by Parties to the Basel Convention report on the actions taken towards the implementation of the Convention texts and on the decisions and actions adopted regarding the export, import, transboundary movements and disposal of hazardous wastes and other wastes. The National Reports to the Basel Convention are transmitted annually via a questionnaire. In addition to questions of a more technical nature requesting information about the volumes of transboundary movements, etc., a section is included on the effects of the generation, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes and other wastes on human health and the environment. Out of the 162 Parties that have transmitted at least one national report to the Basel Convention, only Saint Lucia has included one gender keyword mention in its most recent report. In this example, Saint Lucia updated the information on its Designed Competent Authority and Focal Point, noting that the organisation now responsible for these roles is the Ministry of Education, Innovation, Gender Relations and Sustainable Development, thus identifying the Ministry as an implementing agency. 36 Indicator 8: The Rotterdam Convention PIC Circular The Rotterdam Convention does not have any reporting mechanism per se, but it disseminates a Prior Informed Consent (PIC) Circular biannually to provide Parties with relevant information on chemicals, including decisions adopted by Parties regarding specific chemicals as well as examples of specific environmental and health concerns. The latest Circular from December 2016 included a total of four women and/or gender keywords in the final regulatory action submissions by Brazil and Norway. Brazil\u2019s notification mentions women and/or gender keywords three times in its rationale to ban phorate. The notification cites an incident in India, where 40 rural women experienced phorate poisoning on a tea plantation. Most of these women were severely poisoned and stayed in the hospital for two days. In another mention, the notification by Brazil recognizes that gender is a contributing factor to the increased risk of poisoning by organophosphates. Norway\u2019s notification cites a scientific study on the detection of the chemical Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) levels in women throughout Norway and Russia to inform its decision to severely restrict HBCDD. 37 Discussion and conclusions 12 One goal of the BRS-GAP is to measure the progress in achieving BRS-GAP objectives and implementing activities within the Secretariat, including by collecting measurable information on gender, relating to both qualitative and quantitative indicators. A main purpose for this study, conducted in partnership with the BRS Secretariats, is to support the goals of the BRS-GAP by developing indicators and gathering baseline data on how gender considerations are being incorporated in the work of the Secretariats and Parties to the Conventions and how women are participating in key decision making processes and bodies.12 The results of this study are rather encouraging\u2014 especially with respect to women\u2019s representation as Party delegates at COPs and the inclusion of gender considerations within initial NIPs\u2014as the BRS Secretariats consider the progress being made toward the goals of the BRS-GAP.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b37f7895-16b6-4831-ae60-b3eee633985a": {"__data__": {"id_": "b37f7895-16b6-4831-ae60-b3eee633985a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/womens-participation-and-gender-considerations-country-representation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women\u2019s participation and gender considerations in country representation, planning and reporting to the BRS Conventions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/womens-participation-and-gender-considerations-country-representation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42e29b7200d0100b0ef1f7d7ce1a74f50252a53bb99d89ab203256f8a196721c"}, "2": {"node_id": "7ef075d5-28ef-4418-9b99-0fd3833a1555", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/womens-participation-and-gender-considerations-country-representation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf566ba4f37d10f42619dd3d489218ceb8cbeee301dad396061c0eaf8b43b4be"}}, "hash": "e8c39fc254fd553e4f5e3d898c6c1bbc3cfae54ef728da14f038892c856a5572", "text": "Key areas in which the Secretariat is striving toward successes are reflected in the BRS-GAP goals relating to gender parity: incorporating gender equality in the standard operating procedures (SOPs), specifically encouraging women to participate in meetings and training activities, and promoting", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2b5017b-7be5-4ebd-a46b-8b1cf0cd4e47": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2b5017b-7be5-4ebd-a46b-8b1cf0cd4e47", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/womens-participation-and-gender-considerations-country-representation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women\u2019s participation and gender considerations in country representation, planning and reporting to the BRS Conventions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/womens-participation-and-gender-considerations-country-representation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "797fa42579b57265f3245c6a375d064208d4f45ec40f6ba583e088a42e865c3f"}}, "hash": "797fa42579b57265f3245c6a375d064208d4f45ec40f6ba583e088a42e865c3f", "text": "gender balanced participation in meetings of the Conferences of the Parties and subsidiary bodies is clearly having impact. The data shows that although there is room for further improvement, strides have been made in these areas. Of Party delegates to the 2015 COPs, 45% were women, a 5% increase from 2013 and remarkably close to gender parity. Similarly, 42% or more of the members to the BRS Committees in 2016 were women. Committee members must be experts in the field, and thus the high percentage of women represented is particularly noteworthy for women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. A staggering number of initial NIPs (91%) contain women and/or gender keywords that point to some recognition of how women and men are impacted differently by chemical management in the action planning for the sound management of POPs. Many Parties characterise women as vulnerable by acknowledging their physiological vulnerability to POPs, in some cases including clinical tests on women\u2019s breast milk and fatty tissue, indicating the recognition of the differentiated impact of hazardous chemicals on women and men. Many Parties, complying with Articles 7 and 10, characterise women as stakeholders and as beneficiaries of educational and public awareness activities. However, the participation of women or women\u2019s organisations in the development of the NIP or their apparent leading role in environmental activities is limited, and only a few consider women\u2019s engagement and gender considerations as an objective. This indicates that Parties acknowledge women\u2019s vulnerability and the differentiated impacts on women and men but are not fully integrating or mainstreaming gender considerations within their initial NIPs. 38 Parties evaluate how their NIPs are implemented via their National Report to the Stockholm Convention, in which 37% of Parties confirm to have implemented educational and public awareness programmes, especially for women, complying with Article 10. Despite the percentage being similar to the amount of women-related activities in the NIPs, 19 Parties that mentioned these activities in the NIP did not indicate in their National Report that they have implemented them; similarly, 26 Parties did not include any reference to women-related activities in their NIP but have implemented them according to their National Report. RECOMMENDATIONS In considering this data and the goals of the BRS-GAP, some recommendations for fully embracing gender entry points within this work can be considered. As the data from this report indicates, the participation of women in the scientific committees and in the COPs is noteworthy, and the BRS Secretariat should continue supporting women\u2019s participation at all levels, encouraging Parties to include qualified women and men in their delegations and as Committee members. The BRS Secretariat likewise can ensure information sharing and promotion of documentation across women\u2019s organisations and networks to broaden stakeholder understanding and engagement, to complement Party representation. Additional future studies, including long-term monitoring of the indicators developed here as well as studies exploring other aspects of this work, i.e. the connections and relationships between NIPs and national level strategies on sustainability and strategies on women, can support the goals of the BRS-GAP. Another goal of the BRS-GAP is to include gender-related information in the reporting/ evaluating forms and format. The BRS Conventions have different procedures and reporting mechanisms, and therefore the initiatives to better mainstream gender equality in the BRS should be tailor-made. This study finds that there are some available entry points to include gender in order to promote the success of this goal. The format of the national report questionnaires, adopted by the COP, shapes Parties\u2019 understanding of and capacity to include gender considerations, especially since they are largely tailored to the text of the Convention. This is particularly obvious in National Reports to the Basel Convention, for which the National Report format does not ask any questions pertaining to gender or social issues and, as such, Parties are not reporting on any gender work they may or may not be doing. The National Report questionnaire for the Stockholm Convention only includes one question on social issues, and the question must be answered affirmatively before Parties are prompted to a follow-up question that asks about their gender-related work. However, as the 39 results show, none of the Parties has given further information in relation to that question. Capacity building around the importance of including gender considerations in reporting mechanisms can be very useful to raise awareness among Parties, especially since the Secretariat has limited influence in the adjustment of the national reporting format. Similarly, many Parties transmitted their initial NIP prior to the development of the BRS-GAP, and since it is an informative document, Parties are not required to include gender considerations in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6df917f4-27f8-41f8-81c3-758cbca635c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "6df917f4-27f8-41f8-81c3-758cbca635c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/womens-participation-and-gender-considerations-country-representation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women\u2019s participation and gender considerations in country representation, planning and reporting to the BRS Conventions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/womens-participation-and-gender-considerations-country-representation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b226300659d78f125f05b9ee37543e8b49e753fbf53c3b1b5faf56be2979bfc"}, "3": {"node_id": "d2b557f2-90cd-4b13-b25e-c391748bef87", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/womens-participation-and-gender-considerations-country-representation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69367db519e7c66cc6120195ea3585f5d9f78bf1553bf69d9530b5d99da616d9"}}, "hash": "5bbf8c8482114d4b9789757f0736a9bfc6973b9a974ea2ae62edbde74421c9c9", "text": "the updates of their NIPs. As the data of the report indicates, previous efforts to mainstream gender considerations in relation to chemicals have yielded results, and Parties have expressed concerns about women\u2019s vulnerability and the harmful impact of hazardous chemicals on them in their initial NIPs. In this vein, many Parties to the Stockholm Convention have complied with Articles 7 and 10 in their NIP, showing an interest in including gender considerations in future work. The BRS Secretariat, with the help of the Gender Task Team, and with consideration of the upcoming socio-economic guidance on NIPs development and guidance from the GEF implementing agencies which rely on the GEF gender policy and action plan, can support the inclusion of gender considerations as part of one of the future NIP addendum. The development of specific Gender Action Plan components to the NIPs (and associated capacity building) could be taken into consideration in future updates of the BRS-GAP. If the BRS Secretariat hopes to learn more about the gender work Parties are conducting as part of their commitments to the Conventions, reporting mechanisms should request this information and provide Parties the opportunity to explain these aspects of their work. Communication and capacity building are key. The BRS Secretariat has recognised the importance of training and developing the skills of the BRS staff on gender issues, as well as of supporting awareness-raising and outreach activities with partners to and stakeholders of the Conventions. These efforts should be strengthened, and capacity building and training should be supported at all levels, both internally and externally. Communications strategies can also support these goals. The results from this report were presented at a side event, Lessons and best practices integrating gender into the implementation of the BRS Conventions, at the 2017 COPs. Side events such as these are important opportunities for information sharing, awareness raising, capacity building and building collaborations. Through side event dialogue, as elsewhere, questions around and recommendations for further technical training, financial support, and partnering opportunities may propel further advancements in BRS-GAP implementation\u2014and toward enhanced implementation efforts that serve the needs, protect, and improve the lives and livelihoods of women and men worldwide. COPs should continue to feature side events specifically discussing gender considerations, highlighting new research and projects successfully implemented. 40 References I.

that yield numerous ecological, economic, and social benefits. Many countries have made large-scale commitments under the Bonn Challenge, a global effort to bring 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested land into restoration by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030. Achieving this commitment requires decision-makers to address the diverse ecological, socio- political, and economic factors that impact restoration efforts at different scales. With such large targets, it is challenging to determine where to begin \u2013 and how to approach \u2013 the restoration process. The Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) was designed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the World Resources Institute (WRI) to provide a framework for countries and regions to identify, analyze, and prioritize restoration opportunities in order to develop a suite of restoration strategies for particular contexts. From May 2016 to March 2017, the Environmental Leadership & Training Initiative (ELTI) of the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies and IUCN conducted a series of six online courses, entitled \u201cForest Landscape Restoration in the Tropics.\u201d ELTI and IUCN offered these courses in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French to 125 environmental practitioners from over 30 countries. The objectives of this collaboration were to develop the capacity of diverse practitioners working on FLR in tropical developing countries, support future leaders of FLR and ROAM initiatives, and accelerate action on FLR and ROAM to meet countries\u2019 pledges to the Bonn Challenge. The course presented ROAM as a broad framework alongside academic knowledge and applied experience in FLR to provide individuals involved with FLR policy, planning, and implementation with a foundation to address a range of objectives in their restoration initiatives. This booklet includes a collection of inspirational stories from alumni of the ELTI- IUCN online courses that illustrate the diverse ways in which they have made profound and positive impacts that they attribute to their participation in these courses. The stories are featured on ELTI\u2019s website at elti.yale.edu and IUCN\u2019s website at iucn. org/forest. \u2014 3 \u2014 ROAM Workshop in La Zafra, Antioquia, Colombia in October 2016.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c010a4c2-6132-4184-9f73-67b21addabe4": {"__data__": {"id_": "c010a4c2-6132-4184-9f73-67b21addabe4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/leaders-action-achieving-forest-landscape-restoration-through-online", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Leaders in action : achieving forest landscape restoration through online learning", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/leaders-action-achieving-forest-landscape-restoration-through-online", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5fddda41ddf34213d4b2337961d5f36ae35688972365a8887a3ae470665829be"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7cb864b-c1dc-46f9-8487-fa692a189314", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/leaders-action-achieving-forest-landscape-restoration-through-online", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5014394398303cfb280a5f202c74b644de9dd6bb91acc42d6f7dcd9cfecfa82a"}}, "hash": "7485527b4c4d9a0f8b4d8f063b8c13f8462e3e6a7c68f68cd2efa147110a072f", "text": "Photo includes IUCN Staff members Mirjam Kuzee and James McBreen along with ELTI-IUCN Course Participants David Echeverri L\u00f3pez and Tal\u00eda Waldr\u00f3n (featured on page 8) \u2014 \u00a9 Paola Isaacs ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors of this book would like to thank Mirjam Kuzee (IUCN), Gillian Bloomfield (ELTI) and Karin Bucht (ELTI), for their pivotal role in this partnership to bring the ELTI-IUCN Online Training Series and this book of stories to fruition.

As the population continues to grow, the same amount of land must feed more people, increasing pressures on land and other resources. \u201cThe land has no time to rest,\u201d says Alphonse Polisi, the Director for Environment and Climate Change in Burundi\u2019s Office for Protection of the Environment (OBPE). \u201cSo", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "130d0a8f-81df-4cc6-8c57-40bba799df7b": {"__data__": {"id_": "130d0a8f-81df-4cc6-8c57-40bba799df7b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/leaders-action-achieving-forest-landscape-restoration-through-online", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Leaders in action : achieving forest landscape restoration through online learning", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/leaders-action-achieving-forest-landscape-restoration-through-online", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37481a2120bd43704ed8d20a82d99bf36fb65b446c735f9e07fce3a4da177f35"}, "3": {"node_id": "6dfa35eb-3f07-4b5f-8cc5-52f82c52f6df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/leaders-action-achieving-forest-landscape-restoration-through-online", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32b310f4d49e0aeab0a74da7c2f38c3c960012701f9091bfb6304452a1604549"}}, "hash": "a8ff7afe4f62ee68944fbfac8da4e11dfa4bb71b35b9b759e0ff17ad46d6aaa3", "text": "we are working at the national level to raise awareness and restore landscapes that must continue to perform under growing pressure.\u201d Alphonse believes the national government has a responsibility to promote more sustainable land- use decisions. He took the ELTI-IUCN online course Forest Landscape Restoration in the Tropics in October 2016 to expand his ability to guide and support the successful implementation of restoration opportunities. The ELTI-IUCN course helped open Alphonse\u2019s eyes to the importance of holistically planning environmental management projects across institutions at the national level, and the identification and engagement of stakeholders throughout the process. ALPHONSE POLISI Alphonse Polisi \u2014 \u00a9 Alain I was very much interested in the discussion of stakeholder identification; everyone has knowledge and value to add to opportunities on the ground. Stakeholders must take the lead at the landscape level. They\u2019re a prerequisite for the success of our restoration opportunities. \u2013ALPHONSE POLISI Along with improving stakeholder engagement, Alphonse has led an effort to gather and consolidate data from environmental management projects at the national level. \u201cWe have involved 34 groups from different sectors, including ministries, NGOs, private organizations and associations: a task force for the national program of landscape restoration,\u201d he says. \u201cThrough this program, the department of environment and climate change will compile data, practices, and technical guidelines.\u201d The database from this effort will support many objectives. It will allow the OBPE to monitor and coordinate landscape restoration at the national level. All restoration project and program planners will have access to the data, so they can learn from other partners\u2019 approaches. Finally, it will allow Burundi to report on commitments, such as the Bonn Challenge. \u201cWe have received an enthusiastic response to our efforts to coordinate FLR and provide a channel for exchange on FLR at the national level,\u201d says Alphonse. \u201cWe are proud to position the OBPE as an institution to relay information on matters of environmental protection and, hopefully, help to restore the land\u2019s productivity.\u201d Alphonse discussing achievements with the Minister of Water, Environment, Land Management and Urban Planning during Environment Week \u2014 \u00a9 Alphonse Polisi Acknowledgments Alphonse would like to thank IUCN for the tools and documents they have produced, and the World Bank and IUCN who are working with the Government of Burundi on the current landscape restoration effort. \u2014 6 \u2014 EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AFRICAN COUNTRIES IMPLEMENT AND COLLABORATE ON FLR Numerous countries in eastern and southern Africa have demonstrated interest in FLR, making commitments to international goals such as the Bonn Challenge and supporting regional initiatives including AFR100. To translate these pledges into action, participating institutions need appropriate technical support and improved communication. Charles Karangwa, IUCN\u2019s Regional FLR Hub Coordinator for eastern and southern Africa, works with different countries to enable cross- institutional planning for the restoration of degraded landscapes. In May of 2016, Charles enrolled in the online course Forest Landscape Restoration in the Tropics to improve his knowledge and technical skills in FLR, and expand his professional impact. After the course, Charles felt more confident to \u201cbring a cross- institutional approach to FLR in different countries. I believe we will be more successful when governments, supporting institutions and local stakeholders can come together to apply ROAM to identify our restoration opportunities and the interventions that are best suited to achieving their goals. It also makes a huge difference while developing a restoration implementation strategy.\u201d Policy and decision makers need to consider the landscapes we all depend on. Forest landscape restoration is not only about forests but includes agricultural and pasture lands, catchments, water bodies, mangroves, and more. \u2013CHARLES KARANGWA CHARLES KARANGWA Charles Karangwa planting bamboo to protect Sebeya River bank in Rwanda \u2014 \u00a9 IUCN Charles has worked to raise awareness about ROAM in different forums at regional and national levels.

Many groups have become involved, including: the Regional Autonomous Corporation of the Negro and Nare Rivers (CORNARE), a government environmental authority; the Eastern Catholic University; and the Alexander von Humboldt Biological Resources Research Institute (\u2018Humboldt\u2019). Two representatives from those institutions \u2013 David Echeverri L\u00f3pez, Biologist with the Forests and Biodiversity Group of CORNARE, and Tal\u00eda Waldr\u00f3n, Adjunct Researcher at Humboldt \u2013 felt that an FLR approach offered the flexibility necessary to support Antioquia\u2019s approximately 300,000 residents and advance their restoration and sustainable production goals. DAVID ECHEVERRI L\u00d3PEZ AND TAL\u00cdA WALDR\u00d3N FLR has strong potential for advancing peace in Antioquia.

For example, when he first began working with the government of Burundi, he focused on the Ministry of Water, Environment, Land Management and Urban Planning. After the course, he realized that the success of ROAM and FLR required the effective involvement of a broader array of institutions, ranging from more government ministries to organizations such as the World Bank. \u201cROAM and FLR are inherently multi-sectorial and multi-disciplinary,\u201d says Elie. \u201cThis multi-stakeholder approach better ensures broader FLR buy-in, and a more productive relationship between actors.\u201d Elie and his colleagues have supported the government of Burundi to establish a National FLR Taskforce and National FLR Program. This program will coordinate, monitor and report on FLR initiatives at national and international levels. Also, they\u2019re developing a consultation framework through which partner organizations can report their work implementing FLR in Burundi, a step toward greater coordination. \u201cWe expect this framework will help ensure that FLR investments continuously improve soil erosion control, soil productivity, food security, economic opportunity, and increase carbon sequestration capacity in support of climate change mitigation,\u201d he says.

The plan includes restoring degraded forest landscapes to generate income in an environmentally sustainable way. One actor in that effort is Gustavo Gatti, Director of Conserve Brasil, a Brazilian consulting firm. Conserve Brasil helped Imazon \u2013 a non-profit with decades of history working to conserve the Amazon rainforest \u2013 to define the key success factors of FLR in the Paragominas municipality and in the State of Par\u00e1, and to compile the restoration opportunities for the State of Par\u00e1. Gustavo took the ELTI-IUCN course Forest Landscape Restoration in the Tropics to expand his capacity to develop and execute restoration strategies and assessments based on ROAM. For Gustavo, the course\u2019s timing was perfect. While he was participating in the lectures and online discussions, he was able to apply the subject matter to his consulting engagements. GUSTAVO GATTI Gustavo Gatti \u2014 \u00a9 Luiz Renato Corr\u00eaa It is very important to work at the landscape level.

This can be done in a way that improves ecosystem services while also enhancing the productivity of these areas. This was a big outcome from the course.\u201d To advance this multifaceted view of restoration outcomes and techniques, Jairon and his team created a series of \u2018restoration handouts.\u2019 Each handout describes a different restoration technique \u2013 alley crops, windbreaks, home gardens, forage banks \u2013 and includes real examples from across the region, some of which are still active. \u201cThe information I learned in the course has proven very valuable,\u201d Jairon enthuses. \u201cIt augmented my work monitoring restoration work through geographic information systems, and facilitated my ability to develop the restoration handouts.

Koffi Etienne found the course\u2019s detailed exploration of the ROAM process especially helpful, and appreciated the opportunity to gain insights into strategies and perspectives from other participants.

One veteran of these challenges, Martha San Rom\u00e1n, Director of Environmental Policy for the Administration of Environment and Natural Resources of the State of Campeche, took the ELTI- IUCN course Forest Landscape Restoration in the Tropics to expand her capacity to plan and oversee policies relating to landscape-level restoration. \u201cBefore the course, I was worried the material would be too technical for me. I am not a forest engineer nor a biologist,\u201d Martha shares. \u201cHowever, now that I have completed the course, I can say that anyone involved in decision-making in this field can and should take it.\u201d After completing the course, Martha integrated elements from the ELTI-IUCN course into a three-day workshop for the state\u2019s Annual Operating Program (POA) for Environmental Policy Administration. Martha guided discussions on topics such as: mapping; multi- stakeholder engagement; bringing together multiple sectors; and taking a comprehensive approach to setting environmental MARTHA SAN ROM\u00c1N Restoration does not exclude harvesting from the land.

That inclusive, integrated approach led to outcomes such as an unprecedented collaboration between the decision makers of Campeche\u2019s agricultural and environmental sectors. \u201cToday, the Administration of Rural Development is one of our biggest allies in managing the implementation of a Fire Prevention Program,\u201d Martha enthuses. \u201cField burning for agriculture and livestock raising is a large barrier to sustainable land use and restoration in the Yucatan peninsula. This program\u2019s assertive planning is one of our team\u2019s biggest achievements, and a big step toward more sustainable land use.\u201d Firefighters honored for their role in fighting forest fires in April 2017 as part of the Fire Prevention Program for Agricultural Activities in Campeche, Mexico \u2014 \u00a9 Semarnat Campeche Acknowledgments Martha would like to thank the Governor of Campeche, Alejandro Moreno C\u00e1rdenas, and the Secretary of the Environment and Natural Resources of Campeche, Roberto Alcal\u00e1, for their support, trust and motivation. \u2014 20 \u2014 REGIONAL FORESTER CONNECTS WITH NATIONAL PEERS, SCALES UP RESTORATION EFFORTS IN PERU Deforestation in Peru\u2019s Aguayt\u00eda River Watershed increased dramatically after the construction of the Federico Basadre highway in the 1940s.

She took the ELTI-IUCN course Forest Landscape Restoration in the Tropics to expand her understanding of ROAM and her capacity to engage with stakeholders. As the course progressed, Michelle realized how little she knew about landscape-level restoration, and became inspired to study more: \u201cRight now I\u2019m still reading new materials, re-reading course materials, and reviewing the lectures.

Practices such as unsustainable charcoal production and subsistence agriculture have degraded the area\u2019s landscapes and water catchments. In order to address this concern, Moses Egaru, a Program Officer for Water and Biodiversity at IUCN in northern Uganda, is coordinating a drought resilience program that takes a community-led approach. \u201cMy major challenge was linking our efforts in the water and biodiversity program to the communities\u2019 traditional activities and economic needs,\u201d says Moses. He took the online course Forest Landscape Restoration in the Tropics to expand his knowledge and capacity. Moses\u2019s expanded knowledge and increased confidence have begun to show promising results. \u201cFor the people of northern Uganda to adopt any restoration effort at scale, I knew it would have to be low cost,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I\u2019ve coordinated trainings on farmer-managed natural regeneration [FMNR] for three districts: Lira, Otuke, and Alebtong.\u201d The online course helped me to understand the components of FLR, and how to connect actions at the grassroots level to the subnational and national levels in order to influence policy. \u2013MOSES EGARU MOSES EGARU Moses conducting a water quality assessment in Rwizi catchment, southwestern Uganda \u2014 \u00a9 Jasper Obua FMNR doesn\u2019t require capital investments to implement, and helps communities to select tree species with high environmental, cultural, and socio-economic benefits.

Communities in the region have begun to see some of the benefits of restoring degraded landscapes: streams that were seasonal now flow year-round, the protected wetlands give better quality water in larger quantities, and some fishing is even possible. On a larger scale, Moses has set strategic goals: \u201cWe have plenty of potential partners for restoration efforts, but we need a more coordinated approach for Uganda to meet its Bonn Challenge target to restore 2.5 million hectares of degraded and deforested landscapes by 2020. That\u2019s why I\u2019m facilitating the development of landscape-level platforms where all stakeholders, led by government, can plan, share lessons, and engage on FLR.\u201d A typical homestead within the Aswa catchment in northern Uganda.

For help with this task, the Forest Department has commissioned The Nature Conservancy (TNC) Myanmar Program to facilitate the development of reforestation policy, and refine its forest management systems.

Before taking the ELTI-IUCN online course Forest Landscape Restoration in the Tropics, Dr. Mei Xie, Senior Natural Resources Management Specialist, and Paola Agostini, Global Lead for Forests, Landscapes and Ecosystems, at the World Bank, were unsure about how their institution could best support developing countries\u2019 efforts to restore degraded forest landscapes. \u201cWe knew there was a lot that could be done, but we weren\u2019t sure where to focus,\u201d Mei recalls. \u201cThere are many actors governing and using the land in each country. We wanted to understand better how we could involve them in a meaningful way, during both preparation and implementation. Based on what we already knew about ROAM, we believed it would provide a useful framework that could help overcome this and related challenges.\u201d Being an economist, I really enjoyed the course\u2019s discussion on landscape ecology. I\u2019m using the course\u2019s tools and methods in many of the programs I\u2019m working on, from Burundi to Colombia to India. \u2013PAOLA AGOSTINI PAOLA AGOSTINI AND MEI XIE Mei Xie \u2014 \u00a9 Mei Xie At the time, Mei and Paola were producing an online course called Landscape 101, which included a Tools and Methodologies module. They wanted to include ROAM, and wished to learn more about it so they could address questions following their recommendation. They knew that the ELTI-IUCN course would provide a comprehensive learning package about ROAM. The course did not disappoint. In fact, the participants became the presenters of workshops and trainings on the material shortly after completing the course. \u201cIn our face-to-face training event in Kenya in July of 2016, in support of senior project managers and government representatives from 18 countries, I presented the ROAM steps, coupled with a hands- on exercise modified from the contents of the online course,\u201d Mei shares. \u201cIt was well received. Now, more countries have asked to participate.\u201d Mei and Paola are now helping their colleagues and teams to design ROAM training for more countries. The World Bank has sponsored over 20 participants in several more ELTI-IUCN courses, and has since partnered with ELTI and IUCN to deliver a course for World Bank staff.

General Use and Trade Information within the Red List Assessment PiN WORKING PAPER 6 | A proposAl for Assessing speCies benefits At A lAnDsCpe sCAle the Use and trade module within the red list Assessment contains a separate tab where information on non-con- sumptive use of the species can be captured in addition to information collected regarding use and trade. there is also a separate livelihoods tab that is used to capture more de- tailed information on how a species contributes to a specific livelihood. the optional livelihoods tab contains a set of fields for data entry that make up a livelihoods record, defining the area of analysis, type of product from the species, amount of annual harvest, information on users and their level of reli- ance on the product, and an indication of livelihoods value to people (table 2). Multiple livelihoods records may be created to store data on different products associated with a single species and on data from different areas within the range of the species. However, the livelihoods tab is outdated and hardly used as it is not required for red list Assessments. livelihoods variables are only partly covered in the general Use and trade section of the red list Assessment and in the external Use and trade Assessment. some attempts have been made to collate livelihoods data, such as for some freshwater species, but they have not been entered into the sis modules.

Focus on benefits of species use rather than on livelihoods During workshop discussions it was noted that that the term livelihoods, as used within the red list Assessment and sis, refers to the benefits derived by people from the use (i.e. consumptive or extractive) and trade of a species. As such, it is a narrower conceptualization of livelihoods than frameworks utilised within the field of development (e.g. sustainable livelihoods). this led to a decision to move away from using the term livelihoods within the context of sis and instead focus on species benefits, as this provides a more accurate term for what is being documented. A fo- cus on benefits is also consistent with improving the un- derstanding of the benefits of biodiversity in terms of what people use within a specified area of study, who benefits and how much they benefit. this approach may provide a means to collect and store data, create baselines on use in specific areas, and to aggregate data to scale-up analyses related to use. 3.2. make minor amendments to the Use and Trade module in the Red List Assessment participants reviewed the existing sections related to use of species in sis. it was agreed that \u2018ceremony\u2019 should be added to the end Use classification to standardize data re- lated to the \u201cend-use\u201d of a species making it useful for a variety of iUCn programmes, partners and pin. in addition, it was agreed that the current livelihoods tab should be removed from the Use and trade module within the red list Assessment. A new \u2018benefits Assessment\u2019 will be de- veloped; which will be external to the red list Assessment and parallel (possibly linked) to the Use and trade Assess- ment in sis (see section 3.4). it will be necessary to review and amend some of the terminology used in the questions and classification schemes, e.g. the use of the term \u2018sub- sistence\u2019 is not consistent with other responses (national, international) for the field on scale of end use (see table 1). 3.3. make minor amendments to the Use and Trade Assessment the following amendments emerged from the conversation during the workshop for the wild harvest record within the Use and trade Assessment (noting that the first one also applies to the Use and trade module within the red list Assessment, see above): \u2022\ufffd Add \u2018ceremony\u2019 to end Use classification scheme \u2022\ufffd explore how to record different end uses at different scales (local, national and international), similar to the matrix used in the red list Assessment \u2022\ufffd inclusion of a geospatial reference (point or polygon) \u2022\ufffd bring single harvest or multispecies harvest question from livelihoods tab to harvest record \u2022\ufffd trend over time needs to capture historic use within end Use classification scheme (value to livelihoods in livelihoods tab) \u2022\ufffd Change term subsistence to local in scale of use (table 1) and review classification schemes for terminology. 3.4.

OUTLINE OF A NEW pIN \u2018BENEFITS ASSESSmENT\u2019 the new benefits Assessment is based on the pin model of tracking the flow of biodiversity through the socio-ecological system based on four phases: appropriation of species (e.g. hunting, harvesting, collecting), transformation (e.g. butch- ering, drying, cooking, etc.), exchange, and consumption (Davidson-Hunt et al. 2016). it was agreed to use the terms harvesting, processing, trade and consumption to describe these four phases. the aim of the assessment is to under- stand how a species moves through the different phases, who are the harvesters, processors, traders and consum- ers, and how much they benefit from species use. the starting point of the model is harvesting of a species (fig- ure 3). After harvest, products derived from the species can be processed or consumed directly by the household that harvested (subsistence use). A product can also be traded, either directly or after processing, and then consumed or further processed by other individuals and households in the community. Alternatively, the product can leave the local site for external consumption, processing and trade. fig- ures 3a and b provide two possible representations of the flow of benefits. further discussion will be required to chose that which is preferred. based on the approach utilized previously for \u201charvest re- cords\u201d it was suggested that a benefits Assessment could create \u201cbenefits records\u201d that would be bound in time and space and defined by the activity utilized to generate the information for the record. benefits would be determined for each end use of a species using the approach detailed be- low. As each record is generated through a specific activity, a series of records for species included in the study would be generated. Activities by which data are produced can vary from a desk review of secondary sources of informa- tion (see Deutsch et al. 2016), workshops that could involve researchers, community members or a mix of the two, or through data collection methods with a higher resolution of data (see idrobo et al. 2016). the approach presented below uses a coarse resolution in order to allow flexibility in data collection methods yet provide a means to com- pare harvest records over time and space. this approach is based on the principle that data should be collected at the highest resolution possible given the purpose and re- sources available to a given project/study while providing a means to generalize more specific data so that a common set of variables and metrics for the variables can be com- pared at the coarsest resolution permitted by the approach. PiN WORKING PAPER A proposAl for Assessing speCies benefits At A lAnDsCpe sCAle | 13 Scale and scope Assessments can be undertaken at various scales although the approach presented below was developed from the perspective of pin landscape assessments. As such data will be collected by species for a particular geographic area (i.e. bounded spatially) and will be relevant for a specified time period. Assessments will focus on benefits that ac- crue locally, i.e. within the territory of study. the module will therefore not include processing, trading or consumption that happens at a larger spatial scale (outside the area of the study; figure 3). to get an idea of what is driving the flow of a species through the system, the end uses of the species, which may be outside the local site, will be re- corded. the scale for data within the assessment will be at the landscape, territory or community level. benefits that accrue outside the study site can be tracked using other methods, e.g. value chain analysis, but do not fall within the scope of the benefits assessments for the defined site.

Consumption of products from species After a species has been harvested, it can be processed, traded or consumed directly. for consumption, we are interested in collecting information on the products de- rived from a species, to differentiate between, for exam- ple, meat, bones, skin and eggs from animals, and fruits, leaves, bark and roots for plants. for each product, the end use needs to be selected from the existing end Use classification scheme in sis (table 7). table 7 can be filled out for different products and end uses separately, creat- ing multiple benefit records. After specifying the product and end use, the matrix for the four groups of users needs to be filled out, to indicate how important the consumption of the product is for each group, and whether it can be substituted, how frequently the prod- uct is consumed and how much is consumed. initially, we want to capture how much is used in a qualitative way, with the option to provide more detailed quantitative information obtained through in-depth studies at a later stage in a sep- arate benefits record. the module will also collect informa- tion on whether consumption is subsistence or secondary, differentiating between consumption by the household har- vesting the species and by secondary consumers, i.e. those that acquire the product in a local market or via trade.

Availability, stability, access and perception of species During the workshop, a brief discussion was had about incorporating the factors that shape species use as de- scribed by pin (Davidson-Hunt et al. 2016). there was not sufficient time to think through this part of the benefits assessment in detail during the workshop, and as a result this is something that still needs to be developed. A short description on these four variables is provided here, and further details can be found in Davidson-Hunt et al. (2016). the use of a species, or the ability of a person to use a species, is shaped by: \u2022\ufffd availability of species \u2022\ufffd stability of species populations \u2022\ufffd access \u2022\ufffd perception Availability refers to the supply of biodiversity within a de- fined landscape, i.e. the amount and quality of a species. stability refers to the reliability of the supply of a species and can be affected by short-term (such as seasonal vari- ations) and long-term influences (such as variations in spe- cies abundance). Access refers to the ability to benefit from a species and requires a mapping of access to species and the distribution of benefits from extraction, production, transformation, exchange and consumption. perception re- fers to an individual\u2019s awareness of a species and affects all four phases of use. perception is used to address cultural processes, e.g. if a species is associated with poverty or a social taboo prevents its use, despite availability, stability and access. 4.6. Issues to be further discussed As the development of the sis benefits assessment is a work in progress, this workshop report identifies several is- sues that need further consideration: a. the name of the module/assessment. it is currently referred to as the \u2018benefits assessment\u2019, as \u2018benefits\u2019 was more appropriate than \u2018livelihoods\u2019 given what is being documented, and \u2018assessment\u2019 is consistent with the terminology used for the red list Assess- ment and trade and Use Assessment. b. A review of the terminology and classification schemes used in sis related to use, trade and livelihoods is needed. for example, in the scale of use classification scheme subsistence should be changed to local. c. How to best depict the model of tracing the benefits accrued from species harvest, consumption, pro- cessing and trade (figure 3 \u2013 option A or b). d. How to capture harvest (or use) of species by people outside of the community. Who is considered \u2018local\u2019 (\u2018insider versus outsider\u2019)? e. if and how to capture end use outside of the local site as a driver of local harvest, and providing the possibility of adding case studies to capture informa- tion on value chains beyond the site. f. How to capture substitutability of a species and dis- tinguish from something being a staple (both saying something about the level of reliance on a species but in a different way). g. the selection of variables by which to disaggregate data collected, e.g. what is proposed is to focus on levels of wealth (or poverty) and gender. these vari- ables may require further definition and thought. h. the questions and fields proposed in tables 7-9 need to be adapted to better collect information spe- cific to the different phases of harvest, consumption, trade and processing.

Will there be criteria to determine whether benefits assessment is mandatory, recommended or optional? Who oversees the process of benefits assessments, whether it is undertaken, the degree of completion, the quality of the data, etc. the benefit assessment could serve as a pre-cursor to a \u2018stan- dard\u2019 on livelihoods-related assessment work and projects dealing with the use of biodiversity within iUCn. it will be important to understand what institutional processes need to be followed to develop a standard. 5.3. pilot testing the benefits assessment will need to be built out in an it- erative manner, alternating development and pilot testing. However, before pilot testing takes place, it is proposed to first to run through the prototype based on a small number of species for which there already exists good data. this will provide a better indication of the time needed and the difficulty of completing a full assessment and the likelihood of having sufficient data. to pilot application of the bene- fits assessment, in the early stages, we may want to pig- gy-back on red list Assessments and focus on application in a small number of relevant projects. 5.4. Fundraising for all the above, new funding is required. Joint pin and species programme project development will be needed to develop projects in which to build out, adapt and apply the benefits assessment in a range of different contexts. once the prototype is developed, a possible strategy is to build into new projects at the project concept or design phase provision for benefits assessment to provide a baseline at the start of project implementation. this is consistent with the indicator developed to measure progress against target 22 of the iUCn global results framework: proportion of iUCn projects that systematically assess material benefits and cultural values associated with species and ecosys- tems according to an overarching iUCn people in nature framework (pin).

The workshop will build on discussions from 2013-16 between the PiN team and the Species Programme and TRAFFIC around the inte- gration of PiN and the RLTS using the Species Information Service, the database which stores the data used to gen- erate the RLTS. The PiN team and the Species Programme agreed to collaborate on the development of a livelihoods module within SIS to be applied in the context of species assessments and potentially in other applications. The liveli- hoods module will build on existing relevant sections within the SIS \u2013 the trade and use module and the livelihoods tab within that module.

This paper is meant to ensure participants have a good un- derstanding of work completed to date and the key features of PiN and of species assessments so that discussions at the workshop are focused and productive and that the work- shop delivers key outputs, including the skeleton of an ex- panded livelihood module and an outline of accompanying processes and protocols. SeCTION 1: PiN CONTexT aND baCkgROUND Livelihood analysis Rural development research in the 1980s and 1990s revealed that many rural households did not rely only on agricultural systems as their main economic basis. There was evidence that many households depend on a range of natural resourc- es, such as forests, fisheries, and grazing lands. Livelihood analysis examines the diversity of rural livelihood practices and its use has become widespread over the past decades. Livelihoods are defined as \u201cthe capabilities, assets (stores, resources, claims and access) and activities required for a means of living: a livelihood is sustainable which can cope with and recover from stress and shocks, maintain or en- hance its capabilities and assets, and provide sustainable livelihood opportunities for the next generation; and which contributes net benefits to other livelihoods at the local and global levels and in the short and long term\u201d (Chambers & Conway, 1991:6). Different types of livelihood outcomes have been identified, including increased income, reduced vulnerability, increased well-being, improved food security and more sustainable use of natural resources. The devel- opment of a livelihoods module needs to address whether the focus will be on economic livelihood outcomes (income) or if a broader definition of livelihoods is used. The Poverty and Environment Network (PEN) is a collabo- rative effort led by the Centre for International Forestry Re- search (CIFOR) that aimed to improve the understanding of the linkages between forests and livelihoods in rural areas of developing countries. PEN conducted a large-scale study involving socioeconomic data collection from more than 8,000 households in 333 villages in 24 developing countries over 12 months. Results provide insights into forest-liveli- hood dynamics, the role of factors such as gender, gover- nance, and poverty, and it highlights the important contri- bution of biodiversity to rural livelihoods. However, despite mounting evidence that environmental income is important, it remains widely overlooked by policymakers (Wunder et al. 2014). There is a need to better understand the contri- butions of ecosystems that provide livelihood outcomes to rural communities. While the PEN study used environmental income accounting to evaluate the economic contribution of forests, PiN recognises that livelihood outcomes are not only income related but include other dimensions such as culture, well-being, and food security. IUCN and PiN Building on PEN and other livelihoods relevant work, IUCN recognized the importance of this work on dependence, but wanted to explore a more multi-dimensional approach to understand the interrelationships between people and na- ture and initiated the People in Nature Knowledge Product in 2012 (formerly called Human Dependence on Nature or HDN). The aim of PiN is to measure and document material and cultural values and uses of biodiversity, ecosystems, and water resources. A PiN livelihoods assessment would generally aim to assess the actual and/or potential contri- butions that these resources make to the livelihoods of local communities. As part of the conceptual and methodologi- PiN WORKING PAPER 6 | CONSERVATION STATUS OF BIODIVERSITy IMPORTANT FOR BRIBRI FOOD AND NUTRITIONAL SECURITy cal development of PiN, a series of discussion papers was developed and published in a compilation volume (David- son-Hunt et al. 2016). Details can be found in the volume. The chapter by Suich et al. (2016) explored approaches to understanding the interrelationships between people and nature in terms of impacts on quality of life. The chapter reviews and contrasts the sustainable livelihoods approach (SLA), social well-being, and poverty frameworks. Although there are overlaps between the frameworks, each has strengths and weaknesses. For example, the SLA frame- work has been successful at incorporating natural resourc- es into analyses; however, it marginalises the role of cul- ture.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14dac94e-242a-416e-bd0c-b19ac83d74f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "14dac94e-242a-416e-bd0c-b19ac83d74f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/background-paper-livelihoods-module-workshop", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Background paper for livelihoods module workshop", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/background-paper-livelihoods-module-workshop", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e06fdf0261fa392803f38c8d108750b86dcf8541ea6b6e13f4de45d464d202a4"}, "2": {"node_id": "c49770fe-2631-4fd0-beb3-ad8315a613c9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/background-paper-livelihoods-module-workshop", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9b533d6688e005116200e1bf849e657f1d2a9c72a7b1f160f3a4168cb1022b9"}}, "hash": "6dd50d5ef752c24abcf6e3d6c17e2516c2ba2035f0ee0304709a1b2627ffa782", "text": "The social well-being framework on the other hand, incorporates both the benefits people receive from nature and the social and cultural processes that underlie the con- struction of these benefits, considering the roles of both culture and nature explicitly.

Perhaps rather than trying to take on the whole livelihoods approach together, PiN takes an interest in impacts on quality of life (livelihoods, well-being, poverty) in terms of contributions of nature (Suich et al. 2016). Future work will address ways PiN can measure these contributions (Suich et al. 2016). Specifically, this includes what the PiN methodology for primary and secondary data collection can find regarding livelihoods, poverty and well-being dimensions of species use, distributional impacts of these uses and the trade-offs associated with different uses (or non-use), and impacts of change felt most significantly in terms of local perception or priorities (Suich et al. 2016). Drawing on the reviewed conceptual foundations for under- standing the interrelationships between people and nature, the paper proposes a set of key features of the PiN approach: \u2022\ufffd Analyses should not simply be a description of a situa- tion but increase understanding of how and why condi- tions exist locally and are perpetuated. \u2022\ufffd The scale of analysis should be appropriate to the ques- tion being asked and where relevant, incorporate an understanding of the situation of individuals, not just households. \u2022\ufffd Analyses should be gender sensitive. \u2022\ufffd The multidimensionality of poverty (i.e. how poverty af- fects/is affected by multiple aspects of people\u2019s liveli- hoods) and well-being must be recognised. \u2022\ufffd Analyses should select dimensions that are appropriate to the local context. \u2022\ufffd Analyses should incorporate subjective dimensions and adopt the principle of responsiveness, where people identify elements of quality of life that are important to them. \u2022\ufffd Analyses should identify the sources of vulnerability of different social groups. \u2022\ufffd Assessments should incorporate temporal and spatial dynamics. \u2022\ufffd Analyses should incorporate sufficient contextual infor- mation, including issues related to governance, power relations and political economy. \u2022\ufffd Communities\u2019 participation in the research design, im- plementation and analysis is crucial. \u2022\ufffd Use or collection of data should follow appropriate ethi- cal protocols. \u2022\ufffd Systematic use of secondary data sources should pre- cede primary data collection to build on existing work. \u2022\ufffd Livelihoods analysis should disaggregate biodiversity data to the levels (e.g. species, subspecies and va- rieties) at which individuals and communities receive benefits. Current and potential use of species and key policy domains PiN makes a distinction between current and potential uses of species. While current use describes how a community is known to use a species at the time of study, the poten- tial use of species incorporates historically utilised species, reported uses within similar environments and/or among similar cultural groups and species currently used. The po- tential use of species helps to understand the potential of nature to contribute to livelihoods and increase resilience to effectively respond to change (Davidson-Hunt et al. 2016). The ability of people to improve their livelihoods depends not just on what species are currently used, but also on the species that people used in the past and new and innova- tive uses of species currently present but not utilised (due to lack of access, knowledge or negative attitudes towards certain species or their uses). Both current and potential use can be, at least in part, determined from both primary and secondary data.

These four categories are analysed across the phases of appropriation, transfor- mation, exchange and consumption. Availability refers to the supply of biodiversity within a de- fined landscape, i.e. the amount and quality of a species. Stability refers to the reliability of the supply of a species and can be affected by short-term (such as seasonal vari- ations) and long-term influences (such as variations in spe- cies abundance). Biodiversity assessments such as those carried out by the Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM col- lect information on the availability and stability of species and this information is stored in the SIS. Access refers to the ability to benefit from a species and requires a map- ping of access to species and the distribution of benefits Table 1. Linking the four phases of species use with factors that affect use (Davidson-Hunt et al. 2016) from extraction, production, transformation, exchange, and consumption (see also Ribot & Peluso 2003). Perception refers to an individual\u2019s awareness of a species and affects all four phases of use. Perception is used to address cultural processes, e.g. if a species is associated with poverty or a social taboo prevents its use, despite availability, stability and access. Understanding perception of species allows cultur- al processes to be brought into the understanding of current and potential use (Davidson-Hunt et al. 2016). Secondary data may reveal potential uses of species that are not locally perceived to be useful or valuable (e.g. for nutrition) (Deutsch et al. 2016). Availability, stability, access, and perception help to explore the relationships people and communities have with the species they use, including their own understandings. The PiN mixed methodology and livelihoods assessment The PiN mixed methodology approach (Idrobo et al. 2016) recognises that both qualitative and quantitative data are necessary to co-produce knowledge with rural and indig- enous communities that will be useful for influencing policy domains. The methodology is characterised by an interdisci- plinary approach to take account of different types of knowl- edge and different ways of collecting information to grow that knowledge. It is a guiding principle of PiN to follow a partic- ipatory methodology from the outset, and as such, efforts should be made to include community representatives in PiN assessment teams. Other characteristics of the methodology are that the data should be spatially-referenced and disag- gregated by gender and other social differentiation to under- stand how individuals use and benefit from biodiversity. The PiN methodology aims to examine both current and potential use of biodiversity as it moves through phases of appropriation, transformation, exchange, and consumption. The PiN mixed methodology workflow (Figure 1) consists of three sequential phases: the interdisciplinary situation anal- ysis (Phase I), the collection of qualitative and quantitative data and cultural narratives (Phase II), and data integration and analytical processes (Phase III). The mixed methods workflow is applied in PiN landscape assessments, which aim to understand the material and cultural uses of biodi- versity within defined landscapes and how biodiversity can contribute to livelihoods and well-being.

A scale issue also arose: While the SIS allows users to store a global record for use and trade data (e.g. if a species is widely used and sold across its range), a decision was made to limit the scope of the SIS livelihoods module to the scale of the case study (the level of the locality).1 A detailed wild (or local) harvest record allows for data to be recorded for a locality, while a global summary is used to record what is generally known across the range of a species.

It would be interesting to understand in what situations this may be of use during an assessment.

A literature review was carried out for this subset, involving consultation of papers, databases, and other published and grey literature. Information was exclud- ed if it pertained to geographic areas outside the Albertine Rift region. Use information was categorised according to the SIS use classification scheme. An aim of the project was to further develop the SIS mod- ule to make it more user-friendly and to \u201cencourage experts to complete this information during IUCN Red List assess- ments\u201d. Data from the project were stored in two standalone Microsoft Access databases.2 The aim was to capture data for most important species \u2013 a relative measure based on expert opinion \u2013 for at least one of their use types. It was also noted that measures of importance likely varied over the entire study region, as studies often pertained to specific countries or geographical locations, including case studies. The northern africa freshwater assessment The primary objectives of this analysis were an understand- ing of the importance of wetland resources in the region, quantification of the level of use of freshwater species, and threats to freshwater species (Juffe-Bignoli and Darwall 2012). Economic valuation of species used as livelihood re- sources in the region was attempted, although calculation and use of values obtained was viewed to be problemat- ic by the authors due to the simplistic methodology of the study. Results include an estimation of the number of peo- ple within the region that rely on harvest of freshwater spe- cies as a livelihood activity and the identification of species of socioeconomic value. As in the \u201cVital but Vulnerable\u201d study, data were collect- ed through literature searches and expert consultation via email. The authors recommended the addition of regional workshops involving experts for future studies. Both projects discussed thus far considered ecological changes and access issues that may shape use of resourc- es, reflecting factors that change livelihood outcomes for individuals and communities. These processes are detailed in project reports for several species of high socio-econom- ic importance. For instance, see the vignette on Mentha species in the North Africa Assessment. It is not known whether this information has been incorporated into the SIS database in free text fields. The Lake Victoria catchment assessment An ongoing project, \u201cA critical sites network for freshwa- ter biodiversity in the Lake Victoria Catchment: Building a blueprint for species conservation, protected areas, cli- mate resilience and sustainable livelihoods\u201d, funded by the MacArthur Foundation, aims to develop a use and liveli- hoods expert workshop methodology. Workshops aim to collect use and livelihoods information in individual harvest records to be held within the SIS. Workshop participants in- clude botanists and fisheries experts, academics, and gov- ernment representatives. The purpose of workshops is to gather experts to assess use and importance for livelihoods of all freshwater species in the Lake Victoria catchment. Any sources of information may be brought in by experts, and expert opinions and estimates of importance of spe- cies are sought from workshop participants if data are not known to exist. A workshop facilitator collects information species-by-species until all species in the assessment have been interrogated. HighaRCS and the WRaP toolkit The Wetland Resource Action Planning toolkit (WRAP) (http://www.wraptoolkit.org/) was developed by IUCN and partners to provide guidance for integrating the value of wetland ecosystem services for people and biodiversity within planning processes (Bunting et al. 2013).

The WRAP toolkit contains an in-depth approach to gathering livelihoods data through household and market surveys, key informant interviews, observation, and PRA exercises. In addition, there are specific tools for collecting data on values of wetland species within a local context. Summary of contributions of previous projects and initiatives Except for HighARCS, which contains a comprehensive suite of field methods and data collection tools, other proj- ects that have the intention of contributing data on liveli- hoods to the SIS have relied on expert input through email solicitation or workshops and secondary data review. These methodologies are not designed to look at livelihood out- comes more broadly. Rather, the SIS livelihoods tab aims to capture snapshots of dependence on a species by provid- ing a rough indication of the reliance of people on a species and the total value of the harvest using data and statistics that are most readily collected and stored. exploration of fields in use and trade tab and livelihoods section of SIS Use, trade, and livelihoods data is stored within a dedicat- ed module within the SIS database. The design criteria for the use and trade module and livelihoods tab are that it is a short and simple section (fields within the use and trade tab) that could be filled by anyone undertaking a species as- sessment, and a more detailed livelihoods section for those with better access to data on use and livelihoods (Oldfield, Smith and Allen 2009). In practice, the livelihoods fields have generally been used by specific projects, but have not been used by those working on species assessments. Table 3 lists variables on use and trade in the module and indicates complementarity to PiN. From a PiN perspective, the main functions of the module appear to be as follows: A global use and trade tab may be filled during global species assessments. This tab may draw on local use and trade studies stored as wild harvest records. A local or wild harvest record pertains to a locality. More than one local harvest record may be completed for each species. This means that data may be entered sepa- rately for each \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cuser group\u201d within a specific geo- graphical area, allowing for easier disaggregation of data to account for differences in uses and livelihood importance. Likewise, a livelihoods tab allows data to be stored per lo- cality. Figure 2 shows the appearance and contents of the livelihoods tab and table 4 contains a list of variables and their descriptions from the livelihoods sections that were used in the Lake Victoria catchment study. Of highest potential overlap with PiN are sections pertaining to \u201charvesters\u201d, \u201cconsumers\u201d, \u201creliance\u201d and \u201cvalue to liveli- hoods\u201d. In the livelihood studies of the Species Programme, livelihoods importance of a species within a study area is generally obtained from quantitative estimates of reliance of people on a product with a specific use. These repre- sent techniques of valuation (most notably economic and in terms of food security). Table 4 shows how contributions of species to livelihoods are recorded in the section on value to livelihoods and economy in terms of: 1. percentage of total population in the case study area benefitting from a product 2. percentage of household consumption of this type of product provided by the harvest 3. percentage of household income from this product An overall quantification of the importance of a species to lo- cal livelihoods is considered in 1. Contributions of a species to household income are considered in 2 and 3. Variable 2 may be evaluated in diverse units of measurement, for ex- ample, percentage of protein or carbohydrate consumption.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9954d289-6317-426e-bf5c-fc7f9731106b": {"__data__": {"id_": "9954d289-6317-426e-bf5c-fc7f9731106b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/background-paper-livelihoods-module-workshop", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Background paper for livelihoods module workshop", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/background-paper-livelihoods-module-workshop", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c415901bb70715c5bdf8a0db1b4edf693b36187e3da388c974db79ac9fe5c09f"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2d9b681-6908-4c2a-8c4c-7569c0009cb9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/background-paper-livelihoods-module-workshop", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7752983dc091550fca6ef11cb246c565f7778279e73ced93f7cfddca6c9fd5e6"}}, "hash": "405ebf4b6a816a1a79d864d860e7f80eeec7dee325e5f1b1057720e7ac0a4b38", "text": "PiN WORKING PAPER 12 | CONSERVATION STATUS OF BIODIVERSITy IMPORTANT FOR BRIBRI FOOD AND NUTRITIONAL SECURITy Scale Variable PiN\ufffdcomplementarity Global\ufffdsummary Harvest\ufffdcountries\ufffdof\ufffdoccurrence A\ufffdcoarse\ufffdway\ufffdto\ufffdnarrow\ufffdsearch\ufffdfor\ufffdspecies\ufffd harvested\ufffdto\ufffdwithin\ufffdarea\ufffdof\ufffdinterest.\ufffdSub-country\ufffd occurrences\ufffdare\ufffdalso\ufffdpossible\ufffdto\ufffdrecord End\ufffduse\ufffdscale\ufffd(local\ufffdsubsistence,\ufffd local\ufffdcommercial,\ufffdna0onal\ufffd commercial,\ufffdinterna0onal\ufffd commercial) This\ufffdvariable\ufffdcan\ufffd\ufb02ag\ufffdspecies\ufffdthat\ufffdmay\ufffdhave\ufffdvalue\ufffdin\ufffd the\ufffdPiN\ufffdtrade\ufffdand\ufffdincome\ufffddomains.

Screenshot of fields in the livelihoods tab The relationship between data collection methods and data in SIS Livelihoods information stored in the SIS is largely based on the output of the projects described above that aim to fill in this section for each species assessed. Use information is more extensive and may draw on the non-expert input of assessors performing Red List assessments, when uses of a species are known to them. As such, the methodology for use and livelihoods data collection is not directly associated with the process of carrying out Red List assessments and has required specific project funding. As data on livelihoods are a relatively recent addition to SIS, data coverage is cur- rently highly regional and may not be completed over the entire range of a species. Finally, we note that there is no way currently to store detailed livelihoods data within the SIS. Rather, original sources may be referenced for each individual field. SeCTION 3: DeVeLOPINg aN exPaNDeD SIS LIVeLIHOODS mODULe Content of the use and trade module PiN looks at both potential and current uses of species with- in an assessment area, collects information on constraints on use (availability, stability, accessibility, perception), and is developing ways to monitor and measure the relationship between current and potential use. The SIS has potential to provide critical data regarding this relationship.3 Once factors shaping use are better understood, the PiN assess- ment will include methodologies for valuing the contribution of species to livelihoods, and well-being. There is an evident overlap with the aims of the use and trade module as PiN assessments may contribute data to inform conservation planning in relation to species of interest that are important for local livelihoods. The following section reviews salient issues concerning the use, trade, and livelihoods sections described in section 2. 3 PiN\u2019s 2016 Sixaola Situation Analysis lays out a pilot approach for integration of SIS data with other secondary sources to understand how threats to species\u2019 availability and stability can shape use. URL: https://porals.iucn.org/library/node/46332 PiN WORKING PAPER 14 | CONSERVATION STATUS OF BIODIVERSITy IMPORTANT FOR BRIBRI FOOD AND NUTRITIONAL SECURITy Use The use and trade module provides the basic structure for storage of species use data. The use classification scheme does not contain a full list of possible uses corresponding to PiN domains \u2013 food and nutrition, medicine, energy, shelter, ceremony \u2013 although the gap is small and free text entry is permitted. All domains appear to be covered except for a data field for ceremonial value. Use data may be stored in SIS either within a local/wild harvest record or within the global record for the species.4 The harvest record storage method appears to be compatible with PiN\u2019s interest in distinguishing between current and potential use, as it would help assess- ment teams record whether a species has known historical uses in a particular area. PiN\u2019s proposed digital tools (Deutsch et al. 2016) may be used to contribute \u201cglobal\u201d use data that may not be uncovered during locality-based livelihoods proj- ects or by experts undertaking global species assessments. As data on use values are added through case studies (and potentially crowdsourcing/mining of existing data sets), data on potential uses would accumulate in the SIS attached to both species and locations. Trade Trade data is currently collected within the End Use fields for individual harvest records. The fields include a descrip- tion of specific products and scale of trade (local, national, Table 4.

Livelihoods In contrast to the use tab, the livelihoods tab contains mea- surements of dependence of people living within an area on an individual species. The livelihoods tab can store infor- mation on harvesters and consumers of species and esti- mates of economic or nutritional importance of species for households. Data is provided by experts in livelihoods or literature reviews. Limited data collected through solicitation of experts may poorly represent the reality of individuals, segments of the population or communities within the area of interest. There is a danger that best guesses become the data that are recorded in the SIS database. For instance, the livelihoods tab only partially accounts for the benefits flowing to particular groups of people from a harvest, which risks masking differences in benefits flowing to local com- munities for subsistence and monetary benefits flowing to outsiders harvesting locally. There is concern that different groups become conflated unless assessors are careful to create a series of records for each group of known users. This is problematic if this data is to be used to make deci- sions about harvesting affecting user groups. PiN has not yet developed a detailed approach to measure the contribution of species to livelihoods, but will include cul- tural values and importance to people and groups through the phases of transformation, consumption exchange. Fields in the livelihoods tab pertaining to identity and type of indi- vidual and household potentially allow information stored as harvest records to be disaggregated by gender, age, and household wealth. However, more detail would be needed to understand the range of users of a species. methodological complementarities and differences In contrast to most of the projects reviewed in section 2, PiN assessments are community-based.

PiN and Species Programme projects may derive second- ary data from the same set of sources, \u201ccrowdsourced\u201d or solicited from experts. This is especially relevant to new means of data collection and collation proposed by Deutsch et al. (2016). Digital tools such as for crowdsourc- ing and data mining could be used to find relevant sec- ondary data on species use and livelihood benefits. A pub- lic portal could be created to crowdsource use data from existing datasets, which can then be incorporated into the SIS database within individual harvest records, referencing source, date of study, location of recorded use and other relevant metadata. addressing the architecture of the module The existing \u201cwild harvest record\u201d structure within the use and trade module SIS (see section 2) has the advantage of attaching data on use and livelihoods to a locality at a particular point in time. This is necessary to analyse change in uses, value and threats to species within a particular area \u2013 in contrast to conclusions that may be drawn from a glob- al-level analysis. A further advantage of the existing SIS data structure is that external references are allowed for each field, permitting ex- ternal documents and datasets to be referenced. This would potentially support openly available livelihoods datasets be- ing linked to, or stored in an external data repository (e.g. see Deutsch et al. 2016) that can be linked to SIS harvest record data.

Further development of the existing SIS livelihoods tab to better capture information on how use of species contrib- utes to livelihoods is an expected outcome of collaboration between PiN and the Species Programme. An alternative, however, would be to create a dedicated livelihoods module within the SIS. This module could be independent of, but link to, specific fields within the use and trade module and other modules within the SIS. According to the MAVA workshop report, the aim of liveli- hoods information collection within SIS is to \u201callow analy- ses e.g. to show that a species, harvested for a particular purpose, is of importance to a particular social group or gender\u201d. This logic has been adopted within the livelihoods tab. However, scope is limited to data on identities of har- vesters and consumers. PiN\u2019s approach as illustrated in Ta- ble 1 provides for a more detailed look at spheres of activity and the factors that shape participation in these, including the availability and stability of resources, access to sites, resources and technology, and perception of usability and desirability of species and products. The livelihoods module could, in an initial phase, experiment with ways these variables relate to livelihoods outcomes for specific groups within a locality, and how livelihoods con- tributions of activities across the four phases may be mea- sured. Although in its first iteration, the matrix in table 5 rep- resented again below shows how database fields may be formulated to evaluate specific cells of the matrix in terms of their impact on the potential for a community or sub-group to use or trade a species for livelihoods benefits. The table is heuristic in scope and it may not be of practical impor- tance to comprehensively address each cell. Some key questions for the workshop Some key questions for the workshop include, but are not limited to, the following: \u2022\ufffd What would be the purpose of an expanded livelihoods module within SIS? \u2022\ufffd What were the challenges/road blocks with previous efforts to develop a livelihoods tab/module in the SIS? What developments were not included in the SIS and why? \u2022\ufffd How does the basic architecture of the current use and trade module and livelihoods tab need to change? \u2022\ufffd What would application of the module look like? What kinds of projects might use the module and how might they be funded? \u2022\ufffd Who are the intended users of the module? \u2022\ufffd What types of variables would need to be included in a livelihoods module? \u2022\ufffd How would data be collected (primary or secondary) and by whom? \u2022\ufffd What processes and protocols need to be put in place for users of the module? \u2022\ufffd Who would input data into the SIS? Who has access to the data once it is stored in the SIS?

FLR is the long-term process of regaining ecological functionality and enhancing human well-being across deforested or degraded forest landscapes. It also allows countries to achieve multiple national and international commitments on sustainable natural resource management and development. The ROAM manual released in 2014 was developed as a \u2018road-test\u2019 version, with an innovative approach of engaging a range of disciplines and stakeholders to identify, analyse, negotiate, and prioritise FLR opportunities. One of its hallmarks is a process of adaptive learning to improve future versions of the methodology.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e14c282-8950-4402-9130-d9ddcae6a95a": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e14c282-8950-4402-9130-d9ddcae6a95a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/gender-responsive-restoration-guidelines", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender-responsive restoration guidelines", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/gender-responsive-restoration-guidelines", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "52a67b9bc87672dc2d95803f881aab72dac86bd7caef8dc71831590dc3e59fb6"}, "2": {"node_id": "ab7b45a5-e79a-4589-b8c2-f985a8199756", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/gender-responsive-restoration-guidelines", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fddade8927077e7f25142c71d53a1e0b17386e462f81e95618b36808b9541f9a"}}, "hash": "66276bc30359a288b90f03695dae5394079e751c2876d34dd6cc275e8a011d7e", "text": "One of its hallmarks is a process of adaptive learning to improve future versions of the methodology. As part of IUCN\u2019s effort to update the methodology, these guidelines have been developed to ensure the application of ROAM and the ensuing FLR implementation, including any policy uptake and land-use planning, is gender responsive. This means: identifying, understanding, negotiating and implementing FLR in ways that can address gender gaps, overcome historical gender biases in policies and interventions related to FLR, and ensure the outcomes of FLR interventions benefit equally women. FLR interventions that are gender responsive are also more sustainable in the long term, owing to the central role women play as foresters, farmers and food providers.

At the same time, ROAM and FLR can promote actions that proactively improve the situation of whole communities through an inclusive, equitable and participatory approach, especially including those most excluded and marginalised (by sex, age, ethnicity, religion, caste, etc.). Many examples of research and data exist showing women play a key role in natural resource use and management, particularly in agriculture and forested landscape systems and along value chains. For instance: \u2022 Women are responsible for household food preparation in 85-90% of cases surveyed in a wide range of countries.2 \u2022 Women encompass an average of 43% of the agricultural labour force in developing countries.

FLR requires a participatory and multi-sector approach with an emphasis on engaging as broad a range of stakeholders as possible \u2013 including groups often marginalised by sex, age, ethnicity, religion, caste, etc. However, effective and gender-responsive FLR does not constitute merely including women in the process, but requires a wide array of actions to ensure women and men fully participate in, and equally benefit from, FLR interventions. When applying ROAM, specific actions to accomplish this include: 1. Conduct a gender analysis to provide insights into the roles, responsibilities, uses, rights and practices that affect the way that women and men from various socio-economic/cultural groups in the target area use and manage natural resources in and around forests to support their livelihoods and their families \u2013 to collect comprehensive baseline data (sex- disaggregated) and to support regular monitoring and assessment. 2. Involve women in restoration decision- making, as stakeholders and in practice, to address underlying social and gender inequalities from the start of the project while ensuring the best data and knowledge is available. 3. Improve women\u2019s rights to land and natural resources, including within communities. 4. Create partnerships and alliances with regional and national restoration networks to enhance inclusiveness of women and marginalised groups. 5. Develop gender-sensitive indicators and collect sex-disaggregated data to track the extent to which outcomes respond to the identified gender issues, to be included for assessment area(s) and as part of the monitoring framework to showcase impact. 6. Facilitate dialogue between women and men to foster more equitable access, use, control, and management of land and natural resources (i.e. grievance mechanism). 7. Develop gender-responsive polices on land and forest management at the sub- national and national levels. 8. Exchange knowledge on key gender issues, strategies and outcomes between 3 FAO. (2014).

Preparation and planning Identifying and articulating the challenges, problem statement and objectives of an FLR assessment demands consideration of gender gaps and inequalities and, thus, opportunities and priorities for \u201cdoing better.\u201d Aligning the FLR objectives with these priorities \u2013 and keeping this alignment in mind throughout the assessment process \u2013 will help ensure assessment results are relevant and compelling to key decision-making institutions in the country and ensure the FLR initiatives comply with national, regional and international gender equality mandates. Defining the problem, scope and outputs A gender perspective needs to be included when defining both the major problems to be addressed and the long-term objectives. Defining the problem should identify the needs, interests, and priorities of women, women farmers, and decision-makers, to ensure that all problems are being identified and can be prioritised accordingly. It is important to consider if and how women are driving deforestation and landscape degradation, and which FLR opportunities could alter activities and benefit women. This will allow for more effective development of what the objectives should be, and will allow for a stronger integration of gender throughout the assessment and programming. Engaging key partners The assessment team should actively seek to engage representatives and institutions involved in national women\u2019s rights and gender policy-making and programming, including the country\u2019s women, gender, or social ministry and national women\u2019s mechanisms (e.g., the National Women Council in Rwanda or the Women\u2019s Affairs Secretariat in Mexico). In addition, the team should actively engage with other key implementation partners including gender focal points from environmental ministries and women\u2019s organisations working across sectors at all levels, as relevant to the identified FLR scope and options (see Appendix II for a case study on Malawi and how it identified specific partners and groups). This engagement and communication with women\u2019s mechanisms will not only support the gender analysis conducted as a part of Phase 1, but also support actions throughout the ROAM and FLR process more broadly. Identifying the assessment criteria and indicators For initiatives like FLR that require long- term planning and investments, it is crucial to consider demographic patterns such as population size, density, composition, growth, and migration. These patterns and scenarios have the potential to either complement or negatively influence the identification, planning and implementation of restoration opportunities, and must be considered during analysis of a potential restoration site. It is also crucial to include assessment criteria and indicators that are relevant specifically to women on activities that drive degradation (e.g. fuelwood and energy consumption, land use, poverty, or female-headed household ratio) as 6 Gender-responsive restoration guidelines well as potential benefits identified during the scoping of FLR opportunities. In addition to choosing indicators that are gender responsive and women specific, the legal, social, institutional, policy and financial limitations or opportunities need to be identified with respect to gender. Economic, environmental, and social costs and benefits of potential FLR interventions should be assessed. Opportunities or constraints may lie in, for example: \u2022 Government policy papers and strategies on land use, conservation, forest, water or agriculture sectors; \u2022 Legislation on women\u2019s rights to land; land tenure regimes (formal and customary); \u2022 Restoration priorities and funding sources used for previous restoration initiatives; and \u2022 Women\u2019s access or barriers to market, credit and financial mechanisms. These aspects need to be considered when applying the Restoration Diagnostic tool8, for example, which assesses whether the political, institutional, social economic and environmental conditions and success factors for FLR are in place at national and sub-national levels. Only by conducting a gender analysis at a national or sub-national level can an assessment team and programme designers have a holistic understanding of the complex inter-linkages between women and men and their environment. All indicators and assessment criteria should then be informed by the application of this gender analysis.

A major objective of a gender analysis in FLR is to provide information with respect to the differentiated access to, control over, and knowledge about existing resources in a potential restoration area. It also includes information on the sex-disaggregated division of work, the levels of participation, and the distribution of benefits that can illuminate existing power dynamics and inequalities. A gender analysis is an essential feature of a comprehensive ROAM assessment that both provides for and influences the planning, data collection, analysis and recommendations.9 It should consider at the least the following questions: \u2022 What are the different roles played by women and men in forest use, forest management, agriculture and livestock? 8 The Restoration Diagnostic is a ROAM tool that assesses the presence of key success factors to inform decision-makers on what enabling factors exist for FLR implementation. See the ROAM Handbook pages 94-98 at iucn.org/ROAM. 9 For a comprehensive questionnaire, as discussed in the Malawi case study in Appendix II, see IUCN\u2019s Gender Responsive ROAM/FLR Analysis Framework at http://genderandenvironment.org/resource/gender-responsive-roamflr-analysis-framework/ 7 \u2022 Are there gender differences in access to, control over, and knowledge of forests, non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and agricultural goods and services? \u2022 What are the different types of land tenure? \u2013 What kinds of land do women have access to or control of? \u2013 Who holds the title or deed to the land? (Men only? Women only? Both?) \u2013 Are there any cultural restrictions for women to own land or in how they manage land? (e.g., women in Ethiopia are not allowed to plough) \u2022 Who decides whether or not a resource may be used? \u2022 Are there any regulations, customs or territorial rights that pose restrictions on the use, access or control of the resources based on someone\u2019s socio-economic status in that locale? \u2022 Do women and men have different priorities for FLR initiatives? \u2022 Do women bring different knowledge and skills to the FLR process? \u2022 How could FLR initiatives impact women and men across socio-economic groups differently? \u2022 How could FLR initiatives benefit women and men? \u2022 Who prioritises potential benefits? Who decides the division of benefits and to whom they go? \u2022 How are women and men from different socio-economic groups currently represented in decision-making processes relevant to FLR initiatives? \u2022 What are the constraints faced by distinct groups of women for full participation and engagement? \u2022 What are the national gender policies and legislation that should be taken into account? \u2022 What barriers do women from various socio-economic groups face in accessing finance mechanisms? Identifying data and capacity needs While much of the data collected for a ROAM assessment is spatial in nature \u2013 either in mapped form or easily mapped \u2013 other data will be in the form of contextual reports, narratives and studies, particularly those related to policies, strategies and programmes, and can provide robust context to the ROAM process and decision-making. In addition, depending on locality, spatial data on sex-disaggregated socio-economic data may exist and should also be included in developing multi-criteria degradation maps and priority maps (see the Malawi case study in Appendix II). It is also important to consult with academics or other experts in the country about contributing information on land and resource tenure, cultural norms, gender inequalities, and social conflicts over resource use within the assessment area, to help ensure the collection and inclusion of appropriate gender-differentiated knowledge and data. Planning for stakeholder engagement Stakeholder groups can be categorised in different ways.

Gender-responsive restoration guidelines 9 Participation of women stakeholders may require specific planning and support, including consideration of location, transport, timing of engagements and childcare, as well as providing a space where women are comfortable. For example, a summoning for women may take place through children\u2019s school notebooks; younger women may be better reached through recreational spaces such as dance halls or sports fields. Planning for meaningful participation and inclusive spaces will require context-specific knowledge of local gender dynamics and considerations; therefore, it is important to enlist the aid and expertise of local women\u2019s organisations or groups to ensure effective and appropriate methods. Organising the inception workshop The assessment team should organise an inception workshop to inform key stakeholders of the potential for FLR and engage their interest and involvement in the ROAM process right from the start. In various initiatives worldwide it has proven useful to conduct a session prior to the assessment workshop with only women, representatives from women\u2019s organisations and gender experts to build both technical knowledge and women\u2019s confidence on FLR themes, identify gender inequalities in restoration opportunities and identify women\u2019s priorities. Depending on the country context, participants in training sessions could range from women with experience in national and global policy to local women who are farmers, entrepreneurs, or community leaders at the sub-national level. This \u201cgender\u201d workshop would then feed into the inception workshop. It has been piloted in a few countries10 with participants identifying and discussing gender inequalities, gaps and barriers, but also entry points and related gender actions for addressing these issues with specific gender indicators of achievement as seen in the sample Gender Plan of Action for Malawi (Appendix III). 10 Inception workshops for gender specialists, women and women\u2019s organisations in relation to FLR have been conducted in Brazil, Malawi, Burundi, and Guatemala. However, this methodology has been conducted in no less than 25 countries to support the development of Climate Change Gender Action Plans (ccGAPs), and gender-responsive National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs).

However, it is crucial to have diverse technical and stakeholder expertise and perspectives represented \u2013 including engaging stakeholders from women\u2019s organisations and gender equality advocates, as well as gender focal points from relevant ministries \u2013 while also considering gender balance to avoid sub-optimal representation of women (i.e., participants from the initial women and gender inception workshop can still engage again). It is important to recognise that the prioritisation exercise with women may produce different results than those from a men-only or jointly represented group. Where the lack of empowerment for women has been identified as a bottleneck for successful implementation of FLR, prioritisation of FLR opportunities for women is needed. Throughout the diagnostic analysis it is important to integrate gender considerations into key success factors since this can provide a more in- depth analysis. Social conditions need to specify whether local women and/or men are empowered to make decisions, and whether women and/or men are going to benefit from restoration. Data to inform a critical look at restoration options In addition to collecting detailed technical data and quantified analysis to reliably and realistically evaluate the potential extent of and costs and benefits associated with proposed FLR interventions, socio-demographic issues and trends need to be considered and included. Land use, tenure and drivers of degradation, particularly in the identification of relevant gendered data, poverty rates, existence of 11 Additional country roadmaps available at: http://genderandenvironment.org/?s=REDD%2B+roadmap 11 female-headed households, and gender equality indices, can be utilised to inform the process. This data should be sex- and age-disaggregated (at the household and community level) to provide information on the context of issues and trends that can be monitored for impact over the duration of the interventions. Examples of maps demonstrating how social- and gender- specific data can be utilised in conjunction with biophysical data to identify key issues and areas for implementing restoration options can be viewed in Appendix II in the Malawi case study. Estimating the costs and benefits for restoration It is necessary to estimate and model the additional social and ecosystem goods and services for restoration interventions and their associated costs and benefits. While the requirements for this step will depend on the broader parameters of the ROAM application, an assessment typically involves estimations on biophysical aspects. It should also assess the social, economic and cultural dynamics, including, but not limited to, the following: \u2022 Estimating the additional or reduced time or labour of women and men on restoration options; \u2022 Estimating the change in non-cash income to households, and women and men as individuals (i.e., forest products such as food, fuelwood, medicines, game, etc.); and \u2022 Estimating the impact of restoration activities on household income levels, disaggregated by sex. Phase 2. Data collection and analysis Native Brazilian women, iStock 12 Phase 3. Results to recommendations This final phase needs to be targeted towards the tangible inclusion of assessment results in the implementation of national policy priorities. The ultimate indicator of a successful assessment will be that key actors move forward with the data collected in preparing policies, programmes, or strategies on FLR that complement and help deliver national priorities in a variety of areas, including economic development, poverty reduction, gender equality, women\u2019s empowerment, natural resource use, food, water and energy security, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Diverse stakeholder engagement during the validation phase needs to continue and should include the specific representatives who have been engaged throughout the process. This can include, such as discussed in the Malawi case study (Appendix II), continued engagement of a gender focal point, or gender specialist group with FLR technical teams to ensure gender is integrated throughout FLR policy, programming and measures at national and local levels. This also is an important step to maximise the opportunities available for catalysing additional gender-responsive forest, conservation and environmental policy and programming support. As a follow up to the gender analysis, a gender approach needs to be used during the validation process to ensure that the gender- sensitive process results in recommendations and outcomes that are gender responsive. The following questions and topics are examples of what can and should be discussed: 13 \u2022 Are women\u2019s and men\u2019s needs and priorities (around their lives and livelihoods) considered in prioritising FLR opportunities? \u2022 Are women or women\u2019s organisations a major stakeholder in identified FLR opportunities? \u2022 Do the FLR opportunities have differentiated benefits for women and men? \u2022 Do the FLR opportunities have differentiated risks and potentially negative impacts for women and men? \u2022 Are there specific opportunities to improve women\u2019s status and condition through FLR initiatives? \u2022 Do the FLR opportunities improve women\u2019s", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8461545-9207-47ce-bff4-731ae25ccd45": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8461545-9207-47ce-bff4-731ae25ccd45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/gender-responsive-restoration-guidelines", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender-responsive restoration guidelines", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/gender-responsive-restoration-guidelines", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f495c01b5f2a3a25f8aa5ba9fe75b547afd681d294bc3034e1919e2ff40a0450"}}, "hash": "f495c01b5f2a3a25f8aa5ba9fe75b547afd681d294bc3034e1919e2ff40a0450", "text": "land rights and tenure opportunities? \u2022 Do women have equal access to the financing options of FLR? Following the validation phase, reporting on the process needs to separately include the specific results regarding gender and be integrated throughout the other areas where results from the analysis and entire process are relevant. This can then be used by policy and decision makers to enhance their knowledge and understanding of the critical issues, thereby making the outcomes for proposed interventions more appropriate, efficient and effective while providing a knowledge base of gender issues to consider in future interventions and projects. Using these guidelines will allow ROAM and the broader FLR process to be gender responsive. Rather than simply identifying gender issues and avoiding any harm to the lives of women, a gender-responsive FLR process will help overcome historical gender biases so that women and girls may access, engage, and benefit from all aspects of the process. Without valuing the experiences and uses of both women and men in a landscape, only partial data necessary for assessing FLR options will be available \u2013 and a thorough gender-responsive assessment may also reveal where new entry points for restoration opportunities exist.

Gender-responsive FLR in Malawi This case study from Malawi details successful practices in planning gender-responsive, context-specific FLR activities as laid out in these guidelines. It intends to inform stakeholders involved in similar processes of best practices and lessons learned to ensure that local gender issues are fully and intentionally considered at project inception and continued through implementation. Preparation and planning The National Forest Landscape Restoration Assessment (NFLRA) for Malawi was launched in February 2016 by the Ministry of Natural Resources, Energy and Mining (MNREM) with support from government departments in the ministries of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development (MoAIWD); Gender, Children, Disability and Social Welfare (MoGCCD); Lands, Housing and Urban Development; Local Government and Rural Development; and Finance, Economic Planning and Development; as well as other relevant national and subnational stakeholders. The national assessment was designed to identify needs and opportunities for restoring the productivity and ecological function of deforested and degraded landscapes in Malawi. The main activities of the NFLRA process, led by the MNREM Department of Forestry, were organised from February through November 2016 with support on integrating a gender- responsive approach provided by IUCN through the KNOWFOR Programme. A multi-sector national task force was organised to guide and facilitate the national assessment process and was supported by three technical working groups organised to oversee (1) stocktaking and mapping activities; (2) policy and institutional analysis; and (3) economic and financial analysis. The process of executing the NFLRA used ROAM and piloted activities outlined in these guidelines to mainstream gender in the following interventions: \u2022 Stakeholder consultations at the national, district and rural community level; \u2022 Stocktaking of existing and successful restoration interventions; \u2022 Assessment of food security issues; \u2022 Spatial analysis and mapping of degradation and restoration opportunities; \u2022 Economic and financial analysis of restoration costs and benefits; \u2022 Diagnostic of key success factors and enabling conditions for implementation; and \u2022 Identification of baseline information and proposed monitoring indicators.

As each national-level assessment process varies based on local objectives and situations, it is essential that early planning account for the diversity of objectives to fully and effectively address context-specific economic, environmental and social issues, including gender. In Malawi, IUCN worked with stakeholders and implementing groups to facilitate the development of a plan to administer a unique, gender-responsive approach that used a broad suite of activities and interventions, including: 16 \u2022 Preliminary policy and institutional background research on gender equality across multiple sectors in Malawi; \u2022 Stocktaking of relevant FLR activities during field visits through stakeholder dialogues, including separate women\u2019s and men\u2019s discussion groups on preferences, income-generation, co-benefits, etc.; \u2022 Facilitation of a pre-inception workshop for gender specialists and technical working group focal points, and establishment of a gender specialist group; \u2022 Identifying national and locally enabling conditions and entry points for gender consideration into the different activities implemented by the technical working groups; \u2022 Design, training on and dissemination to districts of a tailor-made questionnaire on themes relevant for addressing gender issues in FLR in Malawi; \u2022 Collection, analysis and validation of questionnaire responses, as well as stakeholder consultations, to identify gender gaps and entry points; \u2022 Gathering of sex-disaggregated socio- economic data and performing geospatial analysis with biophysical characteristics to provide multi-criteria analysis; and \u2022 Inclusion of specific chapter on gender analysis and recommendations in final NFLRA report, along with integration throughout other sector-specific chapters, and the National Strategy and Action Plan. Data collection and analysis The methodology for the inclusion of gender in Malawi\u2019s NFLRA started with preliminary background research on the political and institutional framework for gender in Malawi as well as some broad gender equality statistics. Identifying the inclusion \u2013 but also strengths and weaknesses \u2013 of gender across environmental sectors\u2019 policies relevant to FLR provides an idea of what level of understanding and commitment for gender exists. Additionally, sex-disaggregated data at the national level on anything from access to primary education to average marrying age, to data on cell-phone ownership to existence of bank accounts gives an overview of how gender equality is advancing on the ground in a country, beyond the policies and rhetoric that may boast gender equality. A key component of a gender-responsive ROAM (and FLR processes more broadly) is levelling the playing field of knowledge on FLR for women, women\u2019s organisations and gender experts at the national and sub-national level. Using the collected data and research, IUCN facilitators were able to create a methodology for a gender workshop to precede the overall ROAM inception workshop \u2013 a \u201cpre-inception\u201d workshop to engage these specific stakeholders. The Malawi pre-inception workshop invited gender experts from the MoGCCD, gender focal points from environmental ministries (including Agriculture, Water, Land, and others), and representatives from the Department of Forestry, all of whom contributed to the establishment of a gender specialist group. The pre-inception workshop focused on building the capacity of this gender group on FLR and the ROAM process to instil confidence when engaging in the NFLRA inception workshop with FLR- relevant sector specialists who presumably would have more knowledge on FLR, but may be lacking knowledge of the gender issues important to their sector. The pre-inception workshop also specifically provided the gender specialist group with information on the linkages between gender and FLR, including issues with climate change, forests, land, water, etc., which may be new sectors in which to apply their knowledge and thinking on gender. With diverse knowledge and expertise of gender across multiple sectors, the pre- inception workshop specialist group collectively contributed inputs to the gender issues in the design and elaboration of a Gender Plan of Action (GPA) for the NFLRA. The objective of Gender-responsive restoration guidelines 17 the GPA was to provide guidance to the three technical working groups of the NFLRA and implementing partners to ensure a gender- responsive ROAM process in Malawi in all the various aspects. The gender specialist group presented this GPA and general information on the context of gender and FLR to the task force, technical working groups and other stakeholders during the NFLRA inception workshop that immediately followed the pre-inception workshop. To ensure the technical working groups\u2019 understanding, consideration and use of the GPA, at least two representatives from the gender group were added to each technical working group during the NFLRA inception workshop, and also a permanent representative added for the continuing elements of the NFLRA process. The technical working groups were then able to discuss the different actions needed to strengthen the opportunities for gender considerations, add any", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48868929-036e-4d3e-aecd-105a7aefa85d": {"__data__": {"id_": "48868929-036e-4d3e-aecd-105a7aefa85d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/gender-responsive-restoration-guidelines", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Gender-responsive restoration guidelines", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/gender-responsive-restoration-guidelines", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0dd05b31dd4693faa40713ffd225180a584df1dcd0c996d1eed9c98e8382810c"}}, "hash": "0dd05b31dd4693faa40713ffd225180a584df1dcd0c996d1eed9c98e8382810c", "text": "additional opportunities if needed, and recognise the enabling factors at the national and district levels that could help mainstream gender in the NFLRA. A priority action of the GPA for the Stocktaking and Mapping technical working group was to conduct a gender analysis using IUCN\u2019s Gender Responsive FLR Analysis Framework12 as a guide. This framework was adapted by the gender facilitators of IUCN and gender specialist group to design a questionnaire specific to the gender issues, as relevant to FLR, identified during the pre-inception and inception workshops. The questionnaire covered the following topics: \u2022 Socio-cultural norms and practices of local communities in the district area in terms of gender division of labour, rights and responsibilities, access to information and services, access to and control over economic and financial resources and services, with focus on gender and ethnicity; \u2022 Gender-based livelihood patterns of local communities, including such aspects as access to land, water, sanitation, education, health, agriculture and forest, disaggregated by sex, with a focus on women and female- headed households; and \u2022 Use and control over the resources and services and the roles of women and men in the management of community and household natural resources. Following the design of this questionnaire, gender officials from the 28 districts in Malawi were invited to a regional workshop where the questionnaire \u2013 and methodology for collecting evidence in a gender-sensitive manner \u2013 was shared so that each official could complete the questionnaire for their district providing a more local evaluation complete with sex- disaggregated data. Unfortunately, invitations for this regional workshop were sent on short notice, and gender officials from some districts were unable to attend, resulting in a lack of gender data and information gathered from those districts. Still, 14 districts returned gender questionnaires providing a wealth of information on specific gender issues in the context of FLR-relevant sectors at the sub-national level. The information was organised for each district into sub-categories, including demographics; livelihoods; natural resource access, use and control; women\u2019s empowerment and decision making; and restoration activities with results compared across districts. The data gathered was analysed by the gender specialist group along with the stocktaking and mapping technical working group, and then moved to a validation workshop for approval of all groups and stakeholders of the NFLRA process.

Analysis of sex-disaggregated population density to identify areas with higher proportion of women, Malawi Results to recommendations With the qualitative and quantitative information from the questionnaires \u2013 identifying gender gaps and entry points \u2013 and consultations with the leads of the three technical working groups, GIS specialists worked with the IUCN to develop spatial data that takes into consideration the social and economic issues affecting natural resources and landscapes. For example, the stocktaking and mapping technical working group took into account gender and the socio-economic issues that are important to Malawi to address by including data on poverty, access to markets, food security and population density overlaid with sex- disaggregated population statistics, specifically considering areas where the gender ratio showed a higher proportion of women (Figure 1). The resulting multi-criteria map was then used to highlight areas for prioritising food security interventions, including areas where women could be specifically targeted for enhanced impact \u2013 drawing recommendations for gender- responsive landscape restoration strategies based on the coupling with broader multi- criteria analyses (Figure 2). Furthermore, the gender specialist group with the support of IUCN identified global, regional and national mandates and commitments on gender and environment in Malawi and how key national policies and institutions that include gender considerations will be crucial to engage for the implementation of gender-responsive FLR interventions in Malawi. This additional background research and analysis, coupled with the data collected from the questionnaires strengthened the gender analysis results, was Gender-responsive restoration guidelines 19 Figure 2. Multi-criteria analysis used to highlight areas for prioritising food security interventions, Malawi shared with MoGCCD national gender focal points and district level officials, and MoAIWD representatives for review and validation. The information from the gender analysis also supports the overall restoration opportunities assessment by feeding into the drafting of Malawi\u2019s NFLRA Report and the National Strategy and Action Plan.

The Report also provides recommendations to ensure a gender-responsive approach is used in all FLR policy, programming and measures, to enhance gender equality in Malawi. Additionally, the continued participation of the members of the gender specialist group \u2013 particularly with the technical working groups \u2013 in accordance with the GPA will ensure a gender-responsive approach is integrated throughout the FLR processes, with potential to catalyse additional forest, conservation, and environmental policy-making, programming, and measures in Malawi at national and local levels. Enabling conditions Certain elements promoted a comprehensive gender-responsive approach throughout the Malawi NFLRA process, in complement to these guidelines. Designated funding for gender- responsive planning and activities, as well as a facilitation team (including representatives from Malawi\u2019s Department of Forestry and IUCN) Appendix II. Gender-responsive FLR in Malawi 20 who was keen to deliver results on a gender- inclusive process, ensured IUCN\u2019s engagement from the very beginning and throughout the ROAM phases. Technical support provided by IUCN, coupled with the participation of gender experts from MoGCCD at the national level and its gender officers in the districts, highlighted a variety of issues allowing for a more robust analysis of the linkages between gender and FLR specific to the Malawian context. This was particularly evident in the engagement of the 28 districts in identifying which areas and restoration interventions should be prioritised for the greatest impact. Additionally, the induction of the technical working groups on gender issues in FLR, as well as the participation of the gender specialists with each of the technical working groups, provided the opportunity for enhanced collaboration of gender, rather than a siloed sector, to inform the assessment phase and implementation of specific initiatives. In order to maintain the momentum of a gender-responsive assessment process in Malawi, these elements need to be carried on and translated into the planning, policies and interventions for implementation of FLR initiatives. Continued facilitation of the gender specialist group and their engagement with the technical working groups is crucial for gender- responsive planning and implementation. This will also ensure review of the National Strategy and Action Plan by the gender specialist group to ensure gender issues and information from the analysis have been sufficiently considered, including specific gender actions, budget and indicators, with outcomes enhancing gender equality. The gender focal point of MoGCCD (or other gender machinery) should be regarded as a key stakeholder in guiding the process and can be seen as a coordinator of the gender specialist group, and its engagement.

It is also widely recognised that aquaculture significantly contributes to sustainable development in coastal communities and plays a vital role in ensuring food security, poverty alleviation, and economic resilience. In the framework of integrated management, the time has therefore come to identify the potential opportunities and synergies that can enable aquaculture and conservation to work together more effectively.

While capture fisheries have now reached a plateau of production, marine aquaculture of fish, shellfish and algae has been steadily increasing over the past decades and has become a valid option to make up the protein shortfall. However, one of the major constraints for the aquaculture production sector is the availability of, and access to space. In many coastal areas, competition with other marine activities is already high, mainly because the bulk of marine aquaculture is located close to the shore. Furthermore, water quality in some coastal areas is often not good enough to allow high quality production. In addition, there is a need for increased ocean protection and the preservation and/or restoration of marine ecosystem health. The establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is a key tool essential to meeting the Aichi targets. However, MPAs need to be compatible and integrated within local contexts, acknowledging potential economic activities that are sustainable and in harmony with their conservation objectives. Aquaculture might meet these requirements. The pressures on MPAs could be reduced by better coordinating the development of marine aquaculture with the establishment and management of MPAs. Promoting synergies between multiple-use MPAs and identified compatible activities, such as sustainable aquaculture production is essential. Acknowledging that both aquaculture and MPA may benefit from each other in striving for global sustainable development, the time has now come to explore the following questions: Under what circumstances can MPAs and aquaculture come together? How could MPAs boost aquaculture growth? How could aquaculture activities provide financial support to MPAs? How can we minimize negative interactions? Should we exclude some types of aquaculture (e.g. industrial farms of carnivorous fish cages)? Should we define a frame, a specific approach or just main principles? Background 3 During the last three decades, global wild-caught fish roughly increased from 69 million to 93 million tons. But 85% of world\u2019s fisheries are either being fished at full capacity or already overexploited, depleted or recovering. The world's human population is expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 according to the 2015 UN revision of world population prospects. Despite substantial efforts to improve fishery management, global fisheries will continue to experience pressure in order to meet future demand. In the meantime, aquaculture has grown at an impressive rate. Global aquaculture production rates increased from 5 million to 63 million tons and are expected to grow further with an increase of 38% over the period 2014-2024. Since 2014, it has been contributing more to the supply of seafood1 for human consumption than capture fisheries. Nevertheless, aquaculture production is highly unbalanced with 25 countries accounting for 97% of total global production, mostly in Asia. Freshwater finfish farming still accounts for the largest proportion of the world's aquatic production, an Asian model originating from very traditional integrated fish-agricultural systems. China alone represents 58% of world's total inland and marine production, and 82% of the world's marine aquaculture production (mainly seaweeds).

The seaweed industry is undergoing a steady growth driven by Indonesia and China and currently accounts for nearly half of the total marine aquatic living productions. In fact, in contrast with terrestrial livestock farming, aquaculture is very diversified in terms of the number of aquatic species being farmed, the types of technologies used and the degree of intensification, etc. Between the two extreme situations, on one hand intensive industrial fish farming and on the other hand extensive low density aquaculture driven by local communities, there is a wide range of aquaculture practices, types, scales, and situations. The assessment of the sustainability of aquaculture productions is thus a rather complex issue. This means that the farming cost/benefit and impact assessment analysis should be approached on a case by case base. Evaluation parameters should include criteria regarding production objectives, practices, cycles, type of management, environmental conditions, etc. World aquaculture production distributed among different species categories. 50% 25% Aquatic plants Other aquatic animals Crustaceans Molluscs Marine finfish Inland finfish Understanding the various types of aquaculture and their potentialities FOCUS: SUSTAINABILITY OF AQUACULTURE FEEDS The composition of aquaculture feeds is a critical key issue in the sustainability of carnivorous fish and shrimp farming industry, highly dependent on fish meal and oil supply. The aquafeed guide launched by the IUCN (Le Gouvello and Simard, 2017) addresses the sustainability of aquaculture feeds via considerations on the sustainability of the main raw materials used in aquafeeds. Recommendations are made for a more sustainable supply and restricted use of fishmeal and fish oil, to be sourced from responsibly managed industrial small pelagic fisheries. Due to the very high nutritional quality of these ingredients, it appears difficult to find viable alternatives, but some promising alternative sources have been highlighted such as fisheries and aquaculture co- and by-products, vegetable materials of terrestrial origin, land-based animal by-products or algae, provided that all these raw materials are produced under sustainable practices. A more locally based sourcing strategy for aquafeed ingredients is proposed as a way to improve the overall aquaculture sustainability within a territory.

The trophic level represents its relative position in the aquatic food chain. These levels can be ranked according to dietary preferences. In the lower ranks, we would find species requiring little to no food or plant based food. The higher ranges would contain species with greater needs like carnivorous species relying mostly on a fish based diet. % WTP = % of World Total Production Seaweeds 27% WTP Seaweeds are autotrophic organisms producing organic matter through photosynthesis.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70dcc82c-bde4-43f5-aa05-6cdc844507cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "70dcc82c-bde4-43f5-aa05-6cdc844507cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/aquaculture-and-marine-protected-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Aquaculture and marine protected areas", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/aquaculture-and-marine-protected-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "91c681c8dcf595728e2da4e85ef7eda23c74104eee6a9ccb60e704f6c77ef024"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a0eb31a-8b71-44e8-aad9-9c976a901899", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/aquaculture-and-marine-protected-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3240a460c0f15b6aea346b35ab87a3e0ab77e71a34517886a25e340e0fcccabd"}}, "hash": "4e5317cb206bc00ecf353677e5c3947cbab0e616e112b902a2f99bc01b48306f", "text": "They consume CO2 and some nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous and are located at the basal level of any food chain.

Hatcheries Hatcheries are the facilities that take care of culture organisms from broodstock maintenance and spawning to larval rearing. Broodstock Adult and mature individuals that are used for breeding purposes. They can be captured from the wild or produced from a selective breeding programme. Larval rearing First stages are usually cultured in controlled conditions with high quality waters. Carnivorous fish larvae can be fed with live prey. For shellfish, it includes the metamorphosis and settlement phases. Nursery Nurseries for farming of juveniles can be held within a hatchery or in another facility. Grow-out Grow out is the longest stage. The transferred juveniles are grown until marketable size, being sorted on a regular basis. FARMING SYSTEMS Aquatic organisms can be grown under different culture modes. Most common farming systems are described hereunder, although, it is not an exhaustive list. Cages/Pens Floating or semi-floating enclosed nets for finfish placed in coastal or offshore areas. Suspended culture Longlines are ropes vertically set in the sea to support shellfish or seaweed cultures. Vertical or rack culture Sticks or posts are staked on the bottom and act directly as a growing medium for shellfish or support racks for seaweeds. Bottom Shells, stones, rocks, cement slabs etc., added to the bottom substrate provide attachment sites for shellfish. Ponds Ponds are standing water bodies, either natural or artificial, where finfish, crustacean, shellfish or seaweed are produced. Recycling aquaculture systems (RAS) Land based tank system which operates with little amount of water. By filtering water and reusing it, those systems enclose fish, shellfish or seaweed, generally in high densities. Integrated Multitrophic Aquaculture (see IMTA Focus, p. 14) DESCRIPTION OF THE MOST WIDELY PREVALENT MARICULTURE SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD 5 INTENSITY Density is the number of animals or biomass per volume unit. Intensity combines density and inputs such as supplementary artificial feeds. Intensive productions involve high density cultures of aquatic species, with regular and nutritionally complete feeding. Examples: salmon cages in Northern Europe, Canada and Chile, seabream and seabass in Mediterranean countries. Some shrimp cultures in Thailand, in New Caledonia... Semi-intensive systems involve lower stocking densities than intensive ones, with the enhancement of naturally occurring feed, and some direct artificial feeding. Examples: mullet farms in Egypt, some shrimp ponds in Asia or Latin America. Extensive aquaculture involves a low density of cultured species, sometimes with the enhancement of naturally occurring feed. Examples: seaweed cultures, shellfish, milkfish ponds in the Philippines. AQUACULTURE SITE Land-based aquaculture Aquaculture production facilities with tanks and/or ponds, located along the shoreline. Inshore Inshore or coastal aquaculture is generally near the shoreline, in embayments or in sheltered coastal areas. Offshore Offshore aquaculture or open ocean aquaculture where farms are located some distance offshore with significant exposure to wind and wave action. The farms are positioned in deeper and less sheltered waters. It is an emerging approach to mariculture or marine farming.

The following benefits and services provided by aquaculture are underlined as follows: \u2014 Aquaculture can play a direct role for wild stock fauna enhancement and flora/conservation. Various examples are provided, such as grouper population restoration in Italy, coral reef farming in Madagascar... However, caution should be exercised, to monitor the impacts on wild stock genetic variations, and assess the overall sustainability of such aquaculture versus other options such as strict conservation rules. \u2014 Aquaculture can be designed for fisheries enhancement and proposed as a valid alternative to overfishing on vulnerable stocks. Restocking for fisheries based on aquaculture has been well developed in many countries for decades such as Japan (all fisheries) and in the USA (salmon fisheries). But these kinds of aquaculture depend on specific national and local traditions, formal governance mechanisms, markets, and rely on appropriate monitoring tools, in order to avoid impacts on wild stocks. \u2014 Aquaculture can play a major role for food security, poverty alleviation and economic resilience of MPA local communities. For instance, in Madagascar (Focus Blue Venture case, p. 12), aquaculture is proposed as an alternative to overfishing in a region of great poverty, although it may be challenging to pursuade traditional fishing communities to switch to aquaculture. Women are often the actors of such transition. \u2014 Aquaculture can provide services to coastal ecosystems such as carbon sequestration, nutrient or phytoplankton biomitigation, benthic biodiversity restoration. These various benefits are mostly achieved with shellfish and seaweed cultures, but also mentioned with finfish cages (Focus Madeira p.9). However, research has to be carried out to better describe these services and point out their limits. This being the case, it can be said that a controversial aquaculture system, such as an intensive salmon cage farm, may become acceptable for a given marine protected area, provided that it is well placed and cleverly managed. The same farm, however, would be completely incompatible for an MPA hosting another specific marine habitat. In contrast, the cultivation of seaweeds or shellfish, considered a low impact aquaculture activity (with a small ecological footprint), may in fact become detrimental to a coastal socio- ecosystem, if not appropriately planned and managed. 9 FOCUS: CURRENT STATUS OF MPAS, MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING AND AQUACULTURE IN MADEIRA AND CANARY ISLANDS SWOT analysis of Aquaculture production in the archipelagos of Madeira and Canary Islands (C.Andrade - R.Haroun) Strengths \u2014 Studies show no significant impact of fish farms, \u2014 Aquaculture industry reaching maturation stage with economic, social and environmental issues integrated into the business, \u2014 Marine Reserves zonation provide an example integration of MPAs and economical activities.

On the other hand, the oldest fish farm and first pilot project in Madeira is due to move out of the limits of a designated marine bird reserve within ten years. In the case of the Canary islands, the Regional Agency of Fisheries defined in 2010 the Regional Plan of Aquaculture Zonation (PROAC in its Spanish acronym), which designated priority areas for aquaculture production along the coastlines of the Canary islands. Nevertheless, this Plan has not been implemented until now and new licenses have not been awarded for off-shore aquaculture production due to major differences among diverse governmental agencies and the uncertainties related to the implementation of the European Marine Framework Strategy Directive.

They should be defined and accepted among the stakeholders of the MPA project as a pre-requisite. Once the MPA objectives are defined, other issues will need to also be considered and agreed. Undeniably, in order to meet the Aichi objective of 10%, we need the extension of multi-purpose / multi-use MPAs. But more than a debate on MPA categories (\"no take\" zone or multiple-use zone), the crucial issue is to make sure that the right management tools are in place in order to satisfactorily meet MPA objectives. If both questions upon MPA objectives and the presence of an adequate management have been stated and accepted by the stakeholders (within the MPA and its surroundings), the aim of the aquaculture project should also be, in the same way, clearly questioned and acknowledged. Three contextual situations related to the MPA/aquaculture interaction have been identified: Development of a multiple-use MPA in an existing aquaculture area This relates to situations where aquaculture farms already exist before the MPA is actually declared and set up by the authorities. This context is widespread, well illustrated by Scottish cases, where most salmon or shellfish farms were existing before the MPA declaration (Focus, p. 11). Aquaculture farms are usually not moved out, but an impact assessment of the farms should be conducted in regard to the MPA\u2019s objectives, which may lead to the relocation of the farms or to re-definition of the MPA limits in extreme cases. Development of aquaculture farms in multiple-use MPAs The second situation illustrates the case where there is an existing multiple-use MPA and there is a call to develop aquaculture within the area in order to meet some of the local community\u2019s needs. In this situation, the type of aquaculture systems would need careful selection to meet the needs of the community and be compatible with the management objectives for the MPA, as the case study brought by Blue Venture in Madagascar illustrates (p. 12). Some guidance on aquaculture and multi-purpose MPAs has already been developed within the European community and could be helpful in this regard, as well as other general recommendations that already exist on site selection and aquaculture with regard to zootechnical and socio-economic issues. Joint creation of multiple-use MPAs with aquaculture operations In the third situation, the MPA is established and the associated aquaculture production(s) are set up as simultaneous developments. This situation is illustrated by the French Mayotte case (Focus, p. 13), although the fact may be argued that some aquaculture productions farming non-native carnivorous fish (at a very small scale) pre- existed in this area, prior to the Mayotte National Marine Park creation. The pre-existing situation of the farm is, in fact, the main reason why such an aquaculture production system was authorized within the multiple-use MPA.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d504d2a-7d14-4007-86cc-f70d9dc7f9e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d504d2a-7d14-4007-86cc-f70d9dc7f9e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/aquaculture-and-marine-protected-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Aquaculture and marine protected areas", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/aquaculture-and-marine-protected-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3df0119fc9745fbec48de4df662e06393529d0e9dcb1fd98eeb0d7900a6ec80f"}, "2": {"node_id": "80791395-2f25-45f0-8601-babbd71c68d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/aquaculture-and-marine-protected-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9af763aee83de2cec4cfea83441c7b43c07e4a2058210c5f864579097cd2b96e"}}, "hash": "579c0b8f83b1335567bf2f724432182aa572ca271cd938c57d37fb81f30ddf24", "text": "The key critical issues are related to how the decisions are made to allow such aquaculture production, how it will be monitored, and what vision the project leaders have for the future.

Various options of aquaculture types, systems, purposes and scales should be studied to optimally adapt the specificity and needs of each potential site and minimize adverse effects and the overall environmental footprint.

The purpose is to evaluate the consequences of a MPA creation for existing aquaculture farms (and other impacted sectors) on a specific site: what are the additional requirements for the farms, and consequently additional costs for them? Aquaculture farms within such new MPAs should display good practices and be able to prove it. \u2014 If MPA came first, then a Habitats Regulation Appraisal (HRA) is required. It should provide, and analyse sufficient information to allow a competent authority to ascertain whether the plan or project will not adversely affect the site\u2019s integrity. In addition, aquaculture sector professionals have developed a voluntary Code of Good Practice in order to address various practical issues such as cage and equipment design, prophylaxis, management and operational practices. For the Scottish and French authorities, for instance, fish production is acceptable, provided that \u201cgood practices\u201d are applied within the farms and good monitoring of the aquaculture impacts is in place (e.g. Scotland and Mayotte cases). Similarly, for the location and area of coverage, the location of the sites should be discussed with local stakeholders and aquaculture professionals in a concerted approach binding sustainable development, social integration and environmental considerations. MPA managers should be prepared to exchange ideas and visit diverse types of aquaculture farms to reach a better understanding on aquaculture concerns and limiting factors.

A matrix, with a similar format as those used by IUCN in its marine guidelines, is an effective tool to identify major synergies. Table (p. 7) provides an illustrative example of the type of approach in the interaction between MPAs and Aquaculture and should be used for general guidance as many of the specific issues are related to prevailing conditions in the specific site such as stocking densities, conservation objectives, etc. It could, however, provide a flexible frame to further explore potential synergies between aquaculture and MPAs, and help all concerned stakeholders identify specific issues that should be followed up on. Eventual decisions on whether to proceed or not, or to modify the original concept, will all depend on the overall case assessment. In addition, even where the illustrative example of Table (p. 7) shows green compatibility, this does not negate the need for comprehensive discussions and evaluation of siting and impacts. COULD INTEGRATED MULTI-TROPHIC AQUACULTURE (IMTA) PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SYNERGIES WITH MPA MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES? By definition, Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) (Focus IMTA) seems an interesting perspective on reducing negative aquaculture externalities and maximizing its production capacity whilst enhancing the associated marine biodiversity and augmenting resilient ecosystems. In this context, some applications of IMTA could be of interest within MPAs by providing enhanced opportunities to secure management synergies. IMTA could be deployed in various cases as in Table (p. 7) (e.g. high density fish cage cultures, shellfish culture, sea cucumber culture... ), although a specific assessment of the proposed local IMTA system must be conducted to define what level of compatibility it has regarding the MPA category. DO NON-NATIVE SPECIES AQUACULTURE OPERATIONS POSE DIFFICULTIES IN ACHIEVING GREATER SYNERGIES WITH MPAs? The acceptance or non-acceptance of the aquaculture production of a non-native species within an MPA is also a very critical point. For the nature conservation community, it seems quite difficult to accept that an aquaculture production of non-native species within an MPA could be allowed. However, non-native species are widespread, even in marine ecosystems within MPAs. In aquaculture worldwide, it has been a major trend for decades.

Following this approach, shellfish and marine plants for instance, could benefit from the organic and inorganic waste generated by finfish marine farms. Thus reducing their impact on the environment and, at the same time, diversifying income for the farmers. IMTA has been a traditional aquaculture system for centuries in Asia, associating agriculture-livestock productions to freshwater finfish polycultures. This has drawn attention recently, by some work in Canada and Europe, where seaweed, finfish and shellfish productions are associated within the same coastal area. on the introduction of new species of oysters in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94e1cb7e-556a-4a88-9e4d-cd5a0e6f5911": {"__data__": {"id_": "94e1cb7e-556a-4a88-9e4d-cd5a0e6f5911", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/aquaculture-and-marine-protected-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Aquaculture and marine protected areas", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/aquaculture-and-marine-protected-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3e6de3ce7f79e048fb3e6b86d216a8492c15e78f299b0045c9312b3dcaf6c13d"}, "3": {"node_id": "677979d0-285c-4d89-9078-2ea7e9cabb1f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/aquaculture-and-marine-protected-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e4f47ce84113bf93f5f504a07df14cd64da1fd3037f1782af21e3163bc798f4"}}, "hash": "048902e6c56c5b53ffad571489fd84828ec07ebed9131598b7525dfe96d1e530", "text": "order to overcome epidemic outbreaks in local oyster species. Even in the situation where the aquaculture production is based on a local species like Atlantic salmon in Scotland and Norway, it may also be argued that the domesticated farmed fish becomes, over time, quite genetically far from the local wild species. Consequently, each case of aquaculture should be contextually analysed, and risk assessed, with regard to this particular issue of non-native species, and whether the species concerned is already farmed in the local or national context. The frame provided by the European Union with regard to risk analysis, provides a very valid approach, as it has been approved and validated by the scientific expert community. EXPLORING NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES: MPA/AQUACULTURE MONITORING, DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION Many potential synergies exist between MPAs and aquaculture and vice versa. In the coming years, stakeholders and MPA managers should come together more often to better understand the aquaculture sector, its constraints for production, and its intrinsic needs for a high- quality environment. At the same time, MPA managers and aquaculture leaders should always work to reduce conflicts, but should also explore optimising advantages, especially in the area of supporting conservation efforts, restocking, and lowering environmental footprints and intensity of production systems. Among available tools and potential approaches/ concepts that should help in reconciling aquaculture and MPAs, the following were identified: \u2014 The concepts of Ecosystem Approach to Aquaculture and Carrying Capacity: they provide very valid tools, integrating human activities within the wider ecosystem (Focus Ecosystem approach and carrying capacity). \u2014 The development and application of Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) together with Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM): They constitute dynamic processes facilitating site selection \u2013 with the correct water quality and siting measures \u2013 for aquaculture applications. \u2014 SWOT analyses: As illustrated by the case studies, a SWOT analysis may provide a valid analytical tool, shared with stakeholders, to evaluate ongoing aquaculture projects within MPAs and identify the actions to correct weaknesses and prevent failures. \u2014 \u2018Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures\u2019 (OECM): Alongside the traditional view of MPAs, more options for cooperation may open in the future through new guidance IUCN will develop for the Convention on Biological Diversity to further elaborate achieving Aichi Target 11. Conceptual model for an IMTA system by Joyce Hui (www.joycehuiart.com). \u00a9 Her Majesty the Queen of Canada, 2013. FOCUS: ECOSYSTEM BASED APPROACH AND CARRYING CAPACITY The Ecosystem approach is a powerful tool for the integrated management of human activities and should be used to address site selection and management. This approach, based on the best available scientific, traditional and local knowledge, gives an equal voice to all stakeholders including the aquaculture community. It aims to optimise the use of an ecosystem without damage, through the management of human impacts and activities. Carrying capacity is a concept defined (in the case of aquaculture) as the maximum biomass of a farmed species that can be supported by an ecosystem without by-passing the maximum acceptable impacts to the farmed population. Carrying capacity can be broken down into four categories; production, physical, ecological and social. 15 \u2014 Environment Impact Assessment (EIA): It can be required by national authorities and will address most of the key questions addressed in this paper. \u2014 Good practices as a standard and consideration to a certification: In MPAs, aquaculture should be developed on the basis of best practices. Those good practices may be recognised and controlled through a certification process. However existing standards such as organic or ASC (Aquaculture Stewardship Council) may not address the objectives of an MPA. New certification standards could be created (\"certified MPA-friendly\") but this may lead to an uncertain, costly and time-consuming process, may be questionable regarding MPA and aquaculture diversity cases. In addition, it may create a gap between emerging and wealthy industrial country situations. \u2014 The use of impact assessment tools such as Life cycle analysis or Ecological Footprint: They are being adapted for aquaculture activities. However, due to the diverse and multidisciplinary nature of environment issues and highly variable production processes, implementation so far does not reflect the full diversity of aquaculture activities and often neglects social aspects of sustainability.

However, more than a percentage number, it is far more relevant to attain conservation objectives and to do so, it will be essential that the appropiate types of governance and management system are in place. These are critical issues as MPAs expand to cover greater areas of the oceans. Similarly, the aim of an aquaculture project should also be clearly set out alongside adequate governance frameworks and the selected management system to allow sustainable seafood production under an ecosystem approach. Understanding the relationship between aquaculture and multiple-use MPAs is critical in developing opportunities for greater synergies. This in turn has the potential to develop a simple matrix of aquaculture systems vs MPAs categories to support broader discussions in both communities.

The diversity of farming methods using a wide range of technologies and species predicates against this. In most cases, approaches will anyway need to be adapted or applied according to the objectives of specific MPAs. A matrix may be useful for broader discussions but a case by case and stepwise approach will always need to be taken through a participatory approach, using tools appropriate to the circumstances, available data and the specific requirement of the specific MPA - with an equal consideration of ecological, social and economic issues. Examples do exist though, and include providing alternative livelihoods for small-scale artisanal fisheries to encourage them to shift to low impact aquaculture, such as sea cucumber ranching and rope-based seaweed aquaculture. More broadly, where economic income is needed within a multiple-use MPA and choices can be made, options for properly selected aquaculture sites may be far more preferential and sustainable than other economic options which would involve destruction and/or permanent loss of habitats and species.

relationships that have evolved over millennia in this unique and vulnerable part of our planet, and the cultures who depend upon them. In addition, melting ice means the Arctic is opening to new human activity in the ocean, such as offshore oil and gas development, shipping and fishing. These activities have the potential to inflict further stress on Arctic marine ecosystems already straining under the effects of climate change. I believe we have a historic opportunity, and a profound obligation, to do what we can to educate people around the world about the need to protect ecologically important and sensitive ocean habitats in the Arctic for future generations. The need to act is urgent. The Paris Climate Agreement of 2015 represented a crucial step toward addressing global warming and its effects on the Arctic. As we work to implement that agreement, we must also strengthen the health and resilience of the Arctic by protecting key habitats and ecosystems from damaging human activities. This report presents the results of a scientific workshop convened to identify globally unique marine areas in the Arctic that exemplify the criteria for inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List. It builds on a previous report, published in 2007, on Arctic World Heritage funded in part by my Foundation.

This report presents the results of a scientific assessment of globally significant ecosystems in the Arctic Ocean that may be of Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) with respect to the natural criteria for World Heritage status. The report is intended to advance recognition and conservation of globally significant natural marine sites in the Arctic, a region which is currently under-represented on the World Heritage List. The report does not assess potential OUV related to cultural heritage, which was beyond the scope of the project. This report describes seven exceptional areas in the Arctic Ocean that are of such global significance that they may be of OUV and thus be priorities for inscription on the World Heritage List. The methodology used to identify these sites involved: 1) Preparation of a preliminary desktop scientific assessment of the key physical and biological features that distinguish the Arctic Ocean globally, along with an evaluation of illustrative sites that best exemplify these features and are of sufficient integrity and scale to be considered of OUV. The desktop study was based on existing data and information gathered from peer- reviewed scientific publications, previous assessments The Bering Strait Ecoregion Disko Bay and Store Helle\ufb01skebanke Ecoregion The Northern Baf\ufb01n Bay Ecoregion High Arctic Archipelagos The Great Siberian Polynya Remnant Arctic Multi-Year Sea Ice and the Northeast Water Polynya Ecoregion The Scoresby Sound Polynya Ecoregion 500 km Illustrations of Potential OUV in the Arctic Marine Environment Marine Boundary Map: Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab, Duke University (2016) The marine areas of potential Outstanding Universal Value represent the priorities that emerged through the workshop and review process described in this report.

This was followed by individual and group consultations with workshop participants and further peer-review. Workshop participants and additional reviewers are listed in Annex 2. The seven areas identified through this process do not represent a comprehensive list, but are intended to be illustrative of sites that best illustrate the globally unique features of the Arctic Ocean. They are: \uf0a7\ufffd The Bering Strait Ecoregion (including St. Lawrence Island). As the Pacific gateway to the Arctic Ocean, the Bering Strait Ecoregion is one of the world\u2019s great migration corridors. An estimated 12 million seabirds nest, forage and breed in the Bering Strait Ecoregion, and hundreds of thousands of marine mammals of several species migrate through the Strait in both spring and fall. The region also illustrates important geological history, having functioned during periods of low sea level as a land bridge between North America and Eurasia. \uf0a7\ufffd Remnant Arctic Multi-Year Sea Ice and the Northeast Water Polynya Ecoregion. Containing much of the thickest, oldest ice in the Arctic and one of its largest polynyas,1 this region presents a striking combination of Arctic marine phenomena. Multi-year sea ice, a globally unique habitat, and its associated species are likely to persist for the longest period of time here as the Arctic warms and sea ice melts. The adjacent Northeast Water Polynya supports many species, including the critically endangered Spitsbergen stock of bowhead whale. \uf0a7\ufffd The Northern Baffin Bay Ecoregion.

Polynyas often provide critical habitat for birds, mammals and other marine life. \uf0a7\ufffd Disko Bay and Store Hellefiskebanke Ecoregion. Complex physical and ecological processes in the Disko Bay and Store Hellefiskebanke Ecoregion, which is linked to an existing World Heritage site in western Greenland, lead to enhanced primary production in this area, which in turn supports diverse Arctic mammals and seabirds. Store Hellefiskebanke is a critical winter habitat for the West Greenland/ Baffin Island walrus population (around 1,400 animals estimated in 2012), along with hundreds of thousands of king eiders. \uf0a7\ufffd The Scoresby Sound Polynya Ecoregion. The Scoresby Sound Polynya Ecoregion includes the world\u2019s largest fjord system. Among other functions, the associated polynya provides seabirds with important feeding opportunities in spring and early summer, when ice still blocks coasts further to the north and south. The Scoresby Sound Polynya Ecoregion is very important for several IUCN Red- Listed species, including the critically endangered Spitsbergen stock of bowhead whale, narwhal, polar bear, Atlantic walrus and ivory gull, and supports the second largest breeding population of little auks. \uf0a7\ufffd High Arctic Archipelagos. Consisting of the waters between and around the Arctic\u2019s extreme northern archipelagos (Svalbard, Franz Josef Land and Severnaya Zemlya), the High Arctic Archipelagos separate shallow coastal seas from the deep Arctic Basin, and are a region of high productivity and important habitat for walrus, polar bear and other threatened species. The shelf topography of the region is extremely diverse and includes archipelagos and islands, insular shelves, shallow and deep-water fjords, edge and cross troughs, and sea-bottom edge glacial formations. The High Arctic Archipelagos support connected populations of birds and mammals, including 85% of the global population of ivory gulls. \uf0a7\ufffd The Great Siberian Polynya. Located in the Russian Arctic, the Great Siberian Polynya is a spectacular example of Arctic polynya ecosystems and is of great significance to marine biological diversity. Most species of fish, and nearly all the seabirds and marine mammals in the Laptev Sea are dependent on the Great Siberian Polynya. This region is also one of the most important ice-exporting areas in the Arctic. Through the course of this project, a number of additional areas were identified as worthy of further consideration as Arctic marine regions of potential OUV (see Annex 3). 8 Natural MariNe World Heritage iN tHe arctic oceaN Conclusions and recommendations The sites identified through this process are illustrative of the exceptional nature and value of the Arctic marine environment. This report is meant to inspire their possible future protection as part of our global marine heritage. As Arctic sea ice retreats, these superb marine features are becoming increasingly accessible to fishing, shipping and new economic demands and threats. The dramatic pace at which Arctic sea ice has declined in recent years highlights the urgency for enhanced understanding and protection of these priceless places of potential OUV. Protection through the 1972 UNESCO World Heritage Convention is one crucial way to secure these places for generations to come. An analysis of the current Tentative Lists of States Parties to the World Heritage Convention that have jurisdiction over portions of the Arctic Ocean highlights important gaps when compared to the scientific assessment reflected in this report. Only two of the seven areas of possible OUV as identified in this report are currently partially represented on the Tentative Lists of States Parties: Svalbard Archipelago (Norway) and Quttinirpaaq (Canada). There is thus a serious mismatch between the Tentative Lists and marine areas of possible OUV in the Arctic Ocean. In view of this, States Parties to the 1972 World Heritage Convention may wish to consider the following recommendations: 1) To update their respective Tentative Lists in relation to the Arctic.

This report focuses on marine areas, with limited consideration of coastal areas. It does not address the terrestrial or freshwater nature conservation values of the region, nor did it consider estuaries and deltas. The Arctic hosts globally significant areas for nature conservation beyond its highly significant marine values that are the subject of the present report. The biodiversity, geodiversity and wider nature conservation values of the Arctic need to be assessed for their potential OUV, as a priority step to the representation of the Arctic on the World Heritage List. This will also be important for some of the marine conservation areas identified in this report, especially those with terrestrial components; 4) To evaluate OUV in the Arctic Ocean and the broader Arctic region from a cultural and traditional knowledge perspective. A key conclusion of the expert workshop centered on the intimate relationship between local communities, particularly indigenous peoples and traditional cultures, and the Arctic\u2019s natural marine environment. The OUV of the Arctic region should be considered from both its cultural and natural perspectives. Furthermore, the full recognition of the rights of concerned communities, as recognized in the Convention\u2019s Operational Guidelines, is fundamental in any nomination process. Cultural values and traditional use and rights will need to be considered within and beyond the relevant priority areas identified in this report; 5) To pursue a wider evaluation of marine conservation values in the Arctic, including the High Seas. There are more marine areas in the Arctic Ocean that could be considered to be of OUV beyond the seven priorities identified in this report, and further evaluation is needed of the areas identified in Annex 3 at a minimum. The potential application of the World Heritage Convention in the High Seas is a topic of current discussion, and thus the High Seas of the Arctic, including the North Pole, provides a further focus for the identification of potential OUV in the region. 6) To nominate candidate areas in the Arctic Ocean as World Heritage Sites that meet fully the criteria, integrity, protection and management requirements of OUV, and thus would merit inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List, considering the priority areas described in this report. Natural MariNe World Heritage iN tHe arctic oceaN 9 cHapter 1: IntroductIon 1.1 The 1972 UNESCO World Heritage Convention and the Arctic The 1972 UNESCO World Heritage Convention1 unites nations behind a shared commitment to preserve the world\u2019s outstanding cultural and natural heritage for the benefit of present and future generations. It recognizes that the protection of this heritage is the collective responsibility of the international community as a whole. As of 1 February 2017, there are 1052 properties inscribed on the World Heritage List, including 814 cultural sites, 203 natural sites and 35 mixed sites, across 165 different States Parties.2 About 50 sites are considered marine,3 representing just 4.7 percent of all 1052 World Heritage sites but covering 55.5 percent of the total area of all natural and mixed World Heritage sites.4 Currently, five World Heritage properties are located north of the Arctic Circle, including three natural, one mixed and one cultural site: 5 \uf0a7\ufffd The Rock Art of Alta, Norway, 1985, (cultural); \uf0a7\ufffd Laponian Area, Sweden, 1996, (mixed); \uf0a7\ufffd Ilulissat Icefjord, Denmark, 2004, (natural); \uf0a7\ufffd Natural System of Wrangel Island Reserve, Russian Federation, 2004, (natural); and \uf0a7\ufffd Putorana Plateau, Russian Federation, 2010, (natural). Of these World Heritage sites, only one site is recognized within the World Heritage Marine Programme: the Natural System of Wrangel Island Reserve (Russian Federation). Since its designation in 2004, no new marine World Heritage sites in the Arctic Ocean have been inscribed on the World Heritage List. In that time-frame accelerating loss of sea ice and accompanying economic development have posed increasing risks to unique and globally significant Arctic marine features. 1.2 Ecological relationships linking the Arctic Ocean to existing World Heritage sites in other regions The Arctic Ocean has a profound impact on the wellbeing of ecosystems all over the world. Many birds that breed in the Arctic during summer season, for example, migrate south during winter to feed and rest. They go as far south as the Wadden Sea (Denmark, Germany, Netherlands) and the Banc d\u2019Arguin National Park (Mauritania), two of the most critical points for migratory birds on the East Atlantic Flyway and inscribed on the World Heritage List in 2010 and 1989 respectively (Figure 1).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba18393a-cb08-4f9e-a124-9ac09de42038": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba18393a-cb08-4f9e-a124-9ac09de42038", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/natural-marine-world-heritage-arctic-ocean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural marine World Heritage in the Arctic Ocean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/natural-marine-world-heritage-arctic-ocean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3fabd5a5bb5fd78e43af3e53fb8a5ef90219dbeeee0798fb1a67afeb2e417411"}, "2": {"node_id": "f539a3cf-4a3e-4314-b265-f9297fffbcb7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/natural-marine-world-heritage-arctic-ocean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "51e0500bdeb5f0fc2746b2390f05f82e19708c9734e6483e9bb223978b25c612"}}, "hash": "ae3a84bc209f05aa4e418bfd164d7cfab01b7d705ee719db2ca86ceca748b2f4", "text": "The ecosystems of these two World Heritage sites are thus intimately connected with the Arctic Ocean and the protection of the Arctic\u2019s key features is important to those sites.6 7 Figure 1: Interconnectivity between", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "512a21ad-7d6f-4253-a4ef-0850c3c3367e": {"__data__": {"id_": "512a21ad-7d6f-4253-a4ef-0850c3c3367e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/natural-marine-world-heritage-arctic-ocean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural marine World Heritage in the Arctic Ocean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/natural-marine-world-heritage-arctic-ocean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7cd520138f1cfe97ee4e01e1e3ad58b3a32fdf071440083b3132658a5342cc69"}}, "hash": "7cd520138f1cfe97ee4e01e1e3ad58b3a32fdf071440083b3132658a5342cc69", "text": "the Arctic and the Wadden Sea and Banc d\u2019Arguin National Park World Heritage marine sites.

Most of the subpopulation migrates between the lagoons of El Vizcaino and the summer feeding grounds 7 Chapter 1: INtrODUCtION 10 Natural MariNe World Heritage iN tHe arctic oceaN in the Chukchi, Beaufort and Northwestern Bering Seas in the Arctic. Research suggests that some whales migrate all the way from Mexico to the feeding grounds near the Natural System of Wrangel Island Reserve (Russian Federation) World Heritage site.8 These are just two examples of the connections between the Arctic Ocean and existing World Heritage sites in lower latitudes. These connections, along with the responsibilities of States under the World Heritage Convention to protect their own and each other\u2019s World Heritage, and the requirements for integrity, protection and management for World Heritage sites, form a strong argument for increased protection of the Arctic. The OUV of some World Heritage sites may be jeopardized if no additional protection measures are taken in the Arctic region. Box 1: Previous analyses of World Heritage in the Arctic The 2007 Expert Meeting on World Heritage and the Arctic The first International Expert Meeting on World Heritage and the Arctic took place from 30 November to 1 December 2007 in Narvik, Norway, organized by the Nordic World Heritage Foundation and the UNESCO World Heritage Centre, with the support of the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation.10 The meeting focused on the exchange of information on the natural and cultural heritage of the Arctic region, with identification of potential sites of Outstanding Universal Value for the World Heritage List. Participants at the meeting noted that \u201cthe Arctic Region is one of the gaps on the World Heritage List with only two natural properties, one mixed and one cultural property, located north of the Arctic Circle.\u201d It was also emphasized that \u201cthe Arctic region is important for global processes and is to be considered as precious heritage for humankind. The region includes a number of unique and outstanding natural and cultural heritage places which require protection, improved management and international recognition due to their vulnerability.\u201d Seven recommendations were made during the meeting, including a proposal put forward by IUCN to prepare a thematic study on natural heritage in the Arctic region. Preliminary Gap Analysis In 2012, the UNESCO World Heritage Marine Programme commissioned an initial overview of existing marine World Heritage sites to assess the extent to which major marine regions and marine ecosystems are represented on the World Heritage List.11 The review found several key gaps \u2013 regions and ecosystem types where there are few if any marine World Heritage sites, despite the presence of exceptional marine features. The review concluded that: \u201cThe Arctic Realm might be of special interest. Nearly no World Heritage sites exist anywhere along the vast and distinct Arctic coastlines but contain many exceptional marine features.\u201d IUCN Thematic Study on Marine World Heritage In 2013, IUCN published its thematic study on marine World Heritage,12 which analyzed the biogeographic covera
