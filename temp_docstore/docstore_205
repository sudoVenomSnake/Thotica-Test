DG continues. But this will take time. Technical and institutional innovations in data gathering can capture perspectives and trends beyond the official statistics. To carry out effective follow-up and review for the SDGs, governments need to better use the multidisciplinary expertise that exists across their structures and seek access to expertise that strengthens their capacity to develop integrated policies and strategies. Moving forward, it is important to engage the whole range of stakeholders in developing a better- shared understanding of future challenges. The perspectives captured in this report can serve as a starting point for dialogue with stakeholders in various regional forums, such as the Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development, and at the national level. Many of the cross-cutting issues highlighted can benefit from regional action, peer learning and cooperation. By providing a basis for regional dialogue, the knowledge products of the ESCAP, ADB and UNDP partnership will extend meaningful support to national implementation efforts as well as to regional peer learning. 132 Endnotes 1. Other forms of poverty exist beyond income poverty, and they are related to the lack of access to education and health services, modern energy services, safe drinking water, sanitation and adequate food and nutrition. Climate-related impacts and natural disasters can worsen the deprivation of vulnerable groups and marginalized communities of people from the public provisioning of development-oriented services. 2. PPP=purchasing power parity. 3. Calculated by ESCAP. Due to changes in the methodology applied for the China 2013 household survey, on which poverty data for that year are based, the comparability with previous years is subject to caution.

The New Industrial Revolution is an umbrella term that captures the ongoing industrial development characterized by connectivity between people, things and resources, supported by new developments in information technology and advanced manufacturing. This process also includes a blurring of lines between the physical and digital worlds and between different economic sectors, such as services and industry. It presents great opportunities for enhanced, efficient and environment-friendly economic growth. 3. L.

Vulnerable employment is defined as the sum of the employment status groups of own-account workers and contributing family workers. Workers in vulnerable employment are less likely to have formal work arrangements and are thus more likely to lack elements associated with decent employment, such as adequate social security and recourse to effective social dialogue mechanisms. Vulnerable employment is often characterized by inadequate earnings, low productivity and difficult conditions of work that undermine workers\u2019 fundamental rights.

It singles out \u201cbright spots\u201d and \u201chot spots\u201d, provides insights about each goal and points to emerging issues. It reveals many of the common challenges that governments will confront as they work to develop appropriate responses to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The outlook report represents a preliminary but comprehensive stocktaking effort in the region to provide the best available knowledge that can help governments, regional agencies and other development actors as they forge the much-needed social and political consensus on the gaps and priorities for achieving each SDG. Despite the publishers\u2019 confidence in the rigour of this report, the content does not fully match the breadth and complexity of information required by governments and other development actors to fully grasp the nuances of the goals and targets.

Its mandate is to foster cooperation between its 53 members and 9 associate members. ESCAP provides the strategic link between the global and country-level programmes and issues. It supports governments in consolidating regional positions and advocates regional approaches to meeting the unique socioeconomic challenges in a globalizing world. The ESCAP office is located in Bangkok. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to a large share of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth and regional integration. Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants and technical assistance. The United Nations Development Programme partners with people at all levels of society to help build nations that can withstand crisis and drive and sustain the kind of growth that improves the quality of life for everyone. On the ground in nearly 170 countries and territories, we offer global perspectives and local insight to help empower lives and build resilient nations.

These are timely issues for countries in Asia and the Pacific to focus on. Overall, the region has made impressive gains in reducing income poverty in recent decades. Nevertheless, too many people across the Asia-Pacific region still confront poverty as part of their daily life. Some 400 million people, almost one in ten, live in extreme income poverty. One in four people in the developing countries of the region are deprived in additional ways that impact their health, education and standard of living and increase the likelihood that all people in the region will not benefit from shared prosperity. As the development context of our region changes, the relationships between and among governments, the public, the private sector and other players are evolving. Relationships between countries are also changing, and there is evidence to suggest that gaps between the poorest countries in the region and middle-income countries may be growing. This report highlights three key entry points for addressing poverty and expanding prosperity in the region: through pro-poor urbanization, effective management of rural\u2013urban transitions with a focus on rural development, and enabling investment in sustainable and equitable infrastructure. Although people in extreme income poverty are more likely to live in rural areas, they are also increasingly found in our cities and peri-urban areas. The provision of high-quality, low-carbon and resilient infrastructure, with emphasis on meeting the last-mile needs of the poorest, will be essential and requires a paradigm shift in planning and design. Our analysis is set in the context of long-term trends in the Asia-Pacific region that will shape approaches to poverty alleviation and the prospects for achieving prosperity. These include increasing regional cooperation, growing urbanization, shifting demographics (including ageing in some countries and migration), growing but uneven access to information and communications technology and the rising demand for natural resources. Effective action on eradicating poverty requires tackling the systemic, sociocultural and geographic factors that underpin marginalization, exclusion and lack of protection for human rights. The number of people likely to be in vulnerable employment in the region is now greater than the global average, for example, and women are particularly affected. Measures to ensure that all people can benefit from growth in the region on an equal footing are needed. By analysing the links between these trends and highlighting good practices, this report will provide useful input into regional and global dialogues, including at the upcoming High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development and its preparatory events. Our three organizations are pleased to partner to support achievement of the 2030 Agenda at all levels of governance in our region, and we hope that this report provides useful insights into opportunities for making progress.

This comprehensive understanding should inform national implementation planning efforts and regional cooperation initiatives. With its focus on the theme of the 2017 session of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development\u2014\u201cEradicating poverty and promoting prosperity in a changing world\u201d, this first annual thematic report is produced to support discussions within the region and to inform implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the national level. More than one in ten people in Asia and the Pacific\u2014some 400 million people\u2014live in extreme income poverty. A much larger number\u2014more than one in four people\u2014in the region\u2019s developing countries experience poverty in multiple dimensions. The concept of multidimensional poverty enables a more complete grasp of the links between the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and thus a more coherent and effective policy framework. In some countries, multidimensional and income poverty rates coincide, while in others, multidimensional poverty rates are either much higher or lower than income poverty rates. The structural factors that determine whether, and to what extent, people benefit from development need to be better understood.

The changing development context of the Asia-Pacific region presents new opportunities to reduce poverty and expand prosperity. Yet, there are growing risks that all people may not be able to participate in the economy on an equal footing or benefit from prosperity gains. Transforming the futures of all people in this region will depend on the capacity of the governments to address the structural dimensions of marginalization, exclusion and inequality, whether within a country or between countries. Regional economic integration, urbanization, demographic change, access to information and communications technology (ICT) and connectivity and the rising demand for natural resources are regional trends associated with changing economic structures, market forces and the flows of finance, information and natural resources. They are imposing new pressures and challenges to decision-making and resource allocation. Women and migrants in urban areas and impoverished rural households, all of whom daily deal with a convergence of risks, are likely to face heightened barriers to improving their situations. In this context, public institutions must better equip themselves to balance and align the interests of different stakeholders. The \u201creciprocal rights, obligations and responsibilities between states and citizens\u201d\u2014and among stakeholders, sometimes referred to as a social contract, will determine how equitably the interests of all people\u2014particularly people who are most vulnerable\u2014are identified, prioritized and balanced. This report explores three entry points to the theme of poverty and prosperity: (i) managing urbanization for inclusive development, (ii) strengthening responses to rural poverty in the context of the rural\u2013urban transitions and (iii) infrastructure development. Each area presents opportunities and challenges in a changing development context. Managing urbanization for inclusive development More than half of the Asia and Pacific region\u2019s population will reside in urban areas by 2018. Multidimensional poverty is already an important feature of these expanding urban landscapes\u2014 xii almost 10 per cent of people living in urban areas live in multidimensional poverty. Urbanization has demonstrated a positive correlation with economic growth, helping millions of people move out of poverty. At the same time, urbanization processes have increased inequality, exclusion and risks. The rural\u2013urban transitions and demographic changes taking place across the region and their gendered dimensions have far-reaching implications for both rural and urban areas and for family structures and communities. Larger numbers of older people are living independently and are more likely to be women who are widowed, who are likely to spend a larger percentage of their lifetime with a disability and who are more than twice as likely to live in poverty. Opportunities presented by technological innovation and digital connectivity have benefited even the poorest of households, but these opportunities are not accessible to everyone. Cities are the hubs of regional integration processes and rising demand for natural resources and thus have also become a nexus of transboundary challenges, such as migration, crime, the spread of disease, climate change impacts and the increasing burden of waste. Efforts to promote inclusive urbanization must successfully deal with inequality and exclusion, the increasing vulnerability of impoverished and slum populations, the increasing and more complex health risks and inadequate infrastructure and services. Urban areas are particularly vulnerable to shocks, crises and disasters. People who are poor, marginalized and vulnerable suffer disproportionately when calamity hits. Although high densities of people, jobs and assets have positive impacts, urban areas also make populations extremely vulnerable to both natural and human-made risks. Marginalized groups, including migrants, tend to be the poorest and most neglected people in urban areas. Along with women and other vulnerable groups, their needs often go unrecognized and unmet. Inclusive and sustainable urban management needs to prioritize building the resilience of the most vulnerable strata of urban society. Some cities are already leading the way on inclusive approaches to managing urbanization, including utilizing tailored measures of multidimensional poverty. There are also recognized limitations, ranging from political and fiscal power to weak institutional capacity. Addressing these governance dimensions, including through peer-to-peer networks, will be necessary to reduce poverty in urban areas. Focusing on the gendered aspects of migration in the region and on improving the well-being of women migrants in particular can help chip away at persistent poverty and inequality in rural and urban areas. These groups often face the amplified effects of multidimensional poverty and thus require special attention in the urbanization process. Frequently due to a lack of options, migrants relocate to areas in cities where they lack access to basic services. Women in these areas who cannot access safe public transportation, for example, may", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb4d98b9-d332-4153-8548-692bfe8468f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb4d98b9-d332-4153-8548-692bfe8468f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dda31edcb3b0d38b332a8b8e93b3cf4683a36028c0aa98fa5206e7ea272e0860"}}, "hash": "dda31edcb3b0d38b332a8b8e93b3cf4683a36028c0aa98fa5206e7ea272e0860", "text": "also experience deprivation of health care, education and employment. Localizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in cities can be an important opportunity to renew the social contract, re-envision urban governance and better include those who have been left behind. The 2030 Agenda as well as the New Urban Agenda depend on a renewed social contract for their success. Both Agendas underline the need for inclusive and participatory approaches and partnerships. Cities have strong potential to adapt these Agendas to their context and to establish effective partnerships. Elements of a paradigm shift in urban development \u2022 Urban social protection programmes \u2022 Adoption of multidimensional approaches to addressing poverty and using updated measurement tools, such as the Multidimensional Poverty Index \u2022 Risk-informed urban planning \u2022 Focus on marginalized and vulnerable groups, including women and migrants, and the gendered aspects of migration \u2022 Examined and renewed social contracts emphasizing inclusive and participatory approaches and partnerships in the context of localizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \u2022 Policy links between urban and rural development strategies rather than adhering to an urban\u2013rural dichotomy xiii Strengthening responses to rural poverty in the context of the rural\u2013urban transitions More than half of the region\u2019s total population lives in rural areas. And almost two in five people living in rural areas in developing countries live in multidimensional poverty, although there have been notable improvements in income poverty. The 2030 Agenda highlights the need to increase investment in rural infrastructure and to support positive links among urban, peri-urban and rural areas by strengthening national and regional development planning. It also provides for the protection of natural ecosystems and biodiversity, which will contribute to attainment of the 17 SDGs and for which rural areas largely have a custodial role. Governments face severe political pressure due to agriculture\u2019s declining share in gross domestic product value. While agricultural GDP value-added stood at 6.9 per cent in 2014, the sector employed 36 per cent of the region\u2019s workforce and more than 60 per cent of the workforce in the least developed countries in 2013. Economic structural changes mean that governments increasingly have to balance competing but equally important policy objectives with respect to food security, environmental sustainability and poverty reduction. The approach to these multiple policy objectives will determine the long-term development impact of rural\u2013urban transitions. The response to the rural sector and to the role of agriculture in the context of the ongoing rural\u2013 urban transitions will be critical to the prosperity of all people in the region. Rural poverty eradication is inherently linked with urban poverty through the flows of people, natural resources, information and technologies. The rising demand for ecosystem services and natural resources is an emerging issue in rural land use. Demographic changes are leading to more fragile, vulnerable rural populations. Climate change and disasters already place a heavy burden on the agriculture sector and threaten rural livelihoods. And cross-border investments and agricultural corporatization often offer only limited benefits for rural populations. These trends exacerbate the lack of access to and ownership of land, which is particularly constrained for women and indigenous peoples. Demographic changes and the rural\u2013urban transitions are also prompting the ageing and feminization of agriculture, which will have long-term consequences unless the gender inequalities are resolved (for instance, the yield gap between male and female farmers is directly attributable to differences in access to economic resources). Strengthened responses to rural poverty require policy interventions to support innovations in infrastructure provisioning and financing, community-based and participatory management approaches, farmers\u2019 organizations, policy research and investment in sustainable agriculture and rural development as well as in the sustainable management of natural resources. A focus on the agriculture sector must be reinforced with investment in agricultural resources and development, which is increasingly critical for poverty reduction. Public sector spending on agriculture is not commensurate with agriculture\u2019s overall importance for securing food security for all people. In fact, the regional average for agricultural spending relative to agricultural GDP lags behind other regions. Coherence of rural policy solutions with national macroeconomic, social and environmental policies and international agreements is critical.

Infrastructure development\u2014Building for tomorrow Although significant progress has been made in expanding infrastructure within the region, basic needs remain unmet. Future demand for infrastructure will be substantial. Concerted efforts are needed to cover the last mile in clean energy, safe water and sanitation and digital connectivity infrastructure for hundreds of millions of unserved people. Transitions in Asia and the Pacific are shaping the infrastructure needs and demands. Infrastructure investment projections for the region indicate a need of more than $26 trillion, or about $1.7 trillion per year, equivalent to 5.9 per cent of forecasted GDP. Governments already have a central role in financing infrastructure in the region, providing more than 90 per cent of finance to date. But it is frequently not sufficient. The costs of closing the gaps in access to basic infrastructure are likely a modest share of this total projected investment. There are particular challenges, however, in raising and directing finance to close the gaps in access to basic infrastructure as well as for raising the quality and sustainability of infrastructure. There are promising technological innovations, particularly in the areas of energy and ICT, that can more quickly narrow the access gaps and at lower cost than previously. Infrastructure has an imperative role for rural and urban communities, connecting and enabling the two-way movement of people, information and opportunities. Basic infrastructure services, such as water and sanitation, are sorely inadequate in many urban areas, and the quality and environmental sustainability of energy and transport infrastructure urgently needs to be improved. At the same time, however, the largest number of people without access to infrastructure services, such as electricity, better drinking water and the internet, live in rural areas. Integrated approaches to infrastructure planning that consider the rural\u2013urban links and approaches to meet the differing needs of stakeholders can help countries better manage the rural\u2013urban transitions. Continued innovation in financing will be needed. The implications for financing infrastructure delivery encompass mobilizing the funds, building meaningful public-private partnerships and reconciling project and investors\u2019 needs. New business models as well as new approaches to attract financing from a wider range of investors will be necessary. Access to concessional and risk-tolerant finance can facilitate these efforts. Strengthened governance encompassing institutions, rules and processes, backed by a capable public sector, will be vital for the structure and oversight of equitable and efficient infrastructure that maximizes social gains and long-term sustainability imperatives. Delivering infrastructure that will contribute towards poverty and prosperity gains in the context of the SDGs will involve enhancing the planning and selection of projects, managing the environmental and social impacts (including through incentives for service delivery that supports environmental and social objectives) and providing more effective oversight. Delivering infrastructure for sustainable development \u2022 Cover the last mile in clean energy, safe water and sanitation and digital connectivity infrastructure needs \u2022 Promote better-quality, low-carbon, resilient and environmentally sustainable solutions \u2022 Diversify financing sources and approaches \u2022 Strengthen governance, including through better planning, sound policies and regulations xv In conclusion The exploration presented through this report ultimately emphasizes how policy coherence is critical and how a multidimensional understanding of poverty and prosperity is foundational to that coherence. It also offers insights into how policy coherence through the SDGs can create opportunities for making progress on the subset of goals that are the focus of the 2017 session of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. As the development context changes, the ability of economic and political systems to equitably fulfil the aspirations of all people, including future generations, will be increasingly challenged. Public institutions must better equip themselves to better balance and align the interests of different stakeholders. Many of the examples highlighted in the report work towards strengthening the social contract and provide opportunities for innovative partnerships that enable solutions for poverty eradication and the better sharing of prosperity. Political commitment and allocation of resources as well as institutional support for tackling marginalization and exclusion, including through the protection of human rights, are needed. The widening gaps between countries jeopardize prosperity in all countries. Regional solidarity and cooperation will be essential to overcome the significant lags in progress by the countries with special needs to ensure that opportunities presented by the cross-border dimensions of regional trends have positive impacts. The transformation of the region based on mutual responsibility and accountability for the shared progress of all people, in all countries, should be an intrinsic part of the response to the 2030 Agenda.

There are diverse and extensive needs for disaggregated data and for data and information that promote strengthened policy coherence. Knowledge partnerships at the regional and subregional levels will be essential for collective learning and implementation. xvi CHAPTER 1 Poverty and prosperity in Asia and the Pacific 1.1 Introduction Eradicating poverty and building prosperity within planetary limits is the central challenge of the new development agenda. That challenge also requires that the future of all people\u2014in particular, those who are most deprived of a decent standard of living\u2014be transformed for the better, within a generation. This transformation should be within reach for the Asia and Pacific region. After all, the region begins that journey with a positive record of achievement, including considerable gains in poverty reduction and favourable economic, social and political changes. This report explores that potential as it reflects on the theme of the 2017 session of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development on \u201cEradicating poverty and promoting prosperity in a changing world\u201d. Providing an overview of poverty and prosperity in Asia and the Pacific, this report considers five regional megatrends: regional economic cooperation and integration; rural\u2013 urban transitions; demographic changes; information and communications technology (ICT) access and connectivity; and increasing demand for natural resources. The report looks at the risks and opportunities presented by these trends. It points to promising responses through three interlinked entry points for this agenda: (i) realizing the promise of urban development, (ii) strengthening responses to enduring rural poverty and (iii) providing sustainable infrastructure. The discussion offered is intended to inform regional dialogue and promote coherent policy frameworks for eradicating poverty and promoting prosperity in Asia and the Pacific. It also can support governments\u2019 implementation efforts at the start of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,1 including through the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be discussed at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in 2017.2 1.2 An overview The Asia and Pacific region covers 56 countries that are home to more than 60 per cent of the global population and that together produce almost 40 per cent of the world\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP).3 Twelve countries have least developed status, and only three are industrialized. Despite persistent poverty, people in the region generally have a better quality of life, more purchasing power and better access to transport and modern energy services than they did previously. At least 21 countries have increased their social protection spending as a share of total government expenditures over the past two decades,4 and debt-to-GDP ratios are declining, signalling better fiscal management.5 The 2030 Agenda speaks to a future in which all people, not just the wealthy strata, can enjoy \u201cprosperous and fulfilling lives\u201d, and progress is \u201cin harmony with nature\u201d.6 Specifically, SDG 1 emphasizes the eradication of poverty \u201cin all its dimensions\u201d.7 The scope of the challenge cannot be underestimated. Economic growth is slowing, and as poverty rates fall, each dollar invested in poverty eradication has declining impact.8 Thus, progress in poverty reduction may be harder to achieve because what remains is more entrenched. The region is lagging in comparison to other parts of the world (with the exception of Europe) on human capital development,9 despite years of rapid economic growth. Among other threats, climate change, which influences economic, social and environmental changes across the region, is threatening livelihoods and creating \u201cinstant\u201d poverty when an extreme weather event takes place. The report thus begins with an emphasis on how understanding poverty and prosperity from multiple perspectives makes for more effective strategies. And as this section also underscores, fundamental to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda is the urgent need to recognize and confront the factors that drive inequality, marginalization and exclusion. 2 Figure 1.1 Share of extremely poor people in the world, 2000\u20132004 and 2010\u20132013 (percentages) Source: ESCAP, Statistical Database, based on World Bank, Development Research Group, http://data.unescap.org (accessed 15 December 2016).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f035ed93-41d8-4e75-ae9c-900bb22621ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "f035ed93-41d8-4e75-ae9c-900bb22621ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9ef45a8745de4e25ff540b01dfc2a4f79be339c672bdf7fd236dcf263c7bb9e"}, "2": {"node_id": "c0daf48d-e515-4b37-b576-4702d8e281d0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7104285ae3f3f6a585ddff8458699e0a7fe47953912ce204f0a00a928281f78a"}}, "hash": "ce0756f348c9d6c0cfef9670206271ad11cd585749942f0c0aa3efd1f2a74fd2", "text": "Income poverty According to the latest data, some 400 million people, or around 10.3 per cent of the region\u2019s population, were living in extreme income poverty between 2010 and 2013.10 The region\u2019s extremely poor populations accounted for some 52 per cent of the world\u2019s extremely poor people during 2010\u20132013, down from 65 per cent of the total during 2000\u20132004.

Just over 50 per cent of extremely poor people in the world lived in the region in 2010\u20132013 (figure 1.1). South and South-West Asia now make up more than 75 per cent of the region\u2019s impoverished people (figure 1.2), and with the groups of least developed countries and small island developing States (Pacific), are falling further behind (figures 1.3a, 1.3b and 1.3c). Figure 1.3a and figure 1.4 show that there are several countries with high poverty rates, based on data for both international and national poverty lines.12 National information on income poverty is only part of what is needed to build effective poverty reduction strategies. The importance of subnational and disaggregated statistics needs to be emphasized, and it must be assessed in tandem with data on other dimensions of poverty. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Pacific island developing States North and Central Asia 3.8% 4.4% Least developed countries South-East Asia East and North-East Asia Asia-Pacific 2010\u20132013 2000\u20132004 South and South-West Asia Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific 3 Other dimensions of poverty Measures that capture other dimensions of poverty, such as education, health and living standards, have been developed. The global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) recognizes that poverty goes beyond inadequate income to include deprivation of basic human capability.13 It assesses the scale of multidimensional poverty based on the number of people experiencing several dimensions of deprivation simultaneously.14 Based on the global MPI, more than one in four persons in developing countries in the region are deprived in multiple ways, or as it is characterized, \u201cliving in multidimensional poverty\u201d. In rural Asia and the Pacific, the rate doubles to two in five people. In South Asia, 86.3 per cent of people living in multidimensional poverty are located in rural areas. Eight of the ten countries with the highest rates of multidimensional poverty in the Asia-Pacific region have least developed status.16 MPI assessments propose that people who are destitute endure a combination of severe deprivations, for example, a situation in which no one in the household has at least one year of education, two or more children have died, there is severe malnutrition of an adult or child, no access to electricity or to sanitation, access to safe drinking water only at a distance of more than 45 minutes\u2019 walk, cooking with biomass fuels and/or where no material assets are possessed.15 Multidimensional poverty is not strongly correlated with income poverty.17 Poverty reduction strategies that focus exclusively on increasing income can therefore miss important parts of the picture. Some countries have relatively low income poverty rates but, at the same time, relatively high rates of multidimensional poverty, such as Bhutan, Cambodia and Pakistan (figure 1.5).

This is where a multidimensional poverty assessment is particularly useful. While low education levels strongly correlate with chronic conditions of poverty, health status risks and food security are associated with both chronic and transient poverty. Health crises reduce work productivity and increase the risk of poverty. The food crisis that emerged in 2008 and its impact on the poorest households in the region was a strong warning to governments to remain especially vigilant regarding food security. The incidence of hunger has fallen much more slowly than income poverty across the region, particularly in South Asia, and the numbers of undernourished people has increased as populations have grown. The poor pay a large proportion of their income\u2014up to 70 per cent\u2014on food. Unstable prices in the late 2000s substantially eroded the purchasing power of households and undermined gains in poverty reduction. Poverty reduction, therefore, requires a stable supply of affordable, nutritious and safe food. Ensuring that the agriculture sector and other supportive economic activity, including transport services, for example, can deliver this supply should be an intrinsic component of any poverty eradication strategy.19 Inequality, marginalization and exclusion More than 60 per cent of the region\u2019s population lives in countries in which income inequality is increasing. Income inequality, as measured by the Gini Index or the Palma Index, remains stubbornly high (above the world average) and has increased in China, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and the Russian Federation, among other countries.20 On the other hand, in 14 of the 21 countries where data are available,21 inequalities are decreasing; household expenditure or income per capita among the bottom 40 per cent of the population grew faster than the overall per capita expenditure or income growth rates.22 Malaysia, Thailand and Turkey have some of the highest rates of inequality (for countries with data), as measured by the Palma Index, even though inequality is on the decline within their borders.23 Like poverty, inequality is multidimensional.

Inequality, marginalization and exclusion are heavily gendered and create vulnerabilities. Oppressive gender stereotypes and inequality in access to resources, health services, participation and economic power are the shared experiences of women and girls across the region.26 One in three women globally are subject to violence, and this figure rises to more than 40 per cent in South-East Asia\u2014the highest among the global regions.27 Inequality, marginalization and exclusion also touch on fundamental issues of identity that particularly affect minorities,28 including ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities, as well as those who are discriminated against due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. Some 70\u201380 per cent of an estimated 370 million indigenous peoples in some 70 countries across the world are found in Asia and the Pacific.29 All forms of discrimination impact the ability of people to reach their full potential. Social stigma and low levels of investment in social protection and in the active participation of persons who live with a disability30 mean that persons with disabilities are largely shut out of labour markets and have little access to education, vocational training and decent work. A disability situation is found more often in poor households than in Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific 9 non-poor households;31 in Viet Nam in 2011, for example, the poverty rate among households in which someone lived with a disability was higher than in other households, at 20.1 per cent, compared with the overall poverty rate of 15.7 per cent.32 Persons with a disability are more likely to be women than men; in Bangladesh, 23 per cent of women live with a disability, compared with 10 per cent of men. Disability is often found in higher frequency in rural than in urban areas.33 Inequality, vulnerability and employment Marginalization and exclusion promotes situations in which people are only likely to access the least desirable of economic opportunities and on unfavourable terms, such as in vulnerable employment, where they are subject to discrimination, receive insecure and inadequate earnings and endure difficult work conditions. Some of the worst forms of marginalization and exclusion are a manifestation of weak frameworks for the recognition and protection of human rights. The Asia-Pacific region has the largest number of victims of forced labour, at 11.7 million people in 2012. An estimated 83 per cent of victims of human trafficking in the region are women or girls, compared with 60 per cent globally. Forty per cent of victims in South Asia and 30 per cent in East Asia are children.34 Income inequality \u201chas been perpetuated in the region through persistent and vulnerable employment\u201d.35 The share of vulnerable workers declined across the region between 1991 and 2012. But at 59.7 per cent in South-East Asia and the Pacific and 76 per cent in South Asia, it remains substantially higher than the global share of 48 per cent.36 In every subregion, women are more likely to be in vulnerable employment than men; and that share in each subregion is substantially larger than the global share of 49.3 per cent. In South Asia, 81 per cent of women workers are in vulnerable employment. Vulnerable employment includes informal employment,37 which comprised half to three-quarters of all non- agricultural employment in developing countries in 2016 (which is characteristic of agricultural employment).38 A recent report from a United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association underlined that, globally, there has been a lack of \u201ceven the minimum exercise of workers\u2019 rights, disenfranchising millions of workers, including migrant workers. This exacerbates global inequality, poverty, violence, child and forced labour, and directly contributes to problems, such as human trafficking and slavery\".39 Marginalization and exclusion at different stages of life For youth, lack of access to education increases the risk of poverty. Where employment opportunities fall short of demand in terms of numbers or quality, youth risk marginalization and exclusion as they age. Although youth unemployment rates are among the lowest in the world, young people in the labour force are 3.8 times more likely to be unemployed than their adult counterparts in the region. The youth working poverty rates are also higher.40 Labour force participation among older men in developing Asian countries for which data are available is declining, while that of older women is increasing.

The largest number of immigrants were received in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka.43 10 Only a few countries in Asia and the Pacific, none of which are major countries of destination for migrants, have signed, ratified or acceded to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. The provisions of the Convention are \u201croutinely ignored\u201d.44 The number of low- skilled and semi-skilled migrants for employment from Asian and Pacific countries increased by almost 50 per cent between 1990 and 2013, to more than 95 million.45 Depending on the policies and economic contexts, labour migration has had different outcomes for migrants and national populations in both origin and destination countries. Even where there is comprehensive policy and administrative agreements between countries, there is varying success. Private actors are taking an increasing role in managing the cumbersome administrative processes, but they sometimes are creating exploitive conditions that, in extreme cases, constitute human trafficking, with women at particular risk.46 \u201cPeople of concern\u201d to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are among the most marginalized and excluded of groups and number some 9.8 million people in the region, including 2.9 million internally displaced persons and 1.5 million stateless people.47 As many as 5.4 million refugees in the region in 2014 constituted 40 per cent of the global refugee population.48 The Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan and Turkey, together, hosted almost 30 per cent of all refugees worldwide in 2014.49 Geographic dimensions Marginalization and exclusion also have geographic dimensions. In the Pacific island developing countries, for example, access to basic social services is limited for populations living on the outer islands. Landlocked developing countries deal with relatively greater challenges in accessing economic opportunities from trade, among other hurdles, while rural areas or mountain communities are often underinvested in terms of infrastructure development or provision of services. Human well-being Human well-being is an important focus of SDG 3 (on good health and well-being). It speaks to the vision of a world in which \u201call life can thrive\u201d50 and includes both material and non-material dimensions, such as health (physical, mental and emotional), being able to participate in community life and having a life purpose. The Human Development Index provides an objective measure of \u201ca long and healthy life, access to knowledge and a decent standard of living.\u201d51 Despite improvements in 20 Asian and Pacific countries in 2014, as many as 19 were still below average in terms of well-being, according to their ranking on the Human Development Index.52 In 15 countries, there were declines or no change as of 2014, relative to other countries.53 UN- Habitat\u2019s City Prosperity Index proposes objective well-being measures that are most relevant to the urban context.54 Insights into life satisfaction, happiness, life purpose and other non-income and non-material factors are fundamental to understanding the subjective human experience and the overall impact of development strategies. Determined via subjective measures based on an individual\u2019s self-assessment, different frameworks show that, in general, only a few Asian and Pacific countries indicate relatively high levels of subjective well- being.55 Conclusions from a global assessment of subjective well-being in five areas (life purpose, financial, social, community and physical)56 suggest that, based on a survey of a limited number of countries in Asia and the Pacific, people in this region are less likely thriving in relation to life purpose and social well-being than the world population generally. Only five of the region\u2019s countries are among the top 50 countries in terms of a global happiness ranking, while the majority of Asian-Pacific countries for which there are data (some 24 countries) are ranked between 50th and 121st.57 Subjective measures of well-being show that income does not always translate into human well-being.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54506a23-23de-4ff8-ab1a-5706d3dd4139": {"__data__": {"id_": "54506a23-23de-4ff8-ab1a-5706d3dd4139", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d12da443e3a362d7b9f6ce65fc6b482f95f49f9bd92d3360cff32b093d660646"}, "2": {"node_id": "ccfa89a1-2f72-4a2a-ba98-a5bba32f9534", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd1a23cf9937b02544c428a55c56118299357ff9fd6d551d486b9fd2c1a61450"}}, "hash": "6cf5fd1d104fdbcfea46cfaf068d57f37318b4b7b7d9a20f21b6c3644fd906c9", "text": "A greater policy focus on subjective well-being is important for strengthening individual and community resilience58 as an important dimension of prosperity.

The World Health Organization\u2019s Quality of Life index presents a framework that includes both subjective and objective measures suitable for cross-cultural contexts and adaptable for specific groups of people and countries.59 1.3 A changing development context The experience of the converging food, fuel and energy crises of 2008\u20132009 is a constant reminder to keep an eye on the horizon for emerging challenges. Five important and linked megatrends are shaping the current status of and outlook for poverty and prosperity in the region: regional economic cooperation and integration; rural\u2013urban transitions; demographic change; ICT access and connectivity; and, increasing demand for natural resources. Effective, long-term responses to the challenge of reducing poverty and expanding prosperity will benefit from the changing flows of financial and natural resources and people across the region that accompany these trends. This section points out where some of these opportunities lie but also calls attention to the risks. Each of these trends has a cross-border perspective as well as a national perspective. In a region that is increasingly polarized by income differences and where poverty is being concentrated in the least developed countries in particular,60 regional cooperation must be strengthened. Regional economic cooperation and integration Regional economic cooperation and integration facilitates the flow of goods, services and people through policy coordination and institutional arrangements between two or more countries.61 In operational terms, regional economic cooperation and integration can take the forms of integrated markets for goods, services, capital and labour; infrastructure connectivity; financial cooperation; and economic and technical cooperation to address shared vulnerabilities and risks.62 There are many other areas in which blossoming cooperation is fostering economic cooperation, such as city-to-city partnerships. Trade integration is one of the most visible forms of economic ties. By July 2016, the region\u2019s economies were parties to as many as 169 (63 per cent) of the 269 preferential trade agreements in force globally. Within the region between 2000 and July 2016, the number of enforced agreements increased from 54 to 169.63 Political leadership is also driving cooperation initiatives, for example, with China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative and with the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. An assessment of regional economic integration and cooperation based on trade and investment flows, on monetary and financial flows and on cross-border mobility of people concluded that East Asia is the most integrated, followed by South-East Asia, the Pacific, South and Central Asia, with variations, depending on the dimension of cooperation and integration. Opportunities for integration, in particular through infrastructure development for connectivity, are opening for the Central Asian and South Asian economies. Challenges to the Pacific island economies remain.64 These cooperation arrangements are intended to provide mutual economic benefit. Trade agreements primarily facilitate private sector opportunity, giving reciprocal and legally binding market access. However, in the Asian and Pacific context and without a specific response that brings countries together in common action, the risk that people will be engaged in the economy on an unequal footing or be excluded is likely to increase. Experience emphasizes that workers\u2019 rights can be negatively impacted under trade agreements,65 while cross-border investments create obligations between governments or between governments and the private sector under agreements that may overlook the protection of human rights and the livelihoods and concerns of the most vulnerable workers in society. Rural\u2013urban transitions With economic integration and increasing links between countries come opportunities that drive the rural\u2013urban transitions. Countries 12 are at different stages of structural change, which involves \u201ca falling share of agriculture in economic output and employment, a rising share of urban economic activity in industry and modern services, migration of rural workers to urban settings and a demographic transition in birth and death rates that always leads to a spurt in population growth before a new equilibrium is reached\u201d.66 Once predominantly rural based, more than half of the people in Asia and the Pacific will live in cities in 2018. The urban population grew by nearly one billion people between 1990 and 2014. The urban share of the population varies, ranging from 18 per cent in Sri Lanka to 100 per cent in Singapore. Seventeen of the world\u2019s 28 megacities are here; by 2030, that number may grow to 22 megacities in the region. This urban population explosion is not only due to natural increase but also to rural\u2013urban migration and geographic expansion of urban settlements through annexation and transformation of rural villages into small urban settlements.67 People go to cities seeking opportunity, but rural\u2013urban migration can also result from internal conflict, and environmental change, including climate change and natural", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c5cda61-348e-4b58-943f-a73e55a64295": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c5cda61-348e-4b58-943f-a73e55a64295", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2ce14ada1cd9d13841845d27e941ef5caa50ef642868e081c4cff347965d986"}, "3": {"node_id": "f46e314d-1c8c-4726-8a76-95ab817b0be4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d1e0e013bd9ea055a67fe5ee8d46b16ecbe3e9e6268dc089ecdfe50fa0acf18"}}, "hash": "574789277a145db902e4b0a54a71ef4d04c9e1a40e012772c4f4288aca3217d7", "text": "disasters. The share of urban population increased much faster in East and North-East Asia than in other subregions in the decades before 2015 (table 1.1). China, Bangladesh, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam had the fastest increase in their share (ranging from 20 to 22 percentage points). On the other hand, Cambodia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Sri Lanka are the least urbanized. Nepal, Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka are among the top-ten least urbanized countries of the world.68 Urban centres are associated with reduced income poverty, but they experience considerable challenges with multidimensional poverty, migrant populations, new health burdens from non-communicable diseases and the risk of communicable disease, as well as with solid and other forms of waste (as discussed in Chapter 2). The expanding and changing profile of demand for food and the accompanying transformation of food systems are part of the rural\u2013urban transition and provide opportunities for economic diversification that are critical for inclusive growth.69 Economic opportunities are expanding in the areas of access to technology, factor inputs, logistics and related off-farm activity, among others.70 In some countries of South-East Asia, the transition has facilitated the growth, rather than the decline, of agriculture, and has transformed negative food security gaps to positive ones. A strong political mandate for pro-poor growth has enabled major investments in rural infrastructure (in particular, irrigation infrastructure that has stabilized yields) and rural development and technological revolution on rice and capacity to respond to changing dietary demands.71 In contrast, in other countries where agriculture has been deprioritized, declining shares of agriculture in GDP and employment have been accompanied by a widening gap in labour productivity between the agriculture and non-agriculture sectors. Linking urbanization and rural development strategies will be critical for poverty reduction and food security. Climate change and financial stability could mean that rising, rather than falling, food prices will accompany the rural\u2013 urban transitions.72 Additionally, those transitions are taking place at a time when market forces are having a more important role in food systems and when impoverished households already spend most of their income on food. The future of those who live in cities is thus intimately linked with the outlook for those who live in rural areas. Demographic changes and migration A \u201chistoric\u201d demographic transition is underway in Asia and the Pacific\u2014a majority of nations have entered, or are about to enter, a period in which working-age people able to contribute to economic growth and development comprise a significant share of population.73 The ratio of people at working age to older persons is, however, still decreasing rapidly.74 Ageing is a concern in almost every region, particularly in North-East Asia, where more than 50 per cent of the region\u2019s population older than 65 years live.75 The inadequate social protection and provisions for \u201cactive\u201d ageing create conditions in which the financial and care-related burdens of an Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific 13 Table 1.1 Share of population living in urban areas (percentages) Subregion East and North-East Asia South-East Asia South and South-West Asia North and Central Asia Pacific Source: UNDESA, 2015. 1950 17.9 15.5 16.0 16.6 62.4 1990 33.9 31.6 26.5 27.3 70.7 2015 60.0 47.6 34.8 35.0 70.8 2030 71.5 55.8 42.0 42.0 71.3 2050 77.9 64.5 52.5 52.5 73.5 ageing population are likely to be most keenly felt by women of working age\u2014who may themselves be struggling with conditions of vulnerable work. The speed of the demographic transition and its relatively early occurrence in the development process means that developing country governments have less time than what industrialized country governments had to establish adequate social protection. They also have fewer resources.76 Rural\u2013urban migration as part of the rural\u2013 urban transition is part of the demographic changes taking place while also a driver of the changes. Labour migration is a structural reality of the region and is reflected in relatively low regional unemployment rates.77 Migration due to environmental change is expected to increase.

Where ICT use has become part of the business culture and way of life, technology access and digital connectivity have boosted economic dynamism and entrepreneurship in both rural and urban contexts. Research from the industry suggests that mobile technology created 15 million jobs in 2015 and 5.4 per cent of GDP in Asia and the Pacific.79 \u201cSmart\u201d initiatives that apply ICT in innovative ways are part of the vision and planning for more efficient cities, energy grids, traffic management and service delivery. ICT applications can provide opportunities for youth employment. Youth have important potential to lead innovation, leveraging ICT in new ways, including to address some of the most pressing development challenges.80 The spread of ICT also presents governments with the possibility to strengthen the delivery of basic services, including health care and education, and to increase the efficiency of the services provided. It also enables governments to engage a wider range of stakeholders in shaping the delivery of these services and supporting greater social transformations in the context of the 2030 Agenda. ICT services are not financially, cognitively, physically or culturally accessible to all people. More than 35 per cent of the region's population, mostly in rural areas, still lacks access to the internet.81 One billion people in East Asia, South- East Asia and the Pacific and 1.4 billion people in 14 South Asia who live in areas with mobile internet services cannot currently access those services. In some Pacific countries, for example, as little as 1 per cent of the population has access to the internet, which can cost as much as $650 per month. This digital divide is widening, and not all people can access the opportunities presented, particularly by broadband technology.82 Demand for natural resources The use of natural resources (biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores, industrial minerals and construction minerals) in Asia and the Pacific have increased five times more quickly than population growth and slightly faster than the region\u2019s average GDP growth between 2000 and 2015. The region\u2019s resource use is now projected to reach 80 billion tonnes annually by 2050,83 despite resource efficiency gains in 22 economies between 2000 and 2012. The demand for resources is linked to the production and consumption associated with economic growth and the building of infrastructure. There are important downstream and upstream impacts for the entire population, but particularly for the most vulnerable households as these resources are extracted from nature and transformed through energy and other inputs into goods and services. These include land-use change, threats to biodiversity, land degradation and the emission of greenhouse gases, waste and pollution. Greenhouse gas emissions in economies in Asia and the Pacific in 2012 totalled 26.7 billion tonnes, reflecting a 4.2 per cent average rate of annual increase from 2000.84 Urban areas in the region generate about 1.21 million tonnes of municipal solid waste a day. By 2025, this amount will more than double, to 2.65 million tonnes daily.85 Plastic is a critical component of this waste, with micro plastic turning up in 100 per cent of fish catch in some regions of Asia. It is approaching a crisis on the scale of a \u201cglobal threat\u201d, comparable to global climate change, food security and water scarcity.86 Water resource constraints are exacerbated by the production of untreated wastewater. The Asian and Pacific region has the largest share of global renewable freshwater resources but the lowest availability of water per capita. The World Economic Forum report has, in the past, noted the climate-water-food-energy nexus as one of three important clusters of risks that have recently emerged and points to resource- security issues (causing extreme volatility and sustained increases over the long run in energy and commodity prices) as one of the five risks to watch.87 Increased competition for natural resources and cross-border investment is placing rural people at growing risk of losing their land and livelihoods while they face growing health and food security risks (as discussed in Chapter 3). The diminished integrity of ecosystems due to unsustainable management practices reduces the flow of ecosystem services, on which economic activities, such as water-intensive production and hydropower, and sectors, such as tourism, depend. The loss of ecosystem services also impacts the health and well-being of the wider population and therefore diminishes the capacity of governments to fully deliver on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

These changes will challenge governments\u2019 ability to balance and equitably fulfil their obligations and responsibilities to all stakeholders in society, particularly the most vulnerable. The social contract, which shapes the \u201creciprocal rights, obligations, and responsibilities between states and citizens\u201d88\u2014and among stakeholders, will be instrumental in shaping the way in which governments respond to these pressures. These relationships are already evolving in many places. The private sector is taking an increasingly important role in delivering basic services.

Small farmers are losing their land to external investors without due process or compensation, and space for civil society is declining\u2014trends that run counter to the requirements of sustainable development. In the context of the regional profile of poverty and prosperity, the people most vulnerable in a changing Asia-Pacific region are more likely to be women and migrants in urban areas as well as impoverished households in rural areas. Despite the region\u2019s economic and poverty reduction miracle to date, the large numbers of people engaged in vulnerable work are likely to remain. The vulnerability of impoverished households in both rural and urban areas stems from related trends that impact people in both areas in different ways. The long-term success of poverty eradication and prosperity building will hinge directly on the careful management of the rural\u2013urban transitions,91 which historically have required close attention to the relationships between the public and private sectors92 and which should support, rather than undermine, food security and poverty reduction objectives. Efforts to meet the needs in two of the most basic dimensions of poverty\u2014food security and health\u2014must be strengthened, while social protection investments and investments in the social sector, including for education and infrastructure, should be expanded to enable the region to catch up with the rest of the world. Some of the priorities for an evolving social contract include strong policy signals, commitments and allocation of resources to tackle the multiple dimensions of poverty. They also require institutional support for addressing inequality, marginalization and exclusion, including through the recognition and protection of human rights. A strengthened and evolved social contract is also required at the regional level. Regional solidarity is needed to address the significant lags in progress and challenges in countries with special needs, in particular, and also to mitigate the risks posed by the cross- border dimensions of the regional megatrends. 1.4 Overview of the report The transformation of the region based on mutual responsibility and accountability for the shared progress of all people, in all countries, should be a guidepost and an intrinsic part of the response of all countries to the 2030 Agenda. Multidimensional approaches to poverty eradication and promoting prosperity provide opportunities for more coherent responses. Strategies to eradicate poverty will not benefit all people if \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d approaches to poverty are maintained. The following chapters explore poverty and prosperity in urban and rural areas, focusing attention on the most vulnerable and marginalized people and mainly in the developing country context. The report also explores how the changing development context presents opportunities and challenges to the delivery of infrastructure for poverty eradication and shared prosperity, highlighting the changing role of the private sector in infrastructure provision and providing recommendations regarding financing and governance. 16 2.1 Introduction In 1950, 19.6 per cent of the region\u2019s population lived in urban areas. By 2018, more than half of the region\u2019s population will be living in urban areas, and urban living will be the dominant lifestyle of the next generation.1 This rapid urbanization has brought both opportunities and challenges. Cities account for as much as 80 per cent of the region\u2019s economic output and could share more than half of the global GDP, trade and investment by 2050.2 Their contribution to the national economy outweigh their populations. Metro Manila, for example, is home to 12.5 per cent of the Philippine population3 but contributes 36.5 per cent of national GDP.4 Most of the world\u2019s most prosperous countries are also the most urbanized. In general, there is a positive association between urbanization and measures of development, such as income per capita or the Human Development Index, and a negative association with poverty rates.5 Although the association is not universal or necessarily causal, it is clear that the concentration of economic activity in urban areas increases productivity, diversifies employment opportunities and improves access to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "519ba576-8317-4a06-9d1c-916af7008895": {"__data__": {"id_": "519ba576-8317-4a06-9d1c-916af7008895", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f9b84958433e5622a3161a06eac48f3fb07faee51c6a703045c4b9169ce41b4a"}}, "hash": "f9b84958433e5622a3161a06eac48f3fb07faee51c6a703045c4b9169ce41b4a", "text": "infrastructure and services that, together, improve quality of life and facilitate economic growth.6 Urbanization also contributes to rural poverty reduction through rural\u2013urban migration and remittances and increased demand for rural products, particularly agricultural products. Urban areas typically offer more economic opportunities than rural areas, allowing migrants a pathway out of poverty.7 But how much urbanization contributes towards poverty eradication and prosperity depends on the degree to which it is managed for inclusive and pro-poor outcomes. Governments have acknowledged this governance challenge with their adoption of both the New Urban Agenda and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes SDG 11 on sustainable cities and communities. Both Agendas outline multiple issues to be managed in urban development to reduce poverty and promote inclusion of all people in the benefits of prosperity. This section considers the opportunities for strengthening the role of cities in helping to end poverty and promote prosperity in Asia and the Pacific. Section 2.2 reflects on the influence of the megatrends in the region on urban development. Section 2.3 considers issues and challenges within urban governance, and section 2.4 points to options to respond to the challenges, drawing on experiences from the region. 2.2 Urban development: Trends and prospects Urban development is influenced by a range of global and regional megatrends, which in turn are impacted by the growth of cities and towns. As outlined in Chapter 1, these trends include: rural\u2013 urban transitions, demographic changes, regional economic cooperation and integration, ICT access and connectivity and demand for natural resources. Rural\u2013urban transitions and demographic change Urbanization is at the nexus of the shifting population distribution in Asia and the Pacific and significant changes in economic, social and political structures. Urbanization impacts both rural areas and peri-urban areas across a rural\u2013 urban continuum. Migrants, and particularly women migrants, who move from rural to urban areas typically support family members left behind through their remittances; they tend to migrate back and forth for seasonal work and influence additional migration through social networks. In parts of South-East Asia, these migrants are predominantly young women in search of employment in garment factories, service industries or as household help. By contrast, most rural\u2013urban migrants in South Asia are male. Urban areas have lower fertility and mortality rates, which generally increase the proportion of older people. This demographic trend, however, is partly counterbalanced by rural\u2013urban migration. Rural\u2013urban migration and demographic changes together have far-reaching implications 18 for both source (rural) and destination (urban or peri-urban) areas, for the households and communities involved and for the well-being of older people, women and children. A recent study in China found that both migrant children and children left behind by migrant parents demonstrated significantly less interaction and competence (functioning) than other Chinese children.8 Family structures in both urban and rural areas are changing, with the greatest impacts in rural areas. Where multiple generations used to cohabitate in extended family or clan structures, the migration of working-age people to urban areas leaves a growing proportion of older people living independently in the rural areas. China, Indonesia and Thailand now have 20\u201340 per cent of their older populations living independently.9 Older people in later life are poorer and more vulnerable to income and health insecurity, which women are more likely to experience with greater severity and for a longer period of time due to their longer life expectancy.10 The faster growth in the number of older persons in urban than in rural areas of Asia poses a challenge for poverty eradication and promoting prosperity. In the absence of support from working adults, older people often lack mobility and care and become more vulnerable to crime, exploitation, disasters and conflict.11 The challenges of ageing are often more pronounced among older women. Compared with men, older-aged women are three times more likely to be widowed or living alone, spend more years and a larger percentage of their lifetime with a disability and are more than twice as likely to live in poverty.12 As the growth in the number of older people is much faster in urban than rural areas of Asia, this will pose a challenge for attaining the goal of poverty eradication.13 Regional economic cooperation and integration Rural\u2013urban transitions are strengthened by increased links between urban areas. Asian cities that are located in strategic trade and economic corridors can encourage regional cooperation. They form an important part of global economic networks14 that connect them with each other through increasingly globalized supply chains. Increasing physical connectivity, together with rapid digital connection, has been enabling the development of the economic corridors between countries and cities.

Cities are re-emerging as powerful players; competitive and well-run cities are crucial to making free trade agreements work.15 At a time when governments face difficulties in coping with today\u2019s transboundary challenges, including climate change, terrorism, poverty, diseases and the trafficking of drugs, guns and people, cities and their political leaders offer a new force of good governance. They are coming together to act on global issues. These initiatives include the Global Parliament of Mayors,16 the EU Covenant of Mayors and Compact of Mayors,17 100 Resilient Cities18 and the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group.19 Within the region, CityNet is the largest association of urban stakeholders. It has grown to include 131 municipalities, non-government organizations, private companies and research centres. Through capacity building, city-to- city cooperation and tangible projects, it helps members respond to climate change, disasters, the SDGs and proliferating infrastructure demands.20 United Cities and Local Governments Asia-Pacific, with links to 7,000 subnational governments and representing nearly 3.8 billion people, carries out a range of activities that address concerns of cities and local authorities, including within the learning cooperation between members and city-to-city learning.21 Local leaders of the ASEAN Cities Mayors Forum seek to strengthen their cooperation and development of stronger community institutions, infrastructure and the social and economic life of cities through urban management and participatory governance.22 ICT access and connectivity Digital connectivity enables innovative solutions to a range of issues, from women\u2019s safety in cities Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific 19 (such as Safetipin),23 participatory city planning and budgeting (such as the Kita Kota initiative)24 and solid waste management in cities (such as MakeMyIsland)25 to early warning systems for typhoons and floods (such as a GIZ Philippines initiative)26 and real-time information to help stop epidemics (for example, in India).27 Digital technology helps reduce poverty, vulnerability and exclusion in cities. Even the poorest people have benefited from the digital revolution through the use of mobile phones to run businesses and access financial services. Digital technology has the potential to improve the lives of migrants and other marginalized communities. Mobile phones and internet access can, for example, facilitate access to information on jobs and available social services or be used for sending remittance income to migrants\u2019 families in rural areas.28 Global IT hubs, such as Bangalore and Gurgaon in India, have boosted growth opportunities for people who have the skills and qualifications to participate. These hubs attract educated and digitally literate workers. But the growth of such industries can also marginalize older and less-educated urban residents who do not have the skills to participate and who are pushed out of fast-growing urban hubs by rising costs and gentrification. Increasing adoption of high-speed (5G) mobile networks, the internet of things and the sharing economy will have important implications for the cities of the future. Greater inclusion of all people in the prosperity of cities can be fostered by investing in community-based schooling, skills training and bottom-up IT literacy programmes and by encouraging the development of local support and ancillary businesses to cater to the needs of technology workers. China, for example, has demonstrated top-level political will to focus on bottom-up and human-centred ICT initiatives for smart-city development.29 Rising demand for natural resources and increasing emissions Urbanization is changing the way natural resources are used and transforming the use of land.30 With a rise in income, for example, urban food consumption patterns have changed and become more intensive in the use of energy, land and water and in the emission of greenhouse gases.31 Globally, cities account for 60\u201380 per cent of energy consumption and generate more than 70 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions.32 Unplanned urban sprawl puts pressure on agricultural land, forests and open green spaces. It can undermine other determinants of sustainable development.33 For every 10 per cent increase in sprawl, there is a 5.7 per cent increase in per capita CO2 emissions and a 9.6 per cent increase in per capita hazardous pollution.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96fabde9-3fba-4473-8292-b683d34b4fa7": {"__data__": {"id_": "96fabde9-3fba-4473-8292-b683d34b4fa7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c735be23b81ad51a73c8ddc9363ebc9130687208526e9eead2a481a112f0938e"}, "2": {"node_id": "84d2c27a-3e65-49ee-a068-1a53983f2ebe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26724a40620b02e05270a0fb2c204e0dbc52cd8269fed96e5655600752ba09cc"}}, "hash": "f07a6868637705f36fec59e5c534408179e85fbf40fd96e8a52a693e258269b9", "text": "From 2000 to 2015, the ratio of the land consumption rate34 to the population growth rate in East Asia and the Pacific was the highest in the world, with industrialized regions second.35 Conversely, compact, high-density cities, such as New York, Singapore and Tokyo, use much less energy and emit less CO2 per capita than the national or global averages.

Urban areas in the region generate about 1.21 million tonnes of municipal solid waste a day. By 2025, this amount will more than double, to 2.65 million tonnes daily.36 The challenges of waste disposal have been felt deeply in Asia\u2019s megacities. For example, Mumbai, with 12 million people, regularly runs out of landfill sites, while Jakarta, with 10.3 million residents, struggles with garbage in its rivers.37 Cities are making efforts to manage their solid waste problems. Singapore, which was once threatened by a rising tide of garbage, has managed it through recycling and efficient solid waste treatment systems.38 The Smokey Mountain dumpsite of the Philippines has been closed, and most of the residents relocated to other areas, although similar landfills still exist in surrounding areas.39 20 2.3 Poverty and vulnerability: Issues and challenges The changing development context presents several important challenges for urban governance. Changing landscape of poverty, rising inequality and exclusion The changing landscape and morphology40 of poverty at the subnational level is resulting in major income-poverty hotspots in the urban areas of middle-income countries\u2014areas in which poverty is deeply entrenched and reinforced by deprivations in non-income dimensions. Compared with larger cities, the income poverty rate is higher in smaller cities, such as those in Kazakhstan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam.41 In Viet Nam, for instance, small cities and towns account for 43 per cent of the urban population but more than 70 per cent of the urban poor, while Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City accommodate 32 per cent of the urban population but only 11 per cent of the urban poor.42 In China, most small cities are at the low end of the industrial process and face a greater challenge to improving and expanding their economies.43 The multidimensional approach to poverty measurement better describes the daily experience of poverty. Although urban areas of the region have much less income poverty than rural areas, on multidimensional counts, the region has a significant number of people who are poor, compared with other regions. Of the 1.5 billion multidimensionally poor people living in 102 developing countries in 2016, 53.9 per cent lived in South and South-West Asia alone, East and North-East Asia South-East Asia South and South-West Asia North and Central Asia Africa Europe Latin America and Caribbean Other countries or areas Total Source: Human Development Report Office, 2017. Note: MPI calculations for regions and subregions (internal document). Estimates for urban areas do not include Argentina, Libya and Trinidad and Tobago, therefore they are based on 99 countries. Surveys for these three countries do not present the urban\u2013rural variable. The share of MPI poor people in the Pacific region is not given because data are available for only one country.

When urban challenges, including the inadequacy of infrastructure and services are considered, the multidimensional poverty head count ratio increases. This has important implications for targeting for resource allocation.49 Rapid urbanization has promoted economic growth in Asia and the Pacific and created a large middle class over the past two decades.50 Rapid urbanization and increases in income also have been accompanied by increases in inequality in some countries.51 Women, and particularly migrant women, experience urban poverty as a layering of vulnerabilities linked to their gender and to their status as migrants, and they generally occupy the most exploitive and poorly paid employment positions.

In 2014, around half of the global urban population was exposed to air pollution levels that were at least 2.5 times higher than the maximum standards set by the World Health Organization.57 Nearly 70 of the 100 most polluted cities in the world are in Asia, including cities in Bangladesh, China, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan.58 Between 2008 and 2013, air pollution in cities in South- East Asia increased by more than 5 per cent.59 As much as 80 per cent of air pollution is attributable to transport,60 with old, poorly maintained vehicles running on low-quality fuel and roads prone to traffic jams.61 Singapore and Seoul have focused attention on emission- reducing public transport programmes as a way to reduce the health risks, including respiratory disease and death. (Air pollution was estimated to have caused 7 million deaths in the world in 2012.62) As a study of air pollution in New Delhi underlined, those who are poor are exposed to higher levels of air pollution, while older persons and children are most vulnerable to the impacts. Pollution controls thus should take into account poverty and equity considerations.63 The prevalence of non-communicable diseases is increasing with the ageing, rapid unplanned urbanization and unhealthy lifestyles. Non-communicable diseases already disproportionately affect low- and middle-income countries, in which nearly three-quarters of these deaths occur. For example, the number of urban dwellers with diabetes in low- and middle-income countries is projected to almost double from 181 24 million today to 347 million in 2035.64 Diabetes prevalence in China, was 9 per cent in 2013, comparable with the level in the United States (at 9.2 per cent),65 and in India, an estimated 70 million people were affected in 2015,66 almost one in ten people. The cost of treatment of non- communicable diseases is high and escalating, outstripping rises in income.67 The Pacific island countries face particular challenges in providing health care for the ageing populations scattered across their many islands. Prevention strategies include legal and policy measures, such as increased tobacco taxation and reduced import tariffs on \u201chealthy\u201d products that can help reduce the non-communicable disease risk factors.68 Pandemics that may be triggered by climate change will particularly affect urban people, especially those who are poor and more vulnerable to disaster impacts. While a health risk by itself, the lack of adequate sanitation could facilitate the spread of infectious diseases (and increase the risk of global disease outbreaks) more easily with the projected increase of populations living in slums and the growing mobility between cities.69 Inadequate infrastructure and services Infrastructure development has not kept up with or met the expectations of the populations of growing cities in developing countries.70 All the major cities of South Asia, including Mumbai, Delhi, Dhaka and Kathmandu, struggle with inadequate access to social services, such as health care, education, roads, transportation, electricity, safe water supplies and sanitation facilities.71 Inadequate provision of infrastructure and services increases the vulnerability of poor people in cities. In addition to causing losses in productivity,72 these shortcomings in infrastructure development reinforce other forms of inequality.73 Estimates indicate that if the high-impact consequences of climate change coincide with inequitable access to basic infrastructure and services, natural disasters will force tens of millions of urban dwellers into extreme poverty and may cost cities $314 billion each year by 2030, up from around $250 billion today.74 An estimated 440 million people, representing 27 per cent of the region\u2019s urban population, lived in informal settlements in 201475 that were characterized by non-durable, overcrowded housing and a lack of access to improved water and sanitation or security against eviction. Infrastructure, particularly in low-income areas of cities, is rarely gender-sensitive, thus it limits the mobility and economic opportunity for women and girls who can face daily harassment on public transport and risks of sexual violence.76 Infrastructure development and strengthened service delivery is critical for supporting women\u2019s livelihoods in urban areas, with the potential for transformational impact. Better health care, child care, education and other services in cities would support women\u2019s empowerment while also catalysing rural development through potentially increased remittances. Cities are confronted with multiple governance challenges that hinder their ability to strengthen infrastructure service delivery. Unfinished decentralization reforms, specifically administrative and fiscal decentralization processes, leave cities without the necessary capacities and resources to address the many challenges. Horizontal and vertical coordination between the tiers of government remains complicated due to a lack of clear mandates and procedures, which invariably affects service delivery.

People living outside an officially demarcated city, though integral to the local urban economy, may not be able to access some basic public services (including education, health care, water and sanitation) and are often not involved in municipal planning and budgeting processes. Finally, the influence of investors and local economic elites in urban areas is often disproportionately high, which skews decision- making and government functioning in their favour and away from the interests of the groups who are most in need. Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific 25 2.4 Managing urban development for poverty eradication, prosperity and sustainability Cities can support sustainable development and poverty eradication when they are inclusive, sustainable, green and safe. Achieving these aspirations requires significant changes to current urban development paradigms, including policy reform. The management of urban development requires an integrated multiple-stakeholder approach that extends beyond the realm of government policies to the much wider sphere of the relationships between communities and groups and among the people at large. To identify opportunities for urban development and address existing and emerging challenges, effective participation and collaboration among all relevant stakeholders, including local governments, the private sector, civil society and women\u2019s and youth organizations, are necessary. The 2030 Agenda and the New Urban Agenda underline the need for such inclusive and participatory approaches and partnerships. These Agendas can be used as a push to renew the social contract, re-envision urban governance and address inequality and exclusion. Some cities and their mayors are already leading the way on sustainable urban development, examples of which are discussed further on. However, many of them struggle to drive actions due to constraints, including limited political and fiscal power, lack of access to development financial resources, low institutional capacity, lack of inter-sector cooperation and inability to engage stakeholders, including through partnerships.77 Urban social protection programmes Many countries in the region have used social protection programmes and social integration programmes to tackle urban poverty. For example, establishing a comprehensive social protection system has been key for China's poverty reduction. The Dibao programme, which provides cash to needy households in China, is the backbone of the social protection system there and has been extended throughout the country. The Government of Viet Nam has made efforts to integrate migrants in secondary cities and offer them social protection.78 For example, the Government made it easier for migrants to change their residence status from temporary to permanent, thus allowing them to avail of social protection benefits. To better manage the flow of migrants into big cities, the Government is creating opportunities for employment, income and service access in secondary cities, designating them as potential growth centres. The Government of Viet Nam also issued policies that encourage investment in housing development and associated services for people in the low-income bracket, thus incentivizing migration to smaller cities and towns.79 Multidimensional approach for planning and for targeting urban poverty Several countries in Asia and the Pacific are beginning to use more comprehensive indicators than income to measure and target poverty. The Multidimensional Poverty Index, as discussed in Chapter 1, is one example that allows for countries to reflect their own context and realities into their poverty measurements. Bhutan uses the MPI as its development target and as one of the main considerations in allocating annual capital grants across dzongkhags or gewogs. The Government of the Philippines incorporated the MPI into its 2011\u20132016 development plan and used it to set poverty reduction targets. Ho Chi Minh City in Viet Nam launched the first citywide MPI in 2014 and found that the number of people in MPI poverty was much larger than people who are income poor (at 11.3 per cent and 0.1 per cent, respectively). The MPI has since been deployed in other cities in Viet Nam for targeting social protection (box 2.1). Improving the resilience of cities through risk-informed urban planning The concentration of people, assets, critical infrastructure and economic activities in cities exacerbates the impacts of natural catastrophes. Risk-informed urban planning helps to reduce the vulnerability of urban poor households and build up both a city\u2019s and its residents\u2019 resilience to disasters and climate change. Six disaster-prone 26 cities in three countries in the region are working to improve their resilience against disaster by analysing the historical damage and loss data at the subnational level and assessing the likely impact of climate change-related risks on various sectors, including transport, sanitation, health and water.80 Low-cost green buildings in urban areas that meet the requisite building codes have also been successfully developed as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "612f76df-eea9-4e2a-a444-1e2b12f40f40": {"__data__": {"id_": "612f76df-eea9-4e2a-a444-1e2b12f40f40", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9aba6c56d521274f54f04ef503130ef1a956f8535618726ec09672344cf1cec5"}}, "hash": "9aba6c56d521274f54f04ef503130ef1a956f8535618726ec09672344cf1cec5", "text": "the basis for social enterprise.81 Innovative management of emissions and wastes Cities worldwide as well as in Asia and the Pacific have been engaged in managing urban challenges, including the problems of increasing greenhouse gas emissions and solid waste. As a first step towards a comprehensive effort to measure and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a global momentum is building for developing emissions inventories for cities. Many cities now regularly measure and disclose their emissions data through such mechanisms as the Covenant of Mayors (2,450 cities in 2012) and the Carbon Cities Climate Registry (164 cities in 2012). Many cities in China, including 36 cities participating in a pilot project on low-carbon development, have either completed or are in the process of conducting base-year greenhouse gas inventories.82 Recent case studies show how greenhouse gas inventories enable Asian cities to drive green investments, leverage and access climate financing (including from an evolving global carbon market) and raise public awareness.83 For example, a study in Johor Bahru, Malaysia Box 2.1 Use of the Multidimensional Poverty Index for targeting social protection in cities of Viet Nam With its launch in the 2010 Human Development Report, the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) has gained popularity for planning, targeting and allocating resources in Asia and the Pacific. It measures deprivation using ten indicators under three dimensions: health, education and standards of living. Countries have localized the global MPI, mainly changing the indicators, and put it to various uses. Following a National Assembly resolution, the Government of Viet Nam developed a new multidimensional poverty line and piloted it in Ho Chi Minh City in 2014. Now the Government uses it in other cities to identify non-income poor households in order to better provide social protection. Unlike the global MPI, the city MPI has five dimensions with ten indicators: (i) education (adult education level, child education attendance), (ii) health (access to health care and health insurance), (iii) housing (quality of house and house area), (iv) clean water and sanitation (water source and toilet) and (v) information accessibility (access to communication services and assets for information accessibility). The use of the MPI has brought an additional 2 million urban people into the poverty net who are above the (income) poverty line but are poor in terms of the non-income dimensions, or MPI criteria. They will now receive assistance for housing, health insurance and education, among other needs, under the various poverty reduction programmes.

In recent years, several innovative approaches in several countries have demonstrated how \u201cgreen city\u201d concepts can be put into practice. Use of smart technology has been successful in some parts of the region, such as the Baidu Recycle application in China85 and the MakeMyIsland application in the Maldives (box 2.2). Addressing the poverty and marginalization of women migrants Although female migrants are a particularly poor and vulnerable group, they often do not receive targeted support from there local government. Grass-roots and civil society organizations have stepped up to take a vital role in protecting and assisting female rural\u2013urban migrants. Institutions, such as the Self-Employed Women's Association in India or HomeNet in Thailand, provide financial, institutional and capacity development support to women migrants, in particular by targeting their labour market vulnerabilities. Further strengthening of such organizations as well as the cross-pollination of their tools and methods could strengthen these critical support structures.86 Increased use of ICT, in particular mobile phones, also holds the potential to improve migrants\u2019 lives. For example, a study in Niger found that migrants with access to mobile phones were able to remain connected with potential employers, family members and friends in urban areas, which thus enabled them to scope out new job opportunities more efficiently. Mobile phones also can be used as tools for financial inclusion and facilitating remittance flows. In some cases, the use of such tools can even improve the banking sector in rural areas or neighbouring countries through additional liquidity.

Soon after the launch of the app, more than 64 issues were reported and addressed during the first weeks. It is now in use in four islands of Laamu, Male and greater Male. Using a mobile phone, local residents can report to the authorities if people are discarding garbage in an area not designated as a dump. The complaint is recorded on a website and mapped digitally.

Rural\u2013urban migration by women thus should be presented as a potential opportunity for local government to help and improve the lives of both rural and urban families and communities. Despite some research on this issue,88 the gender dimensions of rural\u2013urban migration are not understood well enough across the region overall, and there has been limited analysis of the policy implications in either the urban or rural contexts. 2.5 Conclusions: Realizing a shift in the urban development paradigm Urbanization will continue to increase over the next decades in Asia and the Pacific, shepherding in opportunities as well as challenges in a changing development context. It has a positive correlation with the overall economic growth of countries and has helped millions of people move out of poverty. However, these benefits have not been shared by all, and ensuring inclusive and pro-poor outcomes will require a shift in the urban development paradigm. Managing urbanization for poverty eradication and inclusion starts with the adoption of more multidimensional approaches to tackling poverty, including through refined and contextualized tools that allow the multiple dimensions of poverty to be better understood and confronted, such as the Multidimensional Poverty Index. Risk-informed urban planning is another crucial area to focus on. Poor and marginalized people are also the most impacted by shocks, crises and disasters. Inclusive and sustainable urban development must prioritize building the resilience of the most vulnerable groups in a society. Specific efforts are needed to address the plight of migrants, who tend to be the poorest and most marginalized people in urban areas and whose needs often go unmet. Focusing on the gendered aspects of migration in the region and on improving the well-being of women migrants in particular is critical to tackling persistent poverty and inequality in rural and urban areas. Women migrants are active agents in bringing urban prosperity to rural areas and tend to send a greater proportion of their earnings back to rural communities than men do. While many governments have attempted to control or reduce rural\u2013urban migration, improving the quality of life of migrants is crucial to the efforts to eradicate poverty and promote prosperity. Further research and analysis of policy implications are needed. The shift in the urban development paradigm may require a new look at the social contract between people. Local governments are not always able to provide targeted support to people who are poor, and civil society organizations have taken on an increasing role. At the same time, the influence of investors and local economic elites in urban areas is often disproportionately high, while mechanisms for stakeholder engagement in decision-making processes are underdeveloped. The 2030 Agenda as well as the New Urban Agenda depend on a renewed social contract for their success and emphasize the need for inclusive and participatory approaches and partnerships. Localizing these Agendas, which have been agreed upon by world leaders, to cities can facilitate the improvement of the social contract, re-envision urban governance and better include people who are left behind. Some cities are already leading the way on sustainable urban development. Many, however, struggle with limited political and fiscal power and low institutional capacity. Peer-to-peer networks can help to strengthen the response to poverty in urban areas. Finally, the change in the urban development paradigm needs to include a shift away from the urban\u2013rural dichotomy. Rather, policymakers should see it as an ever-changing continuum in order for development efforts to be inclusive.

The 2030 Agenda commits to \u201csustainable agriculture and fisheries, supporting smallholder farmers, especially women farmers, herders and fishers in developing countries, particularly least developed countries.\u201d1 The 2030 Agenda also highlights the need to increase investment in rural infrastructure and to support positive links between urban, peri-urban and rural areas by strengthening national and regional development planning. And it provides for the protection of natural ecosystems and biodiversity, which will contribute towards the attainment of the 17 SDGs and for which rural areas largely have a custodian role. Rural poverty in the region, although persistent, has declined in the past few decades. A more productive agriculture sector has contributed to this development\u2014through increased real income, employment generation and reduced prices of food.2 Technological advancements, institutional arrangements and the corporatization of food production have contributed to increased agricultural productivity. Rural\u2013urban migration also has accounted for some of the reduced incidence of poverty. The development of rural infrastructure, rural\u2013urban links and links between major cities has had an important role in connecting urban growth with rural development in East, South and South-East Asia.3 Rural areas, however, where 51.2 per cent of the region\u2019s population resides,4 are still home to the majority of poor people. An estimated 39 per cent of the rural population in developing Asia and the Pacific lives in multidimensional poverty, as indicated by the global Multidimensional Poverty Index.5 In rural areas, women are especially burdened\u2014they take on an increasing share of work for subsistence and income generation with limited access to resources while carrying out chores and caretaking activities and participating in community activities. This chapter describes the challenges for efforts to eradicate poverty and promote prosperity in rural areas and in a changing development context. Section 3.2 reflects on the implications of the regional megatrends for rural areas. Section 3.3 highlights the policy challenges that arise for rural poverty eradication, and section 3.4 describes specific responses. 3.2 Rural areas in transition: Trends and prospects Governments face severe political pressures. On one side, agriculture and the rural sector\u2019s share in GDP is declining in the process of structural change. Due to low productivity, agricultural value-added accounted to 9.9 per cent of GDP in 2013, while the share of agriculture in total employment was 36 per cent of the labour force.6 This divergence between labour productivity in agriculture and in the other sectors of the economy is an important component of the increasing inequality in the region\u2019s income distribution. Economic structural changes mean that governments increasingly have to balance competing but equally important policy objectives: food quantity versus food quality, short-term increase of food production versus long-term socio-environmental sustainability, affordable food supply for the poor versus the need to boost farmers\u2019 income, the production of food versus non-food crops and the use of land for farming versus non-agriculture land uses for urbanization and industrialization or for ensuring the continued flow of ecosystem services. The way in which these multiple policy objectives are approached holds important implications for ensuring equitable benefits from the rural\u2013 urban transitions and for long-term food and environmental sustainability. Rural\u2013urban transitions and rural food security Income growth has made food more affordable. And food availability per capita has increased over the years. Food consumption, however, is 32 not geographically uniform; urban consumption accounts for half to two-thirds of the food economy in Asia. Thus, food security has become an issue of distribution, requiring a targeted approach to reach hungry and malnourished people living in structural poverty.7 The rural\u2013urban transitions, rising incomes and changing consumption patterns have resulted in changes of food preference, with animal-based food having more of an important role than it did previously. Meat and dairy production in particular are often land and water intensive. The expansion of grazing, for instance, has resulted in further deforestation, desertification and increased greenhouse gas emissions, adding more pressure to the natural resource base and rural areas. Higher and more volatile food commodity prices have become a feature of world markets since 2007, although world commodity prices were relatively stable in 2016.8 On the supply side, food production is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "badab1e6-7e11-4b90-b6a9-b3501836c658": {"__data__": {"id_": "badab1e6-7e11-4b90-b6a9-b3501836c658", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a51f831ccc55a4dff37bc62df682b4e1bb04803a89bdfaa2957b044ac40188ce"}, "3": {"node_id": "7da8f646-4bd6-4332-9a93-9cfcc2d92d61", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "608d65a631fb0df82bc2f0a88681fe6e3019bc54b824867536ef9af497742ff2"}}, "hash": "2117c8c665c7e9da07e3ed9908e5429775b19f3c8eba9540b6f88cb29a23489b", "text": "affected by climate change as well as land and water scarcity, while the demand for food is increasing due to population and income growth\u2014the probability of price surges is high, given the scale of global environmental degradation. Rising food prices mean that rural people, who are usually net buyers of food, end up spending a larger proportion of their limited income on food and, at times, reducing the quantity, quality (nutrition) and frequency of their meals.9 Management of food security in rural areas is increasingly an international trade and macroeconomic issue rather than just a domestic agricultural issue.10 Increasing demand for natural resources and pressures on rural land Increasing urbanization, changing lifestyles and global population growth contribute to increasing the demand for land. Deforestation of rural land in subtropical Asia11 is due to urbanization, mining and infrastructure (altogether responsible for one third of deforested land),12 local and subsistence farming (responsible for one third of deforested land)13 as well as growing commercial agriculture (responsible for one third of deforested land).14 Increased pressures and competition over land and water threaten rural livelihoods, especially where rural populations are growing and per capita land is shrinking.15 Pressures on oceans and marine ecosystems also threaten the livelihoods of fishing communities (box 3.1). In the context of regional integration and globalization, commercial agriculture, including cross-border investments for food and non-food agro-industrial production, is likely to accelerate, together with the corporatization of agriculture, to meet the rising demand for affordable and nutritious food. An analysis of land laws in 13 countries in the region concluded that at least Box 3.1 Pressure on oceans, seas and marine resources Oceans, seas and marine resources are also experiencing increasing pressures. Almost 80 per cent of global fish stocks are fully exploited, overexploited or have collapsed. Small-scale fishers and fishing communities, who rely on fisheries for food security, are losing access to and use and control of these resources due to legal reforms that require them to have market-embedded rights to fish, increasing marine protection areas that prohibit small-scale fishing, overfishing, pollution and destruction of fishing grounds, all of which reduces the catch. The \u201cactions, policies or initiatives that deprive small-scale fishers of resources, dispossess vulnerable populations of coastal lands and/or undermine historical access to areas of the sea\u201d are described as \u201cocean grabbing\u201d. Source: Bennett, Govan and Satterfield, 2015. Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific 33 43.5 million hectares of land (equivalent to 12.3 per cent of arable land of these countries16) had been transferred from smallholders to corporations due to changes in laws and regulations.17 Cross-border agricultural land acquisition can generate high financial returns to investor countries, with better access to the food produced. These arrangements often impact large land areas and are typically made and formalized without public disclosure, meaningful prior consultation, consent and appropriate compensation (\u201cland grabbing\u201d). They can result in the displacement of smallholders and indigenous people, particularly those in areas with insecure or traditional land tenure systems. Impacts of land grabbing include reduced access to natural resources and local livelihoods, the loss of spiritual and cultural traditions and food insecurity. This is particularly the case in countries with weak governance and unclearly defined local land rights.18 Cross-border agricultural investments often hold little benefit for local populations.19 In recent years, the number of corporate farms has grown, while both the number of smallholder farmers and the size of their landholdings have shrunk, in both industrialized and developing countries. In Indonesia, for example, the number of large farms and the number of plantations have increased by 54 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively, while the number of smallholders declined by 16 per cent between 2003 and 2013.20 In tandem with this trend, the number of landless farmers is on the rise in many countries and is correlated with poverty and social exclusion21 as a result of population growth, corporate agricultural expansion22 and degradation of arable land, including through intensive cropping practices23 and the subsequently declining per capita arable land.24 In the past two decades, access to arable land decreased in East Asia and the Pacific (from 0.128 hectares to 0.103 hectares per capita)25 and in South Asia26 (from 0.176 hectares to 0.122 hectares per capita).27 A high incidence of landlessness is evident in densely populated South Asia and South-East Asia.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7da8f646-4bd6-4332-9a93-9cfcc2d92d61": {"__data__": {"id_": "7da8f646-4bd6-4332-9a93-9cfcc2d92d61", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a51f831ccc55a4dff37bc62df682b4e1bb04803a89bdfaa2957b044ac40188ce"}, "2": {"node_id": "badab1e6-7e11-4b90-b6a9-b3501836c658", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2117c8c665c7e9da07e3ed9908e5429775b19f3c8eba9540b6f88cb29a23489b"}}, "hash": "608d65a631fb0df82bc2f0a88681fe6e3019bc54b824867536ef9af497742ff2", "text": "Landlessness is often more likely to impact women, poor people, indigenous peoples and vulnerable groups in rural areas.

Technology, including ICT, along with institutional reforms, infrastructure development and improvements to human capital, has contributed to better agricultural production and to reducing poverty and hunger among smallholders. In the developing world over the past 50 years, for example, cereal production tripled while the land area cultivated increased by only 30 per cent.29 ICT has an instrumental role in supporting smallholders\u2019 decision-making, ranging from which selection of commodities to plant to which markets to sell their produce. Because the impacts of climate change and increasing market access can make decisions more complex, the role of ICT for decision-making becomes even more significant. There are already successful cases in which digital connectivity supports rural farmers to sell their commodities at a good price, to make agricultural extension services more accessible and to make irrigation more efficient in various countries in Asia and the Pacific. ICT devices are also used in regulating illegal fishing.30 Demographic changes in rural\u2013urban transitions Rural\u2013urban migration can diversify income sources for rural households. But demographic changes point to an increasingly vulnerable rural population with larger proportions of female and ageing farmers who face risks and shocks associated with climate change, natural disasters and environmental degradation. 34 In Asia, the proportion of women in the agricultural labour force varies from country to country\u2014it exceeds 50 per cent in Bangladesh, while it is decreasing in others, such as Malaysia. The feminization of agriculture reinforces the existing barriers to productivity increases, for example, through women\u2019s limited access to and use of secure and quality land, agricultural inputs, technology, extension services and credit. There is an average yield gap between men and women, at around 20\u201330 per cent, that can be attributed to the unequal access to resources. If women were able to achieve the same yield levels as men, agricultural output in developing countries would increase by 2.5\u20134 per cent.31 With outmigration of working-age people, the agricultural workforce is increasingly aged, and a growing proportion of older people now live independently in rural areas and are more vulnerable.32 The number of farmers is expected to shrink further.33 In Japan, where lower fertility and continued urbanization exacerbate the decline of rural populations of working age, some 896 municipalities (out of 1,800 total), mostly in rural areas, will lose half of their female population of childbearing age by 2040, resulting in smaller rural populations and a high risk of dismantlement.34 This will further accelerate young people\u2019s migration to urban areas as well as the loss of unique cultures and traditional values. As these trends converge, rural poor households will continue to face many challenges if there is no specific support and without a wider strategic approach to the rural\u2013urban transition. 3.3 Addressing the needs of fragile, vulnerable and marginalized rural populations: Issues and challenges The regional megatrends likely will lead to a more fragile, vulnerable and more marginalized rural population who face diminishing access to land and natural resources and increasingly unfavourable terms of access to markets and services. Several policy challenges thus confront the efforts to eradicate poverty and promote prosperity in rural areas in the context of the rural\u2013urban transition. Poverty reduction efforts in rural areas take place in the broader context of economy-wide structural change. This process entails improved agricultural productivity, commercialization and diversification of production patterns and the release of labour from the agriculture sector to then shift to the manufacturing and services sectors. Structural change, however, does not automatically lead to the inclusion of marginalized groups, including the rural poor. Recognizing the diverse needs of rural households Rural people who are poor are diverse and include those working in plantation sites, contract farmers, individual farmers and those involved in off-farm activity. Economic opportunities in the rural areas must address both agricultural and off-farm potential. Supportive interventions must support this diversity. They must strengthen corporate compliance with labour laws and regulations. They must also offer technical assistance, financing and human capital development to ensure that structural change, which is necessary for the long-run success of poverty reduction, does not leave the rural poor behind. Regional and global integration drives changes in supply chains and technology use in the agriculture sector. These technological innovations in agriculture and market changes (access, logistics and producer-distributor relationships) can easily sideline smallholders, leading to greater inequality.

Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific 35 Ensuring access to basic services Multidimensional poverty measures reveal that investments in meeting the most fundamental needs remain critical yet lacking, including access to health care, education, safe drinking water and electricity. Educational poverty 35 and health poverty, 36 components of the MPI, typically concentrate in rural households and households in which the head is not working or is working in agriculture.37 For example, 277 million people in the region still lack access to safe drinking water,38 and 417 million people lack access to electricity.39 Most of them live in rural areas, where income largely determines access. On average, energy expenses consume a large portion of income among poor households in many developing countries. Such households pay, on average, eight times more for the same amount of energy than other income groups.40 Generally, about 20\u201330 per cent of annual income is spent on energy fuels and an additional 20\u201340 per cent on indirect costs associated with collecting and using the energy, such as injuries and lost time.41 In the region, 1.8 billion people still rely on traditional fuels. Dependence on traditional fuels contributes to deforestation, degradation of forests and loss of biodiversity in many communities. Collection and use of traditional fuels causes time poverty and impacts the health of women and children. Policies to encourage investment in infrastructure are fundamental to rural development. The development of rural infrastructure, rural\u2013urban links and links between major cities through rails and roads has had significant importance in connecting urban growth with rural development in East, South and South-East Asia.42 Strengthening and protecting access to natural resources and incentivizing the sustainable management of natural resources It is critical to strengthen and protect the rural population\u2019s access to natural resources as part of the rural\u2013urban transitions, particularly forest resources, because a substantive portion of their income and food derives from these resources. According to a field study in Asia and other regions, forest-based income constitutes 20.1 per cent of average household income in rural areas of tropical and subtropical Asia.43 The reliance on forest for income differs, depending on household income levels\u2014reliance is greater in poor households than in non-poor households. However, forest income is much higher in the non-poor households in absolute amounts.44 Forest ownership and use rights are key to determining the level of forest resource sustainability, forest income and food security of the rural populations.45 While the 2030 Agenda advocates for the sustainable management of natural resources, their value is not adequately reflected in market prices of natural resources. The incentives for long-term investment are diminishing, yet are increasingly critical to stem the loss of natural capital. Strengthening the incentives framework for the sustainable management of natural resources and aligning this with wider food security and poverty eradication objectives at the national level will be critical for rural livelihoods. 3.4 Responses and opportunities Policy issues and challenges require responses for the provision of rural infrastructure, the sustainable pro-poor management of natural resources and schemes to support farmers, including smallholders. At the same time, it is also imperative to create systems and modalities that incentivize investments in agriculture and that correct the distortions that create incentives for unsustainable use. National policies that encourage research, development and engineering efforts are necessary for agricultural development to lift rural poor households out of poverty. Innovation in infrastructure provision and financing The provision of better infrastructure and services are required to enhance productivity and 36 quality of life in rural areas. Technological and institutional innovations and partnerships can be better channelled to expand access to water, energy and food in rural areas. Decentralized solar power initiatives from Bangladesh,46 Nepal47 and other countries and decentralized water provision in China, India and Viet Nam48 that successfully involve targeted communities, including women and youth, and integrate strong pro-poor, gender and livelihood considerations present affordable and environmentally and socially sustainable solutions. They also provide welfare benefits through employment creation and strengthened social capital. Water transfer systems, including market-based systems, enable rural people to sell water for urban use. These systems also enable urban areas to finance water efficiency in farms. Policies to strengthen the efficient and fair water allocation between rural and urban areas can contribute to rural poverty alleviation while addressing resource constraints and the need for sustainable natural resource management.49 Community-based and participatory management approaches Community-based and participatory natural", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42da5979-5fd9-424a-b710-99a824c3a673": {"__data__": {"id_": "42da5979-5fd9-424a-b710-99a824c3a673", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc37a06a1c1ba08c85d53c7e1923e1bad10140b9e2883da8b72f30ad3580fc09"}, "3": {"node_id": "0fa760f6-c631-41c5-b8d2-2885c64ddd93", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6985d67023317248804c59c920d86a3c02581d0e8f6d5b6a0860abeafdcb985b"}}, "hash": "4afabd769be84ecd9be5fdbff52c6490eefa9cf3379c3814d55ec4f0d8c4452c", "text": "resource management generally improves local livelihoods, resulting in reduced levels of poverty, improved forest quality and enhanced biodiversity conservation. It also leads to strengthened governance through increased community participation, empowerment and effective institutions at both the local and national levels. Improving the quality of forests and increasing their cover lead to climate mitigation. Significant features include the involvement of stakeholders in decision-making that impacts their lives and the empowerment of communities with rights and the responsibility to sustainably manage their natural resources. Community-based forestry management is practised in various countries in the region. It is practised in large proportions of forests in Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and China, where almost 99 per cent, 61 per cent and 60 per cent of total forest land, respectively, are in community possession.50 Participatory forestry management, however, is not free from constraints. Sometimes, the degree of participation is minimal (engaging stakeholders only in limited and insignificant parts of the decision-making process) and/or not inclusive (stakeholders are not equitably represented or certain groups, such as low castes, youth, women and indigenous peoples, are excluded) to the extent that a \u201cparticipatory approach\u201d is no longer meaningful. Consequences documented in studies of participatory forestry management cases in India and Nepal revealed that the poorest households\u2019 access to forest products actually worsened and travel time to collect fuel wood increased because of expensive charges for collection in the community-managed forests.51 This evidence points to a need for a pro- poor approach to community-based forest management so that the poor populations are not adversely impacted but are integrated in such initiatives and that they significantly benefit from their participation. Community-based forest management must seek prior informed consent of a community. Specific attention must be given to disadvantaged groups and indigenous communities, including respect for their customary rights. There must be an equitable and fair sharing of benefits arising from the use of resources, including biological and genetic resources from the community-managed forests. Among the most critical factors for successful participatory forest management implementation are wide and inclusive representation of stakeholders, including the involvement of local users (especially those who are poor, who are generally women). Other critical factors include local users\u2019 participation in informed decision-making processes, support from forest department staff and a favourable local setting, including a consensus on desirable uses of forest products and protective means against outsiders and those who infringe the agreed rules.52 Farmers\u2019 organizations Farmers\u2019 organizations, particularly self-organized cooperatives, must be supported to enable small farmers to access the technological and market changes that are an important facet of the Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific 37 rural\u2013urban transitions. Farmers\u2019 organizations can augment negotiating and bargaining power of farmers to sell products at higher prices, increase the chance to have their voices heard by policymakers and the public and reduce the transaction costs, such as transport and access to markets. These institutional arrangements empower small farmers and help them overcome challenges related to the high transaction costs and in gaining access to markets and public services. Engaging youth through such organizations also strengthens innovation. There are government-driven and non- government-driven farmers\u2019 organizations. Government-driven cooperatives aim to deliver essential agricultural services. In many cases, however, these government-driven cooperatives face distrust by farmers because they have been seen as controlling rather than empowering farmers.53 Member-driven self-organized cooperatives have been found to contribute more to poverty- alleviation efforts.54 Nevertheless, cooperatives should be funded by members\u2019 contributions and income-generation activities for the sake of financial independence and autonomy.55 Enhancing networks with local, national, regional and international connections can strengthen competitiveness.56 In India, the National Dairy Development Board promotes, finances and supports milk production and distribution networks by organizing milk producers at the grass-roots level. It has helped to organize the Indian Dairy Cooperative, comprising a network of more than 100,000 village-level diary cooperatives with 12.3 million members and accounting for 22 per cent of the country\u2019s milk production. About 60 per cent of its members are landless or smallholder farmers, and a quarter of its members are women.

The rate of returns to agricultural research development investment ranges from 40 per cent to 60 per cent and does not decline over time.59 In Asia and the Pacific, it is estimated that a modest increase in agricultural productivity between 2016 and 2030 would lift an additional 110 million people out of poverty.60 Yet, public spending on agriculture in the region is not commensurate with the sector\u2019s importance in the overall economy; compared with other regions of the world, the region\u2019s average agricultural research spending relative to agricultural GDP is lowest.61 In addition, government initiatives and support are necessary to complement and strengthen the efforts by rural communities and farmers for rural poverty reduction. Strengthening the sustainability dimensions of all investment in the rural sector is critical. Trade and investment agreements can benefit from reference to the Principles for Responsible Agricultural Investment that respects rights, livelihoods and resources.62 These considerations and governments\u2019 commitments to sustainable, inclusive rural development need to be reflected in government decisions regarding the regulation of investments and trade agreements and in the design of social 38 protection schemes for people who are poor. These are among areas in which governments\u2019 commitments to sustainable, inclusive rural development are particularly critical. Modalities to encourage investment in the sustainable management of natural resources and responsible agricultural investment The incentives for the sustainable management of natural resources, including sustainable agriculture and sustainable forest management, can be strengthened through demand-side interventions, such as eco-labelling and eco- certification, which help to meet the rising demand for safe and fairly produced food. At the same time, such interventions must engage small farmers in the supply chain governance of agri- food systems to ensure that they are able to work with the additional requirements and processes of new standards and certification schemes (box 3.2). These measures can be combined with awareness-raising among consumers and partnerships between farmers and urban consumers, including internet shopping via ICT, with effective delivery services. Financing through innovative mechanisms, such as payments for ecosystem services (PES), have successfully brought together the interests of economic sectors (such as hydropower production and tourism) with forest management. They are now operating in various countries, including China, India, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. Ecosystem management is critical to prevent the negative impacts of climate change, which is projected to pose increasing risks to the region through floods, landslides and other weather events. A recent literature review of research suggested that the link between a PES scheme and poverty alleviation is not yet clear but the researchers concluded that ecosystem services support well-being and perhaps prevent people from becoming poor.63 Documented practices show that the integration of a pro-poor approach into a PES design is critical for the sustainability of the scheme.64 Other factors for successful PES schemes include making payments using non-monetary goods and services, such as education, to avoid corruption and the unfair distribution of benefits. They also include involving honest intermediaries between buyers and sellers, combining livelihood improvement and the provision of a critical resource, such as water, in the design of the scheme, as well as appropriate land tenure and rights. Authorities in Lam Dong Province in Viet Nam piloted a PES scheme in 2008 for forest conservation to protect water quality, prevent soil erosion (that results in the silting of hydroelectric reservoirs), encourage the harvest of natural forest products and maintain the aesthetic landscape for tourism. A legal framework was established for the scheme for the collection and distribution of the economic value of the ecological services provided by the forest in Lam Dong. The project resulted in continuous forest protection and management service and improvement of economic conditions of households who protected the forest. By 2010, the Lam Dong PES activities resulted in protection of 209,705 hectares of threatened forest land. In a few years\u2019 time, the scheme collected $4.46 million and benefited 9,870 households, including 6,858 ethnic minorities and poor forest dwellers. Each participating household received $540\u2013$615 per year, a 400 per cent increase in income over the previous forest protection payments by the Government.

Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific 39 The regional output of an agricultural product is far less variable than the output in individual countries. International trade is therefore a potentially powerful tool to smoothen supply fluctuations across countries in a region and, as a result, to reduce price volatility. Adherence to common principles to support the free flow of traded commodities among countries will Box 3.2 Agri-food governance and certification systems Consumers increasingly demand products that are produced and marketed in a sustainable and responsible way. Markets have responded to this trend with sustainable certification systems. These certification systems exist most notably for bananas, coffee beans, cacao, palm oil, soybeans, sugar and tea makers across the Asia-Pacific region, including Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. Although this trend is a positive step towards sustainable practices, the new trend has produced some challenging outcomes. Smallholder farmers have smaller production units and, as a rule, tend to have higher overall transaction costs, reduced marketing capacities, limited access to efficient production technologies and, correspondingly, reduced access to international markets. Private sector certification systems and voluntary standards for sustainability have sought to overcome these challenges through sustainable practice regulation. However, standards typically imply additional requirements and processes, which can potentially introduce new barriers to market entry for small farmers. This has created a market paradox\u2014while the objective of sustainable certification was to increase sustainability practice and to assure that those most in need have access to markets, the reality is that due to high entry costs, medium- and larger-sized farmers are more capable of affording the costs associated with sustainable certifications for market entry, thus taking up a larger portion of the market share and further pushing small farmers out. This paradox is a result of market globalization, in which consumers and private sector demands in the industrialized world (North) are driving supply chain decisions that directly affect producers in the developing world (South). Participatory governance in the global South to drive supply chains is severely lacking, resulting in a paradox of mismatched results. While consumers in the North demand sustainable goods, this is unachievable without sustainability dialogue with producers in the South. The literature suggests there are two main tenets to overcoming the paradox of sustainable certification systems. The first is ensuring that there are mechanisms for empowering stakeholders to participate in supply chain management decisions to legitimize the sustainable certification standards and pathways for entry. The second is to reduce barriers to certification systems. The latter can be done by enabling producers to organize and undertake certification as a group or with capacity assistance from commodity technical specialists, social lenders or other stakeholders seeking to enable access to finance for sustainable producers in the agriculture sector. Various organizations in the region have already engaged in this area. This has resulted in new investment in infrastructure for market access, organized representation of stakeholders and enhanced cooperation between social lenders and farmers dedicated to enabling sustainable supply chains. However, to ensure future sustainable practices and inclusion, more needs to be done to ensure that producers are engaged in the supply chain governance of agri-food systems.

Regional and international dialogues can have an important role in preventing practices that undermine those principles. 3.5 Conclusions: Rethinking rural development strategies Challenges for rural poverty eradication include increasing pressures on rural land and resources that households depend on for their survival, the corporatization of agriculture that pushes smallholders away from their land and the feminization and ageing of agricultural labour that puts increasing burden on women and older persons. Urbanization is a major driving force behind these challenges. Yet, as evidenced in various places in the region, urban development, if linked effectively with rural areas through rural infrastructure, can help reduce rural poverty. Thus, urbanization should not be seen in isolation, separate from rural areas, but it should be regarded as an integral part of the solutions to the rural challenges. Fundamentally, the strength of rural areas lies in its people and abundant nature.

Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific 41 4.1 Introduction Developing countries in Asia and the Pacific have built more energy, ICT, transport and water and sanitation infrastructure than any other developing region in recent decades. Infrastructure has a vital role in delivering all the other SDGs and efforts to eradicate poverty in all its forms (box 4.1). Despite the significant progress, however, many people still lack access to basic infrastructure. Infrastructure is defined in terms of both the physical structures in such sectors as electricity, transport (including roads, rail and sea), telecommunications and water and sanitation and the services these assets provide (such as mobility, lighting and connectivity).1 These services are essential for poverty reduction in all its dimensions2 and for supporting wider development efforts, including the provision of health care and education. The greatest infrastructure deficits are often found in the poorest countries and in the poorest parts of countries. Most countries in the region have ambitious plans to overcome those deficits. How governments choose to bridge the infrastructure will have profound implications for their people and for the entire planet, including for climate change responses. Properly planned, implemented and accessible infrastructure is fundamental to advances across all the SDGs.3 This chapter considers the opportunities for delivering infrastructure to help end poverty and promote prosperity in Asia and the Pacific. Section 4.2 reflects on the implications of trends in infrastructure, including the megatrends highlighted in Chapter 1, for poverty eradication and prosperity. Section 4.3 considers issues and challenges related to delivering sustainable infrastructure, with a focus on governance and finance. Section 4.4 considers options to respond to these challenges, drawing on lessons and experiences from the region that can help inform policy choices. 4.2 Infrastructure development in a changing context: Trends and prospects Diverse approaches to delivering different types of infrastructure have been trialled across the region. The policy context and resource endowments affect the options available to countries and how infrastructure can be used to reduce poverty and expand prosperity. Some countries may have special needs, including least developed countries and small island developing States.4 In addition, several trends will affect projected infrastructure investment needs. There are persistent gaps in access to infrastructure. As already noted, some 417 million people in the region still lack access to Box 4.1 Infrastructure and the Sustainable Development Goals SDG 9 seeks to promote resilient infrastructure and inclusive and sustainable industrialization and to foster innovation. It stresses the need for connectivity infrastructure in transport and information communication, with a focus on quality, accessibility and affordability. The SDG 9 targets also highlight the need to upgrade and retrofit infrastructure to make it more efficient and sustainable. Other SDGs focus on extending access to specific types of infrastructure, including ensuring water and sanitation services for all people (SDG 5) and access to affordable clean energy (SDG 6). Goals related to urbanization (SDG 11), consumption and production (SDG 12) and climate change (SDG 13), among others, are also closely linked to the provisions of infrastructure. 44 electricity,5 277 million do not have access to safe drinking water and 1.52 billion lack basic sanitation.6 Covering these last mile infrastructure needs is a substantial challenge for the region. Infrastructure can have an important impact on poverty when integrated with wider development efforts. For example, while road connectivity, energy and irrigation services increase the ease and reduce the costs of access to markets and non-farm jobs in rural areas, the impacts on poverty are greater if such efforts are coupled with other development measures, such as health care and education programmes.7 Public expenditure on infrastructure is poised to grow. In 2015, around $900 billion was spent on infrastructure in the developing countries of Asia and the Pacific, reflecting about 6 per cent of regional GDP.8 Nearly three-quarters of this spending took place in China. The total anticipated financing need (including measures to mitigate", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74b7e5df-aad0-4529-bc72-36306cb55fe2": {"__data__": {"id_": "74b7e5df-aad0-4529-bc72-36306cb55fe2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b5ae059c4b950a3f26c8902598c19d7d409318bcec49244985de777059555bef"}}, "hash": "b5ae059c4b950a3f26c8902598c19d7d409318bcec49244985de777059555bef", "text": "and adapt to climate change) is estimated at $26 trillion between now and 2030, or about $1.7 trillion a year, equivalent to 5.9 per cent of the forecasted GDP.9 Much of this future investment is needed in China, in part because of its focus on replacing old infrastructure. The investment needs are greatest in capital-intensive sectors, such as electricity (56 per cent) and transport (32 per cent), particularly for expanded road building. The projected water and sanitation needs focus on urban areas, but the needs in rural areas are also substantial. Infrastructure needs are difficult to cost and project accurately, however, and many factors will affect actual investments, including technology choice, financing models and such macroeconomic issues as future growth in the region.10 Only a modest share of this projected infrastructure investment need is required to provide access to those who presently live without basic infrastructure services. A review of literature on the costs of extending access to energy suggests these represent a relatively small share of total demand for energy infrastructure investment, at $135 billion to $150 billion between 2016 and 2030.11 Similarly, a review of research and studies on extending universal access to water and sanitation, including in rural areas of Asia, suggest that it is likely to require investment on the order of $350 billion by 2030.12 These are substantial sums, but they are relatively modest compared with the anticipated total infrastructure investment. Nonetheless, it is often difficult to generate revenue from such investments, which will create particular challenges in raising and directing finance towards these activities. At the same time, the quality of existing infrastructure must be strengthened, and infrastructure must be better maintained, especially where outages and disruptions are frequent. About 42 per cent of the total infrastructure investment projected in the region is for maintenance. The region needs to build infrastructure for a sustainable future that is compatible with the social and environmental goals, thus limiting air and water pollution, promoting efficiency of resource use and reducing associated greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible.13 Infrastructure that is better suited to a changing climate is essential for building resilient communities and economies; for example, rising sea levels will particularly affect road and transport infrastructure in coastal areas.14 Clean technology is increasingly viable and can close the infrastructure gaps while reducing costs. Some Asian countries, including China and India, have emerged as leaders in clean energy technology, investing in some of the largest volumes of clean energy at some of the lowest costs (see box 4.2).15 Decentralized renewable energy systems are now addressing the previously unmet needs of some of the poorest and most remote inhabitants of the region, particularly in rural areas, in diverse countries (such as India, Mongolia and Nepal). Several Pacific island States, including the Cook Islands and Fiji, have ambitious targets to switch to 100 per cent renewable energy.16 Much progress remains to be made in increasing the share of clean technologies in the overall energy mix. But countries across the region are recognizing potential opportunities. These infrastructure development challenges and opportunities are shared by almost every country of the region. They are also affected by wider Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific 45 regional trends, with important implications for regional efforts to eradicate poverty and promote prosperity, as discussed further on. Rural\u2013urban transitions Infrastructure has an imperative role for rural and urban communities, connecting and enabling the two-way movement of people, information and opportunities.17 Although Asian cities have emerged as hubs of innovation and business, as discussed in Chapter 2, infrastructure provision has not kept up with their rapid growth. The lack of access to sanitation and safe drinking water in urban areas, particularly for poor households, is an important issue for well-being and non-income poverty. Many cities are grappling with interconnected transport challenges: Growing reliance on private vehicles drives congestion and air pollution, with severe health impacts; safety is a big problem, with many people killed in road accidents, and concerns about personal safety on public transport may dissuade its use. Cities already account for 60\u201380 per cent of energy consumption and 75 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions in the region. Yet, there are many opportunities to promote the use of clean technologies and increase efficiency in urban areas through smarter infrastructure provision.18 As Chapter 3 highlighted, extreme poverty persists in rural areas, where access to infrastructure tends to be lower. People without access to electricity largely live in rural areas. In Cambodia and Myanmar, for example, the rate of rural electrification was less than 20 per cent in 2016, while in urban", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e15fb7cd-cdaf-4f2d-9316-72247906b1ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "e15fb7cd-cdaf-4f2d-9316-72247906b1ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33cd4b2d67a3bb1ae82596eaacc0a930013b272c3fafa16baf4c6e50cd0ac545"}}, "hash": "33cd4b2d67a3bb1ae82596eaacc0a930013b272c3fafa16baf4c6e50cd0ac545", "text": "areas it was 97 per cent in Cambodia and 59 per cent in Myanmar.19 More than 35 per cent of the region\u2019s total population still lacks internet access, and most of these people live in rural areas.20 Integrated approaches to infrastructure planning that consider the rural\u2013 urban links and approaches to meet the differing needs of stakeholders can help countries better manage the rural\u2013urban transitions.21 Digital connectivity ICT is transforming Asia and the Pacific. Nearly 45 per cent of the region\u2019s total population had mobile internet access in 2016, which was a 250 per cent increase over the previous five years. Box 4.2 The clean energy technology revolution in Asia and the Pacific The costs of renewable energy have plummeted in recent years. Policy and procurement innovations in Asia are bringing renewable energy online at low cost. For example, auctions in India\u2019s Rajasthan State in late 2015 resulted in Fortum FinnSurya Energy offering to provide solar energy at $64 per megawatt hour, and in January 2016, Andhra Pradesh State procured solar power at $69 per megawatt hour from SunEdison and SoftBank Group Corp, which was nearly half the global average cost of solar power in 2015. Private investment in off-grid energy is increasingly commercially attractive and viable, and it is encouraged by policy and government investment in many countries. Investment in the small (less than 1 MW) distributed renewable energy market in China grew by 81 per cent in 2015, to $5.5 billion. Companies in China, India and Thailand are emerging as key players in a vibrant new small and pico renewable energy markets. Further cost reductions of 60 per cent for solar energy and 40 per cent for onshore wind are anticipated by 2040. Anticipated advances in energy storage technology and associated cost reductions could open up new opportunities for renewable energy technologies to meet energy needs at low cost. Source: Frankfurt School-UNEP, 2016; BNEF GOGLA and World Bank Group, 2016. 46 The share is expected to increase to 70 per cent by 2020. More than 60 per cent of the region\u2019s population subscribed to mobile telephone services in 2015.22 The full potential of these innovations remains to be realized, however, especially because access to ICT is uneven: Some 2.5 billion people who lived in areas with mobile internet did not use those services in 2014. In some countries, notably in the Pacific, costs are currently high, although interventions are improving service.23 Expanded access to ICT opens up many possibilities to design smarter infrastructure and associated services that can support prosperity in the region. For example, smarter energy and water metering systems can help households manage their consumption and associated costs. ICT is already beginning to be used to support traffic management and transportation systems, particularly in urban areas. Changing demographics place diverse demands on infrastructure Changing demographics, including ageing, gender and migration dynamics, will have significant implications for future infrastructure needs. Even though most of the Asia and Pacific population is of working age, populations are ageing quickly in many countries.24 In most countries, infrastructure planning has focused on the needs of young and working-age populations, but infrastructure will need to evolve to accommodate the needs of older people, too. For example, ageing will pose new demands for transport solutions for those with reduced mobility and for long-term care facilities. Reduced population density in some areas may affect the future viability of providing infrastructure services.25 Infrastructure is closely linked to gender equality. The time burdens for collecting water and fuel and for family care work, which fall disproportionately on women, may be eased through access to water, energy, sanitation and transport.26 Access to ICT can also support women\u2019s empowerment by providing them with access to information and opportunities for social engagement.27 Men and women use infrastructure services differently. For example, women\u2019s use of public transport is affected by many factors, including safety, lighting and access to toilets. Ensuring gender sensitivity in infrastructure design is thus essential to maximizing contributions to poverty and prosperity. Migration is another element in the region\u2019s changing demographics. Access to infrastructure can be a factor in decisions to migrate. Finding appropriate solutions to migrants\u2019 needs for basic infrastructure, such as housing and sanitation, is a significant challenge. Regional cooperation and integration Government cooperation in the region has included a focus on infrastructure, particularly roads and transport. For example, in 2010, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) developed the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity, from which 18 projects were completed.28 A new plan was adopted in 2016.29 The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) programme, initially fostered by development partners, has included", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb121c18-4935-4527-8cc3-78c6f4f805b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb121c18-4935-4527-8cc3-78c6f4f805b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a589799b534e39a90d28fd7e538e6358202f4da614677bc9147118b991ca0e99"}}, "hash": "a589799b534e39a90d28fd7e538e6358202f4da614677bc9147118b991ca0e99", "text": "several initiatives to upgrade and rehabilitate road networks. Infrastructure also has been a prominent feature of efforts to connect countries in the greater Mekong subregion. ESCAP member States have been cooperating for decades to develop an integrated Asian highway network that meets common standards. New efforts, such as the China-led One Belt One Road initiative, also seek to strengthen Asian connections with Europe. Finally, maritime connectivity is particularly important for Pacific countries (box 4.3). The integration of infrastructure networks has been pursued as a way to enhance the free flow of goods and services across borders by maximizing synergies between countries\u2019 resource endowments.30 For example, regionally integrated energy and water systems can allow countries to benefit from each other\u2019s resources and maximize complementarities. Despite the potential, however, it can take many years for regional cooperation programmes to build the requisite momentum and demonstrate benefits. Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific 47 Box 4.3 Maritime infrastructure in the Pacific Maritime transport infrastructure is vital for linking Pacific countries to global and regional markets. Pacific maritime transport systems, however, are characterized by low connectivity, high transport costs and ship-source oil pollution. The Pacific only has direct liner shipping connections to countries in East Asia, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States. Most of the 31 international ports in the Pacific are owned by national or provincial governments, and facilities vary greatly. For instance, in Nauru, general cargo vessels must anchor offshore while cargo is discharged to lighter boats; in Suva and Fiji, a heavy-duty wharf is capable of supporting heavy- duty lifting equipment. Efforts to strengthen maritime infrastructure and establish regionally managed hubs with multiple facilities are now underway, with the goal of improving connectivity.

Regional infrastructure often focuses on economic priorities rather than targeting the needs of poor populations. Regional infrastructure has often relied on conventional technologies and approaches and raised complex questions about how to manage impacts on people and the environment in a transboundary context. Planning and implementation processes need to be strengthened to realize the efficiencies and environmental sustainability. Natural resources and infrastructure Infrastructure development is closely intertwined with the region\u2019s growing demand for natural resources. But infrastructure can increase the pressures on natural resources. Indeed, demand for land is a primary consideration in the siting and construction of infrastructure. Infrastructure assets are often resource intensive. While access to infrastructure enables activities that lead to natural resource production, extraction and processing, infrastructure construction can also link to the loss of important natural resources and ecosystems. Poor people may be particularly impacted in such processes, as discussed in Chapter 3. For example, the construction of roads in forested areas can drive deforestation. Natural resources also provide natural infrastructure services. Wetlands, for instance, can provide buffers against flooding more effectively than dams, and they provide some of the same filtration functions as built water-treatment plants. Protecting natural ecosystems thus can avoid the need for new infrastructure. Efforts are needed to both minimize the negative impacts of infrastructure on the environment and to support prosperity in the region. These measures are essential to ensure the sustainability of infrastructure. In addition, better governance of natural resources and the environment is an essential complement to infrastructure development. 4.3 Governance and finance: Issues and challenges This section outlines issues and challenges for governance and finance in delivering infrastructure that works to eradicate poverty, expand prosperity and achieve the 2030 Agenda. Technology innovation is a cross-cutting aspect of both these issues. These themes are echoed in the wider literature and policy debates on meeting the infrastructure-related demands of the 2030 Agenda. 48 Governance Delivering infrastructure that will realize the SDGs poses a complex challenge of governance, including issues related to planning, environmental and social management, policy and regulatory frameworks and oversight processes.31 In addition, the risks of corruption and poor management of infrastructure programmes are well recognized, particularly in the large-scale programmes. Planning and selection: Infrastructure planning and investment requires governments to make long-term commitments of substantial public resources and to do so with limited information on future needs as well as the financial and environmental implications. The needs of poor populations may not always be the focus, and poor people may be less able to influence the planning and policy processes. Infrastructure planning processes may be ad hoc or incomplete. Subjective assessments and institutional interests may shape preferences. Changing technologies and associated costs are reshaping the underpinnings of sectors, such as energy and transport.

Managing environmental and social impacts: Infrastructure provision can have serious social and environmental impacts, which may be particularly severe with large-scale projects.34 The impacts on people affected by the siting, construction and operation of infrastructure, particularly the impacts on vulnerable indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities, need to be addressed. Conflicts over the siting of new infrastructure are increasingly common across the region. Practical ways to make infrastructure selection and design processes inclusive, responsive to people\u2019s needs, affordable and gender sensitive are needed. As previously noted, better environmental and social governance is a critical complement to infrastructure development. Policy and regulation: Incentives for infrastructure service delivery that also achieves environmental and social objectives need to be strengthened. State-owned enterprises have a central function in many sectors, including energy and water. Governments have responsibility for providing roads, particularly in rural areas. In many cases, there has been reliance on conventional technologies, with limited incentives for efficiency and weak financial management. Efforts to reform policies and regulations that govern infrastructure have been underway for some time. It can be difficult to balance cost recovery with affordability. Controversies may ensue when prices charged for services, such as electricity, water and road use, are increased in this context. These controversies may be politically challenging when private actors take over from public providers. In many cases, policy and regulatory frameworks do not yet adequately accommodate new technologies, such as off- grid energy systems, or players that may be able to provide better-quality infrastructure services, including to unserved communities and poor households. Oversight and management: A critical but often underemphasized aspect of infrastructure is maintenance. Planning processes often focus on adding new supply and raising finance for the initial investment needed rather than on maintaining and maximizing the impacts of planned assets. Incorrect use or poor maintenance of key assets can lead to deterioration in the quality of the service provided and will reduce the assets\u2019 useful life. Better choices about how to use existing infrastructure that also plan and provide for maintenance (including as part of programme design and operation structuring) and that manage the demand for infrastructure can all help improve the contribution that infrastructure assets make to sustainable development.35 Good procurement practices are imperative. For example, the selection of poor contractors who do not deliver on schedule can result in significant cost overruns. If projects are not well designed or Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific 49 delivered to agreed specifications, maintenance costs may be much higher than expected. Wasted expenditure and poor service quality may result. Finance Finding the money: The public sector provides more than 90 per cent of infrastructure finance, equivalent to about 5.1 per cent of regional GDP.36 Public finance has been especially central to transport and water infrastructure and in lower-income and small island States. Infrastructure can represent a significant burden on public finances in most countries. Furthermore, governments often use a range of subsidies and tax concessions to encourage investment in certain types of infrastructure or to enable user access. But subsidies may not target the intended beneficiaries effectively, even though they may be designed to protect the poor, or they actually may perpetuate reliance on carbon-intensive or outdated technologies. There is now strong interest in diversifying the sources of finance for infrastructure, including publicly operated infrastructure. For example, some infrastructure-related state- owned enterprises are now raising funds from commercial sources and development banks without sovereign support due to increasing public debt levels. The viability of attracting new sources of finance, particularly from the private sector, depends on the type of investment and the country context. Effective public private partnerships: Establishing effective partnerships with private actors to deliver infrastructure is of substantial interest but can be challenging. Private participation in infrastructure finance has increased in many countries in the region, although it accounts for less than 10 per cent of total investment (figure 4.1). Private investment has been most prevalent in energy and ICT infrastructure, enabled in part by regulatory reforms aimed at attracting private participation. Even in industrialized countries, public\u2013private Figure 4.1 Private sector participation in infrastructure finance in Asia, 1990\u20132012 Source: Hudgins, and Sharma, 2014. 90 91 92 93", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cde0e61b-ffad-4b10-9a81-5290926b60c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "cde0e61b-ffad-4b10-9a81-5290926b60c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c8912804012b5e59874039fe100d3bd5965084add78a00012e6486affa40838"}}, "hash": "9c8912804012b5e59874039fe100d3bd5965084add78a00012e6486affa40838", "text": "94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 00 10 11 12 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 $ billions (cumulative) Investment year China India Indonesia ASEAN 5 50 partnerships falter and encounter delays and cost overruns.37 A study of public\u2013private partnerships in India, for instance, found that delays in land acquisition and clearances resulted in average cost increases of 30 per cent associated with accumulated interest and were beyond the control of private developers.38 Other issues, including macroeconomic factors, such as currency risk, and political stability, can also affect implementation. On the other hand, private firms often have greater negotiating power with public sector counterparts and a greater knowledge of the implementing costs. Government institutions may lack the skills, expertise and incentives to design programmes that will be attractive to private investors while a fair deal for the public. It also can be challenging to direct private investment to infrastructure that responds to the needs of people who are poor if the potential for profit is more limited. While attention has often focused on large-scale public-private partnerships, partnerships with small and medium-sized enterprises or non- government organizations to deliver programmes targeting the needs of poorer or underserved people are also relevant. Reconciling project and investor needs: Debt finance from banks has dominated infrastructure finance in the region. Opportunities to expand debt finance are often constrained due to exposure limits and funding mismatches because of a need for long-term finance, and for local currency finance. A further impediment is the lack of well-developed bond markets that harness domestic savings, including in major economies in the region. Savings in the region have grown, and assets under management are increasing, although there are substantial variations between countries.39 Overall, there are deepening and increasingly diverse pools of public and private capital that could potentially be tapped to help meet the infrastructure needs.40 There has been strong interest in encouraging institutional investors to take on a bigger role in infrastructure, in part because of their appetite for longer- term investments. At present, however, few infrastructure investments have been structured to meet their financial requirements.41 Returns vary substantially across infrastructure type and specific investment opportunity. Public and concessional finance is often necessary to overcome the risks or meet viability gaps, particularly in cases in which infrastructure services deliver a vital social benefit or public good without generating a sufficient financial return on investment. 4.4 Strengthening delivery capacity, realizing the potential of both public and private finance The challenges outlined in section 4.3 are significant. There are many possible responses and encouraging practices across the region that can unlock the potential for infrastructure to help Asia and the Pacific build a better tomorrow. This final section of the chapter focuses on opportunities to strengthen governance and find innovative ways to mobilize infrastructure finance. More effective governance: Strengthening institutions' capacity to deliver infrastructure Political conditions, cultural norms, expectations and the capacity of non-state actors to engage in decision-making processes all affect governance and institutional arrangements for infrastructure in different ways across the region. More inclusive, responsive and accountable governance can improve the contribution of infrastructure to sustainable development and to ending poverty. Sustained investment in the expertise, time and capacity of independent stakeholder groups that can provide informed, technically robust inputs into infrastructure-related policy, planning and financing processes can be an important part of the solution. Robust participatory planning: Investing in informed and participatory infrastructure planning at all levels can provide a forum through which governments and stakeholders agree on the priorities for infrastructure development. Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific 51 Robust planning and prioritization processes can also yield substantial financial savings and avoid wasted investment in poorly designed projects that do not meet development objectives or are not viable.42 Better planning also helps mitigate infrastructure project risk. The use of tools to support effective prioritization, building on cost\u2013benefit analysis and multi-criteria decision-making analysis methodologies can be encouraged, with a focus on the needs of poor and unserved people. Mechanisms to support the coordination of infrastructure planning at various levels, from regional to local, may help to increase the efficiency and complementarity of infrastructure investments. The important roles of local and urban government in these processes are increasingly well recognized. There is also a case for changing how implementation is monitored, from output-based measures (such as kilometres of road constructed) to outcome-based measures (such as the number of people with improved physical connectivity). International policy processes can reinforce national implementation: As of 2018, countries will be asked to review their progress on", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9810c451-ea47-43da-b6df-049466aa908d": {"__data__": {"id_": "9810c451-ea47-43da-b6df-049466aa908d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/eradicating-poverty-and-promoting-prosperity-changing-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a0c51dd8a0195a5e147c7d7805a9474398b0dd8b5afc25828bcea8a86c9e936"}}, "hash": "3a0c51dd8a0195a5e147c7d7805a9474398b0dd8b5afc25828bcea8a86c9e936", "text": "implementing their Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement on climate change. Infrastructure choices will be central to these strategies and better planning will be essential in making progress. International organizations, including development banks and expert groups, have supported better planning and could step up such efforts in response to expressed interest from national governments and associated stakeholders. Sound government policy and regulation: Government policy and regulation are essential in shaping outcomes, including for poverty reduction. For example, policies and regulations that govern electricity generation, connection to the grid and tariffs for different energy sources shape the viability of renewable energy markets. Many Asian countries have taken important steps to encourage renewable energy generation and to drive down associated costs to the point where they are competitive with conventional energy options. Continued policy and regulatory innovation, accompanied by efforts to correct market distortions that encourage business-as-usual approaches are needed. Efforts to strengthen state institutions involved in infrastructure and to help them to do more on poverty reduction and environmental sustainability need to be sustained. Regulators reflect technical information and create new forums to understand and respond to stakeholders\u2019 interests, including those of poor and underserved customers. These arrangements can be strengthened by continuing to build the knowledge base and capacity of regulators in relevant sectors to understand the trends with respect to sustainable development in their sectors, business models and financing options. Better partnerships: Strengthening government capacity to structure and negotiate partnerships with private actors in sectors of mutual interest by enabling access to more refined technical, legal and financial skills can strengthen appropriate engagement. In some countries, specialized government units have been created to improve contract negotiation, and maintain a degree of independence from everyday government responsibilities.43 The use of competitive but efficient procurement systems, robust disclosure and regular reporting to stakeholders can help strengthen the transparency and accountability of infrastructure delivery, particularly when private partnerships are involved. Development partners have provided advisory services for public\u2013private partnerships and supported facilities, such as the International Infrastructure Support System, which is an online platform for project development. They also supported programmes to certify public\u2013private partnerships specialists and knowledge-sharing platforms, such as the PPP Knowledge Lab.44 These capacities can help overcome hurdles in project preparation and improve the chances of financial closure and successful implementation. All these measures require sustained engagement to deliver results. Improving data availability and transparency: Better data, information and transparency can enable improved infrastructure delivery to meet the SDGs in Asia and the Pacific. There are myriad of needs, but a few key issues are highlighted here. Data on infrastructure service quality can help identify potential bottlenecks and areas where service needs to be improved. Systematic public reporting on outages, disruptions and safety incidents can support better targeting of investment in maintenance or upgrades to existing infrastructure. City authorities in Chennai, 52 India, for instance, worked with a local non- government organization to collect data on public toilets, enabling it to plan future investments to improve public sanitation.45 Transparency about project implementation and costs is necessary to strengthen accountability for infrastructure delivery and to support informed civic participation (box 4.4). Expanded access to ICT, along with new tools to process and analyse complex data, can enable improved infrastructure transparency. Realizing the potential of both public and private finance Governments across the region and development partners recognize the need to find new and creative solutions for financing infrastructure to deliver the SDGs. The investment climate and other macroeconomic factors in particular countries will affect possibilities for mobilizing finance, and it may be more challenging to attract large-scale private investors to projects in smaller and less developed countries. Investor motivations will also affect outcomes, and policymakers need to be realistic about what profit-seeking private investors will be prepared to finance. Raising public finance: Raising public finance remains a core pillar of the region\u2019s infrastructure strategies. A range of policy options may be possible to increase a country\u2019s public spending or fiscal space for infrastructure spending. Expanded tax collection and management are important in most countries, given that tax-to- GDP ratios are generally low.46 Some governments may be able to better capture the value of public land, for example, through leasing or selling land or through property taxes. Capital recycling by divesting from existing assets and investing the funds from sales into new projects is another strategy that some governments could explore. It may also be possible to raise revenues by introducing or increasing user charges.

Several countries in Asia and the Pacific have initiated development finance assessments to understand the particular mix of finance (public, private, domestic and international) that can be deployed to help them deliver on the 2030 Agenda.47 Innovative finance: Efforts to find new ways to raise finance for actors in infrastructure delivery, particularly for poor households, are ongoing.

In Sibagat municipality of the Philippines, for instance, a group of citizens formed the Integrity Watch for Water Anti-Corruption Group (IWAG) to monitor the finances of water projects in their region. In a municipality in which about 20 per cent of the water budget was lost, the group brought together volunteers with different backgrounds and expertise to strengthen the integrity of processes around the provision of water and sanitation services. After receiving capacity-building training on the full cycle of public financing, IWAG members could identify potential issues and vulnerabilities to be addressed by the local government and water providers.

Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific 53 Box 4.5 Mobilizing finance for municipal infrastructure: Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund The Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund was established in the mid-1990s to mobilize private capital for municipal infrastructure investments as a trust, in partnership with private banks. It disbursed about $100 million in its first three years to 120 local governments and raised $35 million in market finance for publicly owned infrastructure in two bond offerings on the basis of an AA+ rating. Repayment rates were more than 98 per cent, compared with the 23 per cent in the state-guaranteed, parastatal-financed projects. Creating a financing vehicle for municipal infrastructure had important impacts, including strengthening urban government capacities to design, finance and build revenue-generating infrastructure; improvements in the management of subsidies, pricing and service delivery; and replication of successful financing.

This can be challenging, given that many such entities have a limited track record and face constraints in accessing credit. The possibility of expanding the municipal bond market has been discussed\u2014it is an approach that has seen some success in China.48 Some subnational governments have also created funding platforms to mobilize investment for urban infrastructure (box 4.5). Private sector participation in providing energy, water and connectivity for people who are poor has been an area of substantial innovation and entrepreneurship in recent years. For example, off-grid renewable energy systems have become increasingly cost-effective, and a wide range of applications that respond to the needs of poor households in rural and urban areas are emerging.49 Financing innovations are helping these programmes scale up (box 4.6). Similar examples can be found in other sectors, including water and sanitation (box 4.7) and ICT. Access to ICT for remote and disadvantaged communities in countries, including India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan, has been extended by requiring industry players to pay part of their net earnings into universal service obligation funds. These funds finance service Box 4.6 Extending access to solar energy in India More than 150 million households in India are either not connected to the grid or are underserved by existing electric utilities and instead rely on expensive and polluting lighting solutions. Companies, such as Simpa Networks, are providing India\u2019s energy-poor households with solar energy on a pay-as-you-go basis. Simpa provides solar home systems that can be used for lighting and charging devices. The price of a solar home system is $200\u2013$400, and an instalment system allows customers to make an initial down payment of 10\u201330 per cent and then choose how much energy to purchase. Mobile phone technology can be used to make choices about the service and buy credit. Proceeds go towards repayment of the capital cost of the solar home system and to sustain the company. Once fully paid (typically after two to three years), the consumer owns the system, which will continue to provide energy for the household.

Support for project preparation and structuring: Efforts to expand the number of viable infrastructure programmes that can tap the deepening pools of private finance in the region and globally and still meet diverse investor needs are underway.50 Regional initiatives include the Asia Pacific Project Preparation Facility, established in 2016 to support preparation of infrastructure projects that demonstrate climate resilience, sustainability, poverty reduction impact and potential to mobilize private capital.51 Global initiatives include the Global Infrastructure Facility, established in 2015 to provide integrated support to multilateral development banks, private sector investors and governments.52 The Group of Twenty (G20) forum also supports project and pipeline development through its work on infrastructure and climate funds that seek to green future infrastructure investments.53 Specialized programmes that help small and medium-sized enterprises respond to the needs of poor populations for clean energy, water and ICT could be encouraged. Preparation support needs to focus on environmentally sustainable projects, particularly low-carbon and resilient approaches. The number of project preparation support initiatives has grown recently. Initiatives need to be coordinated and coherent to ensure optimal use of scarce resources. Steering new sources of finance towards infrastructure: Opportunities for development banks to help attract other investors and reduce the risks that impede their broader participation in infrastructure-related projects is an area of growing focus. The Addis Ababa Agenda for Action on Finance for Development called for a global infrastructure forum to support coordination and lesson learning across development finance institutions to thus accelerate progress in delivering sustainable infrastructure. Development finance institutions can sometimes address the risks that impede wider commercial and private financial institution participation in programmes or in scaling up their investments. For example, they may be able to facilitate project bonds or the securitization of project assets to bolster institutional investor confidence. They can also help state-owned enterprises diversify their sources of financing. Countries in Asia and the Pacific are pooling their resources to create new institutions, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank, to engage on this agenda. Box 4.7 Financing sanitation for the poorest households Some non-government organizations have started to use philanthropic funding to provide credit for delivery of safe drinking water and sanitation. For example, Water.org provided $11.3 million to microfinance institutions and non-government partners worldwide that have disbursed more than $120 million in loans reaching 2.4 million people. Most of these loans go to people earning less than $2 per day and have demonstrated they can repay them. In India, the programme facilitated more than 545,000 water and sanitation loans while maintaining a repayment rate of more than 99 per cent. This suggests a significant interest in water and sanitation loans. The success of the financing arrangements is affected by intermediary institutions\u2019 ability to raise capital and offer viable products, client commitment to these programmes and ability to repay their loans and links with providers of sanitation services who can deliver well-designed and effective solutions to people\u2019s sanitation infrastructure needs.

Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific 55 4.5 Conclusions: Better infrastructure delivery through partnership, innovation and effective governance Building infrastructure that will enable Asia and the Pacific to eliminate poverty, foster prosperity and meet the SDGs requires grappling with multiple policy priorities. Concerted efforts are needed to cover the last mile in clean energy, safe water and sanitation and connectivity infrastructure for hundreds of millions of underserved people. The sums of finance involved represent a relatively small share of the total anticipated infrastructure financing needed in the region, but finding the money can be difficult, given that such interventions may not always be financially viable. Focused government support for this agenda, with the help of development partners, will be necessary. Creative partnerships with underserved communities and private actors hold significant promise. At the same time, however, delivering on the SDGs requires seizing the opportunity to find better- quality, low-carbon, resilient and environmentally sustainable solutions to infrastructure needs to support continued prosperity in the region. Strengthening the governance of infrastructure will be vital at multiple levels\u2014from regional to local. Better planning processes are needed and must reflect social and environmental considerations, the availability of new technologies at falling costs and opportunities to improve infrastructure management. Sound policies and regulations are essential, enabled by a capable public sector that is well placed to develop partnerships with players in the infrastructure sector, including non-government organizations. Better data on infrastructure needs and options and transparency will support these efforts.

Special efforts to find financing solutions to meet the needs of poorer countries and poor people within all countries, will be essential. There are also important opportunities to direct finance towards low-carbon, climate-resilient infrastructure. Raising public finance and strengthening public financial management will be an important part of the solution. Efforts to prepare and structure projects so that they are more attractive to a wider range of investors also hold promise. Development finance institutions in the region can help mitigate the risks that dissuade commercially oriented finance and direct this funding to sustainable infrastructure. Access to concessional funding can help to build requisite capacity and to bridge potential viability gaps. Through improved governance and innovative approaches to both public and private finance, countries in Asia and the Pacific can build the inclusive and sustainable infrastructure necessary for a prosperous tomorrow. 56 The theme of the 2017 session of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, \u201cEradicating poverty and promoting prosperity in a changing world\u201d, holds special importance for the Asia-Pacific region. Here, more than 400 million people still live below the $1.90 per day poverty line, and more than one in four people are poor in multiple dimensions. This report, produced under a renewed partnership between ESCAP, the ADB and UNDP to support the national and regional efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Keeping an eye on the horizon, this report explores five megatrends that will determine whether all people will be able to thrive and fulfil their expectations for a better life in the future: regional economic cooperation and integration; rural\u2013urban transitions; demographic changes; ICT access and connectivity; and demand for natural resources. Three interlinked entry points\u2014 realizing the promise of urban development, strengthening the response to rural poverty in the context of rural\u2013urban transitions, and delivering sustainable infrastructure\u2014provide insights into the challenges that confront the region\u2019s governments and its people. Based on this exploration, the report provides four important insights. One, in a changing development context, confronting the systemic challenges that lead to marginalization and exclusion is critical to eradicating poverty and expanding prosperity. Without specific attention, the processes of marginalization and exclusion that lead to unequal participation in the interactions of States, markets and civil society, will exacerbate the risks already faced by vulnerable workers, migrants and rural poor households\u2014and particularly women in each of these categories. Social dialogue and action around these issues, and whether enough is being done to meet the needs of all people, forms an important starting point. Two, an effective response requires enlarging the scope of our understanding of poverty, beyond income measures. Eradicating poverty in all forms everywhere requires identifying and understanding the needs and aspirations of people most in need. Mapping these needs can support the design of more complete interventions and inform appropriately differentiated resource-allocation strategies. Up-to-date disaggregated data on the multiple dimensions of poverty are needed, and indicators should be adapted to the local context. However, both income and multidimensional poverty indexes are insufficient by themselves to describe the range of human needs, experiences and aspirations that are important to a coherent, transformative and universal development agenda. Subjective measures of human well- being provide complementary and important perspectives. Three, governments\u2019 capacity to balance their responsibilities to different stakeholders, to share the benefits of development and to establish effective partnerships will determine the impact of their implementation efforts. The issues discussed in this report and wider debates on the SDGs allude to the evolving relationships between governments, the private sector and the wider public, including the increasingly important roles of the private sector in delivering services that support social and economic progress. These changing relationships will challenge the ability of governments to equitably fulfil their obligations and responsibilities to all stakeholders, including those most at risk and future generations. In the words of former United Nations Secretary- General, \u201cThe 17 Sustainable Development Goals are our shared vision of humanity and a social contract between the world's leaders and the people.\u201d In Asia and the Pacific, there is need for strong policy signals and enhancement of regulations, institutions and incentives that result in more inclusive prosperity- and sustainability- enhancing urbanization, rural development and infrastructure delivery. A strengthened social contract provides opportunities for innovative partnerships that enable effective responses. Institutionalized stakeholder engagement, collaboration between governments, non-government organizations, community organizations and private sector partners can help to frame and define solutions to the challenges highlighted in the report, solutions 58 that better align development outcomes with public interests.

Finally, an effective response that works to achieve the holistic sustainable development agenda in its entirety requires a heightened degree of policy coherence across sectors and between the different tiers of governments. This report contributes to a better understanding of the sustainable development goals that are the focus of the 2017 session of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.1 It emphasizes that pro-poor rural\u2013urban transitions require closely linked action on SDG 1 on poverty, SDG 2 on hunger and sustainable agriculture and SDG 9 on industry, infrastructure and innovation. Integrated urban and rural development strategies must reflect poverty eradication, food security and gender-equality strategies as well as pro-poor investment strategies for infrastructure development, agricultural development and sustainable natural resources management, particularly in rapidly urbanizing countries. Urbanization trends are adding new complexities to the many challenges for achieving SDG 3 on health and well-being, as this report points out. Strategies for managing urbanization for inclusive development need to better recognize these and other risks. They also link achievement on SDG 9 with that of SDG 1 and SDG 3 through infrastructure investment decisions that impact economic opportunity, health and well-being. Highlighting the linkages between the SDGs and infrastructure delivery, the report outlines ways to meet the last-mile infrastructure needs and to maximize the contribution of infrastructure delivery to sustained prosperity in the region, Strategies for advancing progress on SDG 9 can facilitate the flow of goods, people, information and technology between urban and rural areas and strengthen the governance of infrastructure and innovative financing approaches that enable more effective partnership and widen financing opportunities. The better targeting of infrastructure investments will improve access to social infrastructure, including health care. The report also notes the important role that rapidly increasing access to ICT has in opening up new development opportunities in the region. Gender equality (SDG 5) cuts across the three entry points discussed in this report\u2014urbanization, rural development and infrastructure. The gaps between the opportunities available to men and those available to women in this region are persistent and significant, and they hinder progress. The gender dimensions of urban and rural poverty and rural\u2013urban migration, along with the importance of gender sensitivity in infrastructure planning and delivery, are stressed in this report and deserve further attention from policymakers. The report also touches on issues of relevance to conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources (SDG 14) and that link this goal with SDG 1 on poverty. Many of the issues raised that relate to rural livelihoods and the demand for natural resources find parallels in the context of artisanal and coastal fisheries and in the race for ocean resources, including minerals. In addition, the report recognizes the importance of improved ocean connectivity and infrastructure, particularly for the small island developing States. Strategies for achieving all the SDGs must be supported by action for SDG 17 on partnerships to strengthen the means of implementation in terms of trade, finance, technology and capacity-building. The report confirms the importance of ensuring coherence in the international support provided for responding to national needs and priorities, including through regional cooperation efforts. Going forward Because the widening gaps between countries undermine prosperity in all countries and because the development trends that will shape the outlook for the region have both national and regional dimensions, regional cooperation is critical. Enhanced cooperation between countries on trade, migration, decent work and responsible cross-border investments in the agriculture sector as well as with infrastructure financing, in particular for ICT access, transport and renewable energy, is needed to bring the megatrends described in this report in line with sustainable development outcomes. Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific 59 Regional cooperation should also focus on strengthening national statistical systems and innovations in data collection, especially in the context of an expanded understanding of multidimensional poverty and inclusive prosperity. Countries in the region have diverse and extensive needs for information, including to better manage rural\u2013urban transitions and migration, address the development needs of marginalized groups, and to deliver on the no-one-left-behind imperative of infrastructure investment. Knowledge partnerships at the regional and subregional levels can support collective learning and strategies highlighted in this report, including good practices on strengthening urban resilience, managing the rural\u2013urban transitions, improving the agro-supply chain governance and handling financing for sustainable infrastructure. The themes for the forthcoming High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, \u201cTransformation towards sustainable and resilient societies\u201d in 2018 and \u201cEmpowering people and ensuring inclusiveness and equality\u201d in 2019, will be opportune for the Asia- Pacific region.

Urban areas attract skilled workers as well as more productive entrepreneurs and firms. Thus, elasticity of income per capita with respect to population is higher in urban areas, estimated at between 3 and 8 per cent. Small cities serve as links between larger urban markets and rural areas, contributing to the development of rural areas. For details see, UN-Habitat, 2015, p. 2. 7. UN-Habitat, and UNESCAP, 2015. 8.

This approach is informed by the discussion in Beeferman, and Wain, 2016. Physical structures, such as school buildings and hospitals, are considered infrastructure in some definitions. These are not the central focus of the analysis in this chapter, although links are highlighted in the discussion. See www.law.harvard.edu/ programs/lwp/pensions/publications/INFRASTRUCTURE%20DEFINING%20MATTERS %20FINAL.pdf. 2. For example, the UNDP Multidimensional Poverty Index measures standard of living in terms of access infrastructure such as electricity, water and toilets. See http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/multidimensional- poverty-index-mpi. 3. E/2016/70. 4. The ESCAP Asia\u2013Pacific Countries with Special Needs Development Report 2017 (forthcoming) will explore infrastructure in these countries in more detail. 5. Asia-Pacific Energy Portal.

These figures are derived for the 24 developing member countries of ADB. The estimates on infrastructure needs presented in this section are based on ADB, 2017. 9. These estimates are derived in part from available data on current budget expenditure on infrastructure, and projected GDP growth. 10. The modelling exercise does not reflect an optimal scenario for meeting infrastructure priorities. Future growth in China in particular would substantially affect these estimates. 11.

Research from the mobile technology industry also suggests that mobile technology created 15 million jobs in 2015 and 5.4 per cent of GDP in Asia and the Pacific. 23. UNDP, 2015. 24. ADB, 2015.

Positive externalities (benefits such as time and cost savings, environmental protection, and trade facilitation) and negative externalities (costs such as environmental pollution, trafficking, and the spread of communicable diseases) arise when the consequences of one or more countries' actions spill over national borders. If the concerned countries do not make cooperative arrangements, too few positive externalities and too many negative ones will arise. 31. In this context, governance refers to the institutions, policies, regulations, and processes that shape how infrastructure needs are met. 32. Bielenberg, and others, 2016. 33.

It should more productively be seen as a harbinger of things to come if governance systems and social structures are not improved or reshaped to address inequality and marginalization. At its core, democratic governance should aim to support inclusive political processes to ensure the equitable participation of people in decision-making processes; strengthen responsive governance systems to meet the needs of all; and must remain ultimately and consistently underpinned by a normative framework which stands for civil, political, social, and economic rights for all peoples. However we have seen globally and regionally a significant roll back of civil liberties and freedoms in 2016. Electoral strategies and public policies are violently pursued or enforced. Marginalized populations are also politicized and derogated to ensure success at the ballot box. And states have attempted to contain the emerging issue of violent extremism through a preference for coercion rather than addressing the root causes. The use of torture techniques and extra-judicial renditions in recent years, has been a drastic departure from democratic rule of law procedures and international human rights standards. The outcome appears to have resulted in an observable and global roll back of civil liberties, political freedoms and democratic governance. The events of 2016 reinforce the importance of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u2019s principal aim of \u201cleaving no one behind\u201d and, more specifically, of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 on providing \u201cinclusive, peaceful, and just societies for all\u201d. While UNDP has decades of experience in supporting Foreword 1 Phil Matsheza, Team Leader Effective Governance and Peacebuilding Team democratic governance, it now needs to bolster\u2014and possibly even reimagine\u2014its position in increasingly politically polarized global, regional, national, and local contexts. The Governance and Peacebuilding Team at UNDP\u2019s Bangkok Regional Hub (BRH) was at the forefront of reshaping democratic governance work in 2016. New approaches in addressing political violent extremism, youth political and economic empowerment, and LGBTI rights focus on strengthening inclusive political and social processes, and in creating due space for those traditionally marginalized in decision-making processes. The team not only supports legal and policy reform in several areas, but also provides assistance to strengthen governance systems at national and local levels. Specific attention is paid to integrating social innovation approaches to redesign and deliver better services.

To facilitate cohesion and foster more integrated approaches to addressing some of the complex governance challenges in the region, the team\u2019s work is clustered into four broad thematic areas: 1) Political Transitions for Resilient, Inclusive States and Lasting Peace; 2) Good Governance of Development Finance at Global and National Levels; 3) Rights and Voices of Vulnerable, Marginalized and At- Risk Groups; 4) Transparent and Accountable National and Local Governance Systems to Provide Effective and Equitable Services With the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the team \u2019s work is increasingly seen in the lens of achieving the SDGs. The team\u2019s overall work, through the above four thematic areas of work, contributes to the achievement of SDG 16 on inclusive, peaceful and just societies. It also supports strengthening of Governance for the SDGs , i.e. SDG prioritization at the local level, and integrating SDGs with national planning and budgeting processes, and enhancing parliamentary oversight. Further, the team also helps to strengthen Governance of SDGs, i.e to improve the legal and regulatory framework, and governance systems for achieving other SDGs, specifically Goal 3 on good health and well-being, Goal 5 on gender equality, Goal 8 on decent work and economic growth (particularly Target 8.7 on human trafficking), Goal 11 on sustainable cities and communities, and Goal 13 on climate action (through governance of climate change finance). In 2016, the Governance and Peacebuilding Team had several key achievements at the national and regional levels that contributed to the sustainable development agenda. The team was instrumental in leading the discourse on policies and programmes for promoting judicial integrity, preventing violent extremism; forging new partnerships for enhancing youth engagement in achieving the SDGs; and developing methodologies and tools for localizing SDGs. In the area of HIV and Health, the team applied multi-sectoral approaches for the control and prevention of non-communicable diseases and strengthened the outreach of HIV prevention services.

Among the various factors contributing to conflict and insecurity are political and economic inequality and inclusion, which serve to keep political processes out of the reach of marginalized groups such as gender and ethnic minorities, youth, and other underrepresented social groups. Without the promotion of inclusion and integration, any form of social or political stability remains unsustainable. Recognizing the above, the Political Transition for Resilient, Inclusive and Peaceful States thematic area focuses on making political processes (including peace processes) more inclusive by supporting policy-focused research on emerging issues, facilitating spaces for the participation of marginalized groups (including women and youth), and connecting different stakeholders to use data and findings from research to predict and prevent conflict. In 2016, under this thematic area, partnerships with key organizations, academics, data scientists, and the private sector were established to foster a more collaborative approach to address the systemic challenges that contribute to political exclusion and marginalization. Further, the focus on supporting young people\u2019s engagement in political processes was reinforced by the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2250 on Youth, Peace and Security in December 2015. To address growing radicalization and limited spaces for young people\u2019s engagement in political processes, the Resolution calls on countries and organizations working with youth to establish mechanisms that would support the meaningful participation of young people in peace and dispute resolution processes. And at the same time, there is also broader engagement among development actors and countries, the need for engaging young people to achieve the transformative agenda of the SDGs. The different units that fall under this thematic area are Conflict Prevention; Inclusive Political Transitions; Civil Society and Youth; and Women, Peace and Security. a report on work in sustaining peace carried out in 13 countries in the region.

It also connected civil society with big data to predict and prevent conflict, as well as their engagement with policy makers around evidence based policy. Key results achieved in 2016 include: Seminal research on violent extremism in South and Southeast Asia: Research was supported to look at two distinct but related challenges for contemporary societies: the rise of violent extremism and its spread across national borders and the governance of diverse and multi-cultural societies. Two sub-regional research pieces for South and Southeast Asia were commissioned. These reports include a list of actors (research proposed Strategy for Peace and Reconciliation in Afghanistan. As part of the UNDP and UN Department of Political Affairs\u2019 institutions, think tanks, implementing agencies, etc.) working on addressing violent extremism in Asia. More importantly, the reports provide overviews of violent extremism in both sub-regions that include drivers for localized extremist organizations and drivers for foreign fighters; analyses of incidents, locations, and methods of attack; overviews of the security and development causes for violent extremism in South Asia; an analysis of effective tools for the mitigation violent extremism; and recommendations on a mixture of security and development preventative measures that can be undertaken to prevent violent extremism in Asia, and the potential role for UNDP in doing so. One of the issues that was revealed in this research was that, despite increased access to data and information, there exists a limited ability of communities to utilize data and information to identify areas at risk of extremist ideology, or even to understand the underlying factors of resilience that underpin positive peace. Data is disparate, disconnected, difficult to access, and dislocated from citizens\u2019 normal lives. This means that local actors have a limited ability to identify areas at risk of extremism and also propose solutions to reduce those risks. Conversely, civil society members remain an untapped resource as producers of information and data to address existing gaps. For instance, different communities will have different perceptions of security and peace dynamics based on their local circumstance. Connecting people and their perceptions of predictors and incidences of extremism and peace could provide insights as to why and how extremist ideologies erupt, intensify, and disperse alongside identifying pathways to peace. This could illustrate how violent extremism is related to assumed locally-specific drivers such as restricted civic and political space, underemployment, and other grievances. 5 CIVIL SOCIETY ENGAGEMENT Under the umbrella of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1c25701-3568-4e59-b56f-2b9de06fc04b": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1c25701-3568-4e59-b56f-2b9de06fc04b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peacebuilding-annual-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance & Peacebuilding Annual Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peacebuilding-annual-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3234c22374809628cff81479b62a58ee5e6796ccd1cf2943082cd8ecaac27455"}, "3": {"node_id": "aadb6956-33f8-46d0-a5e0-cbf7c1e02df6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peacebuilding-annual-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b92189ab8490373ff700af15258ffb719d13cade2579407e6f00f81cbbeb9b69"}}, "hash": "bf3cd3e27deec04471a4321d842149a0ef78b614e5022cbd7abe39c9ee186cc4", "text": "the UNDG Asia- Pacific Human Rights Network (UNDG APHRN) , which has a dedicated thematic working group on civil society, UNDP co-convened a consultation on civic space in Bangkok on 1 November 2016.

The meeting was attended by more than 60 representatives from the UN and civil society organizations actively involved in human rights and development issues. The meeting contributed to enhance capacity development and fostered proactive and constructive collaboration between all relevant stakeholders from governments, UN staff, civil society, and other private sector representatives. Participants identified key drivers of opportunity and challenges in the region, best practices and lessons learned related to civic space issues. In addition, participants also contributed to the development of a policy brief entitled Data platforms for promoting peace: BRH also progressed toward developing information platforms to help better understand peace and transitional processes in Asia and the Pacific.

Over 270 researchers, policy makers , and key influencers participated in the conference to discuss drivers of radicalization\u2014factors that contribute to \u2014and protect against violent extremism. The conference placed UNDP at the heart of the global violent extremism research agenda, and has positioned UNDP to take a key role in linking the research on the ground with policy and programming. A key outcome of the conference was identifying ways to turn research outcomes into practical policy and programme recommendations for practitioners and policy makers. These include: \u2022 Localizing research by investing in and supporting local-level participatory research that recognizes temporal, cultural and spatial variables; \u2022 Establishing methodological frame- works to ensure that research complies with ethical standards, and is conflict sensitive; \u2022 Balancing structural approaches and counter-narratives by creating and enhancing channels of communication between policy-makers, mid-level and grassroots actors in order to influence local communities where narratives of violent extremism takes place; \u2022 Developing a clear communications strategy to expand the influence and impact of research on countering and preventing violent extremism; \u2022 Establishing networks, support trainings, and develop programmes that deepen the collaboration between researchers and practitioners, and support evidence based policies and programmes Civil Society Space and Stakeholder Engagement \u2013which includes a list of re- commendations on what the UN\u2019s response should be to address the issue of shrinking space in the region. 2 working on community engagement in peace processes, in Indonesia, the Philippines and Myanmar. monitoring and reporting of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and facilitates spaces for youth to participate, innovate, and engage and influence policy makers.

The network aims to raise UN (UN Volunteers, ESCAP), civil society (the world\u2019s largest youth-led organization AIESEC) and the private sector (INTEL, Citi Group, SAP) hosted an Asian Youth Innovation Forum on \u201cLeaving No One Behind: Youth Innovation at the Heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201d in October 2016. This forum convened over 100 participants across 12 different countries in the region with a majority of young women, and supported the winners of various innovation challenges (e.g. access to finance and financial sustainability, inclusivity, managing teams, partnerships and community engagement, productive use of new technologies) at the country level to compete at the regional scale and also to understand the challenges faced by the youth social entrepreneurs in the region. awareness and empower youth in the region to effectively engage with the SDGs. As a follow-up to the workshop, regular updates are shared on an online space connecting the 2030 Youth Force members, AIESEC volunteers as well as UNDP and UNV staff. To coordinate advocacy campaigns and promote networking and information-sharing. The 2030 Youth Force has also cooperated with UNDP Country Offices to raise SDG awareness campaigns in seven countries, namely Cambodia, China, Mongolia, Nepal, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. In August 2016, the 2030 Youth Force initiated a successful SDG awareness-raising campaign on social media entitled \u201c#SendLoveOn\u201d. \u2022 Asian Youth Innovation Forum on \u201cLeaving No One Behind\u2019: Youth Innovation at the Heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Develop- ment\u201d (21 - 23 October): UNDP, together with partners from the \u2022 \"#The Case for Space: Youth at the Heart of the 2030 Agenda\" Conference (30 November \u2013 2 December): UNDP co-organized the #Case4Space #Case4Space event in partnership with leading UN agencies (UNESCO, UNFPA and ESCAP) and youth-led and civil society organizations (Restless Development and FORUM- ASIA).

More importantly, the events provided the much needed space for youth engagement, and identified new ways and means to sustain such spaces at regional, national and local levels. The BRH Youth Team supported the United Nations Action for Cooperation Against Trafficking in Persons (UN-ACT) project by facilitating the engagement of young people and civil society representatives in the Regional COMMIT Youth Forum (Bangkok, 21 - 25 November 2016). Associated with the Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative Against Trafficking (COMMIT), young people from six SEA countries helped shape decisions to counter human trafficking; assist in implementing the COMMIT sub-regional Plan of Action; and gain valuable training and networking skills. The BRH Youth Team actively participated in the N-Peace Awards through the support to a separate award called \u201cThe Peace Generation\u201d which recognizes the work of young men and women who have demonstrated volunteerism as a powerful means of promoting social cohesion and reconciliation. Their efforts in policy change, advocacy and mobilization, media communications, or community action have resulted in the advancement of women, peace and security issues. In the 2016 N-Peace, 2 young activists were awarded, including Rizky Murdiono, a member of the 2030 Youth Force in Indonesia. WOMEN, PEACE AND SECURITY was rolled out in 2010 to address the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325.

An informal review done in 2016 with previous awardees demonstrated that over 75 percent of awardees are invited to either local or national committees on peacebuilding after winning the awards. 2016 adjusted the programme to ensure closer linkages with the work of UNDP Country Offices in peacebuilding. The Network was rolled out in Sri Lanka.

The Governance of Climate Change Finance unit (GCCF) for Asia-Pacific provides technical and financial supports to seven countries to strengthen the formulation and management of their climate change-related public budget by adopting regional tools to their country context. The unit also promotes South-South exchange by bringing all countries to share knowledge and experience at the regional workshops and forums.

CPEIRS are currently being rolled out in four more districts (Myagdi, Dhading, Udaypur, Achham, Bardiya). In Pakistan, CPEIRs were completed at federal and provincial levels (all provinces and administrative territories), and the Pakistan\u2019s Climate Change Financing Frameworks (CCFF) at federal and provincial level are in the process of being launched. In Nepal, the draft district CPEIRs illustrated that districts are spending anywhere from 12 percent of the total district budget to 26 percent of the budget on climate related investments. In Pakistan, the draft provincial CPEIRs showed that the ratio of climate change expenditures to overall budgetary expenditures ranged from 5.7 percent to 18.1 percent. However, to determine whether or not the climate change expenditures are improving climate change adaptation on ground, the GCCF team will support impact assessment of climate change expenditures, looking in particular at poverty and gender impacts of climate related investments (including through ethnographic studies).

BRH also supported peer learning between countries at regional workshops such as the \u201cLinking Finance with Results: Achieving the SDGs in Asia-Pacific\u201d Bangkok and the sub-regional Pacific workshop on Development Finance and Consultations in Fiji. These consultations also ensured that regional perspectives and country priorities from this region were carried to global policy processes such at the Second High- Level Meeting of the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (GPEDC) , which took place in Nairobi in November. There was significant expansion in the demand for UNDP to support countries to manage development finance for the SDGs, specifically through the Development Finance Assessment (DFA) tool developed in BRH. DFAs were completed and published in Bangladesh and Lao PDR, with others still underway in Fiji, Cambodia, Nepal, Mongolia and Timor-Leste. These were used to inform country-level policies and reforms, including Bangladesh\u2019s 7th Five Year Plan, the Philippines\u2019 national long- term vision document, and Lao PDR\u2019s implementation of their development cooperation policy. DFAs were also requested in 7 countries in Latin America and 12 in Africa. LINKING FINANCE WITH RESULTS: The Develop- ment Finance Assessment and Integrated National Financing Frameworks Realizing the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will require a signi\ufffdcant increase in investments. The cost of the SDGs is estimated in the trillions of dollars, at levels well beyond the resources currently available to countries. Meeting these investment needs will require raising and mobilizing signi\ufffdcant additional resources from multiple sources. But it will also require using and channeling resources efficiently. All actors\u2013public and private, domestic and international\u2013have contributions to make. Using resources effectively will mean these resources working to their comparative advantages in meeting a variety of types of investment needs. The 3rd International Conference on Financing for Development held in Addis Ababa in July 2015 opened the discussions on how to mobilize the unprecedented amounts of \ufffdnancial resources that will be required to achieve the SDGs. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) assumes that countries will use their own national development strategies and plans to respond to the SDGs and calls for the adoption of Integrated National Financing Frameworks (INFFs) UNDP BRH has developed the Development Finance Assessment (DFA), a tool to respond to the growing demand from countries in the region to establish evidence and analysis, and introduce policy and institutional reforms for managing the increasing complexity of domestic and international sources of \ufffdnance for development. The DFA provides governments with data and analysis on the quality of their national development strategies and country results frameworks, changing trends in development \ufffdnance and its alignment with national priorities and results. It also helps formulate recommendations for how institutions and systems might be adjusted to ensure that different sources of development \ufffdnance are managed within a coherent framework (the INFF), which better supports the implementation of the SDGs. UNDP is already supporting a number of countries to undertake DFAs. The \ufffdndings emerging from DFAs provide useful data and analysis for discussing reforms at country level. Examples of DFA\u2019s impact include: i) the restructuring of government departments to take a more integrated approach to managing \ufffdnance for development across institutions or bringing closer together the planning and budgeting processes; ii) the development of new integrated policy frameworks that seek greater coherence across external \ufffdnancial \ufffdows; and iii) proposals for new policy dialogue structures for governments and their partners, providing a multi- stakeholder platform that could be used to review SDG implementation.

Such governance systems promote inclusiveness, identify and respond to the needs of the local population, transparently and accountably manage public services, and delivery equitable services. On the other hand, governance systems which do not uphold these standards prove unsustainable and weak in their management capacities, trigger manifestation of social issues such as multi-dimensional poverty, social exclusion, ineffective rule of law, corruption, and human rights violations. The BRH works with governments, the private sector, and civil society in strengthening transparent and accountable national and local governance systems through its work in supporting core government functions and parliament, anti-corruption transparency and accountability, and local governance.

As a result, new activities and new engagements with parliaments have been planned at the country level. Regional exchanges have also been facilitated. governments and hold them accountable. Country-level initiatives often focus on achieving all the three aspects indicated above\u2014i.e. the implementation of UNCAC, addressing corruption risks to improve service delivery, and promoting open governance. In 2016, six countries in the region (Thailand, Viet Nam, Pakistan, the Philippines, Nepal and Myanmar) adapted UNDP\u2019s methodologies for identifying and mitigating corruption risks in key sectors (procurement and infrastructure, water, and judiciary) to accelerate service delivery. Integrity in Public Procurement was launched in the oversight role of the parliaments, including in the achievement of national and international development goals (such as the SDGs), management of public finance, and achieving gender equality. In addition, BRH also contributed to development of new tools and resources for parliamentarians in collaboration with development partners. Specifically, BRH provided UNDP Sri Lanka with substantial policy advice and technical support for developing a comprehensive legislative strengthening project, \"Consolidating Sri Lankan Democracy and Sustaining Peace through Parliamentary Strengthening.\" The main objective of this project is to strengthen parliamentary oversight of the executive branch of government. The project also supports Parliament to ensure mainstreaming of SDGs in all development plans, policies and legislations. Further, the project also focuses on strengthening the role of Parliament as a peacebuilder and sustainer. The implementation of the project started in June 2016. BRH provided technical backstopping to support implementation. This support resulted in improvements to the committee structure to strengthen the Parliament\u2019s oversight function by establishing 15 sectoral oversight committees (including a committee on Women and Gender, and another on Public Finance and Budget). The Core Government Functions and Parliament advisor contributed expert technical support to the development of a Parliamentary Handbook on the Role of Parliament in Implementing SDGs. This tool, developed in cooperation with Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption and UNDP Hub for Arab States, will help parliaments and members of parliaments to strengthen their parliamentary oversight function by promoting international standards of parliamentary procedure and practice, useful experiences and lessons learned, as well as emerging innovative practices. The handbook was finalized after feedback from parliamentarians from South and Southeast Asia, who participated at an inter-parliamentary workshop organized in cooperation with development partners and the Indonesian Parliament in August 2016. In cooperation with Country Offices, BRH will support interested parliaments (including those of Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal and others) to utilize this new parliamentary strengthening tool. Technical assistance was also offered by BRH to UNDP Nepal to support the Parliament of Nepal in mainstreaming the SDGs into its work and establishing a dedicated focal body. BRH supported UNDP Mongolia CO to formulate the second phase of the Local Governance/Hural Project. The Pacific Office was also supported in conducting a legislative needs assessment in the Federated States of Micronesia.

Since its inception, the project closely involved a wide range of stakeholders, including private sector, academia and civil society organizations. The integrity risk assessment in public procurement was carried out in 2014 - 2015, based on the analytical approach developed by the OECD and World Bank, as well as desk reviews, interviews and surveys with several stakeholders. As a result of the assessment, a twenty-point action plan was proposed. The main recommendations were the development of a sound, modern and coherent legal framework, with the adoption of a Public Procurement Law, the professionalization of the procurement function, as well as the adoption of greater transparency. Strong commitment from the Thai government (which set up a sub-committee on procurement as part of its National Reform Council) was an essential ingredient to ensure the successful results of the project. CGD worked over the years in close cooperation with UNDP to draft the Public Procurement Act, based on international models, aiming at maximize value for money, enforcing integrity standards, as well as setting up a coherent public procurement system.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2b0b697-607d-48dd-81e9-da2641a0bb94": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2b0b697-607d-48dd-81e9-da2641a0bb94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peacebuilding-annual-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance & Peacebuilding Annual Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peacebuilding-annual-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa1b5b548b5a42a168ffe1d00481ebab8b94793af6a98c8db976510a22c443c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "2021a562-372f-4e7c-a6f8-88320939852f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peacebuilding-annual-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "264a25ce6a458b1631cf460886aef3cc6c898854506f197bac36fcca578b8a43"}}, "hash": "bd148ba51bdc933398565b94967066b28f007b9e38d58e2267632126fd952e52", "text": "UNDP also supported CGD in building the capacity of public procurement of\ufffdcials through trainings on mitigating corruption risks (UNDP checklist) and international standards (WTO, UNCITRAL, etc.).

UNDP continues to provides technical assistance to CGD on the effective implementation of the law with the development of secondary regulations that need to be developed by 23 August 2017. In addition, in cooperation with the UNDP Procurement Centre in Denmark and CIPS, a curriculum will be developed as part of the professionalization of the public procurement functions. 19 Implementation of the two-year \u2018Strengthening Governance of Extractive Industries for Sustainable Human Development\u2019 project was completed in 2016. The project adopted an inter- disciplinary approach that brought together different practice areas sed by the Managing Director of Transparency International, were presented in a series of national capacity-building workshops (Myanmar, Nepal), regional workshops (in Thailand, and in Tunisia for the Middle East and North Africa region) and at a global events (such as Transparency International's Anti-Corruption Conference). The report is a valuable advocacy tool which has obtained the attention of several experts and anti- corruption practitioners. BRH also provided capacity development support on judicial integrity to the Supreme Court, and the National Judicial Academy in Nepal. A judicial integrity risk assessment was initiated in Nepal in cooperation with the Supreme Court and the UNDP Rule of Law Team. In Myanmar, the Code of Ethics for judges was developed with support from BRH.

Project activities were completed in four countries (Indonesia, Mongolia, Pakistan and the Philippines). In Indonesia, the Coal Mining Road Map, the Feasibility Study on Sovereign Wealth Fund in Bojonegoro, and the methodology for the Mining Governance Index with the Anti-Corruption Agency (KPK) were finalized. The Mining Governance Index assesses the commitment, and the ability of local governments to carry forth the agreed mining governance reforms. The index assessed all the 12 mining regions and helped to identify gaps in the implementation of key reforms\u2014from noncompliance to reducing mining concessions overlap with the protected forest areas. In Pakistan, a mapping and analysis of constitutional, legal, institutional and financial aspects of the extractive industries governance was completed. Key findings of the analysis were that, Pakistan has comprehensive legal and policy frameworks for its oil and gas sector and for mining. This framework calls for greater transparency in the extractives sector, and equitable share of revenues between federal and provincial governments. However, implementation of the legal and policy framework remains inadequate. Provincial governments are not involved in the extension of leases, block allocations, or in decisions regarding the pricing framework. They are also not represented in the Oil and Gas Regular Authority. Further, the mechanisms for # provinces to address their grievances remain ineffective. The findings for the report were presented to representatives of the provincial and federal governments in December 2016. Following the project closure, UNDP Pakistan may address the findings through existing local governance and decentralization programmes. In the Philippines, the GREENR project supported the mapping and analysis of the environmental governance legal and institutional framework. Similar to findings in Pakistan, the mapping exercise revealed that, while legal and institutional frameworks exist, implementation remains weak, and that laws and policies require update.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c7f021d-6e21-4007-923d-81403bd18d4c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c7f021d-6e21-4007-923d-81403bd18d4c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peacebuilding-annual-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance & Peacebuilding Annual Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peacebuilding-annual-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d24d748455473a5d9fc8604b1c45206853ac7d95b1dfc92612746993b148a8b"}, "2": {"node_id": "01b34e7b-1177-4428-ac92-60d235268166", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peacebuilding-annual-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3e22d964dfeefa8408f6027f1ad96c288af6b8cfea92bae6487fcc996a0694a8"}}, "hash": "3065859885e5ddf277f1fadb3cca1c345302cc46e10ed8c42d3067186c36a603", "text": "Necessary capacity development support should also be provided to all the agencies and institutions that have an environmental governance mandate, # See UNDP (2015), Issue Brief on Governance for Sustainable Development.

In June, 19 young community leaders from more than 10 countries in Asia and the Pacific were brought together by UNDP and UN Volunteers in Bangkok for a three-day workshop. The event culminated in the creation of a new youth-led network, 2030 Youth Force, which aims to raise awareness and empower youth in the region to effectively engage with the SDGs. \u2022 Featured Story | Youth network gives new voice to development aspirations in Asia and the Pacific (17 June 2016) Following the workshop, an online space connecting 2030 Youth Force members, as well as UNDP and UNV staff, and AIESEC volunteers, was created to coordinate campaigns and continue networking. To mark International Youth Day on 12 August 2016, the 2030 Youth Force, UNDP BRH, UNV and UNDP country offices ran a regional social media campaign on the SDGs, as well as published an Op-Ed by Nicholas Rosellini in the Nikkei Asian Review. \u2022 Nicholas Rosellini -- Youth can power Asia's next development miracle(12 Auguest 2016) 5. UNDP BRH positions itself as a thought leader on youth Two of the founding members of the 2030 Youth Force UNDP is at the forefront of research on the current state of youth in the Asia-Pacific region, shedding light on youth engagement in labour markets, political participation and national development. This research has been disseminated through two major regional reports (linked below). Country Offices are also taking the lead on research.

The region has witnessed some of the most devastating disaster events in recent years including the Indian Ocean Tsunami, 2004; Yogyakarta Earthquake, 2006; Cyclone Nargis, 2008; Thailand Floods, 2011; Cyclone Haiyan, 2013 and Bagan Earthquake, 2016. Despite such adversities, the spirit to make ASEAN a dynamic, resilient and cohesive regional association through the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community is stronger than ever before. The ASEAN Member States are committed to implement the ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response (AADMER), with the vision of building disaster resilient nations and safer communities. Since the adoption of the AADMER work programme in July 2005, the ASEAN Member States have established strong regional cooperation to minimize disaster losses and respond collectively to disasters in the region. Priorities under the second phase of the AADMER work programme (2013-15) have contributed to the enhancement of an ASEAN mechanism for joint response, enabling policies and enhancing capacities to respond to disasters and help communities recover. These commitments are also embraced in the recently signed ASEAN Declaration at the ASEAN Summit in Vientiane on ONE ASEAN, ONE RESPONSE: ASEAN Responding to Disasters as One in The Region and Outside The Region. Within the framework of the AADMER, the recovery component aims to prepare Member States for recovery by proactive planning and capacity building for more effective and resilient recovery. As a first step, the Governments of Myanmar and Indonesia as the co-chairs of ASEAN Committee on Disaster Management (ACDM) Working Group on Recovery; together with the Governments of Brunei Darussalam, Thailand, Lao PDR and the Philippines; and with support from the ASEAN Secretariat, the AHA Center and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), developed the ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide (ADRRG). The guide was developed through extensive consultations with key stakeholder agencies working on recovery in the ASEAN region. Preparedness for Recovery is now a widely accepted concept that helps countries to plan ahead of the disaster so that recovery and reconstruction assistance is predictable and can be implemented without delay when needed. The ASEAN member states have adequate experience in disaster response and recovery. These experiences can be used to standardize procedures and arrangements for management of recovery. The ADRRG uses the experiences and best practices of recovery from the ASEAN countries to provide guidance on five key components: 1) Policies and Planning for Recovery; 2) Establishing the Institutional Framework for Recovery; 3) Post Disaster Assessments; 4) Resource Mobilisation and Financial Management for Recovery; and 5) Implementation, Coordination, Communications and Monitoring for Recovery. The reference guide aims to \u201cimprove the social and economic outcomes of disaster recovery programmes in the Member States\u201d. In particular, it emphasizes that preparedness for recovery is an opportunity to build disaster resilience and contribute to sustainable development. The ADRRG was endorsed by the ASEAN Committee on Disaster Management in April 2016 and contributes to Priority Area 7 on Recovery under the current AADMER work programme (2016-2020). On behalf of the ACDM Working Group on Recovery, we would like to thank the United Nations Development Programme for its technical assistance and generous support to develop the ADRRG and the case studies to promote resilient recovery of communities in the region. 4 TABLE OF CONTENTS Foreword 3 A Guide to Recovery Planning and Preparedness 7 Disaster losses and risk reduction in ASEAN 8 ASEAN Commitment to Disaster Risk Reduction 10 Understanding Resilient Recovery 12 A common vision of well-managed recovery in ASEAN 15 Preparedness for Recovery 17 1.

The goal of the Guide is to improve the social and economic outcomes of disaster recovery programmes in the Member States. In particular, it aims to ensure that recovery improves disaster resilience and contributes to sustainable development. The Guide helps governments to prepare for disaster recovery by explaining the provisions that should be in place beforehand including those related to legislation, policies, financial arrangements, implementation, monitoring and so on. These arrangements can be adapted to the specific post disaster recovery context, recognizing that disasters differ in scale and impact. Preparedness for recovery means that stakeholders can collaborate to prepare recovery approaches that can be applied effectively when a disaster occurs. Preparation also provides an opportunity to incorporate replicable good practices from the other ASEAN Member States. Together, preparation, execution, and monitoring have great potential to produce more efficient recovery operations and more resilient recovery outcomes. How the Guide serves the Member States The Guide provides a framework for the Member States to strengthen their recovery planning and management capacities before a disaster occurs. The Guide: \u00a7\ufffdExplains key elements of disaster recovery arrangements; \u00a7\ufffdIdentifies the types of interventions needed for participatory and sustainable recovery; \u00a7\ufffdProposes key principles and approaches for effective disaster recovery including reducing future risks; and \u00a7\ufffdShowcases examples of recovery practices from the ASEAN region that could be replicated and scaled up. The Guide can be used by the ASEAN Member States individually to: \u00a7\ufffdImprove readiness for disaster recovery; \u00a7\ufffd Increase the efficiency of recovery implementation; and \u00a7\ufffdIdentify capacity gaps and needs for institutional strengthening. Effective and efficient recovery is also a regional concern. The Guide will contribute to continuous improvement of recovery programmes in the ASEAN region. ASEAN Member States can use the Guide collectively to: \u00a7\ufffdEstablish a shared vision of \u201cgood recovery\u201d and a commitment to continuous improvement of recovery practices; \u00a7\ufffdDefine benchmarks and indicators that can be used to monitor and improve recovery performance regionally; \u00a7\ufffdEncourage further sharing of lessons learned and good recovery practices; and \u00a7\ufffdIdentify and reinforce critical recovery management capacities through training at the regional level. Future updates to the Guide The publication of the Guide represents an important step in an ongoing process to confront the risks associated with disasters and climate change and to ensure that each ASEAN Member State prepares for disasters and manages recovery well. It also represents a commitment among the Member States to continue the quest to become a resilient region, with the capability of organizing recovery programmes that reduce risk and advance regional development goals. This commitment will be exercised through the preparation and sharing of case studies, and updates to the Guide as more recovery experience\u2014including more experience with recovery readiness\u2014is gained. 8 DISASTER LOSSES AND RISk REDUCTION IN ASEAN The ASEAN Member States are exposed to a wide range of natural hazards. Earthquakes, floods, tropical cyclones (typhoons), and drought all affect the region. More than 100 million people in the ASEAN countries have been affected by disasters since 2000.1 Natural hazards and their effects are transboundary by nature, which puts the ASEAN region in a unique position to confront the development challenges presented by these phenomena. For instance, the Pacific \u201cRing of Fire\u201d is one of the most seismically active zones in the world, crossing national boundaries and threatening huge numbers of people in countries across the ASEAN region. The Great Sumatran Fault crosses 12 countries from Southeast Asia to East Africa. It generated a 9.3 magnitude earthquake and the Indian Ocean tsunami that killed over 230,000 people in 2004.2 Typhoons and floods too can produce physical and economic impacts across borders. In 2014, Typhoon kalmaeki affected Viet Nam, the Philippines, and China. The Mekong River, the longest in Southeast Asia, flows through several countries including Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam, and has the potential to cause floods in more than one country at a time.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d5d5303-748a-442f-b93c-374e008233f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d5d5303-748a-442f-b93c-374e008233f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "208aedb37c16f1dbc89b9887105189e175aecd7b73575a265cb46fa7a190df6a"}, "2": {"node_id": "34ffa2d7-3dfe-432c-893e-f80ffdc6d5e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a3ad7b0cea13264469ca7667bd0262cbcee789f2c0018b38cdd1fa93cde97bd"}}, "hash": "4257da38f13bc692c5a02fb5b2de8146337ed341dd08142b7758e062a7056a3b", "text": "In 1996, flooding of the Mekong River damaged about 28,000 hectares of cropped land in Lao PDR and caused considerable damage to its agriculture, irrigation system, and other infrastructure.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf5c301f-21a6-4d74-8edc-2a9d0d48cf19": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf5c301f-21a6-4d74-8edc-2a9d0d48cf19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb48f063d9a9531f336e4a223a4dbed5b51ed36d8090f5c2f71ec950c3d11d2b"}, "3": {"node_id": "3b70a73e-1fa7-445a-b900-f835d23df3f3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57fe2a7366ac8b91332d5aae4145ce5c887db0d2938528c3df4224bae47eb16a"}}, "hash": "8c64230b6a2a84a26bf1d886ff0a4b34d3e0036c31a14d2d6ee4a3b424cbb778", "text": "In Cambodia, more than 450,000 hectares were affected, while the flood caused heavy casualties in the lower Delta area in Viet Nam.3 Even droughts have a cross-border impact. In the same Mekong Delta, water levels in the lower Mekong are now at their lowest since records began, as a consequence of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon in 2015-16.4 The countries along the lower course account for 13 per cent of the global rice output and around 25 per cent of the world\u2019s freshwater fish comes from the river. The severe drought is damaging agricultural production and undermining food security. Additionally, haze from El Ni\u00f1o-related forest fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan in Indonesia has caused health concerns in Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand, Viet Nam, Cambodia, and the Philippines. The Government of Indonesia estimates a cost of US$47 billion to mitigate the haze.5 Disasters affect regional economic growth and make commitments to poverty reduction and shared prosperity harder to fulfil. Annual Expected Losses (AEL) from disasters in the region exceed US$4.4 billion, greater than 0.2 per cent of the regional gross domestic product. AELs for Myanmar, the Philippines, Viet Nam, Lao PDR, and Cambodia are particularly high, at 0.7 per cent or more of GDP. The region\u2019s AEL represents nearly three per cent of actual world losses for the 2003-2012 period.6 The exposure and vulnerability levels of Member States vary considerably.7 Yet, all are committed to disaster risk reduction and have invested heavily in risk assessment, preparedness, and mitigation. Figure 1, compares Annual Expected Losses (AELs) in US dollars and as a share of GNP for ASEAN countries.

Various policy initiatives are now underway to support these efforts, as described in the following section: Policies and Planning for Recovery. 10 ASEAN COMMITMENT TO DISASTER RISk REDUCTION ASEAN Member States have been working together to address the serious consequences of natural disasters on the economic and social development of ASEAN countries since 1976 when the \u201cASEAN Declaration on Mutual Assistance on Natural Disasters\u201d was signed. Since then, cooperation on disaster response and disaster risk management (DRM) continued to grow, reaching a significant milestone when the ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response (AADMER) was ratified by all Member States and entered into force on 24 December 2009.8 The AADMER is a proactive regional framework for cooperation, coordination, technical assistance, and resource mobilisation in all aspects of disaster management. It also affirmed ASEAN\u2019s commitment to the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) and was the first legally-binding HFA-related instrument in the world.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b70a73e-1fa7-445a-b900-f835d23df3f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b70a73e-1fa7-445a-b900-f835d23df3f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb48f063d9a9531f336e4a223a4dbed5b51ed36d8090f5c2f71ec950c3d11d2b"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf5c301f-21a6-4d74-8edc-2a9d0d48cf19", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c64230b6a2a84a26bf1d886ff0a4b34d3e0036c31a14d2d6ee4a3b424cbb778"}}, "hash": "57fe2a7366ac8b91332d5aae4145ce5c887db0d2938528c3df4224bae47eb16a", "text": "The AADMER document states: The Parties shall, jointly or individually, develop strategies and implement programmes for rehabilitation as a result of a disaster ....

The Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: The HFA outlined five priorities for action, and offered guiding principles and practical means for achieving disaster resilience for nations and communities.11 Its goal was to reduce disaster losses substantially and build resilience by 2015. However, recovery is mentioned only in Indicator 4.5 of the framework: \u201cDisaster risk reduction measures are integrated into post- disaster recovery and rehabilitation processes,\u201d and in Indicator 5.3: \u201cFinancial reserves and contingency mechanisms are in place to support effective response and recovery when required.\u201d Nearly all regions had relatively low scores on these recovery-related indicators, and ASEAN was no exception.12 The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 (SFDRR), signed in March 2015, has four priorities of which one focuses specifically on recovery.13 Priority 4 of SFDRR aims at \u201cEnhancing disaster preparedness for effective response and to \u2018Build Back Better\u2019 in recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction.\u201d With this, the SFDRR puts more emphasis on the imperative to reduce risk in recovery and encourages governments to operationalize the concept of \u201cBuild Back Better.\u201d The SFDRR also urges States, regional and international organisations, and other relevant stakeholders to take action to accomplish the agreement\u2019s goals. Some of the proposed actions most relevant to the Guide include: \u00a7\ufffdAdopting public policies and procedures that establish or strengthen coordination and funding mechanisms for relief assistance and for planning and preparing post disaster recovery and reconstruction; \u00a7\ufffdPromoting regular disaster preparedness, response, and recovery exercises to ensure rapid and effective response to disasters and related displacement; \u00a7\ufffdPromoting the incorporation of disaster risk management into post disaster recovery and rehabilitation processes, and facilitating the link between relief, rehabilitation, and development; \u00a7\ufffdUsing recovery to develop capacities that reduce disaster risk in the short, medium and long-term, including through land use planning, structural standards improvement, and the sharing of expertise, knowledge, post disaster reviews and lessons learned; \u00a7\ufffdIntegrating post disaster reconstruction and temporary settlements for persons displaced by disasters into the economic and socially sustainable development of affected areas; and \u00a7\ufffdDeveloping guidance for preparedness for disaster reconstruction, such as on land use planning and structural standards improvement; learning from the recovery and reconstruction programmes since the adoption of the HFA; and exchanging experiences, knowledge, and lessons learned. Indicators for monitoring the Sendai priorities are being developed. Under SFDRR, ASEAN countries have an opportunity to renew their commitment as a region to monitor and report progress on DRR\u2014 including recovery activities. 11 UNISDR (2005) Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df6d85fd-3fc1-4ad2-941b-e823c0a36af0": {"__data__": {"id_": "df6d85fd-3fc1-4ad2-941b-e823c0a36af0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd2ac87c1f04a927323cedbb0dba2b385da8c803be35b85eaf0e82fc96b8219a"}, "2": {"node_id": "5e2becdf-faf9-430d-8e3e-3730e7e9865c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c16e695d4a42e2c4231cd077fda195125d444257f37c7aab3a81084eba56fc29"}}, "hash": "15cd90de16d811fa070755ddfffa0bd7b9c30a349c7f131b3cbb37ecf31116f7", "text": "http://www. unisdr.org/we/inform/publications/1037 12 ISDR, 2014, Global Assessment Reports. http://www.preventionweb.net/english/hyogo/gar/2013/en/home/index.html 13 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. http://www.unisdr.org/we/inform/publications/43291 12 UNDERSTANDING RESILIENT RECOVERY Defining Disaster Recovery The foremost responsibility of governments in disaster recovery is to help people recover their assets and livelihoods. Unlike rehabilitation and reconstruction that refer to the physical aspect of recovery alone, the term recovery is broader and captures the complex range of physical, social, economic, and environmental dimensions of this process.14 However, there are still some differences in the way various agencies view the concept of recovery. The definitions below intend to clarify the concept of recovery, and how it is broader than rehabilitation and reconstruction. The UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) defines recovery as: Decisions and actions taken after a disaster with a view to restoring or improving the pre-disaster living conditions of the stricken community, while encouraging and facilitating necessary adjustments to reduce disaster risk.

The ensuing transition process [entails] restoring trust and confidence as much as regaining human and physical developing capital. Managing recovery [requires] building national capacities, restoring coping mechanisms, empowering communities, and determining root causes and vulnerabilities [that] make societies disaster-prone.15 The Government of Indonesia in its national policy defines rehabilitation and reconstruction as: Rehabilitation is the restoration and recovery of all aspects of public services or the communities to an acceptable degree in a post disaster area with the primary goal of normalizing or realizing an adequate level of operation of the government and community life in the area. Reconstruction is the rebuilding of all infrastructures and facilities, and the institutions in the disaster-affected areas, both at the government and community sides, with a view of revitalizing the economic, social and cultural lives of the communities, as well as reinforcing law and order and promoting community\u2019s participation in all aspects of the society in post disaster areas.16 The Philippines Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 defines recovery as: The restoration and improvement where appropriate, of facilities, livelihood and living conditions of disaster-affected communities, including efforts to reduce disaster risk factors, in accordance with the principles of \u201cbuild back better.\u201d Defining Resilience Risk is a function of hazards, vulnerability, and capability, particularly coping and adaptive capacity. Effective disaster risk reduction depends on understanding the risks to which a population is exposed, the damage and other effects that it could produce, the costs associated with these effects, and communicating this information to those who can take action. Pre- disaster preparation and analysis of risk information provide more time to consider multiple risks and the interactions between them. 14 Additional definitions of terms used in the Guide are found in Annex V. 15 UNDP, 2011, Methodological Guide for Post disaster Recovery Planning Processes: Guidelines and Actions for National, Regional and Local Governments. http://www.preventionweb.net/files/32306_32306guametodolgicaparaprocesosdepl.pdf 16 Government of Indonesia, National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), 2010, General Guidelines for the Conduct of Post disaster Rehabilitation and Reconstruction. Head of BNPB Regulation Number 17. 13 The UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) defines resilience as: The ability of a system, community or society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate to and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner, including through the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions.17 Different kinds of disasters (geological, hydro- meteorological, etc.) elicit different impacts. Floods may cause more damage to farming than housing and infrastructure. Cyclones tend to affect nearly all sectors, especially if they are severe. Earthquakes are likely to damage the built environment but leave agriculture relatively untouched. Disaster contexts are also a factor in both impact and response (urban/ rural; low/high income; the level of public security, decentralization, connectivity, etc.) These differing effects and contexts require differentiated approaches to recovery. But in all cases, opportunities for risk reduction are present. Early, medium and long-term recovery There is enough evidence and experience to indicate that response and recovery are not linear processes, in that they do not follow from one to the other. Rather, recovery begins on the day of the disaster. It often starts with early recovery activities.18 Early recovery activities address immediate needs for stabilizing communities before medium and long- term recovery activities commence. Each country decides the duration for early recovery based on the local context. Early recovery can start from the day of the disaster and continue until l six, 12 or 18 months depending on the scale of the disaster. The Government of Indonesia has designated --- the early recovery phase from two to 18 months and long-term recovery upto three years. Early recovery entails the restoration of basic functions, services, and capacities. UNDP defines early recovery as: Early recovery is a multidimensional process guided by development principles that begins in a humanitarian setting, and seeks to build on humanitarian programmes and catalyse sustainable development opportunities. It aims to generate and/ or reinforce nationally owned processes for post- crisis recovery that are resilient and sustainable. It encompasses livelihoods, transitional shelter, governance, security and rule of law, environment and other socio-economic dimensions, including the reintegration of displaced populations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc87f007-1972-44df-8c93-3ccb1a6e0d0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc87f007-1972-44df-8c93-3ccb1a6e0d0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b839925a1b0f844342bf886115687fe9b7d26340093f682640b47c1fe099595e"}, "2": {"node_id": "89e5fcf7-7500-4bf0-925e-4c481a0f0317", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d7ced119163bf33f2aee61d2efb6abf220067ed197a8206b781d77bbeaec187"}}, "hash": "dcb2540c7073fde51a042d6c15149244960414713c91a0944af52e63135e4fe4", "text": "It strengthens human security and aims to begin addressing the underlying causes of the crisis.19 Early recovery includes the following: \u00a7\ufffdRestoring essential (\u201clifeline\u201d) services, including critical infrastructure and communications; \u00a7\ufffdProviding additional support to critical governance functions of coordination and information management; \u00a7\ufffdSharing information regularly with organisations working on recovery; \u00a7\ufffdMobilising resources", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7df5763f-8685-4a09-9211-966f255883c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "7df5763f-8685-4a09-9211-966f255883c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cce389e2e2f692f395f7269f115f5d3a7b49c1a174212876b5be4395cf5c39e7"}, "3": {"node_id": "34107838-6399-45a1-95d1-d2a999d52dd1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d4fb18c31094400dca9fc88ff250ed6a67e91baf4d870f17469ffc952916436b"}}, "hash": "c0e3ddc3dfaefb4e20d3759f2b9a168d831d4c83637dcd699f0a487ce172e5c5", "text": "for recovery; \u00a7\ufffdProviding temporary or transitional housing; \u00a7\ufffdDebris clearing activities; \u00a7\ufffdConducting damage and needs assessment; and \u00a7\ufffdProviding emergency employment through cash- for-work programmes. The scope and duration of early, medium and long- term recovery are different. Similarly, planning and management approaches to early and long-term recovery differ. Early recovery activities establish patterns that can affect the nature, scope, and cost of longer-term recovery interventions, and therefore must be planned with their impact on longer-term recovery in mind. Medium-term recovery activities can be undertaken from twelve months to two years, and long- term recovery can even take from two to five years or a decade in very large scale disasters. However as mentioned above, each country determines the various phases of recovery based on their country context. 17 United Nation\u2019s Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, 2009. Terminology on DRR. https://www.unisdr.org/we/inform/terminology#letter-r 18 The distinction between long-term and short-term recovery may be less applicable for slow-onset disasters such as droughts; howeer, the objectives of both (e.g. providing temporary housing if households are forced to migrate) remain relevant. 19 UNDP, 2008, Guidance Note on Early Recovery https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/Documents/Guidance%20note%20on%20Early%20 Recovery.pdf 14 This Guide provides a framework for governments to plan, finance, implement and monitor long-term recovery activities. Long-term recovery involves actions that lead to the restoration of normal life, and of the social and economic functioning of the affected community. Planning and management of them are a government responsibility, it may be supported by others. Long-term recovery includes: \u00a7\ufffdDeveloping enabling policies and plans to guide recovery; \u00a7\ufffdEstablishing an institutional framework to organize and manage recovery; \u00a7\ufffdEnsuring that there are adequate resources available or mobilising resources to carry out recovery activities; \u00a7\ufffdRedeveloping and revitalizing disaster-affected areas; \u00a7\ufffdRebuilding and/or relocating damaged or destroyed infrastructure and buildings; \u00a7\ufffdPartnering with relevant organisations for multi- sectoral recovery including restoring and reviving health, education, transport, agriculture, livelihoods, etc.; \u00a7\ufffdRestoring negative impacts on natural ecosystems and the environment; \u00a7\ufffdEstablishing monitoring mechanisms to ensure that recovery is transparent, accountable and inclusive; and \u00a7\ufffdImproving community capacity including those of women, the elderly, persons with disabilities, vulnerable and marginalised groups to reduce disaster risks and manage future disaster events. Resilient Recovery is Everyone\u2019s Responsibility The primary responsibility for organizing recovery lies with the government, but responsibility for implementation is widespread. While the lead agency for disaster risk reduction is the National Disaster Management Organisation (NDMO) \u2013 except in Myanmar and the Philippines \u2013 the lead agency for recovery is often the ministry of planning or the ministry of finance. In some countries, a special agency is set up for recovery. Recovery planning and implementation require a different dispensation and therefore can have separate institutional arrangements to disaster risk reduction. The NDMO, key sector ministries and local governments impacted by the disaster play a pivotal role in the recovery process. In implementing recovery, governments can marshal required capacities by inviting the participation of international and national NGOs, donors, the private sector and others. These external actors may engage in the recovery process either by way of providing resources, technical advice, and capacity building or implementing recovery projects. Many of these actors bring valuable experience and knowledge, and governments may consider partnering with them for a comprehensive and holistic recovery. These include bilateral, multilateral, and international agencies; Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs); academic and technical institutions; the private sector and business community; religious institutions; Civil Society Organisation (CSOs); Community-based Organisations (CBOs) and private individuals. It is also important to recognise that the community itself can play an important role in recovery. Instead of viewing those affected as victims, recovery can provide an opportunity for engagement and empowerment of the affected communities. Involving the community, including women and vulnerable groups, in their own recovery can have knock-on benefits for development and progress. 15 A COMMON VISION OF WELL-MANAGED RECOVERY IN ASEAN So far, most countries are investing primarily in disaster preparedness, which is vital.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34107838-6399-45a1-95d1-d2a999d52dd1": {"__data__": {"id_": "34107838-6399-45a1-95d1-d2a999d52dd1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cce389e2e2f692f395f7269f115f5d3a7b49c1a174212876b5be4395cf5c39e7"}, "2": {"node_id": "7df5763f-8685-4a09-9211-966f255883c9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c0e3ddc3dfaefb4e20d3759f2b9a168d831d4c83637dcd699f0a487ce172e5c5"}}, "hash": "d4fb18c31094400dca9fc88ff250ed6a67e91baf4d870f17469ffc952916436b", "text": "There is now an increased realisation that preparedness for recovery is equally important as many gains of preparedness and response can be lost if recovery is not undertaken in a timely and efficient manner.

It is advisable that a Recovery Framework is developed especially after large-scale disasters, to support a Recovery Programme that is multi sectoral and requires multiple actors to be engaged. Three ASEAN Member States have developed Recovery Frameworks: Indonesia, Lao PDR and Myanmar (please see Annex III for the summary frameworks). The ASEAN Member States are committed to carrying out good quality recovery programmes; i.e., recovery programmes that meet or exceed their objectives, contribute to the country\u2019s larger development goals and are delivered cost-effectively and promptly. The overarching goal of a recovery programme should be to restore and revive the affected communities. A recovery programme should have defined objectives with specific interventions for each sector. Each objective and intervention must specify timelines, financial resources, and a robust monitoring and evaluation system. Throughout the duration of the management and oversight of the Recovery Programme, it is critical to ensure that implementation is on track and that the programmes are delivered in a transparent manner. Disaster recovery provides a unique opportunity for risk reduction: there is greater awareness of the underlying risks, resources are available or can be mobilised and, recovery is considered a political priority. In addition, conditions are right for ensuring that recovery activities include risk reduction so that the impact of future disasters on lives, livelihoods, environment, health, etc., can be minimized. However, this can only happen if the government and partners who are engaged in the recovery, have the foresight and awareness to include risk reduction into recovery programmes. Box 1: Defining \u201cRecovery Framework\u201d A Recovery Framework helps governments to articulate a vision for recovery; defining a strategy; prioritizing actions; and providing guidance on financing, implementing and monitoring the recovery. Through developing a country-level disaster recovery framework, a government will be better positioned to drive a process that unites all development partners\u2019 efforts. Additionally, by developing a framework to manage recovery, a government may be able to better address long-term disaster vulnerability through coherent programmes that bridge the current gap between recovery and development. Source: World Bank, EU and UNDP, March 2015, Guide to Developing Disaster Recovery Frameworks Each recovery programme is unique and provides important lessons for improvements in recovery practice. Lessons learnt, and good practices in recovery are helping the ASEAN Member States to continuously improve their recovery performance. Within the region, there is an opportunity to learn from each other, especially as many countries face similar hazard risks. In view of the above, in preparing this Guide, there was consensus among key stakeholders on five intentions or principles that all recovery programmes should aspire to achieve: 1. Governments and citizens should be ready for recovery 2. Recovery programmes should be planned strategically and managed efficiently 3. key stakeholders including the affected population must participate in the recovery process 4. Recovery should use the opportunity for risk reduction and resilience building 5. Countries should strive for continuous improvement of recovery practices. These are further elaborated in Annex V: Principles for Good Recovery with Performance Indicators, illustrating proposed monitoring indicators tied to the features of good recovery programmes. Photo by Chansok Lay/UNDP, Combodia 17 PREPAREDNESS FOR RECOVERY In recent years, governments and other actors have greatly improved preparedness for emergency response and relief, resulting in a remarkable reduction in the loss of life from natural hazards. A similar approach prepares countries for recovery, by designing tools and procedures to manage predictable activities and assigning roles and responsibilities in advance. The key areas for preparedness in recovery are presented in the following five chapters: 1. Policies and Planning for Recovery; 2. Establishing the Institutional Framework for Recovery; 3. Post disaster Assessment; 4. Resource mobilization and financial management for Recovery; and 5. Implementation, Coordination, Communications, and Monitoring for Recovery. Each chapter includes examples of recovery practices in the ASEAN Member States and provides guidance on the types of decisions that can be made ex-ante, leading over time to more efficient, effective and resilient recovery. These brief examples taken from case studies are intended to spur the documentation of more good practices in recovery from the ASEAN region, which will be featured on the website of the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Centre) (ww.ahacentre.org). 18 Protecting livelihoods assets for eco-tourism in Kampong Phluk floating village, Cambodia Photo by Chansok Lay/UNDP 19 1 .

What obligations do governments have to recovery? 3. How can existing or new policies help recovery? 4. What are the key elements of a Recovery Plan? (vision, principles, key sectors of recovery; criteria for prioritization, sector recovery plans etc.) 1.1 Develop Recovery Policies A. Overall and sector recovery policies A National Recovery Policy is a statement of intent by the government in disaster recovery and establishes the scope of government assistance. Such a policy can be modified in the context of specific disasters. In addition, sectors may have specific recovery policies or development policies that include provisions for disaster recovery. Aligning the over-arching and sector recovery policies brings strategic coherence to the recovery framework and programme. For long-term recovery, sector recovery policies should be based on sector development policies. B. Build on existing policies In the absence of a national recovery or sector recovery policy, sector development policies could be modified to include provisions for disaster recovery. Another option is to develop ad hoc policies which may become benchmarks for future recovery. Disaster Risk Management (DRM) laws and regulations and key sector policy frameworks provide a good basis for developing policies for recovery planning and implementation. All the ASEAN Member States have DRM laws that mandate the preparation of DRM regulations, policies and strategies. National and local plans generally cover disaster risk mitigation, preparedness, response, rehabilitation, and recovery. Some laws also require the preparation of sector recovery plans, following \u2013 or in advance of \u2013 disasters. However, most of the DRM strategies and plans are focused on ex-ante preparations for disaster risk reduction, preparedness, and response. For instance, in Myanmar, the DRM regulations are in the form of Standing Orders that are operational and focus principally on response.20 Therefore it may be necessary to review the existing DRM legislations and add specific guidance on recovery. The recovery policy outlines the recovery outcomes, recovery vision, defines the extent of the government\u2019s responsibility in recovery and identifies the recovery priorities. These aspects of the recovery policy are elaborated below. 1.2 Identify Recovery Outcomes A Recovery Framework prepared before a disaster provides the reference for developing a post disaster Recovery Framework and the Recovery Programme. Irrespective of the scale of the disaster, it is always the government that has the responsibility to lead, manage and coordinate disaster response and recovery. However, in the event of a major disaster, several stakeholders engage in response and recovery activities. In such a situation, there are likely to be multiple sector recovery plans. The principles of good recovery show that a recovery programme must be coherent and coordinated. A post disaster recovery framework brings together sector plans and stakeholders so that a shared vision for the recovery programme can be established. This also helps to identify specific recovery outcomes for a time-bound recovery programme. 20 Government of Myanmar, 2011, Standing Order on Natural Disaster Management in Myanmar. http://www.recoveryplatform.org/assets/ publication/SO%20Printing%20new.pdf 20 A. Establish a vision for recovery with strategic objectives and outcomes Based on the principles for good recovery, a vision for recovery can be broadly outlined even before an actual disaster. The post disaster Recovery Framework must include the specific vision and strategic objectives of the recovery programme. In a large-scale disaster, a recovery programme will engage a significant number of stakeholders for a considerable period. Therefore, the outcomes of the recovery programme should contribute to the development priorities of the disaster-affected country. The involvement and leadership of the Ministry of Planning in post disaster assessments and developing a recovery framework helps to bring about this linkage and also to prioritise recovery for long-term development gains. B. Define the extent of the government\u2019s responsibilities Governments have certain obligations and responsibilities in disaster recovery. A Recovery Policy developed beforehand can help to establish which responsibilities governments will assume. In the case of recovery, Figure 2, below shows the Figure 2: Reconstruction Obligations by Type of Purpose and Liability Social Purpose Private Purpose Public Liability CELL A \u2022 Public infrastructure, e.g., roads, electricity, telecommunications \u2022 Public buildings e.g. government offices, official residences, public libraries and museums, cultural heritage sites \u2022 Public schools and hospitals CELL C \u2022 Low-income and underinsured housing \u2022 Social protection programmes \u2022 Restoration of smallholder agriculture \u2022 Small and medium enterprises and other livelihoods support \u2022 Replacement of livestock and household effects \u2022 Interest on borrowing Private Liability CELL B \u2022 Private schools and hospitals \u2022 Privately built infrastructure CELL D \u2022 Housing \u2022 Commercial buildings \u2022 Industrial operations types of recovery interventions that are most likely required after a disaster.

Governments need to take more complex decisions regarding replacements of private goods and services that serve a social purpose, such as private schools and hospitals (cell B). Usually, governments finance the reconstruction of houses of low-income households and recovery of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), small farms, etc. since these groups tend to be most vulnerable and lack alternate coping mechanisms (cell C). Governments should use the opportunity of disaster recovery to build the capacities of poor and vulnerable communities and introduce risk reduction strategies so that they can withstand future disasters. The government is unlikely to take on the responsibility to replace private assets that serve a private purpose, such as housing and commercial buildings), especially those belonging to higher-income owners (cell D). 21 C. Identify recovery priorities and fund priority needs It is advisable that after a major disaster, an assessment of the damage, loss and recovery needs is undertaken. Such assessments help to identify the short, medium, and long-term recovery priorities and needs. The assessments also help to prioritize the resources required for recovery across sectors and geographical areas within an identified time span. The post disaster Recovery Framework and Recovery Programme should be based on a systematic assessment of recovery needs and priorities. The Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA), a tool for assessing the impact of the disaster is discussed in detail in chapter three. 1.3 Prepare Recovery Programmes It is critical that after a needs assessment is undertaken, a detailed recovery programme is formulated with objectives, activities and budget. The structure of the Recovery Programme can be defined beforehand. Establishing recovery goals, in consultation with stakeholders, is the essential starting point for a good recovery programme.21 This step not only engages stakeholders and aligns their actions, but it also helps establish reasonable expectations, motivates self- recovery in the affected population, and helps address the needs of vulnerable groups. The principles for the Recovery Programme should include cross-cutting issues such as disaster risk reduction, social protection, gender and social inclusion, and environmental management. The Recovery Programme should bring together all sector and local recovery plans prepared by ministries and local governments. 21 International Recovery Platform, \u201cGuidance Note on Recovery: Pre-Disaster Recovery Planning,\u201d http://www.unisdr.org/files/31963_ predisasterrecoveryweb.pdf ; 22 World Risk Report 2015. http://www.worldriskreport.org/fileadmin/WRB/PDFs_und_Tabellen/WRR_2015_engl_online.pdf ASEAN CASE STUDY, INDONESIA: THE ROLE OF THE DISASTER RECOvERY FRAMEWORk Indonesia has the second highest level of disaster risk globally from extreme weather and geophysical events according to the Natural Disasters Risk Index.22 Considering its high level of vulnerability and using recovery as an opportunity to reduce risk, Indonesia is one of the few countries which has developed Guidelines for formulation of Post Disaster Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Plan. The Guidelines articulate the legal and institutional arrangements, the role of lead agencies, timelines for recovery, the recovery planning process, funding sources and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms required for recovery. The National Agency for Disaster Management (Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana or BNPB) is mandated to formulate a recovery policy and coordinate the implementation of the recovery programme. There is a provision to constitute an ad hoc coordinating agency for recovery, whenever needed, to assist the BNPB. The Post- Disaster Needs Assessment and the formulation of an Action Plan for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction are key elements of the recovery planning process, involving local government and other key stakeholders. Indonesia has managed a few recovery and reconstruction programmes using this framework, which includes post-tsunami Mentawai recovery, the post-Mount Merapi eruption in DI Yogyakarta and the Central Java recovery programmes. The recovery and reconstruction programmes were managed successfully and provided lessons for improvement. 22 Reconstruction of houses for disaster affected community in Chin State, Myanmar 23 2 . ESTABLISHING THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORk FOR RECOVERY The institutional framework for recovery defines the roles and responsibilities of the government and recovery actors and provides for their collaboration. It also establishes the legal basis for the actions of all actors and the rules under which they operate.

A. Designate a lead recovery agency The President or Prime Minister\u2019s Office is responsible for designating a Lead Recovery Agency and appointing the leadership team. Designating a Lead Recovery Agency is an important task that could be done before a disaster. Criteria for designating the lead recovery agency The Lead Recovery Agency must have political support, autonomy, authority and technical capacity. The selection of the lead agency usually depends on five criteria. They are the (a) characteristics of the disaster; (b) current governance structure; (c) agency\u2019s prior disaster recovery experience; (d) agency\u2019s ability to reach out and include communities in defining and implementing their recovery process, and capacity to work with local authorities and nongovernmental organisations; and (e) overarching coordination, monitoring, oversight, and control frameworks in operation among a country\u2019s agencies, line ministries, local governments, and civil society. 23 Organisational models for recovery agency Given the complex set of considerations shown above, the structures of lead recovery agencies vary considerably. However, the most common organisational models can be categorized as shown in Table 1. 23 World Bank, EU and UNDP, March 2015, Guide to Developing Disaster Recovery Frameworks, pg. 27 24 Table : Organisational Models for Recovery Agency Strengths Weaknesses Recommendations Option 1.

Strong leadership team for recovery According to the Executing Agency for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (BRR), in Indonesia, a strong, experienced leadership team helps the Lead Recovery Agency gain support from other government agencies, the donor community, and stakeholders in general.25 This is especially the case if the recovery agency is new, the staff\u2019s reputation and professional networks will help it gain credibility with more experienced government and international agencies. The leadership team may be composed of public officials or persons drawn from the private sector depending on the agency\u2019s structure and technical and managerial requirements. Team members should have executive experience, ability to work effectively together, and the stamina to maintain a sense of urgency throughout the recovery process. They also need to demonstrate political impartiality, trustworthiness, and knowledge of local conditions. Technical capacity at national and local levels There is a need for professional and technical expertise at the national and local levels to steer all government capacities and resources for recovery planning and implementation. Such expertise should be institutionalised in all key sectors for implementing recovery. Experience suggests that it would be beneficial to have staff designated in each ministry to lead recovery. Typically, each sector requires a range of technical experts which includes engineers, architects and town planners, community organizers. In addition to experts required for implementation of recovery in all sectors, the government will require personnel for management of finances allocated for resources. This person must have the technical skills and expertise required to support sector recovery. Governments can undertake training activities to build capacities and skills of government staff. 25 The Executing Agency for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (BRR) of Aceh Nias, 2009, Ten Management Lessons for Host Governments Coordinating Post disaster Reconstruction, http://www.recoveryplatform.org/assets/publication/BRR%2010%20Management%20Lessons%20 for%20Host%20Governments.pdf 26 Several international agencies in the ASEAN region, including UNDP, the Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre (ADPC), the Asian Disaster Reduction Centre (ADRC), the International Recovery Platform, have training and capacity building programmes and tools for recovery preparedness. The ASEAN Member States can draw upon these global tools and good practices and partner with them. 26 C. Establish a legal framework for recovery A legal framework for recovery combines (1) legal instruments and procedures in use in normal times, and (2) instruments and procedures established specifically for recovery. The legal framework for relief in most countries is more clearly defined than the framework for recovery.27 Through its International Disaster Response Laws, Rules and Principles (IDRL) Programme, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has analysed the legal frameworks of some ASEAN Member States. The approach taken in the IDRL Guidelines could be applied to strengthen the regulation of recovery in ASEAN countries. 28 The legal framework for recovery includes: \u2022 Disaster Management Law and regulations; \u2022 Laws and regulations that govern public expenditure, land use, social protection, and disaster-affected sectors (transport, education, health, etc.); \u2022 New or strengthened enforcement mechanisms (for instance, to enforce no-build zones); and \u2022 Modifications to or suspensions of normal rules and procedures. Modifications may be called for in regulations related to: \u2022 Approval and management of expenditures; \u2022 Transparency and competition in procurement; \u2022 Planning and environmental review of projects; \u2022 Incorporating disaster risk reduction; and \u2022 Land use policies. Often, legal or regulatory requirements can cause procedural delays for implementing recovery activities which need to be delivered promptly. If modifying or suspending normal procedures creates risks, mitigation measures for these risks should be identified before rule changes are promulgated. Instead of suspending or weakening rules related to disaster risk reduction to facilitate reconstruction, efforts should be made to address bottlenecks in the DRM system.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4fc1303c-552d-41c1-99a3-15368614a551": {"__data__": {"id_": "4fc1303c-552d-41c1-99a3-15368614a551", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b665afeba00a1b4b6071e16c1b319b96147d630bae79829ca1564e2803a1209f"}, "2": {"node_id": "420dfd38-1d8b-42e4-8891-f18586da08bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "15624c5fbc1bae79c3cf3a199cee224603969812f63f21bc4289f948023a71f9"}}, "hash": "3322394343af566a9402c9025aafa984ac85b0c7a281aabedecf2a93b5876b50", "text": "Annex IV highlights the DRM focal agencies, DRM laws, and plans in the 10 ASEAN Member States.

Myanmar: The \u201cStanding Order for Natural Disaster Management in Myanmar\u201d is issued with the aim of ensuring that once disaster strikes, emergency relief, and rehabilitation work is carried out according to the prepared plan and that the people are mobilized at the national level for participation in such efforts. Myanmar\u2019s 2009 Standing Orders include a provision for the respective Natural Disaster Management Committees in ministries and departments, states and divisions, townships, ward/village and at the grassroots level to prepare and issue their own action plans and standing orders for all stages of DRM, including rehabilitation.31 It directs these entities to prepare \u201cpractical and comprehensive action plans\u201d although the content of these plans is not stipulated. The need for simulation activities is explicitly mentioned. D. Identify recovery stakeholders Recovery stakeholders include the government, national and international agencies, civil society, and the private sector. Some of these stakeholders are key to the planning and implementation of recovery while some may not directly participate in the recovery process but can influence the process of recovery. key stakeholders may have been involved in previous recovery programmes or are active in the development of the disaster-affected area. The stakeholders will be known to the local government. The proper engagement of stakeholders in planning can help a recovery programme. Examples of recovery stakeholders are listed in Table 2.

The devastation was massive, and a 30- year armed conflict in Aceh added to the existing challenges of recovery.34 With the monumental task of coordinating multiple agencies engaged in recovery, the government set-up the Agency for the Reconstruction and Rehabilitation of Aceh and Nias (BRR). Over a five-year period, the role of the agency evolved from coordinator to executor, and it succeeded in reconstructing over 140,000 homes, building new schools and improving critical infrastructure.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7667976-1bf1-40c1-9c33-6edb3487b66c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7667976-1bf1-40c1-9c33-6edb3487b66c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae7bbfbcf0990e38b941cd818e7a18c25ec04bbd9f4a988d152fa32d141fe168"}, "2": {"node_id": "17a7fa66-0ec1-4be4-8b5f-80df97ea7fcb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c18b137b0c4650ee67602f7b0c7d315c0f701dc4877bae7d28edcfcd15ec67da"}}, "hash": "0b5b9caf351d1093360dcd180c639e940ab50f8408c9291b5384487ce89ff280", "text": "Those who had left returned to better homes and living conditions and the reconstruction activities are believed to have reduced poverty in Aceh to the pre-tsunami levels.35 There are several reasons behind the success of the BRR that provide valuable insights for recovery agencies elsewhere. \u2022 BRR was headquartered in Banda Aceh and not Jakarta, so it", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8ea639f-3d89-4c1a-a72c-47ca50c4160c": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8ea639f-3d89-4c1a-a72c-47ca50c4160c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc559de6d175c726a85dcf9aeb6076b0745269aa9a7b15c367d2d50b3bdd508d"}, "3": {"node_id": "3daf5ef7-4fdb-4e6f-9923-6e3c2c376057", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d6f5c3cfadee38d5784a746b4d245a2246a08e10e2f31e317aa7178d4ab8cc96"}}, "hash": "27ebe5b5c6035196b500d1f75e0b0ac475daec88c6c028f7416026b553f0c673", "text": "was located on the frontlines of recovery interventions.

Despite the vast coverage, some population groups were left out and didn\u2019t recover.40 However, given the scale of the disaster and the relatively short time frame for recovery, the BRR did a stellar job and was acknowledged by the World Bank as a model for international partnership.41 33 Republic of Indonesia, Master Plan for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of the regions and communities of the province of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam and the Islands of Nias, Republic of Indonesia, April, 2005, p.

As a result, countless lives were saved and people\u2019s vulnerabilities to disasters reduced, even in some very high-risk countries. With a similar motivation, countries are now putting arrangements in place to be ready for recovery. By preparing arrangements for disaster recovery, a government can simplify and accelerate the post disaster recovery planning process. Simulating the recovery planning process is one such way of preparing for disaster recovery. This includes the following steps: A. Develop disaster scenarios Countries that plan for disasters often prepare either for a repeat of their most recent disaster or for their most frequent disasters, which may or may not have a high impact in terms of economic losses. Designing recovery arrangements requires assessing risks and identifying the corresponding disaster scenarios those risks could produce. Some scenarios can be developed without sophisticated forecasting tools, including those for smaller-scale disasters that occur on a regular basis. But modelling less frequent, higher impact events, or events in multi-hazard environments, may require a more scientific approach, and an understanding of the interactions of hazards. Because resources are limited, governments must decide which disasters to prepare for, and which recovery arrangements to develop. Some mechanisms are relatively inexpensive to develop, useful in many types of events, and have high benefits. Others are more expensive and complex to put in place. In this case, a cost/benefit analysis of proposed provisions can be used. National Disaster Management Organisations (NDMO) often develop disaster scenarios for purposes of response planning. These data may also be useful for recovery planning. By sharing this information with a wider group of stakeholders and helping them understand its implications for disaster recovery, NDMOs can support readiness for recovery. B. Prepare risk information systems for recovery Risk information systems are evolving rapidly as tools for DRM, and their use in recovery is expanding equally fast.42 Some of the tools include: \u00a7\ufffdGeospatial data and satellite imagery can be used to estimate the damage and provide information needed to plan relocation and reconstruction. \u00a7\ufffdSpatial impact modelling done before an event such as a tropical storm or impact assessments conducted immediately afterwards can be used to develop rapid estimates of losses. \u00a7\ufffdRisk maps and information on land uses and land use-related vulnerabilities are crucial for deciding how and where reconstruction should occur. \u00a7\ufffdRisk models can also be used to assess the economic and fiscal impacts of disasters, using exposure databases to estimate expected damage from various events. This information then becomes the basis for making decisions about pre-disaster arrangements for recovery financing, as discussed below. To maximize the usefulness of risk information for recovery planning, it needs to be gathered and applications designed before an event occurs. After the event, the time needed to collect and process the information can slow down the recovery planning process. In recovery, NDMOs can play an important role supporting governmental and non-governmental agencies and the private sector by providing risk information and supporting decision making. 42", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a6b0cf4-c316-451e-baa2-cd1ba20cae76": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a6b0cf4-c316-451e-baa2-cd1ba20cae76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80e1307fedf8d08759035624b36200995a378471521a5695aee9576b97544430"}, "3": {"node_id": "219aae4d-1dfa-4b46-be4d-c49ac4e1dd3f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "571e4559dd5307711b960387be35165dc0b6e849c4ab4d9c143893e375511c95"}}, "hash": "fc1b1bf5c900e54f2680e16461b6c65ec3b0d56318e8630f28a19f0c801f2d5b", "text": "Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery, 2014, Understanding Risk in an Evolving World - A Policy Note.

Simulate the recovery planning process The identification, design, and development of disaster recovery arrangements should take place in the context of the country\u2019s disaster risk management policy, its national development plan or other development policy and planning frameworks. The ASEAN Member States are increasingly establishing legal frameworks that require ministries and other government agencies to develop plans for preparedness and recovery at the sector and local level. Simulation is an effective tool for improving recovery planning capacity and strengthening recovery performance. Participants in recovery simulations can come to an agreement on their roles and responsibilities and identify where recovery arrangements are needed. Governments can seek assistance with staging recovery planning simulations. The International Recovery Platform (IRP), for example, trains government officials around the world and offers advice on using simulation for anticipating recovery approaches.43 Recovery simulation, like recovery itself, involves stakeholders who do not participate in the response. NDMOs can support readiness for recovery by establishing working groups or other coordination platforms among government and key recovery stakeholders where simulations can be carried out. At the end of the simulation exercise, each sector should develop guidelines for recovery that cover the following: 1. Contribution and role of agency in recovery operations under various scenarios 2. Needs for support from other agencies in recovery operations 3. Aspects of sector policy framework applicable to recovery and identify gaps 4. Sector programmes, funding mechanisms, and operational procedures relevant to recovery operations and identify gaps 5. Recovery arrangements to be put in place 6. Business continuity plans for the agency 7. Action plan to fully operationalise recovery arrangements 8. Information requirements and identify gaps in the sector or agency 9. Training needs of the sector or agency 10. Resource needs of the sector or agency Special Focus 2: Encouraging Private Sector Readiness for Recovery A. Business Continuity Management in the private sector. The recovery of the government and households depends on the recovery of the private sector and often on the recovery of the non-government/ non-profit sectors as well. This is particularly the case if these actors operate schools, hospitals, and other critical facilities. It is in the government\u2019s interest that the private and non-profit sectors are prepared for disaster recovery. In some countries, private sector advances in preparing for disaster recovery have been greater than those in the government. Private sector \u201cbusiness continuity\u201d arrangements have been implemented in these countries over more than a decade. Business continuity management (BCM) is defined as a holistic management process that identifies potential threats to an organisation or disruptive incidents and their impact on business operations. BCM provides a framework for building organisational resilience with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of its key stakeholders, reputation, brand and value-creating activities. It is similar to what is called \u201ccontinuity of operations\u201d (COO/COOP) or \u201ccontinuity of government\u201d (COG) in the public sector. 44 43 See www.recoveryplatform.org and \u201cGuidance note on recovery: pre-disaster recovery planning,\u201d http://www.unisdr.org/files/31963_ predisasterrecoveryweb.pdf 44 Oregon Emergency Management, [no date], COOP Planning Manual. http://www.oregon.gov/OMD/OEM/plans_train/docs/coop/oem_ coop_manual.pdf 36 There is much the public and private sectors can learn from each other in pursuing these aims. The field of BCM began in the 1980s and, while first associated with information technology, has since expanded to cover a range of threats, including natural disasters, acts of terror, technology mishaps and environmental accidents and a broader definition of critical business processes. The practice of BCM in the private sector is supported by business associations and consultants, and more recently by the involvement of the International Organisation for Standardization, ISO.45 In 2012, ISO published a management systems standard for BCM that can be used by organisations of all sizes and types.46 B. Encouraging private sector involvement in recovery The government can encourage the use of BCM in the private sector and the non-profit sector. It can also support the involvement of the private sector in recovery planning, particularly with companies most needed to support recovery, such as financial institutions, construction and engineering firms, building materials wholesalers and retailers, transportation companies, etc.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "219aae4d-1dfa-4b46-be4d-c49ac4e1dd3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "219aae4d-1dfa-4b46-be4d-c49ac4e1dd3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80e1307fedf8d08759035624b36200995a378471521a5695aee9576b97544430"}, "2": {"node_id": "8a6b0cf4-c316-451e-baa2-cd1ba20cae76", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc1b1bf5c900e54f2680e16461b6c65ec3b0d56318e8630f28a19f0c801f2d5b"}}, "hash": "571e4559dd5307711b960387be35165dc0b6e849c4ab4d9c143893e375511c95", "text": "This can be done in a number of ways: \u00a7\ufffdUse BCM as a topic for private sector engagement - If the private sector is prepared for disasters and recovers more quickly, this helps the government and the affected population to recover.

POST DISASTER ASSESSMENTS Major disaster events are typically followed by numerous agencies conducting a variety of assessments in many sectors. These can range from rapid assessments of immediate needs (more associated with the humanitarian phase of action), to elaborate assessments of long-term recovery and risk reduction requirements in particular sectors. The number of assessments, distinct methodologies, and diverse motivations of agencies can be confusing, including for the affected population. On 25 September 2008, a Joint Declaration on Post-Crisis Assessments and Recovery Planning was signed between the World Bank, European Union, and the United Nations Development Group. They agreed to adopt a common approach to post disaster needs assessments and recovery planning, developing guidelines for the Post Disaster Needs Assessments (PDNA). The PDNA has emerged as the globally accepted tool for post disaster assessments. The PDNA assesses the damage, loss and needs estimates financial requirements and provides the basis for planning and prioritizing recovery. This chapter focus on the preparedness measures for undertaking post disaster assessments and responds to the following key questions: \u00a7\ufffdWhat are the various kinds of assessments? \u00a7\ufffdHow to conduct the assessment? \u00a7\ufffdWhat sectors should be assessed? \u00a7\ufffdWhat kind of information is required for assessments? \u00a7\ufffdWhat outputs are needed from the assessment process? 3.1 Understand Assessments In any type or scale of disaster, the damages, losses, and needs must be assessed to develop a recovery strategy based on the critical needs of the affected population.

International assessment methodologies The purpose of an assessment is to provide the government and stakeholders with a comprehensive, multi-sectoral overview of a disaster\u2019s impact by region and sector. It should also produce an appraisal of recovery needs and an estimate of the costs to recover. It may also provide advice on the recovery strategy. The PDNA is a government-led assessment exercise with integrated support from the UN, the European Union, the World Bank, and other national and international actors. It produces a consolidated report on the physical impacts of a disaster; the economic value of damage and loss; the human impacts as experienced by the affected population; and the resulting early and long-term recovery needs and priorities.

It also provides technical advice on the overall assessment process (Volume A) and sector assessment methodologies (Volume B).51 The PDNA sectors are shown in Box 3. The PDNA methodology standardizes the assessment process and its outputs, which facilitates government assessment of recovery needs and allows disaster events to be analyzed in terms of effects and impacts. As shown in Figure 3, the PDNA builds on the Damage and Loss Assessment (DaLA) methodology developed by the Economic Commission in Latin American Countries (ECLAC) in the 1970s.

Transport Telecommunications SOCIAL CROSS-CUTTING INFRASTRUCTURE 41 B. Nationally defined assessment methodologies Some countries have either formulated their own assessment methodologies or adapted the PDNA for national and local use. As mentioned above, Indonesia has adopted the PDNA process and tools to create the Indonesian PDNA (IPDNA).52 The IPDNA leads to the elaboration of the Action Plan for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction or RENAkSI that is sensitive to community perceived needs. It incorporates disaster risk reduction principles and other cross-cutting objectives, such as gender mainstreaming and a sound environmental approach. In developing the IPDNA, the government also developed a series of training manuals for assessment and implementation of rehabilitation and reconstruction activities. PDNA guidelines can be adapted by governments to suit the country context and facilitate assessment and recovery planning such as to align sectors with ministries, departments, or national accounts. It can also incorporate local terminology or coding; incorporate country-specific recovery and development concerns; and/or translate materials to local languages. In doing so, governments should strive to maintain outputs that are consistent with the international methodology. C. Targeted and specialized assessments Initial assessments, including humanitarian assessments, provide useful background information to guide the scope of the PDNA. The ASEAN Emergency Response and Assessment Team (ASEAN-ERAT) is designed to quickly respond to a major sudden on-set disaster in the ASEAN region. 53 This includes conducting rapid assessments and supporting the national disaster management offices of the disaster- affected Member State in the initial aftermath. There are several other initial assessment methodologies including those of the UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC); the Multi-Sector Initial Rapid Assessment (MIRA); the Disaster Emergency Needs Assessment by the International Federation of the Red Cross; 54 etc. Geo-spatial data and remote sensing also provide useful visual assessments for relief and recovery operations.

SIA is integrated into the PDNA through the incorporation of the HRNA. However, SIA can also be used on a stand-alone basis. 42 3.2 Prepare for assessments The PDNA is an inclusive, government-led process which builds on the capacity and expertise of national and international actors. While not all disaster events require a full PDNA, all assessments follow similar steps. A. Timing of the assessment The purpose of the PDNA is to identify recovery needs. Therefore, the assessment typically begins after the initial relief efforts are completed. At a minimum, there should be assurance that the assessment will not impede ongoing relief activities. Local government staff must be available to assist with the assessment. Depending on the nature and scale of a disaster, a PDNA could start at least two weeks or later after a disaster and take between three to six weeks to complete. The timing varies based on the scope of the assessment and the data available at the onset of the process. B. Prepare for the assessments Refer to the PDNA Guidelines The PDNA Guidelines have useful information for preparing for a PDNA including Terms of References (ToRs); templates and preparatory requirements for the conduct of a PDNA. There is also extensive experience from the conduct of PDNAs in the ASEAN Member States from which these preparatory tools can be adapted. Several measures can be taken to prepare for PDNAs. This includes: \u00a7\ufffdDesignating a lead government agency to manage and coordinate the PDNA (usually the Ministry of Planning); \u00a7\ufffdEstablishing protocols for launching and activating a PDNA; \u00a7\ufffdIdentifying key sectors to be assessed and focal points within the government line ministries including at the local level to lead the assessment; \u00a7\ufffdIn case external assistance is required, identifying key partners from the UN agencies, international NGOs, donor agencies, etc.; \u00a7\ufffdEstablishing pre-disaster baselines; \u00a7\ufffdConducting trainings on the PDNA methodology; and \u00a7\ufffdIdentifying logistical support required for the conduct of a PDNA including office space, interpreters, field visits, etc. In addition to the PDNA Guidelines, the tripartite partners have developed a training package with the purpose of creating a cadre of trained PDNA experts who can be deployed for a PDNA after a disaster. A number of such trainings have been carried out, including a regional training for the ASEAN Member States in July 2015. The AHA Centre\u2019s Executive Programme (ACE programme) has also instititionalised training on the PDNA for NDMO officials. In addition to such training, an orientation before the actual start of a PDNA is important to establish a common understanding of the context and scope of a particular assessment and to train those not familiar with the methodology. C. Prepare to mobilise data An analysis of the pre-disaster context in each sector is required to determine the post disaster effects. This information, known as the baseline, provides the pre-disaster status in a sector or location prior to a disaster. Baseline data also helps to understand the underlying causes of a disaster. Time is saved during the PDNA process if baseline data is collected and available beforehand. Table 8 lists some useful sources of baseline data. 43 ASEAN CASE STUDY, LAO PDR: Institutionalising the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) Lao PDR is one of the few countries in the region that has institutionalized the post disaster needs assessment. The Ministry of National Planning and Investment (MPI) along with line ministries and with the assistance of the World Bank and the Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre (ADPC) has developed a Handbook for Post disaster Recovery and Reconstruction Planning in Lao PDR. Adapting the global PDNA guidelines, the Handbook aims at improving the post disaster needs assessment and provides guidance on recovery and reconstruction planning.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1516bf71-c53c-4d79-905b-8199e73398fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "1516bf71-c53c-4d79-905b-8199e73398fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b143d5f86b303afcfe66e7179743146ff5729191400a6e5067886f6f5676501f"}, "2": {"node_id": "5e5a07ad-3b87-4b9f-a7e4-0e8a2d7200a9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf7818ee53a7211658c677c6002256fc0a2a7112c08b7ce01c037f8a32b373c5"}}, "hash": "523fa4b38decfc7c64144857fd5d0edc7fb2c1ca64702bbeec91b4fc0b79966c", "text": "The handbook identifies the key agencies, scope of the assessment, process and timeline; sectors covered and also includes relevant assessment templates.

In khammouane province of Lao PDR, the damage, loss, and needs assessment system was further strengthened through the development of province-specific tools. These included the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Damage, Loss and Needs Assessment and Guidelines on Planning, Budgeting, and Financing for post disaster recovery and reconstruction activities. The SOPs include guidance on the purpose, timing, scope and funding for the assessment as well as pre-assessment activities and procedures for conducting assessments.60 Despite the challenges of baseline information and better data, the PDNA process in Lao PDR has been integrated with recovery and planning.

Also, governments may consider other sources, including innovative sources for collecting baseline information, including through crowdsourcing information. Risk maps, topographical maps, and land use plans are important sources of hazard risks which are critical for post disaster planning.64 Analysing risk information before a disaster helps to establish the baseline. Assessments based on hazard models and satellite imagery can be used to develop rapid estimates of losses, identify hazard zones, and plan relocation and reconstruction. Geo information, an important source of data, supports a range of risk mitigation and recovery interventions.65 The open data philosophy says that disaster risk data, as well as the knowledge of how to analyse and apply those data, need to be available to everyone.66 Governments can promote the open data approach by pro-actively resolving legal, costs, and technical issues associated with data sharing, either in advance of the disaster or during recovery planning. Protocols can be established in advance for recovery partners to request technical assistance and information for planning and implementation, consistent with the Open Data Resilience Initiative (OpenDRI) methodology.67 3.3 Conduct Assessments The government must direct the assessment process to ensure that the outputs satisfy its purposes and that the public has confidence in the results. In the ASEAN region, international agencies such as the UN, the EU, the World Bank, Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre, Asian Disaster Reduction Centre, and the Asian Development Bank have extensive post disaster 45 assessment experience and often participate when countries need additional assessment capacity. In the event a PDNA is conducted, support can be provided throughout the assessment process. A. Launch the PDNA A government considering a PDNA begins by communicating with a representative of one or more of the PDNA partners: the EU, the World Bank, and the UN. Beginning with the initial contact, these steps are typically followed: 1. Official request from the government and joint decision to activate a PDNA; 2. Designation of the national lead agency for the PDNA; 3. Deployment of a planning mission to formulate the terms of reference (TOR) for the PDNA if required; and 4. Agreement on the support that government and partners will provide to the process. The TOR provides the framework for the assessment including duration of the assessment, geographical areas, and sectors to be covered, data to be collected, field visits to be conducted, teams to be deployed and reports to be prepared. Depending on the agreement reached, PDNA partners may assist the government with financial and technical support, including the recruitment of international and national experts in the relevant sectors from international and national rosters. B. Organize the assessment process The PDNA process consists of an organized sequence of activities. These steps can be followed when other assessment processes are used as well. \u2022 Establish the assessment team, including a steering committee, a coordination team, and sector teams; \u2022 Conduct training on the assessment methodology; \u2022 Collect and validate data; \u2022 Draft sector reports using standardized format; \u2022 Consolidate and analyse sector effects, impact, and needs; \u2022 Formulate the Recovery Strategy; and \u2022 Define the resource mobilization and implementation approach. Government officials should oversee the assessment in all sectors. Relevant national and international stakeholders should participate in all sectors, for both the assessment process and development of the Recovery Strategy. Stakeholders include: \u2022 Government representatives from relevant line ministries; \u2022 Local authorities; \u2022 The affected population, civil society, and local NGOs; \u2022 International actors, including INGOs and donors expecting to be involved in recovery; and \u2022 Private sector representatives. Donor engagement in the PDNA brings international experience to the assessment and helps donors better understand recovery needs.

ASEAN CASE STUDY, CAMBODIA: 2013 Post-Flood Early Recovery Needs Assessment Successive typhoons, a significant rise in the level of the Mekong River, trans-boundary flash floods in the western provinces and heavier-than-average monsoon rains between May and October 2013 caused severe flooding in Cambodia. The floods killed 168 people and affected 1.8 million people spread across 20 of the country\u2019s 24 provinces. A post disaster assessment to determine the damage, loss and needs were undertaken by development partners covering economic, social and infrastructure sectors. The Post-Flood Early Recovery Needs Assessment (PFERNA) report estimated total damage at US$-153.28 million and loss at US$202.94 million.68 It was estimated that the GDP would shrink by 7.0 per cent down from the pre-flood projection of 7.6 per cent, which was largely caused by shrinking agriculture production. The recovery and reconstruction needs for each sector were identified. The total needs were US$306.28 million, which included US$118.41 million for short (3-6 months) needs, US$89.56 million and US$98.32 million for medium (6-18 months) and long-term (beyond 18 months) needs respectively. The report was shared widely among the government institutions and development partners and mobilised about US$200 million from donors in grants and loans to finance recovery and reconstruction projects.69 The report identified strengthening of disaster risk management systems as one of the priorities. The Disaster Management Law was enacted in March 2015. The assessment process was cost effective as stakeholders pooled their resources and expertise. For instance, UNDP provided resources for field assessment and meetings, sector experts from line agencies were deployed by participating agencies without any fee and the government covered the cost of publication and dissemination of the report. This process also helped in building capacities of the national and sub-national agencies on post disaster assessments and identified several areas of improvement in assessment as well as disaster risk management systems in Cambodia. 68 Post-flood early recovery need assessment report, 2014. http://www.kh.undp.org/content/dam/cambodia/docs/PovRed/Cambodia%20post- flood%20recovery%20need%20assessment%20report.pdf 69 ibid 48 Replantation paddy in the aftermath of floods (86-69) acres in Mine Tone Township, Shan State, Myanmar 49 4 . RESOURCE MOBILISATION AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT FOR RECOVERY In the Recovery Framework, the recovery financing component addresses mechanisms for mobilising, spending and reporting on the use of recovery funds. It also includes the policies that assign roles and responsibilities for finance-related tasks and governs the implementation of the financial aspects of the recovery programme. This chapter on resource mobilisation and financial management of recovery addresses the following key questions: \u00a7\ufffd What are the sources of funding available for recovery? \u00a7\ufffd What are the recovery programmes financed by the government finance and how will the funds be delivered? \u00a7\ufffd What kind of financial systems will be used to fund recovery? \u00a7\ufffd What information is needed to plan, control, and report on recovery expenditures? \u00a7\ufffd How will \u201coff-budget\u201d financing, such as that contributed by NGOs or the private sector, be directed, tracked, and reported? The responsibility for issues related to recovery finance rests with several agencies, especially: the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning, Government Treasury Office, local governments, NDMOs, donors, and the private sector including banks and insurance providers. 4.1 . Define the Recovery Financing Approach A. Prepare recovery financial policies Each disaster\u2019s financial strategy is unique, but the options for financing disaster recovery is predictable.

Maximize public funding sources Funding sources for recovery can be categorized as internal (government\u2019s own budget, contingency funds, and insurance proceeds) or external (donor or NGO assistance or international financial institution (IFI) loans). External funding can be on-budget (IFI loans and some donors) or off-budget (NGO assistance and other donors), as shown in Table 9. 50 Table 9: Sources of Recovery Financing by Category Source of funding Category PUBLIC FUNDS Internal resources Government operational and capital budgets On budget Insurance proceeds (public assets) On budget Special levies or taxes On budget Government contingency funds On budget Contingency financing arrangements On budget External resources IFI loans On budget Bilateral donor emergency and recovery assistance On or off budget Multi-donor trust funds Generally, on budget International and national NGO emergency and recovery assistance Off budget Regional funding sources On or off budget Private Funds Private companies\u2019 reserves and loans Household savings and loans Insurance proceeds (private assets) Remittances Private gifts The principal sources of government recovery funding in the ASEAN Member States are government budgets and contingency funds. However, these sources are also tapped for emergency relief and may be insufficient to cover recovery needs. Table 10 describes key public funding sources used to finance recovery, associated implementation issues, and examples of ASEAN Member States using these sources of funding. 51 Table 10: key Public Funding Sources, Implementation Issues, and Examples Funding Source Explanation Examples Contingency funds Internal reserves and contingency budget lines provide the government (and local government) with flexibility in the event of a disaster. At least three ASEAN countries have budget laws that require a percentage of national and local budgets to be reserved for DRR, emergency, and/or recovery purposes. Contingency funds are rarely adequate to cover significant recovery needs, especially in municipal government. New revenue sources are needed to build these funds. Philippines Myanmar Indonesia Contingent financing arrangements Contingent financing gives governments rapid and low- cost access to loan funds for disaster relief, recovery, and reconstruction. Contingent financing instruments include: Immediate Response Mechanism. Certain World Bank borrowers can set up an arrangement whereby in the event of an emergency they can access five per cent or US$ 5 million of the un-disbursed portfolio balance.70 Contingent Emergency Response Component: A project component financed by an investment loan from an international financial institution that allows rapid reprogramming of loan funds following a disaster. Sometimes called \u201czero component.\u201d Contingent credit facility: A free-standing line of credit deployed after a specific event (e.g. an emergency declaration), such as the Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT DDO) offered by the World Bank associated with a development policy loan.71 The Philippines government signed a US$500 million CAT DDO loan in 2011 and tapped it following both Tropical Storm Sendong (Washi) and Tropical Storm Yolanda (Haiyan).72 Myanmar\u2019s National Electrification Project, financed by the World Bank in 2015, includes a Contingent Emergency Response Component.73 Donor emergency funding (bilateral or NGO funds) Funds raised from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), Flash Appeals, or other resource mobilization activities organized by the IASC are meant principally for humanitarian response. Governments can request that funds are spent on early recovery and work to minimize duplication between international and national emergency funding, leaving more local funding for recovery. The humanitarian appeal for the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan requested US$776 million of which US$469.1 million was funded.74 Donor recovery funding (bilateral or NGO funds) Donor funding commitments for recovery are made during Donor Pledging Conferences or through direct communication with donors. Because donor recovery funds are often reprogrammed from existing development programmes, governments should require that recovery activities support long-term development objectives. In the pledging conference held following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, donors pledged more than US$3 billion. 70 World Bank, 2015, Investment Project Financing--IDA Immediate Response Mechanism Guidance Note. http://siteresources.worldbank.org/ PROJECTS/Resources/40940-1365611011935/Guidance_Note_IRM.pdf 71 World Bank, [no date], Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option: Product Note. http://treasury.worldbank.org/documents/ CatDDOProductNote_2015.pdf 72 World Bank, 2011, Disaster Risk Management Development Loan with a CAT DDO.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7172c378-9156-4297-9043-96ff68d92674": {"__data__": {"id_": "7172c378-9156-4297-9043-96ff68d92674", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e72777d6092c2c474d00db3d62d23b0fde99994f2e9f00626e70629b0bf029a"}, "2": {"node_id": "fd8ab9da-023c-400e-80a3-717202fc9fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e5cf03fd81f1fdbeb4172096aed4b2a620703bbea856f0962b61e42ee8186a4"}}, "hash": "0cca595bd77418d1cb51b088ebde38b4c5b9968eb52566bdf6f8de6009d87eeb", "text": "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P125943/disaster- risk-management-policy-loan-cat-ddo?lang=en 73 World Bank, 2015, National Electrification Project. http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P152936?lang=en 74 Financial Tracking Service, PHILIPPINES: Typhoon Haiyan - November 2013. https://fts.unocha.org/pageloader.aspx?page=emerg- emergencyDetails&appealID=1043 52 Funding Source Explanation Examples Multi-donor Trust Funds Multi-donor trust funds (MDTFs) are vehicles for programming, channelling, and/or tracking donor recovery resources.

UN Development Group administers MDTFs for governments. Sample legal documents are found on their website.75 The Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias operated from 2005 to 2012 and financed recovery of communities, housing, infrastructure, economic development, environmental improvements, and capacity building following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and 2005 Nias earthquake.76 In 2010, Indonesia established the Indonesia Multi-Partner Fund Facility for Disaster Recovery, a standing mechanism to fund Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Action Plans that require international assistance.77 Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund (ADRF)78 The APDRF was established by the Asian Development Bank to provide up to US$3 million of quick-disbursing grant funds to restore life-saving services and augment other aid flows. APDRF grants can be used to procure goods, works, and services related to disaster response. Some permitted uses also accelerate early recovery, for example, transitional shelter, water purification and sanitation systems, and debris management. Following Typhoons Nesat and Nalgae in Cambodia in 2011, APDRF funds were used for seed, to rapidly replant destroyed rice fields, temporary repair of irrigation canals, and food- and cash-for-work schemes to repair rural roads. Funding sources that government can control directly, such as its own budget, are preferable to resources that other agencies programme and spend. However, international agencies and NGO funding can be significant and should be considered part of the overall recovery financing plan. A point to note is that external funders may not clearly distinguish between emergency and recovery funding. Shortening the emergency period may allow more funds to be dedicated to early recovery and recovery activities. Recovery funding from both internal and external sources often comes from reprogramming funds previously committed to other purposes, especially to development projects, demonstrating how disasters can have a negative effect on national development plans. B. Expand market-based financing arrangements Disasters not only put financing demands on governments, to cover reconstruction costs, but they may also simultaneously reduce government tax revenues. Some countries are reducing exposure to these fiscal shocks using mechanisms that transfer risk to the market. After most disasters, more financing for recovery comes from private sources than from the government, especially if households are considered. It is in the government\u2019s interest that the private sector and households also have access to market-based mechanisms and risk management tools. Some examples are described in Table 11. 75 UNDG, Multi Donor Trust Funds, https://undg.org/home/guidance-policies/joint-funding-approaches/multi-donor-trust-funds/. 76 Multi Donor Fund, 2012, Sustainable Futures: A Legacy of Reconstruction (Multi Donor Fund, Final Report, Volume 1). http://www.multidonorfund.org/doc/pdf/MDF_report_vol_01_ENG.pdf 77 Government of Indonesia, 2010, The Indonesian Multi Donor Fund Facility for Disaster Recovery (IMDFF-DR) Operation Manual. http://mdtf.undp.org/document/download/5910 78 Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund (APDRF) web site: http://www.adb.org/site/funds/funds/asia-pacific-disaster-response-fund-apdrf 53 Table 11: Market-Based Risk Management Tools Market mechanism Explanation Examples Catastrophe bonds Cat bonds create securities that raise funds and transfer certain catastrophe risks to capital market investors.79 If a qualifying event occurs, investors lose their principal, and the issuer receives those funds to cover their losses. Triggers can be actual losses (indemnity), cumulative losses hitting a certain total (industry loss trigger), or actual catastrophe conditions (parametric index trigger). A catastrophe bond can cover a single loss event or multiple events (\u201cmulti-cat\u201d) over a risk period. Governments can issue cat bonds to have the resources for post disaster assistance, as an alternative (or in addition) to individual homeowners buying their own insurance.80 The government of the Philippines is preparing to enter the cat bond market with the assistance of the World Bank. Weather derivatives These are financial instruments used to reduce the risks associated with adverse weather conditions such as rainfall, snowfall, or temperature.81 The derivative lets buyers smooth their earnings over a period of adverse weather which would usually have affected them financially.82 A broader category of disaster risk management derivatives includes geological and meteorological events.83 Farmers, governments, or companies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "223b7826-e8d3-48aa-afaa-28e9f9554297": {"__data__": {"id_": "223b7826-e8d3-48aa-afaa-28e9f9554297", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a76a058d87f275a08c95cd3539fc6722a3eed9367a4dc39de6bc6d9a2b43fb28"}, "2": {"node_id": "a4ed846f-cc9b-47b0-bf25-f9f639d86144", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "25118e2f71be4ceacb355e09b6bcc965259fe0a6567974c9a9162eec82246250"}}, "hash": "4bf1fd4d7d0272304522a19dcb8caa1c6ac0b5406f1ea167b6a98ae96ebe2051", "text": "Property catastrophe insurance (PCI) PCI protects homeowners and businesses against losses arising from property damage.

Also see: http://www.tcip.gov.tr 54 Market mechanism Explanation Examples Index-Based Agricultural Insurance (I-BAI) I-BAI coverage is based on an index correlated with crop losses, such as wind speed or rainfall (weather-based indices) or average yield losses over a region (area yield indices).85 Buyers (usually farmers and rural financial institutions) receive payouts when the index falls above or below a specific threshold. Index insurance protects farmers\u2019 livelihoods when there is a large-scale or regional risk (in the case of area yield insurance), or a well- defined climate risk (in the case of weather- based index insurance).86 The Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation launched the Weather Index-Based Crop Insurance (WIBCI) programme in Western Visayas in 2013, which pays out for extreme rainfall. Farmers receive payments if the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical & Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) rules that rainfall exceeds or falls under average levels by a certain amount. The insurance premium is tied to farmland value.87 micro insurance Insurance services for low-income clients without access to mainstream insurance services. It can protect low-income households and microenterprises against risks such as an accident, illness, and natural disasters in exchange for premiums proportional to the likelihood and cost of the relevant risk. Micro insurance is offered by commercial insurers, mutual funds, microfinance institutions, NGOs, governments or semi- public bodies, but in some countries has had mixed success in terms of financial sustainability.88 In Thailand, five commercial insurers began selling micro insurance in 2013 through Counter Service, the payment service at Seven-Eleven stores. Micro insurance is regulated by the Office of the Insurance Commission.89 In the Philippines, many insurers offer a variety of micro insurance products. CARD Pioneer, which serves five million low-income customers, was processing claims in Tacloban the day after TS Yolanda struck.90 Regulations for micro insurance were issued in 2010.91 C. Create National Disaster Funds to finance recovery It is proposed to establish a National Disaster Fund (NDF) in the ASEAN Member States to finance post disaster recovery and reconstruction programmes. 92 The National Disaster Fund (NDF) would: (i) Conduct transparent and efficient damage assessments of public assets; (ii) Mobilise immediate funding post disaster; and (iii) Execute the funds in close collaboration with relevant line ministries and public agencies. The NDF would be established under both the Ministry of Finance and the National Disaster Management Office, and could include the following windows: \u00a7\ufffdAn Emergency Fund designed to respond to the immediate needs of a population affected by a natural disaster, hence supporting the NDMO. \u00a7\ufffdA programme for reconstruction, providing financial support to rehabilitate and reconstruct physical assets. The programme would focus on the reconstruction of public infrastructure and low-income housing. \u00a7\ufffdAn NDF Trust, providing resources for post disaster recovery and reconstruction activities

Ocean tsunami was able to mobilise and manage resources to undertake recovery on an unprecedented scale. External aid to the country was massive, with 130 countries providing assistance. There were many reasons for such large scale funding. The world had not faced a disaster of such mammoth scale, so the tsunami recovery was not in competition for aid with other disaster recovery programmes;.The tsunami killed people in 14 countries from 40 different nationalities, which further connected the people across the world; the internet and media coverage was widespread and in real time making it the most reported disaster to date. The aid architecture was propitiously conducive to a government-driven reconstruction programme and the creation of BRR, a dedicated agency for recovery and reconstruction which enhanced the confidence level among donors. To manage resources, a number of funding channels were used. These included the government treasury where funds were channelled through the government budget by signing a grant or loan agreement (World Bank and ADB used this modality); on budget/off treasury where donors disbursed funds to government accounts for further channelling to implementing agencies (used by Governments of Japan and Germany); and the off budget/ off treasury for directly funding on the ground implementation (used by UN agencies, NGOs and the private sector). A rigorous system for financial accountability was followed that helped to gain donor confidence and mobilise resources for recovery. BRR was responsible for financial reporting of all on-budget expenditures while for off-budget projects; it relied on partners\u2019 own accountability mechanisms to report on their financial achievements. BRR submitted periodic Financial Reports to the Audit Agency, and the agency accordingly issued an opinion on each of those reports. The 2007 Statement of Accountability received an unqualified opinion from the Indonesia\u2019s supreme audit institution. The committed funds to resource mobilization were approximately 93 per cent of the pledged funds, an extremely high success rate for resource mobilization. After four years of recovery, more than 90 per cent of the rehabilitation and construction was complete and over 90 per cent of the pledged amount was utilized. D. Develop a Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance strategy Funding for recovery needs is often insufficient. Governments must develop comprehensive financial protection strategies for disasters that identify expected events, and determine which financing instruments are appropriate for various needs, from emergency response to long-term reconstruction. A Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI) strategy helps allocate risk, reduces costs and delays in mobilising funds following a disaster, and brings more certainty to the fundraising process.93 Ex-ante disaster risk management, including financial contingency planning in the form of a DRFI strategy, can ensure access to fast and cost-effective liquidity after a disaster.94 This can in turn speed up recovery and help maintain the country\u2019s long-term development. DRFI instruments range from property catastrophe insurance for homeowners and agricultural insurance for farmers and herders to sovereign-level contingent facilities such as the World Bank\u2019s loan with catastrophe deferred drawdown option (CAT DDO). The World Bank and UNISDR are assisting the ASEAN Member States in the area of disaster risk financing and insurance. DRFI has been identified as an area for exploration under the Prevention, and Mitigation component of the ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response (AADMER) Work Programme, for implementation in Phase 1. 93 World Bank Group. 2014.

The creation of the ASEAN Economic Community is expected to increase DRFI options, particularly with respect to regional insurance markets.

All agencies managing government finances should have a BCM or COO strategy in place because (amongst other reasons) the interruption of these operations could seriously undermine the financing of a national recovery effort. Guidance and formats for BCM and COO plans are available from various sources.98 B. Adapt financial management systems to recovery Public financial management (PFM) comprises all activities for managing a government\u2019s financial affairs, including: \u00a7\ufffdFinancial planning; \u00a7\ufffdBudget preparation and approval; \u00a7\ufffdMobilising and managing cash (treasury); \u00a7\ufffdAccounting; \u00a7\ufffdFinancial reporting; \u00a7\ufffdProcurement; and \u00a7\ufffdAuditing. Reconstruction and recovery add demands on financial management systems due to time pressure, an expanded flow of financial transactions, and the need for closer tracking and more rapid reporting. Some aspects to consider are: 57 \u00a7 Financial management practices: Financial agencies must decide whether any normal PFM policies and procedures should be modified to accommodate the demands of recovery. \u00a7 Financial functions: Special financial management functions may be required, such as tracking donor commitments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e45fb44e-e843-43df-af9f-ca706b3f7283": {"__data__": {"id_": "e45fb44e-e843-43df-af9f-ca706b3f7283", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03e4685790601a0702997773509462b5bacb37d66cb786b053717de2c531b34f"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f5391c1-7e8d-4001-ae51-096f72d9e777", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3198e1c648552ccc5306ba17fe95ad4045c96cc3633fdd18ef8687ebc69761d"}}, "hash": "84903c239b1ab7d98efe69d36decb640f4f333459efdfe331d77e68ba1021496", "text": "\u00a7 Financial functions: Special financial management functions may be required, such as tracking donor commitments.

A number of public financial management challenges encountered in recovery are shown in Table 12, along with potential solutions. Procedures and systems for post disaster PFM can be designed, approved, and developed before a disaster. This overcomes the challenge of doing so while launching a recovery programme. C. Put fiscal transfer mechanisms and controls in place Agencies and individuals carrying out recovery activities funded by the government need prompt and convenient access to their funds. Finance officials must determine how to channel funds to and ensure control by implementing agencies. The primary concerns to resolve include: \u00a7 Transfer of funds (disbursing in a form useful to the implementer) \u00a7 Control of funds (ensuring the funds are used for the intended purposes and costs controlled) \u00a7 Documenting the use of funds (presenting invoices or other evidence of how funds were used) \u00a7 Channelling funds", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d13cedd3-4107-441e-ad2f-ae802b7a9b76": {"__data__": {"id_": "d13cedd3-4107-441e-ad2f-ae802b7a9b76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "677a90bad6c7909675265c397f31e59157f4355dcdcfe3213a34b728ab0890c8"}}, "hash": "677a90bad6c7909675265c397f31e59157f4355dcdcfe3213a34b728ab0890c8", "text": "to local governments Local governments\u2019 recovery activities often rely on central government financing, especially for large-scale disaster events. Control and conflicts of interest are the most common concerns for local government management of recovery funds. 58 The fiscal decentralization system should be designed to handle extraordinary funding transfers, but that is not always the case. Regulations meant to ensure transparency in normal times can turn into implementation bottlenecks after a disaster. How fiscal transfers will be disbursed and controlled should be addressed when adapting the PFM system to response and recovery. Other short-term solutions include: \u00a7 Using on-site auditors to address control issues; \u00a7 Disbursing through a trust fund or administrative agent to improve control and reduce political influence; \u00a7 Arranging for financial institutions to manage cash transfers to local governments or their contractors; \u00a7 Using mobile phones or debit cards to transfer cash and post disaster housing subsidies; \u00a7 Using existing social safety net programmes that provide cash transfers after a disaster (although this contingency must be designed into the programme since dispensing cash creates safety risks for all involved that must be resolved in advance); and \u00a7 Contracting with private financial institutions to channel cash transfers to community groups or individuals (a competitive selection process should be conducted in advance). Cash transfers are an increasingly popular way to provide assistance to households. Government cash transfers or vouchers require policies, legal and regulatory backing; a system to certify eligibility; and transfer modalities, all of which can be designed in advance. The principal risks with cash transfers are that they are used for unintended purposes (vouchers help to address this risk) and that ineligible households receive them. The popularity of cash transfers also means the government and donors may be duplicating efforts. Grievance redressal systems, careful design of transfer mechanisms, and tracking of donor activities can help mitigate these risks. All programmes that involve cash transfers must be designed with monitoring and audit mechanisms.100 4.4 Manage Finances during Implementation A. Reinforce financial management capacity Financial management of the Recovery Programme is a continuous, dynamic function. During implementation, numerous financial management functions must be urgently carried out, in particular: \u00a7\ufffd Tracking the receipt of pledges and mobilising additional funding; \u00a7\ufffd Monitoring the financial progress of implementation; \u00a7\ufffd Overseeing the transfer of funds to outside agencies and households; \u00a7\ufffdFinancial accounting, auditing, and timely reporting on the recovery programme within the government, to donors, and to civil society; and \u00a7\ufffd Budgeting and adjusting financial programming as funding sources or funding needs change. Recovery financial management can overload national and local government financial management staff if they are also carrying out normal financial management responsibilities. As a result, additional staff or other support may be required. Approving streamlined procedures for predictable activities, such as modifying the financial plan, also reduces the workload of financial staff. B. Understand macroeconomic and fiscal impacts The macroeconomic impact of the disaster may require specific interventions to support the country\u2019s fiscal balances and balance of payments since these can affect the feasibility of the recovery programme and other development plans. Impacts such as reduced economic activity, increased inflation and interest rates, and higher borrowing costs and reduced tax revenues for government are common. Increased demand for social services also commonly occurs. Each of these changes can affect the national fiscal condition and put pressure on the capital budget, current budget, or both. These may be short- or long- 100 Humanitarian Coalition Cash Transfer website: http://humanitariancoalition.ca/info-portal/factsheets/cash-transfer-programming 59 term effects; reduced capital spending immediately after the disaster will likely be reversed once the recovery gets underway. The effect of losing a major source of employment, however, can linger for years. Some impacts can be minimized using business continuity practices. For instance, banks should have emergency power, so that tax payments can be made and people have access to their savings. The macroeconomic and fiscal impacts of the disaster should be calculated as part of the post disaster needs assessment process. These are then taken into consideration in developing the Recovery Framework. 4.5 Promote Aid Effectiveness When external assistance makes a significant contribution to the recovery financing plan, a structure is needed for coordination with external agencies, along with rules on the use of funds and procedures for tracking progress. For instance, external agencies should be required to: \u00a7\ufffdCoordinate funding appeals with the government: The government should be fully informed of the purposes and timing of humanitarian appeals carried out on its behalf; \u00a7\ufffdReport on progress with fundraising and changes in scope: The government must be informed of the progress being made on externally funded projects.

Production in the transport machinery sector reduced by 84 per cent and in the information and communication sector by 73 per cent compared to the previous year. Approximately 90 per cent of the damage and loss were borne by the private sector.103 The Thailand Board of Investment undertook several medium to long- term measures to support the recovery of flood affected industries. These included tax exemption incentives as well as non-tax incentives to help affected companies or entrepreneurs restart their businesses, prevent them from relocating or help with temporary relocation and invest in risk reduction measures. These measures helped to boost investor confidence and built resilience for swift economic recovery. A survey by the Ministry of Industry in February 2012 found that approximately 50 per cent of 862 companies in seven flooded industrial estates restarted their operations. A 2014 report found that more than 80 per cent of Japanese-related companies in Thailand were back in business in the seven industrial parks. 61 5 . IMPLEMENTATION, COORDINATION, COMMUNICATIONS AND MONITORING FOR RECOVERY Recovery is evaluated based on a number of variables. These include timeliness, transparency, efficiency, and equity. Delivering on these expectations requires an effective implementation strategy. Such a strategy requires capacities, communications and information management and monitoring and evaluation. This chapter on implementation, coordination, communications, and monitoring respond to the following key questions: \u00a7 What are the capacities required for implementation? \u00a7 How can community participation and self- recovery be encouraged? \u00a7 What are the elements of a communications and information management strategy? \u00a7 How can a monitoring system be established? \u00a7 How can transparency in recovery operations be ensured? \u00a7 How should recovery activities be evaluated? Systems and protocols for monitoring, communications, feedback, and transparency should be designed in advance, so that they are readily deployable should a disaster strike. This starts with the systems used in non-disaster times, such as for monitoring of development projects. In some cases, new systems or protocols are required. 5.1 Implement Recovery The chapter on institutional frameworks highlighted the need to define the roles, responsibilities, and functions of agencies and staff in recovery. For implementing recovery activities, it is important that staff have the knowledge, capacities and expertise to implement the recovery programme. By seconding staff who have worked on recovery projects across sectors and partnering with agencies that have experience of implementing recovery projects, recovery initiatives can be successfully implemented. In addition, standard operating procedures (SOPs), manuals and guides on recovery project operations can help with implementing recovery projects.

Channel the self-recovery impulse and mobilise community participation Active participation of the affected community through community-based organisations and local agencies is desirable especially during the planning and implementation of the recovery programme. This helps to identify the communities\u2019 capacities and needs and ensure that the Recovery Programme is benefitting the affected people. Participation of this kind has practical and psycho-social benefits; it accelerates recovery and educates the population about risk and good recovery practices, while creating solidarity and giving people back a sense of control over their lives. Self-recovery is the driving force behind most recovery activities at the household level. It entails households raising or borrowing funds for their housing and livelihoods recovery, and working on their own or with friends and family to accomplish it. Self- recovery helps to speed up the recovery of affected communities, especially in the event of large-scale disasters. The relative contribution of self-recovery is often underestimated when compared to a large, organized recovery programme. However, self-recovery can also increase risk, especially when households receive no financial or technical assistance and reproduce the unsafe conditions that led to the disaster, or do not work collectively when a common solution is required. It is therefore extremely important that the governments provide financial and technical assistance to the affected communities, or empower municipalities or NGOs to do so, for safer and risk reducing results. Many recovery partners and some governments are experienced in participatory methods, such as owner-driven reconstruction. See case study on Indonesia\u2019s REkOMPAk programme below. However, not all households can recover on their own or participate in organized recovery activities. The government should prioritize addressing the needs of the most vulnerable and marginalized groups and ensure that there is no discrimination based on gender, age, ethnicity, disability, sexual identity, etc., with regard to service delivery. Community volunteers can play an important role in identifying vulnerable families that should be given priority, the precise support required by each household, or supplying labour or other in-kind assistance to these households. ASEAN CASE STUDY, INDONESIA: THE SUCCESS OF THE COMMUNITY DRIvEN HOUSING RECOvERY Between 2004 and 2006, Indonesia was affected by multiple disasters. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami killed 127,720 people and left 93,258 missing. The tsunami destroyed 139,165 houses and severely affected sectors such as education, livelihoods, and health.105 On 27 May 2006, a shallow earthquake of 6.3 magnitude hit the city of Yogyakarta, Central Java and led to the death of over 5,700 people and destroyed 350,000 houses. Two months later in July 2006, a massive tsunami struck West Java and killed approximately 1,000 people and displaced 50,000 others.106 With the need to recover from the number of disasters occurring in the span of just two years, the Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias (MDF) and the Java Reconstruction Fund (JRF) were set up. Under these funds, Indonesia pioneered Rekompak, a community-based approach for large- scale reconstruction of homes and community infrastructure. In Bahasa, Rekompak means \u2018reunion,\u2019 conveying the desire to increase cohesiveness and become solid again. In Aceh and Java, communities needing assistance to rebuild houses were identified through government- led assessments. The specific beneficiaries within these communities were identified through a community consultation process, based on a clear set of criteria 105 BRR, Housing.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56157731-3d90-4f02-acf3-b0faa23996e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "56157731-3d90-4f02-acf3-b0faa23996e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9092ea4dfdaf09f2122f0402cad53aec18d1d35cd8649b6c81093ee85f2f4849"}, "2": {"node_id": "613f11a9-5208-4c12-8215-957838aefcfa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "703bff0d2a3068d60da479846744eb88e6de4c8f3eb14b4e53ea617abe958fd4"}}, "hash": "2d5234420339c457ffa7db80496ef428e993c9170177b8fca4fa9e1217d91ef9", "text": "Roofing the pillars of hope, ISBN 978-602-8199-53-7, Indonesia, p.

Together with its household members, the committee made investment decisions, procured materials, controlled funds, assisted with construction, supervised accounts for funds expended and reported on progress. Each committee reported to the village trustees. Through a participatory process, Community Settlement Plans were developed to guide how physical rebuilding would take place. Systems and procedures for operation and maintenance were also established. The Community Settlement Plans were submitted for approval to village trustees and also to the Project Management Unit (PMU). After approval, funding was provided, and construction began. The community was also provided technical assistance on seismic risk reduction so that new homes were built on safe ground. The Rekompak model resulted in a high level of houses reconstructed and occupied by the community. The primary reason was that the community themselves were involved, and so the houses were designed to suit their needs. There were additional positive benefits of this approach \u2013 a) the building material and manpower used was mostly locally procured or available which helped in regenerating the local economy, b) the involvement of the community empowered them as decision makers on issues that concerned them and c) the community had a greater awareness of the need for seismic features in their houses and risk reduction Engaging the community as a partner in recovery also contributed to the long-term development of the community. The World Bank has identified community driven housing recovery as one of the ten guiding principles of housing recovery.107 This model is highly replicable as community-driven housing recovery programmes in India (2001 Gujarat arthquake) and Nicaragua (1998 hurricane Mitch). 107 Strong, safe and resilient, 2013. http://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/9780821398050_CH07 5.3 Coordinate Recovery Recovery is characterized by interdependencies among many stakeholders, which makes coordination among stakeholders an imperative. Coordination mechanisms could be new, set up for a particular disaster; an existing mechanism repurposed for recovery coordination; or an effective mechanism from a past recovery programme reactivated. Coordination during recovery helps avoid duplication and bridges gaps. Regular information sharing helps keep partner interventions aligned with the overarching recovery vision and facilitates new partnerships and more coordinated implementation. It also provides a platform for sharing of lessons learnt. The government can establish coordination arrangements before-hand. This includes: terms of reference for the coordination team, meeting and reporting protocols, decision-making quorums, information management tools, etc. Coordination may happen through regular physical or virtual meetings that are followed up with clear communication of the next steps and actions. A. Agree on coordination arrangements The Lead Recovery Agency is also responsible for coordination. A description of the mechanisms to be used for coordination with partners should be included in the Recovery Framework. Coordination arrangements may evolve as recovery progresses. 64 Non-government partners should be expected to participate in coordination mechanisms and share information on their recovery activities. The ASEAN Member States use different models for recovery coordination at both national and local levels, some of which are described here. Early Recovery cluster The early recovery cluster is a standing inter-agency mechanism led by UNDP and includes 21 UN and non-UN agencies.108 The cluster operates alongside other humanitarian clusters with the aim of augmenting humanitarian assistance, supporting recovery initiatives and laying the foundations for long-term recovery. At the country level, the early recovery cluster supports or partners with the government and recovery stakeholders to coordinate early recovery activities. Government established clusters The Philippines has used a government-led cluster model, including after Tropical Cyclone Yolanda. Response Clusters, which operated during the crisis period, were reorganized into Rehabilitation and Recovery (R&R) clusters after approximately one year. Each cluster is led by two government agencies. The R&R clusters include social services, infrastructure, livelihoods, resettlement and housing, and are aided by the cluster support unit. Clusters also operate at the local and regional level, led by local officials, with the participation of local representatives of national government agencies and partner agencies.109 Permanent disaster risk management (DRM) committees Viet Nam and Indonesia are among the countries that have created joint government/partner DRM committees that operate on a permanent basis. The DRM committees work on a range of DRM issues in non-disaster times and provide relief and recovery coordination when recovery is underway. The Viet Nam committee is called the Disaster Management Working Group.110 Sector coordination platforms Development coordination mechanisms such as sector tables are found in some lower-income countries where there are numerous external agencies involved in a sector. Used principally to coordinate agency interventions in the sector with the government, they can also be used for coordination of reconstruction", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b95231e6-113f-4141-9e49-70489acdacce": {"__data__": {"id_": "b95231e6-113f-4141-9e49-70489acdacce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da0711157f0f25dab94e3c55bab8c529a2cb4f7166175aa02af4c5a877bb7385"}, "3": {"node_id": "34508af1-a8ac-4460-9a46-b1b00e40c713", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "640b109db8a52912023b7ab8118e41e44a3dc68dafd99b78cd7fc8f72bec794e"}}, "hash": "510fb866d8c615e5ee7d3041b3de097e9b1dd4defabb13e28b78fbf971dfaae7", "text": "activities.

ASEAN CASE STUDY, MYANMAR: COORDINATION MECHANISM FOR RESPONSE AND RECOvERY FOR 2008 CYCLONE NARGIS In May 2008, Myanmar was hit by Cyclone Nargis, the worst natural disaster in the history of the country and the most devastating to strike Asia since 1991. The cyclone severely affected 2.4 million people. It led to the death of 84,537 people, 53,836 others went missing, and 19,359 were injured. Myanmar suffered a total damage and loss of US$4.1 billion.111 The disaster required an urgent need for external assistance including humanitarian staff and a coordination mechanism for response and recovery. The ASEAN Secretary-General urged all Member States to provide urgent relief assistance through the framework of the AADMER.112 The ASEAN Emergency Rapid Assessment Team was deployed for 10 days and submitted its report to the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting. At the meeting, it was decided that an ASEAN-led coordinating mechanism would be established to \u2018facilitate the effective distribution and utilization of assistance from the international community.\u2019 65 A two-tiered structure, to facilitate day-to-day operations was set up consisting of a diplomatic body, the ASEAN Humanitarian Task Force (AHTF), and a Yangon-based Tripartite Core Group (TCG). The Yangon-based TCG was set up to oversee the coordination of resources, operations, monitoring, and reporting. It comprised of three ASEAN members; three from the Government of Myanmar; and three from the United Nations. The TCG mechanism for humanitarian response was adjusted to coordinate the recovery. The three working groups under the recovery structure included basic services, livelihood and physical and social protection, which were identified in the Post-Nargis Recovery and Preparedness Plan (PONREPP).113 The TCG provided a unique platform for the government, the ASEAN Secretariat and the UN to work together. The mechanism helped to put in place a transparent aid mechanism, facilitate an effective needs assessment and establish follow-up recovery plans114 that helped in resource mobilization. It provided momentum to the application of AADMER and valuable experience to the ASEAN Secretariat for coordinating disasters of such a scale. It set a precedent for possible future use in other member states.115 The TCG-led recovery mechanism embedded the \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d principle in recovery planning and monitoring. The Periodic Review process included disaster risk reduction (DRR), giving impetus to a number of risk reduction initiatives in Myanmar. For example, the Disaster Risk Reduction Working Group constituted to support the Cyclone Nargis recovery plan, continued beyond the recovery process to support the Government of Myanmar on integrating DRR into policies and programmes. B. Formalise involvement of NGOs The role of NGOs in recovery has been highlighted in Table 12. It is useful for governments to formalise arrangements with NGOs so that their involvement in recovery is streamlined, coordinated and aligned with the recovery outcomes.

For instance, Indonesia requires NGOs intending to participate in DRM activities including recovery to submit a proposal and a work plan, and to sign an MOU.117 Contracting NGOs A legal framework must be in place to allow NGO contracting. Governments also contract the services of NGOs and CSOs as a way to reduce direct implementation by the government. INGOs have long contracted local NGOs to assist in project implementation, and contracted neighbourhood groups through the use of \u201ccommunity contracts.\u201d118 This is because local NGOs now have more experience with disaster recovery in many countries, and their execution capacity has grown. For instance, in the Philippines, under the Government Procurement Reform Act, NGO contracting (Section 53.11) and community contracting (Section 53.12) have been allowed since the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations were approved in 2009. The Philippines government has also issued implementation guidelines for NGO procurement and guidelines and a procurement manual for community procurement. Recently, Guidelines for Civil Society Organisations acting as Implementing Entities of Public Funds were also released. C. Engage the private sector The recovery of society as a whole depends on the recovery of private enterprises, which include banking, transport, engineering, and construction companies. The private sector is a supplier of goods and services for the government. The private sector also comprises small and micro enterprises that produce critical services and employment for people at all income levels. Depending on the context, the most likely private sector partners that will participate in planning and implementation are individual firms; associations and alliances of firms; industry representatives; and chambers of commerce. The private sector can help governments improve public sector recovery, and also help governments address the recovery needs of the private sector. They can contribute sector experts for assessments and recovery planning, particularly related to commerce, industry, housing, trade, etc. In addition, private firms may have goods, services, and skills to contribute to the recovery effort that should be considered in planning recovery. A number of national and regional initiatives are underway to strengthen private sector involvement in disaster response and recovery, as highlighted in Box 6. Private sector actors will have limited time to engage in recovery planning unless their function is clearly defined and has been discussed in advance. Governments should support private sector initiatives to participate in disaster recovery. Protocols for private sector participation should ideally be negotiated in advance.119 117 National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), \u201cGovernment Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 23 of 2008 Concerning Participation of International Institutions and Foreign Non-Governmental Organisations in Disaster Management.\u201d 118 Asian Development Bank, 2010, Rebuilding Lives and Homes in Aceh and Nia\u2019s, Indonesia. http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/27996/ rebuilding-aceh-nias.pdf 119 Business continuity planning, which the private sector uses to plan recovery, is explained in Special Focus: Encouraging Private Sector Readiness for Recovery, page 52. 67 5.4 Communications and Information Management The Recovery Programme should have a communications strategy. Most recovery programmes are criticised by the media, mainly due to the lack of information on recovery programmes shared with the public. The communications strategy should target all recovery stakeholders, especially donor agencies, the private sector, the affected population and the media. Training and sensitizing reporters about disaster recovery and providing accurate information about progress helps to improve the quality, quantity, and Box 6: Private Sector Involvement in DRR and Recovery The Disaster Resource Partnership, promoted by the World Economic Forum, is a new framework for engaging the engineering and construction industry in disaster relief, recovery, and prevention.

Having information about the progress of recovery also allows families to make plans and take action on behalf of their self- recovery. Therefore, communication should also be considered as a tool for feedback that can be used to fine-tune the recovery programme. A. Conduct a communications assessment The communication strategy requires that the government knows its stakeholders. Before developing a communication strategy, it is best to conduct a quick communications assessment, as described in Table 13.120 120 Based on Chapter 3, \u201cCommunications in Post disaster Reconstruction,\u201d from Abhas K. Jha, et al, 2010, Safer Homes, Stronger Communities: A Handbook for Reconstructing after Natural Disasters, The World Bank, Washington, DC. http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/ en/2010/01/11702495/safe-homes-stronger-communities-handbook-reconstruction-after-natural-disaster 68 Table 13: Elements of a Post disaster Communications Assessment Area to analyse Focus of analysis Purpose of Communications Strategy Political risks, challenges, and opportunities Understand perceptions of the government\u2019s disaster response and plans, and of how the government and other service providers have performed since the disaster Use to adjust recovery activities and to develop communication messages Stakeholder analysis31 Identify and analyse stakeholders who will be directly and indirectly affected by the reconstruction programme Need to target communications and design feedback mechanisms Media, communications channels, and local capacity Understand how groups communicate formally with one another, and the local capability and acceptability of media institutions Information that helps with selection of media channels and formats Social and participatory communication Identify informal systems and community communications practices Identifies alternative channels for communications and feedback, especially for lower-income communities B. Develop a communications strategy The communications strategy should use the findings of the communications assessment to identify the changes sought as a result of communications with stakeholders, which should be directly related to the goals and objectives of the Recovery Framework. Changes can be categorized as awareness, knowledge, attitudes, behaviours, mobilization, or collaboration. Understanding what needs to be communicated helps to design key content and messages and determine the most effective way to communicate them. Selecting the appropriate medium for communications, such as a campaign, electronic media, social media, SMS, etc. helps to reach a variety of stakeholders. The government may appoint an official to assist with communications with the media and others. 5.5 Monitoring Recovery Monitoring is the process by which stakeholders obtain regular feedback on the progress being made towards achieving goals and objectives. This means that monitoring is concerned with tracking not only projects and the use of resources; but also whether progress is being made towards accomplishing the 121 UNDP, 2009, Handbook on Planning, Monitoring and Evaluating for Development Results. http://web.undp.org/evaluation/guidance. shtml#handbook 122 Outcome indicators are the quantitative or qualitative variables that provide a simple and reliable means to measure achievement, to reflect the changes connected to an intervention, or to help assess the performance of an organisation against the stated outcome. Targets are the quantifiable levels of the indicators that a country, society, or organisation wants to achieve by a given time.

Develop indicators and targets Outcome indicators and targets need to be established in every aspect of the monitoring system.122 For recovery, this could include various levels of government, geographic areas down to the level of communities, and sectors and subsectors.

Design and implement the monitoring system Large-scale recovery programmes often include several recovery projects that need to be monitored. The activities of both government and NGO implementers should be monitored, although the data collection and reporting approaches may differ. Overall, the monitoring system may be quite complex, and combine information from various sources. A single agency is normally responsible for collecting, receiving, and analysing monitoring information and producing official reports. There are two options for recovery monitoring: create a new monitoring system for the recovery programme or modify an existing system (or systems) to serve this purpose. Designing, testing, and implementing a new system or major modifications to existing systems require significant time. An option to avoid delays is to contract a private provider for post disaster monitoring services.125 In such cases, appropriate private firms should be identified beforehand along with strict performance benchmarks and penalties. Procedures for collecting and submitting monitoring information should be established beforehand. Formats for data-input (hard copy or digital) and user instructions should be prepared. All those involved in using the monitoring system should be trained. 5.6 Evaluate Recovery Projects and Programmes Evaluation is a rigorous and independent assessment of completed or ongoing activities to determine whether they are achieving their stated objectives. Like monitoring, evaluations can be conducted for: the overall recovery programme, a policy, a strategy, a programme, a project, an activity, a sector, a locality, or an organisation. A. Understand evaluation basics Monitoring and evaluation both provide information that can help inform decisions, improve performance, and achieve planned results. The key distinction is that evaluations are independent, and provide an objective assessment of whether results are being achieved. Evaluations are also less frequent; more rigorous in their procedures, design, and methodology; 70 ASEAN CASE STUDY, MYANMAR: SOCIAL IMPACT MONITORING OF CYCLONE NARGIS RECOvERY AND RECONSTRUCTION Cyclone Nargis of May 2008 in Myanmar was the worst natural hazard-induced disaster in the living memory of the country. The Post-Nargis Joint Assessment (PONJA) released in July 2008 included preliminary social impacts of the disaster at the community level in two areas: the direct social impacts of the Cyclone Nargis and how the communities responded; and the long-run social impacts that external longer-term recovery responses to the cyclone may have. To track the social impact of the Cyclone Nargis over the course of the relief and recovery, the Government of Myanmar and development partners initiated Social Impact Monitoring (SIM), building on the initial assessment results of the PONJA. Four rounds of studies were conducted. This was a first of its kind initiative where the social impacts of a natural hazard-induced disaster were assessed periodically.

They covered 895 inhabitants in 40 villages in the eight townships across the Delta that were most affected by the Cyclone. The SIM studies provided information on aid effectiveness, needs, and insights into the human face of recovery. While roads and bridges take a few months or years to rebuild, human lives take a generation or two.127 The SIM process in itself was very significant as it highlighted the often neglected social impact of a disaster and led to the inclusion of qualitative social impact assessment into the post disaster assessment. As a result, it formed the basis for ongoing social impact monitoring. This social assessment was incorporated into the formal Post-Nargis Joint Assessment report enabling the SIM findings to be incorporated into formal appeals for assistance. It is said that the human dimension of disasters is what makes the news, but it is the rebuilding of bridges and roads that get the money.128 The qualitative methods used in the SIM were essential in focusing attention on the \u2018why\u2019 and \u2018how\u2019 of the aid effort, in understanding the processes and pathways of aid, and in identifying issues that would have been missed by quantitative methods alone. For example, in Myanmar, the SIM quickly identified that farmers and casual labourers had the issue of spiralling debt and high-interest rates. This finding led to a US$50 million budget allocation for credit in the post-Nargis recovery plan. 126 UNIC, Post Nargis Needs Assessment, 2013. http://yangon.sites.unicnetwork.org/files/2013/05/post-nargis_joint_assessment_all_pages.pdf 127 Dr. Kambon, Asha, Measuring the social impacts of a disaster: capacity needs and gaps, ADPC, Asian Disaster Management News, Volume 22, 2015, p. 24 128 Ibid, p. 24. 71 and involve more extensive analysis than monitoring. Evaluation types include the following:129 \u00a7\ufffdProcess evaluation - Analysis of how the programme operates. Focuses on problems in service delivery. \u00a7\ufffd Cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness evaluation - Assesses programme costs (monetary or non- monetary), in particular, their relation to alternative uses of the same resources and the benefits being produced by the programme. \u00a7\ufffd Impact evaluation - Determines whether the project or programme had the desired effects on individuals, households, and institutions and whether those effects are attributable to the intervention. Formally, an impact evaluation requires a control group whose situation can be compared to the group assisted by the recovery intervention. (Not always feasible in recovery programmes.) \u00a7\ufffd Assessments - Not formally part of an M&E system, assessments use available data and interviews to inform decision makers whether or not an ongoing recovery effort is likely to produce the desired outcomes and identify needed changes. Recovery projects and programmes are not always rigorously evaluated. Governments should consider joint evaluations of recovery programmes, especially when a number of donor agencies are present. A request from the government for joint evaluations could help overcome the two principal impediments to the evaluation of recovery programmes: lack of demand from the government and lack of resources since evaluation resources would be pooled. The United Nations has led the development of methodologies and tools for conducting joint evaluations, also referred to as joint humanitarian impact evaluations. Joint evaluations can vary in focus from individual projects to multilateral agency programmes, sector-wide programmes, co-financing arrangements, cross-cutting or thematic concerns.130 Box 7 The Tsunami Evaluation Coalition (TEC) was a successful joint independent learning and accountability initiative established immediately after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.131 TEC conducted five joint thematic evaluations, which formed the basis of the Synthesis Report. The TEC project led to the development of guidance on joint evaluations, and its website provides valuable material on recovery programming. B. Prepare an evaluation strategy The lack of demand for evaluations from beneficiary governments and the lack of resources to conduct evaluations are the main reasons so few recovery interventions are evaluated. An evaluation strategy should be included in the Recovery Framework. Resources should be earmarked to implement it. Conducting an impact evaluation of a large recovery programme is difficult, but process and cost- effectiveness evaluations can be carried out. Existing policies on the evaluation of public investment projects may be relevant for recovery projects in some countries.

The assistance provided by the ASEAN through the AHA Centre started with the issuance of situation reports and early warning, response and relief activities, which further built into recovery and rehabilitation. The measures were based on the recommendation of the ASEAN Secretary-General H.E. Le Luong Minh, following his visit to the affected areas. The AHA Centre was monitoring the direction of the typhoon and providing regular updates to the ASEAN Member States. On November 7th, the AHA Centre deployed the Emergency Response and Assessment Team (ERAT) and set up an emergency communication system. Given the likelihood of communication failure due to the impact of the typhoon, the AHA Centre trained the concerned office on the use of a satellite phone and Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN). 132 The AHA Centre played a key role in immediate response: some planes and naval ships were immediately deployed carrying essential relief supplies including medicines; mobile storage facilities, offices and field hospitals were quickly set up; medical personnel and rescue teams were deployed, and water purification tablets and cash assistance were distributed. These activities were coordinated through the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council/Office of Civil Defence in the Philippines. The AHA Centre\u2019s role continued during the recovery and rehabilitation phase, through the ASEAN Assistance for the Recovery of Yolanda- Affected Areas in the Philippines known as the ARYA Project. The project budget was over US$5 million and sourced from the ASEAN Development Fund. A key feature of the project was, focus on capacity building and technical assistance, which had multiple and long-term benefits. The project supported activities from early warning to the recovery phase, which helped in the rapid implementation of activities. The support under ARYA helped the targeted Local Government Units (LGUs) to develop their recovery and rehabilitation (R&R) plans, helping them access the Yolanda R&R fund from the national government.133 The development of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUPs) and the ecological profiling and assessment are a long-term investment towards disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. The ARYA project coordinated ASEAN Member States support to the Yolanda R&R and helped in mobilising resources from the Member States and development partners. It also helped in facilitating south-south cooperation as ASEAN Member States shared its R&R experience with the Philippines. 132 ASEAN, Second ARYA Project Steering Committee Meeting, PPT, Manila, 14th July 2015 133 Discussion with Senior Recovery Coordinator, ARYA Project on 8th September 2015 in Manila. C. Build capacity for impact evaluation Conducting an impact evaluation is the best way to understand what effect a recovery project has had on a region or population group. Impact evaluations are designed to answer the \u201ccounterfactual questions\u201d: Are the changes observed solely the result of the recovery intervention? What happened to people who were not assisted by the project or programme? If those who were not assisted had been assisted, what would have been the outcome? Impact evaluation requires comparing a group of households or individuals who were involved in the recovery intervention to a similar group that was not involved. 73 5.7 Establish high standards for Accountability and Transparency A. Make a government commitment to transparency and accountability Competition for funding, time pressure, inadequate oversight, and economic desperation in the population are all risk factors for corruption in recovery.

C. Provide systems for grievance redressal Grievance redressal systems handle conflicts and complaints arising from the implementation of the recovery programme and help maintain a focus on the needs of the beneficiary population. Some predictable reasons for complaints include exclusion of those who are qualified; inclusion of those who are not qualified or false claims and hardship. Complaint and grievance redressal mechanisms help to ensure transparency and fairness and reduce errors and manipulation in assistance programmes that have direct beneficiaries. Table 15 lists the essential elements of a grievance redressal programme. With recovery partners, the government can establish standards for complaint handling and grievance redressal for projects with direct beneficiaries. These standards should apply to both government programmes and those of recovery partners. Table 15: Elements of a Grievance Redressal System Element Purpose Announcement The right to complain must be explained in detail to beneficiaries. Procedures for receipt and processing of complaints must be transparent. Complaint intake Intake procedures must be clear. Appointments may be advisable. All complaints received must be registered, regardless of source. Complainants should receive a receipt, and ideally a copy of the written record. Location A safe place is provided to present complaints and to be interviewed, ideally away from where cash or vouchers are distributed. Complainants should not be allowed to congregate at this location. Inquiry and verification Each complaint should be verified within a given period, using local information and established procedures. A system for appeals may be necessary. Communicating decisions The complainant should be notified in writing as to whether the complaint has been accepted or denied.

The idea to build back better is logical and potentially effective as an organizing principle for a recovery programme. But to be effective, its implications for the recovery programme must be defined in practical terms and agreed to with stakeholders. A. What does it mean to \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d? Simply put, the BBB concept means that both the process and the results of the post disaster humanitarian activities should improve on what was in place before the disaster. These improved conditions include not just stronger and safer buildings and settlements, but a better social and political context with strengthened capacities, greater equity, and enhanced economic and social development. The original key propositions of BBB include diverse concepts such as self-recovery, donor coordination, quality control, information management, entrepreneurship, and disaster risk reduction. Establishing BBB as a goal implies doing more than restoring what existed before the disaster. However, there are at least two distinct interpretations of that aspiration explained below: \u00a7\ufffdDRR-focused BBB: For some stakeholders, BBB is principally about disaster risk reduction in reconstruction, in particular; strengthening DRM capacity, reconstructing stronger infrastructure and buildings, and situating houses and other buildings in safer sites. \u00a7\ufffdMulti-dimensional approach to BBB: Other stakeholders interpret BBB more broadly to mean leveraging the recovery process to accomplish fundamental changes that are both structural (improving physical recovery) and non-structural (improving social, economic, or environmental conditions, or strengthening institutional arrangements and capacities). This interpretation may also extend to addressing conflicts and other shortcomings in the political process. Agencies agree that there are four critical dimensions of recovery. BBB can occur in all of them: \u00a7\ufffdPhysical recovery; \u00a7\ufffdSocial recovery; \u00a7\ufffdEconomic recovery; and \u00a7\ufffdEnvironmental recovery. Some examples of BBB-related outcomes under each approach are shown in Table 16.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b720a37-7130-4ace-bf06-98b6427cc137": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b720a37-7130-4ace-bf06-98b6427cc137", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fcff95c5fa8f1395cbc5b7ab9089f51915ed8d96938b841a1313d161eeb7713a"}, "2": {"node_id": "20d18193-7a8d-4b43-a4bd-471f442642c5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "087854f42e8563ef1120386467ae70b10cb4575d9707297e2ca2bb333c682c76"}}, "hash": "ba513c3f2d29354a33809c1e9dfaeda4d8be767b262372d81388fe2641c86119", "text": "Some examples of BBB-related outcomes under each approach are shown in Table 16.

Building trust with previously marginalized communities allowed engagement with the common goal of a peaceful and prosperous future. Facilities rebuilt were of higher quality and better suited to beneficiary needs. For example, housing included sanitation facilities. BBB also included innovations that reformed national governance systems.134 Philippines 2013 Tropical Cyclone Yolanda The Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 defines post disaster recovery as the restoration and improvement where appropriate, of facilities, livelihood and living conditions 134 BRR, 2010, 10 Management Lessons for Host Governments Coordinating Post disaster Reconstruction. 75 of disaster-affected communities, including efforts to reduce disaster risk factors, by the principles of \u201cbuild back better.\u201d The Philippines National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) published the recovery planning document \u201cReconstruction Assistance on Yolanda: Implementation for Results\u201d (RAY/I4R) in September 2014. Explaining that Yolanda risked causing a negative impact on growth, poverty reduction and employment creation objectives of the Philippine Development Plan 2011-2016 (PDP), NEDA proposed a Results Framework for Yolanda recovery. Based on the PDP, the goal was to create resilient, sustainable regions with high and sustainable growth, able to withstand and recover from future disasters. NEDA identified a window of opportunity to \u201cbuild back better\u201d and achieve a higher level of development outcomes in some of the poorest areas of the country and explained that the PDP provided the framework to define and monitor these outcomes.135 Myanmar 2008 Tropical Cyclone Nargis The term BBB does not figure prominently in the Post-Nargis Joint Assessment, organized by the Tri- Partite Group (government, ASEAN, and the UN), or in the Post-Nargis Recovery and Preparedness Plan. ASEAN\u2019s assessment of the post-Nargis experience points out how BBB contributed in three areas: (1) strengthening DRR and improving construction techniques; (2) building back livelihoods; and (3) the use of ASEAN and local volunteers to carry out recovery programmes. Overseas Development Institute (ODI) notes ASEAN\u2019s own role in mediating and facilitating the integration of international organisations in the recovery process.136 ASEAN characterized its work with partners on DRR as \u201cstriking while the iron is hot\u201d (that is, taking advantage of the moment) to spread the concept of building back better into the daily lives of the affected population. Cyclone Nargis was the first time that the AADMER was activated and tested in a real post disaster situation, which provided ASEAN and its members with valuable inputs, lessons learned, tools, and mechanisms that could be applied in future disasters.137 Asian Development Bank, 2015 Recovery should result in higher disaster resilience, both physically and institutionally. The reconstruction process should adopt an all-hazards approach in all relevant regards. Planning should encompass the entire affected area and include proper site selection for relocation.

BBB addresses the importance of enhancing community resilience following disasters and identifies what is considered successful recovery. While recovery policy- makers and practitioners lack a consensus on what BBB should include, at a minimum, BBB should signify a policy commitment to right-sizing, right-siting, and improving the resilience of critical infrastructure.139 C. Leadership to encourage Building Back Better Disasters change people\u2019s thinking and motivate stakeholders to address causal factors. The opportunity to reduce disaster risk after a disaster should not be lost, especially when the resources are available. Without guidance on BBB, experience shows that each agency will interpret the phrase on its own. This may include anything from structural integrity, as emphasized in Haiti, to social transformation, such as occurred in Aceh. Ultimately, it is up to the government to provide the leadership with partners to decide what the standards and principles are to build back better and to communicate this clearly. In planning a recovery programme, government can: \u00a7\ufffd Reach agreement on what the \u201cBuilding Back Better\u201d vision is in planning a particular recovery programme; \u00a7\ufffd Engage recovery actors in supporting this vision and deciding how it will be implemented; \u00a7\ufffd Ensure the conditions are in place for the vision to be realized, including adequate funding; and \u00a7\ufffdUtilize indicators for BBB in the monitoring system and ensure BBB messages are included in the communications plan. As part of its effort to strengthen its readiness for recovery, governments can: \u00a7\ufffd Work with partners to reach agreement on BBB goals for infrastructure and services for sectors and regions, and incorporate these in the country\u2019s Recovery Framework; \u00a7\ufffd Develop enabling policies and regulations, and technical standards for sectors and regions, such as guidelines or modifications to building codes, which help in implementing the goals; \u00a7\ufffd Work with technical experts to identify the additional costs required to meet BBB goals and develop disaster risk financing strategies to reduce and/or cover these additional costs; \u00a7\ufffd Develop indicators to measure whether BBB is being accomplished in sectors and locations; \u00a7\ufffdRequire the incorporation of BBB goals in regulations for land use and development planning at all levels; and \u00a7\ufffd Develop communications tools to disseminate BBB goals and standards on both an ex-ante and ex-post basis. 138 Bindu Lohani, \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d Reconstruction Seminar for Nepal, May 2015, kathmandu, Nepal. 139 World Bank/GFDRR, Guide to Developing Recovery Frameworks, Sendai Edition, 2014. 78 Paddy replanting activity - The farmers were able to restart planting after their agricultural land cleared, Indonesia 79 ANNEx I: AADMER WORk PROGRAMME, 2010-2015 ON RECOVERY This particular component of the Work Programme elaborates Article 17 of AADMER, i.e., rehabilitation. The Work Programme uses the word \u201crecovery\u201d as it covers the whole spectrum of the recovery process that includes rehabilitation and reconstruction. It is also to ensure consistency with the terms used internationally. Article 17 of AADMER summarises that Member States shall, jointly or individually, develop strategies, implement programmes, and promote cooperation (bilateral, regional and international) for rehabilitation as a result of a disaster. During recovery, Member States will lead, manage, and coordinate the overall recovery process, while ASEAN through AADMER mechanisms will provide full support, based on the need and upon request of the affected Member State/s. This component of the Work Programme was drafted based on individual experiences of Member States in managing their recovery process in the past five years, in particular, the experience of the ASEAN Humanitarian Task Force (AHTF) for Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar. Objectives The recovery component aims to strengthen the capacity of Member States to: \u2022\ufffd Conduct damage and loss assessment within one month after a disaster occurs; \u2022\ufffd Develop an effective recovery action plan for rehabilitation and reconstruction within three months after a disaster occurs; \u2022\ufffd Mobilise resources from the local, regional and international community to support implementation of the recovery process; \u2022\ufffd Coordinate and implement activities within a targeted time frame as stated in the recovery plan; and \u2022\ufffd Develop a transition plan and link post disaster recovery process into sustainable development one year before the end of the recovery period.
