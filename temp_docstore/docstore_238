The term Pacific Island Countries (PICs) will be used to represent these 15 political entities. The PICs represent a group that is marked by some similarities and significant heterogeneity. With one exception (PNG1), the entities in this group are marked by the fact of small size and geographic remoteness. Their land area ranges from 12 square kilometres (sq. kms) of land (Tokelau) to 28,000 sq. kms (the Solomon Islands); the area of most countries is however between several hundred and several thousand square kilometres. Population size varies from fewer than 2,000 people (Tokelau) to 800,000 persons (Fiji). The PICs vary significantly in terms of economic development, social indicators and the scale, diversity and complexity of their economies. For example PNG, with its 462,840 sq. kms of area is approximately a thousand times the size of Palau (487 sq. kms), which in turn is more than 20 times the size of Nauru (21.1 sq. kms). Both in terms of size and population, PNG is the largest country. Solomon Islands rank at second place in terms of size and Fiji ranks at second place in terms of population. With only 2,200 THE CHALLENGES 2 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES people (1996) Niue has the smallest population among the 14 Forum countries. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita also varies from a high of US$8,000 (1996) in Palau to US$447(1993) in Kiribati. The principal exports are largely primary products (fish, copra, palm oil, coconut and coconut oil, sugar and molasses), and some manufactured items in some countries. Fiji, Samoa and Kiribati are the only three countries where the share of manufacturing in GDP is between 10 to 15 percent. The principal imports are petroleum products, machinery, transport equipment, chemicals and food items. Scattered as the PICs are, throughout the vast region of the Pacific Ocean, the distances between the countries can be long; and distances within the countries can be equally daunting. Logistics and transportation entail severe challenges. The approximately 80,000 strong population of Kiribati, for example, lives on 33 widely scattered low atolls (800 sq. kms of land) that extend 4,200 kilometres from east to west and 2,000 kilometres from north to south. Kiribati exemplifies the severe development challenges that face a small, remote and resource-poor island state during a period of rapid global change. Even in relatively developed Fiji, transport services to its hundreds of outer islands are often intermittent; several months may go by between shipments of basic goods and fuel. Despite these differences, the PICs share common development challenges, many of them structural in nature. The issues that typify the energy sector arise substantially from the specific characteristics of island economies and cannot be separated from the wider development challenges that these economies face (UNDP 2004). PICs face high import prices for petroleum products and have to contend with high energy costs in general. In addition, they often receive low prices for their exports, and have to incur substantial expenses in taking their exports to distant markets. Inadequate and uncertain transportation networks and limited infrastructure compound the problems that governments face in making available basic services such as health, education, clean water, power and communications to the people, in particular to the majority of the population that lives in the outer islands or in the more remote areas of the larger islands. Accelerating global economic, social and cultural change poses an unprecedented challenge to small, remote States who have to strive for an \u2018impossible trinity\u2019: i) securing the benefits of globalization; ii) maintaining national sovereignty and iii) retaining sufficient flexibility to formulate national economic and social policies. Other challenges that confront the PICs are: how to protect traditional PICs face high import prices for petroleum products and have to contend with high energy costs in general. 3 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES values such as community sharing of resources and co-operative economic activity; protect land tenure (often threatened by resource investments), minimise the social costs of investments (e.g.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5ab43c5-901a-464a-98e2-9851af1834c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5ab43c5-901a-464a-98e2-9851af1834c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e4aaecc9c94214b0e94559d2f0cfc670b396aaa7f35db1f415a9f4470e34117"}, "2": {"node_id": "36fdb9b0-474f-4d90-a423-45f1b63b1080", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "797a17484737836525ef1819851157aecc303709fd07d1ef36846e8153772988"}}, "hash": "711310b144793eb9b38f7fdc7820f484d318c19321c461161a6768e145890366", "text": "increased inequality, less control over investment decisions and poorer working conditions); deal with the rapid erosion of preferential market access; afford the costs of joining (or not joining) the World Trade Organisation (WTO); carry out their commitments to the global community (for example those summarised in the MDGs); and capitalize on new information and communications technologies, which could reduce effective isolation.

Similarly, while there are huge benefits that can result from the use of modern communications technologies, particularly in the more remote areas, inadequate and unreliable energy systems make these benefits ineffective. Many PICs (especially the smaller countries) are dependent on donor assistance for developing and implementing social and economic policies. There is a strong perception that donor emphasis and priorities change frequently and that donor support is often too short-term to produce any lasting impact. Where aid is a small percentage of GDP, the volatility of aid flows and priorities may not be a serious concern, but for some PICs, it can arguably undermine development efforts. There was considerable assistance to the energy sector in the PICs during the 1980s, but this dropped off rapidly during the 1990s, as donor priorities changed and many energy programmes, particularly in renewable energy development failed to proceed beyond the pilot stage. In all the PICs, people tend to migrate from the rural islands and from the more remote areas of the larger islands to the urban areas. This is most prevalent in the smaller countries where urban islands (only one or two urban islands in each country) have become overcrowded. The provision of public services, the non-availability of adequate employment opportunities and the environmental sustainability of these overcrowded islands have become major development concerns. Furthermore, in the smaller countries (especially those that have a special relationship with New Zealand or the United States of America (USA)) there is considerable migration from urban areas to these countries. While this out-migration has softened the impact of population growth, the people migrating are often those with the highest skill levels. The challenges of adjusting to globalization are considerable and the local resources and experience for doing so are extremely limited. 4 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES Over the past decade, a number of studies have highlighted the fact that population growth may impede development efforts in the region. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) recently warned of growing poverty in the PICs. The ADB states that the key issues that affect all its Pacific members are: weak governance; high rate of growth of population; declining educational performance; weakness of the private sector; breakdown of traditional support systems; and the urban elite capturing a high percentage of the benefits of modernization. With the growing pressure for structural reform of the energy sector, including privatization in many countries, (where the government has so far been the dominant economic force), it is clear that a good deal of assistance will be required for reforms to proceed smoothly and in the interests of the people. Several studies have documented the susceptibility of small island states to external economic fluctuations and environmental shocks. A Commonwealth Secretariat vulnerability index ranks the PICs among the most highly vulnerable of the 111 developing countries it has studied. Climate change is another area of concern. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned of deteriorating coral reefs, mangrove habitats, sea-grass beds, major species loss, worsening water balance in atoll nations and declines in vital reef fisheries, all issues of particular concern for small island nations. Other possible impacts include reductions in agricultural output, declines in ground water (both quantity and quality), health impacts, extensive capital damage due to storm surges, and diminished fish production. Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, FSM and Tuvalu are among the countries that are likely to be impacted most due to climate change and some islands may even disappear. In the energy sector, where investments made today have a long-term impact over many decades, PICs need to consider very carefully issues like the location of oil terminals, the safe disposal of wastes, make proper plans for spills (where coastlines may erode) and investment decisions regarding the setting up hydropower units (because rainfall patterns may change). Recent work undertaken as part of the UNDP Regional Energy Programme for Poverty Reduction (REP-PoR) has studied the impact of rising oil prices on developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region. An Oil Price Vulnerability Index (OPVI) has been constructed to measure the vulnerability of countries to increasing oil prices. Out of 24 Asia-Pacific countries studied, 13 countries are classified as \u2018most vulnerable\u2019, and four PICs (Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Samoa and Fiji) are among the seven most vulnerable countries (see Box 1 \u2013 Oil Price Vulnerability and the Pacific Island Countries).

Higher fuel prices lead to increases in transport costs (land, sea and air), affecting the cost of living for islanders. Since most electricity generation is based on diesel, fuel price increases have put upward pressure on electricity costs. While not all PICs pass this on to consumers in the form of price increases, the cost has to be met either by government subsidies to power companies, or from reductions in the quality of supply2 and investment. Higher petroleum prices also constrain households\u2019 ability to move from relying on biomass to more convenient cooking fuels such as kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). As is clear, of the 13 countries that are most vulnerable to soaring oil prices, four are PICs. The OPVI ranks Fiji, Samoa, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu as most vulnerable countries (in ascending order of vulnerability). Out of 24 Asia-Pacific countries included in the OPVI, Vanuatu is ranked as the second most vulnerable country, after the Maldives, also a Small Island Developing State (SIDS). Papua New Guinea (PNG) is ranked as a country with \u2018medium vulnerability\u2019 mainly because it is an oil producer. This high vulnerability of the PICS is due to the high dependence on imported petroleum products for transportation and electricity production among other factors. The small markets and the added burden of higher shipping costs (for petroleum products) to scattered and distant markets means that there is a high impact of rising oil prices on the economic growth of these countries (UNDP 2007a). The following points should be noted on the OPVI3: \u2022 The reason only five PICs have been included initially is due to difficulties regarding access to comparable data, but it is the intention to include additional PICs as data becomes available. However, it is expected that these countries also will be clustered in the group of most vulnerable countries. \u2022 The Index reflects the current positions of the 24 Asia-Pacific countries, based on a limited set of variables; and \u2022 The Index is relative to this group of countries. This high vulnerability of the PICS is due to the high dependence on imported petroleum products for transportation and electricity production. 6 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES The OPVI is constructed so as to capture the three commonly accepted aspects of vulnerability: hazards, resistance and damage. Hazards are international events not under the country\u2019s control, resistance represents the resilience and the fundamental strength of the economy and damage is measured through social vulnerability and is tracked by indicators of human development.

Hence, definitions of poverty particularly those based on income alone are not relevant for many of the countries in the region. In the period 2001-2004, ADB supported a series of poverty assessments in Fiji, FSM, Kiribati, PNG, Samoa, RMI, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. The assessments included surveys of attitudes of urban and rural households regarding their own perceptions of poverty. The findings of the participatory assessments highlight that \u2018...hardship and poverty are real issues in the lives of many people in both urban and rural areas and on outer islands. Poverty of opportunity is just as important as lack of income. In fact, in the Pacific, poverty is generally viewed as hardship due to inadequate services like transport, water, primary health care, and education\u2019 (ADB 2004). Based on the ADB supported poverty assessments poverty/hardship in the PIC context has been defined as an inadequate level of sustainable human development manifested by: i) a lack of access to basic services such as primary health care, education, and potable water; ii) a lack of opportunities to participate fully in the socio-economic life of the community; and iii) lack of adequate resources (including cash) to meet the basic needs of the household, the customary obligations to the extended family, village community, and/or the Church. The importance of family, kinship and customary obligations was a central feature in this definition. The percentage of households living in poverty, according to a basic needs poverty line has been estimated for some PICs. These estimates show a high incidence of poverty in Kiribati (50 percent in 1996), Vanuatu (40 percent in1998) and PNG (37 percent in 1998) and a much lower incidence of poverty in the Cook Islands (12 percent in 1998), Marshall Islands and Samoa (20 percent each in 1999 and 2002 respectively) and about 22 percent in Tonga and the Solomon Islands4 in the years 2001and 2005/2006 respectively5. The poverty line is determined on the basis of 4 Preliminary figures. 5 Source: Abbot 2007. In a barter economy, income is a poor indicator of community well being. 8 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES the income necessary to meet the level of expenditures required to provide basic needs. Where ever possible, information from Household Income and Expenditure Surveys (HIES) was used to estimate urban and rural poverty. However, some governments and many non-government organisations are not fully convinced of the validity of these assessments. There are also doubts regarding the extent to which meaningful comparisons can be made between different countries. While there is still no agreed definition of poverty, the first regional MDG report has recommended mechanisms for poverty measurement and suggested the following steps (SPC 2004): \u2022 develop official measures of national per capita consumption adjusted for purchasing power parity; \u2022 develop poverty-related indicators specific to the region that will assist in measuring the prevalence of poverty as defined for the Pacific; \u2022 recognize the sub-national differences in poverty across different countries; and disaggregate the indicators for the first MDG on poverty reduction, on the basis of rural and urban areas, islands and provinces etc. BOX 2: KEY ISSUES WITH REGARD TO POVERTY IN THE PICS \u25a0 Despite the fact that poverty is a significant issue, it is not yet on the policy agenda of most PICs. Till 2001, only Fiji and PNG had attempted formal estimates of poverty. \u25a0 There is growing recognition that \u2018poverty of opportunity\u2019 is just as important as lack of income and consequently defining poverty by the level of income alone may not be appropriate. There is however still no commonly accepted definition of poverty in the PICs. Without an agreed definition of poverty or hardship, and consensus on the methodology of measuring poverty, it is likely to be difficult to demonstrate that specific energy sector interventions actually reduce poverty or hardship levels. \u25a0 Some argue that extreme poverty is rare in the region and that international definitions based on an income of US$1/day are inappropriate. In this context, there are questions about the relevance of the goal of halving the proportion of people living in \u2018extreme poverty\u2019. However, the attempt to achieve MDGs has brought into focus the issue of measurable indicators of a country\u2019s performance, particularly with regard to poverty reduction. \u25a0 Attempts to alleviate poverty based on income generation have not worked well in the Pacific region and approaches that improve the infrastructure, the quality of life, access to education and to opportunities for self-improvement are more likely to show immediate results. 9 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f364625-81f4-45dd-b0fb-06e0de837237": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f364625-81f4-45dd-b0fb-06e0de837237", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6dd34fe52d3aaff154edba1e1e7b4c5f65f5d0bd404441a5e6317778e084d0c5"}}, "hash": "6dd34fe52d3aaff154edba1e1e7b4c5f65f5d0bd404441a5e6317778e084d0c5", "text": "CHALLENGES Poverty and energy linkages Although energy is not explicitly listed as a MDG, it is now recognized that the provision of energy services is critical to development \u2013 and for achieving the MDGs. Access to modern sources of energy helps in expanding choices for individuals and assists them in capability expansion (UNDP 2006b). Modern energy services are an essential element of developing the enabling conditions that can allow a country to meet the MDGs (Modi 2005). Energy is no doubt an enabler \u2013 an enabler not only of growth, but of opportunity as well. With the benefit of development experience, it is possible to unequivocally state that energy is essential not only for growth, but for the attainment of the key goals that have been set: the eradication of poverty and inequity and the provision of opportunity in equal measure to all. Energy need not however be seen only as an input to production and an ingredient for growth. Equitable, diversified and enlarged access to energy can in fact improve productivity and income at all levels, reduce inequities and substantially change the way people live, particularly the poor and the disadvantaged. It is for this reason that attention needs to be focused on minimum service provisioning and on issues of access, quality and supply (UNDP 2006b). Internationally there seems to be a strong correlation (up to a point) between increased use, or at least access to, modern forms of energy and wealth (as measured by GDP per capita) or development (as measured by the Human Development Index (HDI)). However, though it is clear that increased wealth increases the use of modern energy forms, it is not yet clear that the provision of modern energy sources increases wealth. Though it is obvious that the provision of modern energy sources increases the opportunity for wealth generation, other factors such as poor market access, lack of available capital and low skill levels may prevent the development of income generating activities that can take advantage of the newly available energy sources. In the PICs, overall access to energy can be considered to have strong links with poverty/hardship reduction. People want the services that energy can provide: improved and cleaner cooking, better lighting and longer hours of lighting, improved transport, water pumping, access to entertainment through radio or TV, cooling for food preservation, night-time emergency medical services etc. The reduction of hardship requires access to affordable, reliable, and productive energy services, which in turn provides access to better basic development services. Poor market access, lack of available capital and low skill levels may prevent the development of income generating activities. 10 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES BOX 3: HYDROPOWER IN IRIRI VILLAGE, SOLOMON ISLANDS: HIGH COST, LIMITED BENEFITS In 1983, the first hydro-based village electrification scheme in the Solomon Islands was installed at the village of Iriri, a community located about 45 minutes by power boat from Gizo, the provincial centre of the Western Province. The design premise used for the Iriri and later village hydro installations in the Solomon Islands was that simple designs using local materials should be used as far as possible and community committees should be established for the operation and maintenance of the hydro systems. The project also included specific components which were intended to aid income generation, so as to improve the economic condition of the target village. In 2006, a study funded by the Regional Energy Programme for Poverty Reduction (REP-PoR) was undertaken to ascertain the impact a typical village hydro installation on the village communities in the Solomon Islands, including changes if any in income-generation activities and lifestyles. It was found that though the Iriri and other similar installations in Vavanga and Ghatere saved on the initial cost through the use of locally available materials for the dam and for penstock supports and by the elimination of some design components such as a trash filter and intake structure, these savings led to lower system reliability and increased maintenance requirements. Even with the simplified design and local materials, the cost of the hydro- installations have been substantially greater (on a per house basis) than household solar lighting. The household survey showed that when the hydropower was functioning, almost all the power used was for lighting and/or radio and cassette player operations, a usage level that is easily achieved with solar power, at lower cost and with higher reliability. The justification for the high investment in the hydro installation over lower cost solar energy was the availability of more power to allow the use of larger appliances useful for powering tools", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2e8b248-a1a2-4cc5-a90f-1eda99367008": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2e8b248-a1a2-4cc5-a90f-1eda99367008", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d4913b0092d95a74a61e41268c7a38c33d9c0519f3027a737adfb9c4798b5641"}}, "hash": "d4913b0092d95a74a61e41268c7a38c33d9c0519f3027a737adfb9c4798b5641", "text": "and income generating projects. However in the 20 years following the hydro installation, there has been almost no investment by the community either in larger appliances or in income-generating activities that depend on electricity. This appears to be due to factors other than energy access, including (but probably not limited to) market access problems, unreliability of the power supply, lack of business skills and lack of access to finance for income-generating activities. Some village leaders felt that the hydropower has meant additional costs due to the labour commitment that has had to be made for maintenance, the expense of repair of the electrical components and the general frustration that occurs due to each system failure. While the hydro-technician and some village leaders still hope to renovate the hydro system, it appears that there will need to be a complete replacement of all components, except possibly the turbine, and finding the necessary finance will be difficult. Although some households reported using electricity for income 11 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES generating activities when the hydro power unit worked, there is no evidence that the overall economic development of the village has benefited from the hydro installation over the 23 years since its installation. Indeed, some village elders consider the village to be worse-off today than before the hydro installation. From a poverty alleviation standpoint, there is no evidence that the hydro installation has made any difference one way or the other. Today, most households have no access to clean water or proper sanitation and the general condition of the village and the lives of the villagers are perceived to have hardly changed. Merely having access to energy has not been a significant stimulus to either economic or social improvement for households in Iriri, though the perception of the villagers is that some benefits have accrued. If nothing else there seems to be at least a perception of progress that was not present before the installation of the hydro power unit. Source: UNDP 2006 Given the large number of remote settlements, delivery of energy particularly electricity, is critical for the provision of basic services in the PICs. Many countries have their rural populations spread over numerous small islands and the dispersed nature of settlements makes it imperative to address constraints related to extending the grid. Absence of access to electricity is common in the PICs. For instance, the Solomon Islands has most of its population spread over more than 300 populated islands. In Kiribati, less than 80,000 people live on 33 widely scattered low atolls (800 sq. kms of land). The scattered habitations make a national grid impossible and the distribution of fossil fuels expensive and often unreliable. On large islands, such as PNG, access to some villages is often a problem due to the absence of roads through the dense jungles and rugged terrain. A study on new approaches to rural electrification in PNG estimates that 75 percent of the schools in the country (mostly rural boarding schools) are without electricity, as are a high percentage of health centres. Yet, the study notes, \u2018for most Papua New Guineans, the only benefit received from the government is access to certain critical services, including basic health care, children\u2019s inoculations and maternity care ... and primary school education. All of these services require electric- ity to be effective\u2019 (WB/UNDP 2004). 12 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES Another critical issue related to access to modern energy and poverty is that the small market size in the PICs, combined with the dispersed habitations makes fossil fuels unusually costly and vulnerable to supply interruptions. Households that shift from kerosene to electricity for light- ing and from wood to kerosene or LPG for cooking are considered to be less impoverished. Yet, many households may continue to use wood for cooking due to cost and cultural factors. In many cases, the poor pay more for energy services because using fuels such as wood and kerosene for cooking and lighting is less efficient than using modern fuels. In addition, the poor usually buy fuelwood in small amounts. When the transaction costs are taken into account, energy for cooking often ends up being more expensive for poor people than for the better-off (Saghir 2006). Unlike the rich, poor people find it hard to make even the smallest invest- ments and may therefore end up using less-efficient equipment and/or fuel, often leading to high costs for the households, both in terms of time and money (Clancy et al. 2003).

If the provision of energy is to result in increased income to the community through productive use then specific efforts are necessary to ensure that other critical factors such as access to markets, adequate management, financial and marketing skills, sufficient investment and working capital etc. are accounted for in a project and that the project is acceptable to the people from a cultural standpoint as well. These considerations will ensure that once the energy is available, any income-generating business that is set up has some hope of success. The special case of Melanesia The three poorest Melanesian countries, PNG, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, dominate the PICs in terms of land and population. The \u2018Melanesian three\u2019 as these countries are referred to, contain about 95 percent of all land area of the PICs and 82 percent of the population. The high levels of poverty are indicated by the low HDI ranks and the high Human Poverty Index (HPI) ranks of these three countries within the PICs (see Table 1). Often the poor pay more for energy services, especially for cooking and lighting. 13 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES TABLE 1 MELANESIA RELATIVE TO THE OTHER PICS * of 15 PICs ** of 177 countries a Only others ranked were Fiji (92), Samoa (74) and Tonga (54) ~ = approximately < = less than FIC = Forum Island Countries Source: UNDP 2005 In the Pacific Human Development Report 1999, these three countries held the three lowest HPI positions. In the 2005 global Human Development Report (HDR) also, the three ranked well below all other PICs considered. If the lack of household electrification and extent of cooking with biomass are considered proxies for relative rural hardship, the three countries are again ranked lower than all other PICs. The \u2018Melanesian three\u2019 are characterised by other features that distinguish them from the rest of the PICs. These include: \u2022 Most of the population lives in the rural areas and is not well integrated into the money economy. Though the subsistence/barter economy serves the basic needs adequately, there is little access to cash for purchasing services or goods. \u2022 The isolation of different areas due to the remoteness and rugged terrain, has resulted in the highest density of languages in the world. with over 800 different languages spoken in PNG alone.6 \u2022 The Melanesian countries are among the least politically stable countries in the Pacific region. With their cultural fragmentation, they can be difficult to govern effectively and there is often little continuity in policies as new Cabinets or coalitions tend to form around personalities. \u2022 Compared to other PICs, the transportation of goods, services, people and information can be more expensive and irregular. \u2022 The \u2018Melanesian three\u2019 suffer from high rates of malaria infection, a scourge that is absent elsewhere in the region.

Source: UNDP 2005 In all the PICs, urban and peri-urban areas are fully electrified. A few power utilities in some PICs have established \u2018lifeline tariffs\u2019 for an initial block of household electricity consumed per month. These are meant to subsidize basic needs for low-income consumers. However, some utilities have set the lifeline limit well above a basic needs level (e.g. 100 kilowatt hour (kWh)/month whereas 40 kWh/month might suffice) or have not assessed the impact of the tariff on the poor or the utility\u2019s finances. Except for the single-island countries of Niue and Nauru that have full coverage by a national grid, grids are broken up by the separation of the 15 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES islands, with urban grids usually extending for some distance into rural areas but remote islands having no access to the grid at all. Also, utilities are reluctant to extend further into rural areas since the return on investment is usually negative. Thus national utilities understandably accord rural electrification a low priority and typically extend the grid only where politically expedient or when an external agency pays the cost of the extension. In Fiji, the Solomon Islands and PNG, the policy of maintaining a national tariff that is far below the actual generation and distribution costs in rural areas, has effectively prevented or slowed the development of either State or private grid systems for the sale of electricity services to areas where the national utility or the Public Works Department (PWD) does not maintain a subsidized grid. Typically off-grid electricity supplies are met by diesel mini-grids that are expensive on an energy-unit-cost basis; and the supply is intermittent and unreliable. With regard to fossil fuels, rural areas in all the PICs have open market access to petroleum products. There may be occasional shortages as storage reserves are usually small and the deliveries are not always made on time. In all PICs, there is a strong tendency for market-based pricing of landed petroleum products. Though several countries have price control laws, they are rarely, if ever, used to force the delivery of petroleum products below cost (in some cases, where fuel price control exists and is supposed to be nationwide, it is not effectively monitored or enforced and in remote areas prices well-above the control level are actually charged). The exceptions are subsidies for rural kerosene that exist in a few countries and subsidies towards the shipping cost of fuels to rural islands in others. This subsidy effectively forces the price to the same level for all islands. In the Solomon Islands and PNG, little petroleum fuel is available in the most remote islands or in the interior areas, and it can be extraordinarily expensive, since supplies may have to be flown in or may have to pass through many levels of distribution, each adding to the rural customer\u2019s final cost. Bio-fuel, particularly from coconut oil, is a most promising energy source. Not only does this provide for local energy in rural areas, it also provides an opportunity for income-generation, through the sale of the bio-fuel to urban users. So far, there has been little comprehensive regional level analysis of the technical, financial, economic, social and environmental costs and benefits of large-scale bio-fuel programmes in the PICs. There has also been no comprehensive assessment of the different mechanisms which can help develop a bio-fuel industry, or of its benefits to the low-income rural people who will work to produce the feedstock.

Further limiting access to energy in PNG and the Solomon Islands (and to a lesser extent in Vanuatu), is a relatively fragmented social structure, land tenure issues, political instability and the low priority accorded to energy access development relative to other services such as education, health, water and sanitation. \u25a0 In the larger PICs (Fiji, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands and PNG), many rural electrification projects have been implemented using a variety of technologies and sources \u2013 including diesel, micro-hydro and solar photovoltaic (PV). The lack of effective and adequate monitoring, and the gaps in knowledge relating to the real costs of operation and maintenance make it difficult to effectively plan and implement rural electrification programmes that are cost effective, sustainable and provide quality service to people in the lower income groups. BOX 4: KEY ISSUES IN RURAL ENERGY ACCESS production will become an industrial plantation operation (as is the case with palm oil today), which requires rural workers to leave their traditional homes and extended families to work on foreign-owned and operated plantations. This causes social disruption and only modest poverty reduction. On the other hand, there are numerous locally-owned coconut plantations (that have fallen into dis-use due to low international coconut oil prices) that could be rehabilitated for bio-fuel production and bio-fuel could be price competitive with imported fuels. Solar energy has emerged as the primary rural electricity supply source in several countries (Kiribati and Tonga today and with long range plans for RMI, Fiji and Tokelau). Unfortunately with the exception of the Kiribati experience, the development of small-scale solar power has been ad hoc and generally donor driven, with little consistency in technical systems or among the project managing institutions. For example, in Fiji, there are at least five different physical arrangements for solar electrification and three different institutional structures operating them. The development of small-scale solar power has been ad hoc and generally donor driven. 17 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES Lack of institutional focus for rural energy needs The lack of institutions (except in Fiji) that focus on rural energy access has kept the pace of rural energy development slow. In addition, there is no specific institutional framework or arrangement that addresses poverty reduction through energy access in the PICs. Most PICs have a national level government institution specifically focused on energy matters, typically a department of energy or energy planning unit. The exceptions are Niue, Nauru and FSM. Staffed inadequately, with dedicated personnel ranging from one person (Tokelau) to 25 people (Fiji), these institutions tend to have limited capacities and will continue to require external assistance for policy development, project design, comparative economic analysis, development of standards, etc. Only in Samoa and the Cook Islands, have national energy offices been established under defining legislation; in other countries they have evolved over time, primarily to act as an interface between the government and donors. As a result, the PIC energy offices have no significant regulatory authority and few have any formal relationship with either national power utilities or fossil fuel importing entities. Utility companies/corporations in the PICs tend to provide electricity and energy services primarily to urban areas and to rural areas which are near by and can be economically served from the urban grid. Except for Niue and Nauru, where there is only central utility generation, rural areas where there is no grid supply typically manage energy on a community level through Island Councils, community committees or other local structures. Thus rural energy delivery is usually managed and maintained by local residents (except for larger government station power systems that are typically operated by government agency technicians). In all the PICs, international oil companies operate in a largely market- based environment. PIC markets are too small to have any significant leverage with the oil companies and they are therefore unable to exercise any control over import prices. In Samoa, Tuvalu, Kiribati and Niue, the contract for the supply of fuel is given to a single international supplier. Niue and Kiribati distribute fuel through a local structure not directly affiliated with any oil company. Other PICs allow the oil companies to maintain their own wholesale distribution system within the country and usually retail distribution as well.

There is no specific institutional framework or arrangement that addresses poverty reduction through energy access in the PICs. 18 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES \u25a0 In the PICs, there is no specific institutional framework or arrangement that addresses poverty/hardship reduction through energy access. \u25a0 Capacities within national energy offices and utilities to design and implement programmes vary widely, but are typically low. \u25a0 The lack of institutions that focus on rural energy access (except in Fiji) has kept the pace of rural energy development slow. \u25a0 The responsibility for energy development, particularly for rural energy, is generally split among several government departments and is not well coordinated.8 \u25a0 Regional agencies are faced with a diversity of energy needs, corresponding to the great diversity of individual PICs. BOX 5: KEY ISSUES WITH REGARD TO INSTITUTIONAL FOCUS FOR RURAL ENERGY NEEDS 7 Fiji is unusual in having a group within the Department of Energy (DOE) specifically responsible for rural electrification. 8 In the Marshall Islands for example, the power utility, the government energy office, the health agency, the education agency and the telecommunications agency all engage in the development of rural energy access and each has its own technical staff and its own support mechanism. Most PICs do not have an institutional focus on rural energy development7. In addition, none of the national energy agencies has formal responsibilities to ensure that the poverty-energy linkages are considered. As a result, most rural electrification is ad hoc. It is thus not uncommon to find multiple approaches to rural electrification existing within a single country, increasing the problems of maintenance and technical support. The responsibility for the conceptualization and implementation for the installation, operation and maintenance of rural electrification projects often falls on national energy offices that are typically understaffed and have budgets that cannot effectively provide the needed support. At the regional level, the key regional intergovernmental agency that supports energy analysis and development in the PICs is the Secretariat of the Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC). It provides support for energy resource assessment, renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency efforts, policy development and national planning. In addition, the Pacific Power Association (PPA) assists island utilities in technical and business development, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS) monitors fossil fuel prices and advises PICs regarding fossil fuel economics, purchasing and contract negotiations and the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Program (SPREP) deals with the environmental and climate change aspects of energy. None of the regional organizations have programmes specifically oriented towards poverty reduction through improved energy access. 19 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES Policy and regulatory concerns Few countries in the PICs have policies, mechanisms or institutions that work to reduce poverty through the provision of energy access. Much policy and planning work in the PICs has been valuable, but tends to emphasize improved services to those who already have adequate access to modern energy forms. For instance in some PICs, surveys suggest that rural low-income villagers pay more for substandard energy services (e.g. kerosene for lighting, batteries for radios, etc.) than it would cost to provide basic electrification. Most PICs do not have any formal regulation of the institutions providing rural energy services. Fees for rural energy services are rarely established in a manner that ensures sustainability, there are few enforced technical standards and technical personnel do not have to meet any requirements of experience or training. Regional agencies have actively promoted the concept of national energy policies for about 20 years and today the majority of the PICs have formally adopted national energy policies. A decade ago, several countries (including Tuvalu, Kiribati and Niue) accepted a generic energy policy that was developed externally, but essentially ignored its application. The Pacific Islands Energy Policy and Strategic Action Planning (PIEPSAP) project, supported by SOPAC, UNDP and the Government of Denmark, which is currently underway has shifted the focus from proposing a generic policy to working with countries on policies specifically designed to fit their needs (see Box 6). As a result of this assistance, national energy policies have been prepared and endorsed at the Cabinet level in Niue, Tuvalu, Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. One of the key challenges now is adhering to them in day-to-day decisions.

The Solomon Islands (also with assistance from PIEPSAP) has prepared a rural electrification framework. No PIC has an effective regulatory structure for electric power external to the national utility. Fiji has a Commerce Commission to regulate tariffs but it is not fully independent with the Cabinet still maintaining implicit con- trol of tariff changes. PNG, Fiji, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu all lack sufficient external regulation, which can ensure efficient operations and minimum cost deliveries. Few countries in the PICs have policies that work to reduce poverty through the provision of energy access. 20 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES Since August 2004, a dedicated UNDP-supported project has been un- der implementation in the PICs that has as its focus assistance in the preparation of national energy policies (including rural electrification policies), strategies and practical mechanisms to implement these. The project is executed by the Secretariat of the Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) and is funded by the Government of Denmark. Based on three and a half years of work in these areas the following challenges have been identified in the context of the preparation of national energy policies and strategies in PICs: \u25a0 Development of effective national policies requires strong institutions and government commitment, which is not always in place. Government energy administrations (i.e. energy offices/ energy departments) continue to be inadequately resourced andwithout very much power to influence government policies. This seems to reflect the comparatively low standing of the energy administrations and/or unwillingness of energy officials to push government decisions. In most PICs energy policy decisions, such as energy pricing, petroleum procurement, power system expansion planning and allocation of internal or donor budgets are still undertaken by other entities (such as power utilities, international oil companies etc.), rather than energy administrations (energy offices and energy departments) and often energy offices are not even consulted. Thus, energy departments and units often do not have regulatory power and remain weak in comparison with power utilities and oil suppliers. \u25a0 Policy development is a genuinely sovereign activity where international and regional agencies can only assist. There is clear tension between country ownership and the role a regional and external project can play in areas that touch upon sovereign issues, such as national energy policy development. \u25a0 Energy markets are changing rapidly and policies risk being outdated. \u25a0 PICs are mostly consensual societies where inclusiveness and consultation are highly valued, however time-consuming the process may be. \u25a0 There is overlapping of a multitude of activities in the area of energy in the PICs and as such there is the risk of conflicting or inconsistent advice, including with regard to energy policy development. BOX 6: CHALLENGES IN THE PREPARATION OF NATIONAL ENERGY POLICIES AND STRATEGIES IN PICS 9 9 Sources: PIEPSAP Annual Report 2005 (SOPAC 2006) and different Quarterly Progress Reports (QPRs), available on SOPAC\u2019s homepage. Energy departments and units often do not have regulatory power and remain weak in comparison with power utilities and oil suppliers. 21 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES Objectives and approaches of different regional, international, bi-lateral organizations are not (automatically) fully compatible or well matched. \u25a0 As far as reasonably possible, the regional approach in the Pacific has been to use a model National Energy Policy as a base. In recognition of the limited success of previous attempts to use such models for national energy policy development, Pacific Island Energy Policy and Strategic Action Planning (PIEPSAP) aims at focusing on the specific situation of each respective country. \u25a0 It has become obvious that often the highest level of government decision-making has to be mobilized for national energy polices (including rural electrification policies) to be taken from the development of the policy paper stage to the implementation stage. \u25a0 The more concrete and action oriented activities and outputs become, the more they impinge upon the vested interests of some stakeholder groups. While generalized energy policy statements do not normally draw very much criticism, the idea that stated energy policy may be implemented and followed through, by the establishment of for example something like an effective electricity regulatory framework, seems to agitate those (e.g. power utilities) who see their interests as being adversely affected. Further, there is little commitment by the governments to effect policies that give preference to the development of renewable energy, improved energy efficiency and environmental suitability.

As a result, there is generally no incentive, either supportive or punitive, for the power utility or a private developer to choose efficient and environmentally appropriate solutions. Limited coordination and focus of donor-assisted programmes In most PICs, infrastructure for rural development is often dependent on the availability of donor funds, usually provided as a grant to the smaller countries and as soft loans to the larger countries. The small size of most of the PICs makes donor assistance, both technical and financial, a more important component of energy development than in Asia. As a consequence, energy agendas and related actions are to a large extent influenced and/or driven by regional, multilateral and bilateral organizations. The small size of most of the PICs makes donor assistance, both technical and financial, a critical component of energy development than in Asia. 22 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES In the energy sector, there was considerable assistance to PICs during the 1980s, but this dropped off rapidly during the 1990s, as donor priorities changed. Though the various programmes of regional agencies, bilateral donors and multilateral agencies in the energy sector are vital to the PICs, they do need to have long term goals and improved consistency in their applications if they are to have any lasting impact. There also has been little coordination of efforts by donors and multiple programmes that focus on the same issues often coexist leading to waste, duplication of work and confusion. The main concerns in donor-assisted energy interventions in PICs include (UNDP 2004): \u2022 Donor-funded programmes cannot \u2018solve\u2019 the Pacific region\u2019s energy problems, but can only contribute to those solutions. Past initiatives have tended to spread their efforts thinly across the energy sector. \u2022 There are examples over the preceding two decades where agencies and energy programmes have worked at cross-purposes, duplicated efforts and occasionally offered contradictory advice. This has led to confusion and sub-optimal implementation and generated country and beneficiary resentment in some cases. \u25a0 PICs do not have policies that link energy and poverty. Few countries have policies and mechanisms that work to reduce poverty through the provision of energy access. \u25a0 Much policy and planning work in the PICs has been valuable, but tends to emphasise improved services to those who already have adequate access to modern energy sources. \u25a0 PNG, Fiji, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu utilities lack sufficient external regulation to ensure efficient operations and minimum cost delivery of electrical power to all sectors. \u25a0 There is limited understanding of the impact that energy subsidies have on overall development or on poverty. There is also little awareness that energy cross-subsidies that appear to penalize industry, commerce and urban dwellers to benefit rural customers may actually enhance overall economic development for the country as a whole. \u25a0 There is little commitment by the governments to effect policies that give preference to renewable energy development, improved efficiency and environmental sustainability. BOX 7: KEY ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO POLICY AND REGULATORY ISSUES There also has been little coordination of efforts by donors and multiple programmes that focus on the same issues. 23 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES \u25a0 The small size of most PICs makes donor assistance, both technical and financial, a more important component of energy development than in other developing countries. \u25a0 The linkages between energy access and poverty in the PICs is not yet comprehensively analysed or understood, and consequently such linkages are not integrated in programme development. In fact, in most interventions supported by external donor organizations, the linkages between poverty and energy have not been considered, even though the concept is implicit in most rural electrification programmes. \u25a0 With a number of bilateral, regional and multilateral agencies working in energy, there is duplication of effort and repetition of work. \u25a0 There is a tendency for programmes (in particular renewable energy projects, financed by bilateral donors) to be donor driven, with PICs often playing a passive role in their preparation and design. \u25a0 In general, there is insufficient coordination among donor supported programmes both with regard to formulation and as well as implementation. \u25a0 Donor activities are dominated by \u2018soft\u2019 interventions such as support for meetings, studies, reports and plans; donor support for follow on hardware and field implementation is on a smaller scale. A balance of \u2018hard\u2018 and \u2018soft\u2019 programmes needs to be maintained for the interventions to be effective. \u25a0 Certain areas like utility based grid electrification receive", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57c2c13a-4b47-4ace-ac2e-ba95276dc23d": {"__data__": {"id_": "57c2c13a-4b47-4ace-ac2e-ba95276dc23d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89fe3929b4dc0880c464010bd604e9a2c3b6debc68670ef31379eb6caac268ff"}}, "hash": "89fe3929b4dc0880c464010bd604e9a2c3b6debc68670ef31379eb6caac268ff", "text": "a disproportionate share of external assistance. This emphasis has been at the cost of other important areas, including clean energy for cooking, which would benefit women and children in particular. BOX 8: KEY ISSUES IN DONOR-ASSISTED PROGRAMMES \u2022 Flexible approaches that adjust to changing economic, environmental and political contexts are more likely to succeed. The needs and opportunities in the PICs differ considerably. An approach which may seem appropriate today may be impractical a year or two later, as circumstances change. \u2022 Some energy initiatives in the past were based on specific technologies seeking an application and did not consider the interventions required to improve the quality of life of the people. For instance, some initiatives have promoted renewable technologies not tested elsewhere or in some cases completely unsuitable for the problems they were meant to address. Some energy initiatives in the past have been primarily technology driven. 24 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES In order to ensure that donor assistance is in synergy with government priorities, most PICs have created a committee or a department under the finance or foreign affairs ministry. However, the limited capacity of the PICs tends to result in PICs often submitting to donor influence and pressures to receive whatever programmes are being promoted by funding agencies without genuine coordination of programmes with national needs or poverty reduction efforts. This is worsened by the internal fragmentation of energy responsibility within the PICs themselves; with different donors supporting different agencies, without coordination of technical or institutional arrangements for long term energy project support. Due to the limited capacity available in the PICs, energy system designs are often carried out by donor- selected consultants. There is usually little coordination between donors or even technical continuity between energy projects from the same donor. As a result, one country may have many different types of rural energy systems operating at the same time, making maintenance and technical support difficult and ex- pensive. At the regional level, despite the existence of the Council of Regional Organisations in the Pacific (CROP) and Energy Working Group (EWG), regional programmes tend to be developed and implemented in isolation. Often they neither progress from earlier programmes nor interact meaningfully with existing programmes. Energy, poverty and gender The PICs have endorsed the Millennium Declaration, Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA), the adoption of the Pacific Platform for Action and other international and regional conventions and agreements. These endorsements demonstrate the region\u2019s commitment to addressing the issues of gender equality, women\u2019s empowerment and poverty reduction. On the ground, however, the picture is somewhat mixed. In some PICs, women may spend up to three hours collecting wood and an additional six hours in preparing food each day, with little change from 50 years ago. Even though fuel sources for domestic cooking are slowly shifting away from wood towards kerosene (and LPG in more affluent communities), wood and other biomass are still the predominant cooking fuel used by women in many PICs, especially in the remote and rural areas. The adverse impact of traditional fuels, measured in terms of the opportunity cost of time spent and the health risks is well known; the fact that these affect rural poor women more than any other group needs to be highlighted In some PICs, women may spend up to three hours collecting wood and an additional six hours in preparing food each day, with little change from 50 years ago. 25 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES 10 Emphysema is a lung disease that reduces the ability of the lungs to expel air. and acted upon. Respiratory infections in infants are a major cause of infant mortality and debility. These are particularly acute in the highland areas of PNG, where women cook indoors in traditional and poorly ventilated structures. Nursing women carry children in \u2018billums\u2019, strapped to their back while they cook, exposing both mother and child to smoke and particulate matter. Women and children exposed for long hours to wood-smoke from cooking are liable to suffer far more than average from emphysema10 and eye diseases. There is significant evidence to show that the perceptible shift from fuelwood to liquid fuel (i.e. kerosene and LPG) and to electricity in many of the PICs has provided women with cleaner and more efficient energy for cooking. This shift is however as yet partial, and has generally occurred amongst the relatively affluent and is limited to urban areas.

The use of LPG for cooking is gaining popularity among women in urban communities, as it is convenient and clean, but can be accessed only by those who have a regular household income. Contributing to the declining use of biomass for fuel in urban areas is the fact that access is becoming difficult in urbanised atolls and in cities (for example in Port Moresby in PNG and Honiara in the Solomon Islands). However, biomass is still plentifully and cheaply available in rural areas. Where fuelwood must be purchased in urban markets, women may have more free time (as they are not out gathering wood), but they also must spread their limited household budgets further to pay for the fuel. Not surprisingly, it is the poorer households that are the main users of wood for cooking, in urban areas. The use of liquid fuel for lighting is common in those PICs with largely un-electrified rural areas. Although these fuels are cleaner than biomass (which is still widely used for lighting in PNG and some other rural areas of Melanesia) they still pose health and safety risks for women, particularly in their role as caregivers for children and the elderly. Apart from exposure to the fumes from inefficient kerosene and benzine appliances, there have been many incidents of fires, mainly caused by wick-type kerosene lights. Women\u2019s access to energy is typically seen in the context of cooking fuel. As the study entitled, \u2018Addressing gender concerns in energy for poverty reduction in the Asia-Pacific region\u2019 points out, there is an implicit assumption that the benefits of electricity are gender neutral. This is not correct, as women perceive the need for and use of electricity quite differently from Not surprisingly, it is the poorer households that are the main users of wood for cooking, in urban areas. 26 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES men. In general, women have less access to productivity-enhancing resources, such as labour, collateral, credit facilities, information and training. These inequalities often restrict women\u2019s ability to benefit from available opportunities. Hence, it cannot be assumed a priori that energy interventions that benefit men will necessarily benefit women as well. Special enabling conditions may need to be created to ensure that women are able to access modern energy services and benefit from them equitably (UNDP 2006b). The same study details an example from the Western Solomon Islands, where the management of a community- owned micro hydro system by women has meant substantial benefits in terms of lighting, education, increased incomes and empowerment. Few energy-based rural entrepreneurs Although there is little data regarding rural energy-based entrepreneurship, it is clear that the number of entrepreneurs is few. The most widespread forms of entrepreneurship are in the collection of fuelwood, for sale in \u25a0 To reduce the time spent collecting fuelwood for cooking and on the cooking process, so as to help rural women free up time for income generating activities. \u25a0 Gender issues in the context of the provisioning of energy services are not a priority for PIC governments. \u25a0 Inadequate gender segregated information, and insufficient research on energy and gender linkages is an impediment to the development of gender sensitive approaches and policies. The absence of gender analysis of energy projects makes it difficult to design energy projects to fit gender needs. \u25a0 There are limited internal technical, human and institutional capacities to carry out gender analysis. \u25a0 Women in the Pacific are generally unaware or uninterested in energy and gender/energy linkages. \u25a0 There is limited representation of women in the energy sector. \u25a0 Cultural restrictions influence role assignation, to the detriment of women. \u25a0 There is unequal participation of men and women in decision-making. \u25a0 Government national budgets do not provide for energy and gender projects and initiatives adequately. This is a corollary to the fact that gender is not recognized as a national priority in development plans.

Such enterprises are also found (though to a smaller extent) in RMI, Solomon Islands, Tonga and the Cook Islands. Insufficiently developed markets, low internal technical competencies and the inability of such enterprises to offer after sales service and to keep pace with changing technologies make it difficult for enterprises to remain viable for any length of time, and there is a high turnover; energy businesses focusing on rural markets typically last five years or less. In Tonga, Fiji and PNG, there are solar water heater assemblers or manufacturers that cater primarily to urban markets. In the rural and largely unserved areas of Melanesia, owners of private generators provide electricity for a fee to neighbouring homes or businesses. In Melanesia, as well as in other PICs, rural businesses that use or operate electrical equipment (video parlours for example) tend to operate their own energy sources, using diesel generating sets or solar PV equipment. There are clearly opportunities for energy entrepreneurship development in the rural areas, especially in the larger PICs. It is however not likely that the needed investments will come from rural entrepreneurs, at present. The experience of small rural energy development projects implemented through the private sector, as in PNG has however been encouraging and could serve as a model for other countries. PICs do not have special programmes that provide finance, advisory services or other active support to rural small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and can assist the provision of energy access in rural areas through rural energy entrepreneurship. Most PICs have \u2018development banks\u2019, but few loans have been given for rural energy development or for financing productive uses of energy. A major problem for rural SME finance is the need for collateral. Typically land is the only significant asset held by rural residents and in most PICs there is no clear title for the individual A major problem for rural SME finance is the need for collateral. 28 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES ownership of land that can be transferred to a bank in the case of default on a land secured loan. Thus there is little capacity in the PICs for the development of poverty alleviation through energy entrepreneurship. Some regional non-governmental organizations (NGOs), notably the Foundation for the People of the South Pacific, International (PSPI) have attempted rural business development but without great success and without any focus on energy entrepreneurship. The Women in Business NGO in Samoa has been developing a project proposal to develop cottage industries to make bio-fuel, which can be used as cooking fuel to replace kerosene. There is reportedly a similar women\u2019s NGO initiative in the Solomon Islands. The UNDP/GEF-supported Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) pilot project in Fiji aims to contract private RESCOs to manage rural electrification projects that are capitalized by the government. The RESCO structure followed in Fiji remains a small pilot model covering about 700 households and has plans to reach 5,000 households over the next few years. The ultimate goal is to reach over 10,000 households. The success of the RESCO/public private partnership (PPP) concept in Fiji depends on the private sector\u2019s capacity to install, maintain and provide customer support for individual solar home systems in rural areas and the capacity and will on the part of the Department of Energy (DOE) to properly support and regulate RESCO operations. Some capacity has been developed, but for large scale implementation much more capacity will be needed. The Fiji Cabinet has approved the concept of RESCO, though enabling legislation has stalled. Unfortunately, no other PIC has specific policies promoting decentralised energy based entrepreneurship. The Kiribati Solar Energy Company (SEC) is a government owned RESCO in operation since 1989 and currently operates and maintains over 2,000 solar home systems on rural islands and hopes to expand to over 4,000 rural homes (about 40 percent of rural households) over the next decade. RESCO based rural electrification not only provides electricity to households, it also creates approximately one new job for every hundred households it serves.

There appears to be significant opportunity in Fiji, PNG and Vanuatu for rural energy access development through private sector involvement, but at present the market is poorly developed. \u25a0 Information on rural energy based SME is spread largely through word of mouth or personal observations. There is no institutionalized system that collates, analyzes, presents and disseminates the relevant information. Thus potential entrepreneurs are unable to make informed choices. \u25a0 The experience with private sector entry is nascent and insufficiently documented. Privately operated rural electrification is perceived to be a high-risk and insufficient return activity, in the absence of cross- subsidisation or other mechanisms. \u25a0 Small and dispersed markets limit the potential afforded by scale and concentration. \u25a0 PICs do not have special programmes for the provision of finance, advisory services or other active support for the development of energy access or energy entrepreneurship in rural areas. \u25a0 There is insufficient recognition of the advantages of promoting and encouraging decentralized energy-based entrepreneurship, for the entrepreneurs and to the rural economies, in the energy policies which are being developed or are already in place. Except for Fiji, no PIC has initiated specific programmes for developing decentralized energy based entrepreneurship. BOX 11: KEY ISSUES IN ENERGY-BASED RURAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP Constraints to finance for rural energy interventions National and local government budgets for rural energy development have been insufficient to provide full access to modern energy supplies, in particular in the Melanesian countries. For instance, in the case of PNG and the Solomon Islands, the rural population appears to be increasing faster than the increase in electricity access. Despite the fact that most PICs have reasonably developed commercial banking facilities, none of these banks have any finance for energy activities that is based on loan-terms that are different from ordinary commercial loans. There are no financial institutions in the PICs that provide finance for energy activities at the local level except on a fully-secured basis. None of the commercial banks have finance options for energy based on more favorable terms than commercial loans. 30 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES With commercial banks typically absent in rural communities, micro- finance emerges as an important avenue of finance for rural energy development at the household level. Yet, none of the micro-finance schemes operating in the region include finance for energy systems or energy entrepreneurs specifically and there is little experience with such finance. By far the most effective micro-finance scheme is \u2018friend and family finance\u2019. Loan and gift financing by family members for the purchase of appliances and even PV systems is common in most rural villages. It is not unusual for a family member loacted in an urban area to obtain credit on behalf of a family member in the rural area,or simply to pay the cost of the needed service or product directly. Subsidies for rural energy development are often provided at the national level, though rarely in a transparent and targeted manner. Most PICs have sought to bring down the cost of access to energy by offering subsidies in the form of capital investment grants (e.g. Vanuatu), duty and tax-free fuel for electricity production (e.g. Tonga), exemption from corporate taxes for energy suppliers (e.g. Kiribati) or simply payments from the government treasury to cover energy supply losses (e.g. Tuvalu). In general, the level of subsidy for the supply of electricity has declined over the past two decades, though in many PICs it is still substantial. Direct subsidies for petroleum products are rare, though in some countries (e.g. Kiribati) the cost of delivery to remote areas is subsidized to make fuel prices essentially the same throughout the country. The main international finance agencies operating in the Pacific region are the ADB and the World Bank (WB). In addition, the European Investment Bank (EIB), the French Development Bank (Caisse Francaise de D\u00e9veloppement), the US Import/Export Bank and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation all have had operations in the region.

Most loans have been for grid extensions, not for off-grid power development in low income areas. Japan, European Union (EU), Canada, France, Australia, USA, China, Taiwan and New Zealand have provided large bilateral grants for energy related projects in the PICs. The EU, USA and Japan are the largest donors. UNDP, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the United Nations Economic and Social Commission Subsidies for rural energy development are often provided at the national level, though rarely in a transparent and targeted manner. 31 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), the Global Environment Facility (GEF), etc. have provided grant support for energy related projects to the region supporting mainly studies (including energy resource assessments), capacity building initiatives, enabling activities in the context of international environment conventions and project concept development. Small grants have been provided for energy hardware, mostly solar PV. Nearly all the PICs have incorporated a national development bank intended to provide loans that support national economic development. Usually the interest rate is not lower than normal but the bank is willing to give a loan with lower collateral and for activities with higher risk. Unfortunately the region\u2019s development banks have largely failed to maintain their focus on development oriented investments. In general, they have not been active in supporting energy- related investment though the Kiribati Development Bank has provided key working capital loans to the Solar Energy Company (SEC) and the Fiji Development Bank has shown strong interest in supporting a proposed hydro electric development in Namosi. All PICs have full commercial banking facilities (except in Tokelau where the government provides basic banking services and in Nauru where services are limited by the financial state of the Bank of Nauru). The smaller countries like Niue, Tuvalu, Kiribati have a single full service bank that is partly owned by government and partly by an international commercial bank, based in Australia or New Zealand. The larger countries typically have one or more locally owned banks and one or more international commercial banks (based in the USA, Australia, New Zealand, India or the Philippines). None of these banks have any finance for energy activities with loan terms that are any different from ordinary commercial loans. Typically there is a requirement of at least 75 percent collateral and good credit standing to secure a loan. Credit unions based on employment or on association membership are uncommon but exist in several countries. They are savings institutions that provide small loans for members for consumer purchases and to get over short term cash shortfalls. Instalment-based payment plans and finance are offered by larger retailers for furniture, large appliances and high cost items in the more economically developed PICs. Interest rates are high and loan periods short. Solar water heaters can sometimes be purchased under these plans but in general no energy-related finance is available. BOX 12: BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES IN THE PICS \u2013 ABSENCE OF CREDIT FOR ENERGY RELATED ACTIVITIES 32 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES 14 An electrification survey co-funded by UNESCAP and UNESCO, carried out in Fiji, by the Department of Energy (DoE) at the end of 2005 is one of the few monitoring attempts for at least five years. The main objective of this survey was to investigate actual uses, impact and operation and maintenance problems of electrification in remote areas. With regard to productive uses, an assumption on how poverty reduction can be linked to the productive use of electricity in villages was an important factor under investigation. The survey included 70 villages in Fiji, 35 with grid electrification, 30 with diesel electrification and five with renewable energy-sourced electrification. Preliminary results indicate that there are few uses of electricity (beyond lighting and food storage in shops) that can be considered as income-generating activities in the rural areas of Fiji. \u25a0 Insufficient national and local budgetary provisioning (in particular in the Melanesian countries) for rural energy development has slowed the growth of access to energy. \u25a0 None of the full commercial banks offer any long-term finance for energy activities on loan terms that are more favourable than ordinary commercial loans. Thus the option of resorting to commercial bank finance is expensive and often unavailable. \u25a0 Land is generally not available as collateral in the Pacific, since individual land titles either do not exist or are often of dubious legal validity. \u25a0 Soft-loans from international finance agencies have been limited to relatively large infra-structure projects focusing on utility power grids.

In addition, M&E rarely continues beyond the closure of the project and therefore the longer term impact on people and communities including poverty reduction cannot be assessed and even information that would enable such assess- ment is unavailable.14 The periodic census provides the most comprehensive information regarding type of energy used, type of energy-use appliances owned and information regarding the composition of the household using the 33 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES 15 These surveys are typically based on a sample of households, not on all households as in the census. energy. In addition, at irregular intervals, most PICs carry out a Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) that provides information on the affordability of energy and the sources of income for households15. At the PIC regional level, the Forum Secretariat used to publish petroleum wholesale prices (excluding taxes and import charges) for the PICs. Tools, procedures and guidelines do not exist in the PICs for energy- poverty monitoring, and even general poverty indicators that are used are mainly based on MDGs guidelines and are not well aligned to the poverty issues in the Pacific. In general, there is little regular monitoring and evaluation of the performance of existing energy services (e.g. rural electrification, energy efficiency projects). Equipment installed years ago is often assumed to be still functioning as designed, though spot checks by independent observers indicate that many failures have in fact occurred and the number of households actually receiving project benefits is often much lower than claimed. Limited collection, availability, access and dissemination of detailed energy information In the PICs (as elsewhere) a wide range of accurate and consistently collected data is needed for a correct assessment of key development issues, the formulation of development policies, the practical implementation of polices and programmes, for monitoring results and impacts etc. In the energy sector, data is critical to determine energy imports and exports, for instance, as well as for electricity generation by location or consumption by sector. BOX 14: KEY ISSUES IN POVERTY AND ENERGY MONITORING \u25a0 A number of energy technologies for rural energy access have been deployed (diesel generators, micro-hydro, solar PV and grid extensions) in the larger PICs. There is however little objective information on actual performance, real costs of operation, quality of maintenance and operational status. This makes it difficult to effectively plan and implement technology expansion programmes that are cost-effective, sustainable and provide quality service to rural communities. \u25a0 There is no M&E system in the PICs to study energy-poverty linkages. M&E capacities are typically project related and tools, procedures and guidelines do not exist in the PICs for energy-poverty linkage monitoring and evaluation. Tools, procedures and guidelines do not exist in the PICs for energy- poverty monitoring. 34 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES Despite long term efforts to improve the quality of energy data in the PICs, data remains of poor quality. The data for most PICs is sufficient for \u2018snapshots\u2019 that indicate reasonably well the development situation at the national level at a given time. In general, however, there are few consistent time series datasets that allow accurate estimation of trends, and the availability of disaggregate data by gender, age, geographic location or income group is extremely limited. Social statistics are particularly hard to locate and difficult to use because they are often unreliable or outdated. Researchers have observed a decline in the availability of energy data in many PICs over the past decade. This has been partly due to the increase in the privatization of utilities and other energy suppliers (that has resulted in loss of access to energy sales data) and partly due to the increasingly complex arrangements for energy supply that has accompanied growth. BOX 15: KEY ISSUES IN DATA AND INFORMATION REGARDING ENERGY \u25a0 There has been a decline in the quality and availability of energy data in many PICs over the past decade.

Data reporting is often of poor quality with obvious inconsistencies, data often is not made available until long after collection, and private energy suppliers often refuse to provide energy production and sales information. Data received from different sources regarding the same transactions (e.g. from petroleum product importers and from customs) are often inconsistent. \u25a0 In general the staff of PIC energy offices, and often national planning offices, does not do a great deal of analysis and possibly therefore maybe be unconvinced of the practical value of good data. \u25a0 Poor data leads to poor analysis of issues and problems. Researchers have observed a decline in the availability of energy data in many PICs over the past decade. 35 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries THE CHALLENGES O Facilitating access to modern energy ne of the key factors for addressing poverty concerns is to enhance the reach of energy institutions to rural and remote areas. The PICs can explore a variety of practices being developed in the region. For example, the PPP process formulated in Fiji under their RESCO concept can be replicated in other countries. RMI is developing an off-grid rural electrification mechanism that provides for technical support and general management through an urban utility and this model may also be appropriate for replication. Another example is allowing private independent power producers (IPPs) to establish new rural electrification grids or manage existing rural power plants at government centres (for example PNG\u2019s C centres or Fiji\u2019s PWD-managed provincial power systems). Such intervention in principle could result in both improved quality of existing rural electrification and significant expansion of rural electrification. However, the PICs must establish practical regulatory mechanisms to assure that these services are provided at an affordable and fair price to rural consumers while ensuring that the private operators make a profit. In order that the PICs provide sustainable and affordable access to modern energy to the lower income groups, technology options based on indigenous energy sources need to be accorded a higher priority through increased budget allocations and increased staffing of implementing agencies. The private sector needs to be involved if large scale, rapid implementation is to be achieved. To encourage private sector participation, programmes that provide for rural finance, technical capacity building, business capacity building and PPPs can be developed. To help reduce poverty and hardship, the provision of energy services in the PICs should focus on the cost of providing an affordable basic service, not the cost of providing a kWh (the unit metered and sold) of electricity or a litre of kerosene. Bio-fuel and solar energy are two indigenous energy sources that can improve the lives of the poor, if the interventions are well designed. A national bio-fuels programme to replace a significant proportion of imported diesel fuel or petrol can be justified in part because it creates rural employment. The restoration of degraded coconut plantations, for example, would create many new jobs and would help in the reduction of poverty. Solar energy can help to reduce hardship in the remote islands of the Pacific, by providing a small amount of low voltage direct current (DC) power (to meet basic lighting needs and radio access) for a few hours per day to a large number of households. This would be more effective than providing a smaller number of families with the higher installed cost but MEETING THE CHALLENGES The private sector needs to be involved if large scale, rapid implementation is to be achieved. 36 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries MEETING THE CHALLENGES superior service of essentially unlimited, 24-hour grid-connected alternating current (AC) power or diesel generators powering a village or small area grid (see Box 16). BOX 16: BIO-FUEL AND SOLAR ENERGY \u2013 EMERGING OPTIONS FOR SOME PICS Bio-fuel Currently most PICs are interested in relatively large-scale local production of bio-fuels, primarily to reduce the volume and cost of importing refined petroleum fuels. The way in which bio-fuel industries are developed and structured has a large impact on long-term viability, rural employment and poverty reduction. However, locally produced fuels will not necessarily be cheaper than imported petroleum fuels for the public, due to higher costs than expected, government awarding a monopoly concession for local production or distribution or other reasons. Bio-fuel production could be financially and economically successful for the country, but may have a positive or negative impact on poverty depending on how production is organized or regulated.

Though the end cost of the product could be slightly higher, all the value added will be retained locally rather than most of it being distributed to the overseas investors. Solar energy The provision of solar energy can be a viable option in the more remote islands of the Pacific. Grid extensions into remote areas almost always cost much more per household than do home sized solar PV systems. Surveys of remote rural areas indicate that even with full grid electrification, few households use more energy than is provided by a much less-expensive PV installation and there are hardly any instances of the use of the extra capacity available from the grid supply to develop local income generating businesses. Diesel based mini-grids are even less likely to be cost-effective since they can rarely be operated for more than a few hours a day, due to the very high fuel and repair costs typical in remote areas of the Pacific. Thus financing mechanisms that allow rural households with money income (plantation workers, government employees, shop owners, etc.) suitable finance to obtain solar PV should be developed as an alternative to high cost subsidies for grid extensions and local mini-grid construction. 37 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries MEETING THE CHALLENGES Another constraint in addressing poverty concerns by means of modern energy is that access to petroleum products on remote islands is often unreliable, due to poor management of local stocks. A programme to develop fuel management capacity in remote areas would be useful along with the development of an innovative financing scheme to finance improved fuel storage and distribution mechanisms. The special case of Melanesia Although expanding household access to electricity rapidly may be beyond the financial and management capacity of the Melanesian countries, rural hardship for many Melanesians could be appreciably reduced by programmes that expand the electricity supply to rural government stations and nearby facilities, especially health centres and schools. An area that donors, international development agencies and regional organizations could take up is to provide to the countries in Melanesia with up-to-date information, case studies and advisory services on effective policies, institutional arrangements, and financial arrangements for sustainable electricity services at remote government posts, health centres and schools. More specifically such assistance could include the following: \u2022 Policy guidelines and examples of \u2018best practices\u2019 and success stories from the rest of the world to motivate central governments to act. \u2022 Assistance to central governments in establishing clear rules regarding subsidies (both capital and operating subsidies, if any), technical standards and the support that the central government can provide to provincial and local authorities. \u2022 Clear guidelines on the services which are appropriate for diesel generators, solar PV and micro-hydro and the relative capital and operating costs of each (although generic case studies may be misleading for micro-hydro which is quite location-specific). \u2022 Guidelines (for central government agencies, local governments etc.) for setting tariffs that are transparent and cover true costs. \u2022 Effective mechanisms for bill collections (including such things as pre-payment metering, local shopkeeper collections and community levies for services). \u2022 Improved methods of training operators in operations and maintenance of the installed systems including a process for re-training when operators change or the technology is upgraded. \u2022 Effective ways of reducing costs by more efficient uses of small amounts of electricity (including efficient compact fluorescent lamps, simple time switches, efficient refrigeration units, etc.). Rural hardship for many Melanesians could be appreciably reduced by expanding the electricity supply to government stations and especially health centres and schools. 38 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries MEETING THE CHALLENGES Compared to other PICs, biomass in the form of wood and woody wastes is the main fuel used for cooking among rural households in Melanesia. \u2018Improved\u2019 household wood stoves have failed throughout the PICs, presumably due to inappropriate design and high costs. Not enough attention has been paid to simple means of keeping smoke away from indoor cooking locations, so as to reduce chronic chest and eye problems among women, who have been cooking with biomass for years. Interventions in the Melanesian context are required in the following critical areas: \u2022 Case studies or examples that advocate simple ways of reducing smoke in areas, where the household continues to use biomass fuel would be useful.

With such high prices it will be useful to provide advice on how these fuels can be used more effectively and replaced, wherever practical, with local products for lighting and cooking. \u2022 In rural Melanesia, wick-type kerosene lighting and cooking appliances have caused many household fires and resulted in serious injuries and burns. Women and children are the main sufferers. There are no easy or obvious solutions but two areas that need interventions are: i) An attempt should be made to locate and distribute safer and more efficient, yet inexpensive, kerosene appliances. The availability of spare parts also needs attention. ii) Research into the design of cost effective and safe appliances which use coconut oil or other local fuels for lighting and cooking should be undertaken. In addition, it would be appropriate to demonstrate effective models for improving energy access in rural Melanesia, not as stand-alone projects, but integrated with NGO or government programmes. The effort could include broad ranging public awareness programmes engaging provincial and local politicians, linking with other community-based infrastructure, and other local programme initiatives in the areas of health, education, etc. Although such studies and guidelines will be especially appropriate for Melanesia, most will also be useful for other PICs. Some recommendations concerning possible measures that can be taken in different areas to increase energy access are listed below. These recommendations have been prepared by key national and local stakeholders in the Solomon Islands, but they can be applied to the other Researching the design and cost effectiveness of safe appliances which use coconut oil or other local fuels for lighting and cooking should be undertaken. 39 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries MEETING THE CHALLENGES Melanesian states as well. The applicability of the recommendations to the smaller island states is more limited due to the different levels of rural development and experience with rural energy systems. However for those Micronesian states that still have a relatively large un-electrified rural population (like RMI and FSM), these recommendations are quite relevant. Specific recommendations include16: \u2022 Complete the national energy policy that is being developed and put it into effect, so that there is a known basis for action that will be consistently followed. \u2022 Revise enabling legislation for the national power authority, so as to make it possible for the private sector to generate its own power without penalty. \u2022 Bio-fuel development offers an excellent opportunity for indigenous energy development and rural income generation and should therefore receive the highest priority from the government and the donor community. The government should provide incentives for the development of bio-fuels for transport and electricity generation, including cross subsidies through differential taxation of fuels, to keep bio-fuels competitive with imported fuels as imported fuel prices change. In addition there should be a move by the government to replace the use of diesel-fuel for land and sea transport with locally produced bio-fuels wherever technically practical and possible (as has been done in Vanuatu). \u2022 The national power authority should be required to maintain a specific percentage of its generation from indigenous energy sources, and this percentage should increase over time at a realistic rate. Government and donors will need to assist the national power authority to access the finance and technical support required to provide the hydro and other renewable energy resource development necessary to meet this requirement. \u2022 Develop and implement models for hydro and geothermal development that provide appropriate compensation to land owners, both initially and over the long term, e.g., partial ownership of energy projects by land holders so income is shared equitably despite inflation, currency revaluations and other changes in the economy. 16 Source: UNDP. 2006a.

Specific programmes for long-term rural capacity- building for energy technology and management will be needed to support any programmes for accelerating rural energy development. This is a continuing need that must be addressed by the national education system. It cannot be addressed by individual projects. Enabling policies and regulation Since many of the PICs have been and are presently being assisted by the SOPAC/UNDP/Government of Denmark PIEPSAP project to establish energy policies, strategies and practical mechanisms, policies to reduce poverty through energy access improvements should be considered and included where appropriate. The PIEPSAP project is committed to assisting PICs develop their own energy policies and to help decision makers develop the necessary practical strategies and plans for policy implementation. In particular, assistance in energy access policy development, strategy and planning should be considered for the FSM, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Specifically, rural electrification policies need to address poverty issues and ensure that the benefits of rural electrification include poverty reduction. Programmes at the regional level to develop capacity within the utilities, (perhaps through the PPA as they have specific experience in this area) to understand, analyse the economics of IPP and competently negotiate contracts with IPPs are needed. Practical generic legislation that requires utilities to accept IPP connections and to set rules for the terms of payment (e.g. relative to marginal cost of generation, type of power source, etc.) should be drafted and provided to PIC governments. Capacity- building for energy technology applications and management is crucial for accelerating rural energy development. 41 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries MEETING THE CHALLENGES What is also needed is to develop guidelines for power purchases from IPPs, that consider marginal cost of power to the public utility, poverty alleviation impacts, power reliability effects, capacity offset for the public utility, cash flows for both partners and national development implications. Regulations and legislation should ensure that IPPs receive a fair power purchase contract from the national utility and also ensure that the financial condition of the utility will not be threatened by the acceptance of the IPP power. For instance in Fiji, PNG, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and possibly other PICs, it may be appropriate to develop legislation and regulations which allow IPPs to provide energy using mini-grids to remote locations and government stations. Ensuring that an effective regulatory mechanism is in place is important in this context. At the policy level, it would be useful to facilitate PIC governments and utilities with the development of tariff structures and connection policies, that have the effect of allowing low-income consumers to access grid supplied electricity. Through regional programmes, e.g. PIEPSAP, PIC governments should be advised of the effects of a national electricity tariff on the development of the private sector generation that is needed to improve electricity access outside the existing national utility system. Any advisory services on tariff reform should also assess the value to the utility of \u2018lifeline tariffs\u2019 including advice on tariff structures, which can meet a lifeline objective and at the same time be implemented at a \u2018least cost\u2019 to the utility. Enabling programme framework It is often assumed that the provision of electricity in the PICs, combined with micro-credit finance opportunities and basic business training will result in higher incomes in the rural areas. Some village based micro-hydro and bio-fuel initiatives in the PICs have assumed that improved energy sources will result in the production of more or better goods and services, in turn resulting in cash income for the community. This assumption is based in part on the Asian experience. While initiatives like these have worked in some developing countries, there is evidence this may not be the case in the Pacific. Therefore before widespread programmes of improved energy provision to PICs are carried out, based on these expectations, it would be useful to assess past initiatives and apply any appropriate lessons. In general, PICs need to establish improved energy services in a manner that genuinely helps to alleviate poverty/hardship, and this will require a good deal of case-by- case analysis. Based as far as possible on existing studies, e.g. Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HEIS), recent household energy use Regulations and legislation should ensure that IPPs receive a fair power purchase contract from the national utility. 42 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries MEETING THE CHALLENGES surveys and census data, comprehensive studies are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03292403-c5ae-4027-a97a-2e51dea6f73b": {"__data__": {"id_": "03292403-c5ae-4027-a97a-2e51dea6f73b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f3914285dd893af2932633fec911fd4b2ccb7af4d6da04d76bca040d6d8778d"}}, "hash": "2f3914285dd893af2932633fec911fd4b2ccb7af4d6da04d76bca040d6d8778d", "text": "required that will document the relationship(s) between poverty and energy services (use, cost, availability) and household income an/or expenditure and energy services. The analysis should assess and determine whether there are \u2018cause and effect relationships\u2019 and if so how important they are. If poverty alleviation is an objective, as it should be, it is important to integrate the energy supply project with other activities that support development of the capacity of the recipient community to use the energy for generating income. This income must necessarily be sufficient to at least offset the resources that are expended for obtaining and using the energy supply. Without increasing village net income, it is possible for the provision of electricity to increase the net outflow of cash from the community as a result of families purchasing electrical appliances and then paying for the energy; a process that may increase monetary poverty in the community which has access to electricity. Thus in order to focus on the linkages between energy access and hardship/poverty reduction in the PICs, a key starting point is the development of regional, sub-regional or national programmes that enhance the understanding of such linkages. An important part of that understanding is through the review of earlier local, national and regional energy programmes and the impact on poverty that they have had, i.e., developing an understanding of the programme specific factors that determine whether poverty conditions have improved, remained unaffected or have worsened by energy interventions. There are many NGOs, government agencies and international agencies working in the PICs, in the area of poverty reduction. Their work, as it relates to energy linkages, needs to be compiled and shared among the PICs. It is important to understand the complementary programmes that may be needed to facilitate poverty reduction through energy access improvement, such as market development, entrepreneurial capacity development, infrastructure development, etc. It is also essential to separate cause and effect relationships. Programmes directed primarily toward PNG, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, FSM, RMI and Kiribati should focus on developing those areas, where it has been shown that improving energy access will work to reduce poverty. Rural electrification programmes that tend to increase poverty due to increasing community obligations, without increasing access to ways to meet those obligations should be avoided. Though there are significant linkages between energy service provisioning and hardship/poverty reduction in the PICs, in general they are not the focus of regional or international organizations active in the It is important to integrate the energy supply project with other activities that support development of the capacity of the recipient community to use the energy for generating income. 43 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries MEETING THE CHALLENGES Pacific. Poverty alleviation through energy access provision needs to be placed on the agenda of such entities. Bilateral and multilateral donor organisations in the Pacific and regional agencies should work together, for example, to develop a long-range donor assistance programme plan that includes planned development and coordination of major Pacific donor programmes. This will ensure that \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018soft\u2019 components are balanced and implemented in a manner that is complementary rather than the implementation of programmes in isolation, as has been the case in the past. Duplication of effort needs to be minimised, national priorities require to be addressed and cross-sectoral conflicts in energy development must be avoided. Regional as well as national programmes should be developed interactively with countries and not developed internally by bilateral and multilateral donor organisations and regional agencies. While this may mean considerable additional effort and cost for the donors, the long term benefits through fewer failed projects and more efficient use of project money should more than compensate. PICs need to more closely scrutinize donor projects and reject those that do not fit into their long term programme of energy development. PICs should insist that donor projects are technically appropriate, utilize components consistent with those already in use, genuinely meet the needs of the recipients and that programme delivery be customized to fit each country\u2019s needs in terms of timing, technology and type of implementation. Countries should use the numerous meetings and forums to demand real cooperation among the donor organisations and regional agencies, information-sharing among regional energy organisations and refuse to take part in programmes that do not address their needs. Countries need to have well defined energy policies and be willing to allocate the needed resources for sustaining the donor projects they agree to accept.

A comprehensive regional study or a dedicated programme should be implemented to determine the viability of bio-fuel production in the PICs, emphasizing economic and financial viability and the development of mechanisms to assure decent conditions of employment for those who produce the feedstock and the fuels. This should address technical issues (e.g. the scale of production required to be viable; the suitability of various crops as fuels including coconut, oil palm, jatropha (jatropha curcas)), logistic concerns, likely impacts on the cost and the availability of vegetable oils at various petroleum price levels, the impact on employment Regional as well as national programmes should be developed interactively with countries. 44 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries MEETING THE CHALLENGES creation and possible entrepreneurial activities. The programme will need to investigate warranty issues for generators and technical problems with various bio-fuels and mixtures, as diesel and petrol replacements for power and transport. As far as possible, the programme should incorporate findings of national bio-fuel studies currently underway including those implemented by SOPAC (some with funding from UNDP). The results should be publicized in the form of information guidelines and tool-kits, so as to enable the rational development of the bio-fuel industry in the PICs. Identifying and enabling energy-based entrepreneurship opportunities in rural areas The link between energy-based business opportunities and poverty reduction is obvious due to the income generation and employment avenues rural enterprises provide, as well as the life-style improvements that result from access to modern energy. Rural energy surveys like the one carried out in Fiji at the end of 2005 should be carried out for all PICs so as to identify the areas that rural SMEs operate in and the activities undertaken by them to generate income. Augmenting these opportunities by the availability of modern forms of energy is the next challenge. Information needs to be gathered from NGOs and the government in each PIC regarding attempts at energy entrepreneurship for poverty alleviation, as a part of the effort to document and disseminate information about lessons learnt, best practices, problem areas and case studies of both successful and unsuccessful efforts. NGOs and government agencies that are promoting rural business development need to understand the opportunities for energy entrepreneurship and wherever applicable, include this information in their outreach programmes. In addition, an analysis of the opportunities for rural energy based SMEs needs to be carried out. PIC governments, particularly the Melanesian countries, RMI and FSM, need to understand the benefits, opportunities and modalities available for decentralized energy-based entrepreneurship. For those opportunities that have a good chance of success, programmes should be considered and commercial banks should provide development finance through loan guarantee funds or other risk mitigation arrangements. Further assistance needs to be made available to the Melanesian and RMI governments and the FSM state governments to develop policies that promote decentralized energy based entrepreneurship. For Fiji, RMI, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands and PNG there is little likelihood of large scale An analysis of the opportunities for rural energy based SMEs needs to be carried out. 45 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries MEETING THE CHALLENGES rural electrification being carried out without government subsidy. The RESCO concept used in Kiribati, Tonga, Fiji and RMI provides for capital subsidy but does not subsidize the other components of rural electrification (i.e. operation, maintenance, repair, fee collection, etc.) and is particularly suited to private sector participation in the operation and maintenance of rural electrification systems, a process that typically requires only modest private capital investment. Since a major barrier to private sector entry is the lack of experience with privately operated rural electrification (usually perceived to have a high risk), the RESCO approach places the capital risk on the government and dramatically lowers the risk to the private sector. The experience of RESCO in Fiji should be disseminated throughout the Asia-Pacific region, as a possible approach to decentralized energy-based entrepreneurship based on the PPP concept. However, to retain its leadership position, Fiji should develop a \u2018proof of concept\u2019 project involving over 2,000 households for RESCO concept verification, and if appropriate, introduce modifications to reduce the risk. In Fiji, PNG, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and possibly other PICs, it may be appropriate to develop legislation and regulations, which allow IPPs to provide energy to remote locations and government stations, where currently mini-grids provide power to local communities. An effective regulatory mechanism is important and will need to be concurrently developed.

Trial projects for rural production of coconut oil and the use of coconut oil for rural electrification are underway but have shown mixed results so far. A rural franchise structure has been proposed for coconut oil production in the Solomon Islands. Under this approach, a community can purchase a franchise to produce coconut oil. In return a mini-oil mill is installed by the parent company and the community is electrified by a diesel mini-grid using coconut oil for fuel. The parent company will provide maintenance support on a monthly basis and oil not used in the village will be purchased by the company at a guaranteed price. This approach allows rural dwellers to utilize their existing coconut resources \u2013 and any new resource they wish to create \u2013 and improve both their income and their access to energy, without the social problems that giant industrial plantations create for their workers. The experience of RESCO in Fiji should be disseminated throughout the Asia- Pacific region. 46 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries MEETING THE CHALLENGES Incorporating gender concerns National energy policies in the PICs should address women\u2019s energy use and study the impact on the lives of their families and the community. Access to efficient and reliable sources of energy for modern household appliances affects the general well-being of the family. As primary caretakers of the family\u2019s welfare, women can have more time available for their personal development and for greater participation in the community, if their households have access to electrical appliances such as refrigerators for food preservation, electric irons, efficient stoves for cooking, sewing machines and other labour saving appliances. Where ever excessive time is spent to obtain fuel-wood, alternative cooking fuels or more efficient use of available fuel-wood should be actively pursued. The availability of reliable electricity can open up opportunities for small scale cottage industries for women involving sewing, baking and handicrafts, although (as already stressed) factors other than access to energy can constrain such opportunities. Women\u2019s capacity to earn an income and be more economically independent can elevate their position in the family and community. Even access to television news can enhance women\u2019s capacity to make independent and better-informed decisions about community issues and be less dependent on the opinions and ideas of the men in the household. Improved access to services, including that provided through better energy supply, can contribute towards gender equality and empowerment of women, reduce poverty and improve the overall development of impoverished areas. Improved energy services to low-income PIC households have clear and positive gender impacts. Generic actions required to strengthen and mainstream gender considerations in PICs include (ENERGIA 2006): \u2022 Mainstream gender into national energy policies and planning, including the provision of assistance on the implementation of existing policies at all levels; from government to community. \u2022 The language used in energy and gender policy statements should be clear, gender sensitive and inclusive. \u2022 Enhance and support data collection on gender and energy, including document gender impact of different energy types and technology choices. \u2022 Promote productive use of energy in the rural areas, especially for income generating activities or small businesses for women. \u2022 Increase awareness of energy and gender issues, especially at the rural community level through dissemination of information. Improved energy services to low-income PIC households have clear and positive gender impacts. 47 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries MEETING THE CHALLENGES \u2022 Recognize the need for improved gender and energy training and capacity building at different levels, through a range of methods including gender awareness training for government officials (for energy officers for example) and other stakeholders; gender training at the community level; \u2018train the trainer\u2019 training within communities and seek training opportunities for women in energy technologies. \u2022 Community participation (including men, women, youth and children) is critical for the success of rural electrification programmes. \u2022 Relevant NGOs in the Pacific region need to be encouraged to include energy as one of their focus areas. \u2022 Identify and provide financial support including micro-credit facilities for work in the energy and gender field, and the development of appropriate and client oriented technologies. Promoting the financial viability of rural energy projects Financial institutions need to fully understand the risks of finance for rural energy development. Workshops and training programmes are needed that are directed to helping financial institutions understand the real costs and benefits of rural energy development, particularly with regard to renewable energy. PIC financing institutions, in particular commercial and development banks should be assisted to develop methodologies to evaluate the risks for rural finance (for energy access", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbee0867-1cf3-4ef4-8238-9cece9caab8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "cbee0867-1cf3-4ef4-8238-9cece9caab8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4505c90a4c41703ea6a977e2862186d418ebf993d8264a5857942d731cb2b6cb"}}, "hash": "4505c90a4c41703ea6a977e2862186d418ebf993d8264a5857942d731cb2b6cb", "text": "and for energy efficiency) at all levels. Loan officials should be given training in the technology, application and financial aspects of energy investments. Risk mitigation programmes should be established including partial loan guarantees (effectively increasing collateral), interest rebates (allowing banks to charge higher rates to offset risk) and soft loans to development banks (lowering the cost of money for loans and allowing a lower interest rate to the customer). It is likely that subsidies will continue to remain an important part of rural energy development, but PIC governments usually have little understanding of the relationship between subsidies, poverty reduction and project sustainability. Simplified but useable models that show the relationship between energy subsidies, economic development and poverty for each PIC should be developed and training in the use of the model to analyse different subsidy strategies and policies should be provided. Text materials and training in economic and financial analysis of energy projects of various types should be provided to energy officers. Micro-finance programmes are needed that focus on finance to support rural energy entrepreneurs and for consumers to purchase energy delivery systems and appliances. Micro-finance NGOs and PIC financing institutions should be assisted to develop methodologies to evaluate the risks of finance for rural energy development. 48 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries MEETING THE CHALLENGES agencies should be assisted to better understand the need for finance for rural energy entrepreneurs as well as the demand from consumers to enable them to purchase energy delivery systems and appliances. Loan funds and risk mitigation programmes directed at micro-finance institutions lending for energy related activities should be provided. Simplified corporate models for PIC utilities that allow utilities to determine supply costs under different conditions of loading, fuel pricing and collection rates should also be developed and disseminated. Developing tools and models for monitoring and evaluation of energy and poverty linkages Since the impact of energy access on poverty reduction is to be assessed, there is a need to establish a base-line for the project target groups for both poverty/hardship (using the Pacific understanding of poverty) and energy access. Energy/poverty indicators appropriate to the Pacific that can be used to determine the improvement (or worsening) of poverty in areas provided with improved access should be developed. Such indicators should be included for long term monitoring of energy access projects. Poverty and energy linkages and monitoring and evaluation needs to be integrated in new projects and post project surveys, for those projects that focus on poverty, energy and gender. These links should extend well beyond the formal conclusion of the project. The PICs need to design and implement an M&E system for energy- poverty linkages. Since the Pacific has a different definition of poverty from most other developing regions, a special set of tools and procedures will be needed in the Pacific sub-region that includes non monetary (health, education, nutrition etc.) as well as monetary indicators. Additionally, a policy framework needs to be developed for the incorporation of a decentralized M&E system, accompanied by tools that can assess the impact of energy services on poverty. To aid in the efficient collection of data, regional efforts to increase capacity development activities for the PICs in this area should be initiated. Funding is also needed for the conduct of rural energy surveys in the PICs. This will enable policy-makers to ascertain the actual uses of energy in rural areas, understand the energy-poverty links and then focus on strategies that impact positively on poverty. The PICs need to design and implement an M&E system for energy- poverty linkages. 49 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries MEETING THE CHALLENGES T CONCLUSION he Pacific Island Countries present development challenges that are not easy to address. Their isolation and remoteness combined with the limited infrastructure makes the provision of energy services both difficult and expensive. Despite a number of similarities, the requirements of these nations vary considerably and it is important to recognize this and design policies and projects keeping in mind the specific requirement of a country. A number of new initiatives have emerged in the recent past, in the Pacific region itself, which can be emulated and adapted, so as to expand the reach of energy services to the people. Increased access to energy will help to reduce poverty and hardship in the region. Initiatives related to energy provisioning and poverty reduction should be undertaken through a participatory process, with the close involvement of national governments and local stakeholders, if they are to be successful. 50 Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries REFERENCES17 17 It should be noted that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "863d760b-4991-40c6-bc7c-6ab11376f602": {"__data__": {"id_": "863d760b-4991-40c6-bc7c-6ab11376f602", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in the Pacific Island Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df6ba3ddef9a020f3643a510b05d1bf2d5d4588978db420d76e013bf7c3a0917"}, "3": {"node_id": "46689837-ff9b-4431-bc1e-d219ad6adcc0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-pacific-island-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae4198bb4493a81da1400a03e5c81fe9c789743d48226193bc24ab129b633eca"}}, "hash": "00e4892061ab580ac9d1e58c75cdf1ca5cb1c2bdad627d9c41ae3eb61a763e6e", "text": "only key documents are referenced.

Access to affordable modern energy services can improve their productivity and enhance their living standards. Even so, there are no specific targets for the energy sector in the Millennium Declaration, a historic document signed seven years ago by the world\u2019s leaders. Affordable and sustainable modern energy services are a necessity for countries to meet their Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Efforts of the countries in the Asia-Pacific region to meet these aims will be hindered unless adequate attention is paid to the crucial role energy services play in the development process. This is particularly true for the economic, environmental and social well-being of the poor. With fluctuating energy prices, the poor in many countries in the Asia and Pacific region face a daunting future. For them, access to affordable and essential modern energy services, which could improve their living conditions and ensure a means to earn a living, will fall outside their reach. Recognizing the urgency for countries to factor in access to modern energy services, particularly when shaping national poverty reduction initiatives, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provided technical and financial support for national-level rapid energy assessments. The primary aim of this work, carried out through the UNDP\u2019s Regional Energy Programme for Poverty Reduction (REP-PoR) and completed in 2006, was to identify gaps and priority needs in linking energy services provision with poverty reduction. The framework for rapid gap assessments linking energy and poverty was developed as a joint effort of the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok (RCB) and UNDP country offices in the region, with the support of experts from the region. The draft framework was discussed at two sub-regional meetings, one held in Bangkok, Thailand (August 2005), and the other in Apia, Samoa (September 2005). The meetings were helpful in customizing the framework to suit specific needs and circumstances of the participating countries. FOREWORD v Energy and Poverty in the Philippines Subsequently, the UNDP country offices held national-level stakeholder consultations to consolidate the findings and recommendations of the assessments. This work benefited immensely from the support of government officials and representatives of civil society. Documented in individual country reports, this work serves as a resource and reference material for programming and planning for access to modern energy services for the underserved, particularly, the poor. This document is a summary of the Country Report on the Philippines and is part of a series of REP-PoR\u2019s Asia-Pacific publications. It draws on the key findings of the country report, summarizes the challenges faced at the national level, and provides priority recommendations. Specifically, critical issues related to energy policy, including institutional structures, regulatory frameworks, priority programmes, financing measures, gender concerns, as well as monitoring and evaluation support are highlighted. It offers a way forward, outlining issues and options for the country. Our hope is that this document will be of relevance to national policy- makers, development partners, energy service providers, civil society organizations, and academia in implementing various measures to promote access to modern energy services for the poor.

This study is particularly valid in the context of the Philippines, where income poverty is among the highest in South-East Asia. In fact, more than one-third of the population lives below the poverty line, despite gains in poverty alleviation over the last decade. There is also a significant urban\u2013rural divide, both in terms of socio-economic development and income per capita. Despite its archipelagic geography, the country has shown a good electrification rate. At the national level, 62 percent of households are electrified. This is matched by 92 percent electrification at the level of barangays. The data reflect that all municipalities are fully electrified. Nonetheless, most low-income households cannot still afford modern energy services. Firewood and biomass residues are their main fuel sources. Currently, rural poor rely on firewood for meeting 55 percent of their energy needs and another 25 percent of their needs is met from biomass residues. This study examines critical energy issues in the Philippines, including the institutional structure of the energy sector, policy and regulatory frameworks, and sectoral programmes. It analyses reasons for the narrow reach of energy services to rural provinces, high dependence on traditional fuels and inefficient technologies, restricted supply of energy by rural energy enterprises and inadequate means of financing for increased energy access. The report examines absence of gender-based energy issues in rural energy projects and programmes. It highlights the urgent need for key data and indicators to support monitoring and evaluation of energy access for areas and people who are least served. PREFACE vii Energy and Poverty in the Philippines viii Energy and Poverty in the Philippines This report concludes that lack of national-level coordinating mechanisms constrain the targeted provision of energy services for poor communities and meeting the MDGs in the Philippines. In particular, the current situation reflects that having several policies with no synergies and coordination among them may lead to weak regulatory environment. By having policy convergence through consultative and coordinating mechanisms at the institutional level could synergize energy development strategies with poverty reduction objectives and distribute benefits towards improved access to modern energy services more equitably. Improved coordination mechanisms targeting all energy sector players and specific policy convergence can bring about rural development. Promising energy initiatives can and do exist in the Philippines. A new institutional framework and mechanism to handle the remaining inaccessible areas in rural electrification has been established under the Expanded Rural Electrification Program that will address not only rural electrification to remaining barangays and households but also policy formulation and integration to achieve the targets. Renewable energy sources, which contribute to 28 percent of the country\u2019s energy requirement, have become increasingly popular. Using the renewable energy policy framework for on- and off-grid areas, the Department of Energy (DoE) aims to double renewable energy contribution during the next 10 years. With regard to access to financing, the Government has launched a programme to support new financial mechanisms aiming at encouraging rural development through small enterprises. Under the new mechanisms, several projects and organizations have also incorporated business development in rural energy services. The commitment of the Government of Philippines to provide electrification in all barangays in the country by 2008 is highly commendable. These initiatives must be complemented, however, with strong efforts towards providing poor households with access to alternative sources of modern fuels and efficient, hazard-free energy technology. Apart from carrying out the renewable energy plan, the Government should also promote sustainable use of fuelwood and traditional biomass resources. Rural electrification programmes should include livelihood projects and income-generating components. More importantly, they should factor in well-targeted pro-poor subsidy and tax policies without distorting energy markets. We trust that this report is unique in terms of giving insights into bridging the gaps between the access to energy and poverty reduction ix Energy and Poverty in the Philippines efforts in Philippines. Our aim is to provide country-specific information on institutional structures, energy resources, policy recommendations, capacity and financial gaps that can point towards a coordinated mechanism for improving access to modern energy services, particularly for the poor.

northern tip of Borneo. The country is divided into three geographical areas: Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. It has 17 regions, 79 provinces, 117 cities, 1,500 municipalities and 41,975 barangays (the smallest administrative unit). A barangay consists of less than 1,000 inhabitants residing within a city or municipality. A barangay is administered by a set of elected officials who are led by a chairperson.

In spite of the marked development over the past 10 years, its rapid population growth of 2.4 percent per annum has strained the limited budgetary resources, thereby impeding the provision and quality of basic social services. Income poverty in the Philippines is among the highest in South-East Asia, with more than one-third of the population living below the poverty line. Poverty incidence in the Philippines has decreased by about 10 percentage points during the period 1985 to 2000. As seen in Figure 1, the decrease is more in urban population (14 percent) than its rural counterpart (4 percent). Source NEDA (2004) This rural\u2013urban divide shows that socio-economic development in rural areas needs greater attention, since most low-income families are located there. The per capita annual energy consumption at 0.29 barrels of fuel oil equivalent (BFOE) in 2003 places the Philippines among the world\u2019s middle-range users. However, the rural population, which comprises about 90 percent of the total population, has very limited access to electricity.

The statistics on household connections and energization of power lines further vary at the level of barangays. According to electrification data of the National Electrification Administration (NEA), while there is complete BACKGROUND 3 Energy and Poverty in the Philippines THE CHALLENGES electrification at the municipal level and 92 percent electrification at the barangay level, the national average of electrified households is only 62 percent. For provinces with low electrification rates (between 13 and 30 percent), improvements in the growth rate of electrification may not take place in the next decade. This could be because of the currently unviable nature of grid extensions carried out by electric cooperatives in these areas. This is particularly true in the island provinces. Other options need to be tried to accomplish the goal of total electrification at the barangay level. The important role of renewable energy (RE) has been recognized, as the country increases its RE capacities in grid and off-grid locations through the use of solar, hydro, biomass, wind and geothermal resources. The Department of Energy (DoE) targets to double its RE-based capacity in the next 10 years, as mentioned in the RE Policy Framework for on- and off-grid areas. The plans include 130 to 250 MW of capacity from solar, biomass and ocean; 2,950 MW of hydropower; 1,200 MW of capacity from geothermal power plants; and 417 MW of wind power generation. In this analysis, it is noteworthy that there is a strong correlation between the levels of electrification and poverty. The challenge for the Philippines to reduce poverty and enhance gender equity can be met by providing access to energy services to about one-third of its population. An assessment of the energy sector puts forth a number of challenges to be met in terms of linking energy and poverty concerns, and providing affordable energy access to the poor. For example, agencies such as the National Power Corporation\u2013Small Power Utilities Group (NPC\u2013SPUG) have found in surveys that electricity is not among the top critical needs of the poor population. Some of these challenges are identified and discussed below. THE CHALLENGES Absence of a designated central body and coordinating mechanism to link energy with poverty T he existing institutional framework for the energy sector is limited primarily to DoE and its affiliates for various functions. Under DoE are the Energy Utilization Management Bureau, the Energy Industry Administration Bureau and the Energy Policy and Planning Bureau. The energy-related programmes of these institutions have concentrated on viable areas with established systems to satisfy financial covenants. Therefore, a new institutional framework and mechanism has been installed under the Expanded Rural Electrification Programme to handle the remaining unviable areas. Table 1 summarizes the institutional framework of rural electrification. There is a strong correlation between the levels of electrification and poverty. 4 Energy and Poverty in the Philippines THE CHALLENGES TABLE 1 INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS IN RURAL/ MISSIONARY ELECTRIFICATION Institution Department of Energy (DoE) Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) National Electrification Administration (NEA) National Power Corporation\u2013 Small Power Utilities Group (NPC/SPUG) Distribution utilities and electric cooperatives Other government agencies, such as the Department of Agrarian Reforms and the Department of Interior and Local Government Role Policy direction, goal setting, programme management and coordination Rate design, licensing and determination of universal charge, and approval from the Missionary Electrification Development Plan in coordination with DoE Administration of electric cooperatives, and project identification and monitoring of missionary electrification projects Project implementation and petitioning for the universal charge for missionary electrification Project implementation and operation Financing support and project implementation While individual agencies carry out some activities that link energy service delivery to poverty reduction, a central coordinating mechanism with unified performance indicators to link these issues is absent. With the Government\u2019s thrust on decentralization, community-level services \u2013 including energy provision \u2013 have been started. Certain local initiatives, using meagre resources, too have been started. Electric cooperatives are unable to extend services to about 38 percent of the households. In most cases, the activities of RE-oriented non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are not coordinated with electric cooperatives that work through franchisees. At the community level, associations among households such as the Barangay Power Association (BAPA) demonstrate important local self-help initiatives. Most of these electricity services are carried out through specific project grants and are not akin to market-based partnerships.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa7a6813-c667-4530-a8c6-75ebaa0fb2e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa7a6813-c667-4530-a8c6-75ebaa0fb2e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-philippines", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in the Philippines", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-philippines", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6033c24a601ca624819ba788d7524e7d55a048660da1c871116016a09c5129f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "ead07269-3233-4dd3-bea0-380bede69ade", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-philippines", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2c493ccf773fd7a9cefb5e92a41217614f243251e1c4559511f50732d7da9d34"}}, "hash": "c4074aaf5972382cd5284aa175f9b55e7cddc263b97b7e87e4744bdbd4af27e8", "text": "For example, the Missionary Electrification Fund from the universal charge (collected from electricity users) is mostly subsidized.

The National Anti-Poverty Commission (NAPC) oversees the integration of poverty reduction approaches into various programmes and project initiatives. Electricity-sector framework present only in viable areas The energy sector programme of the Philippines has been shaped by external factors, including an energy crisis in the early 1970s. It is important to trace the development of energy programme and assess the results of the Government\u2019s efforts achieved in providing energy access to rural and unserved areas. Table 2 presents the policies, programmes and strategies adopted, and helps understand the current situation. These programmes are being implemented in conformity with the country\u2019s archipelagic geography. The geographical conditions constrain the existing energy supply networks for electricity and commercial fuel and, therefore, their reach in rural communities varies from village to village. Moreover, sparsely populated islands and communities face neglect. The usual approach of expanding grid-based electrification cannot be sustained and needs fresh funding or other approaches that could reach the unviable 8 percent of barangays or 38 percent of the households, mostly in remote and poor communities. Gender equity too is also not well addressed in these programmes. Also, even though biomass is the predominant and highly dispersed fuel currently (and expected to be so in the future for rural and poor communities), there are The approach of expanding grid-based electrification cannot be sustained.

Devices such as energy-efficient stoves are not being seen, let alone the adoption of other clean technologies for biomass use. The programme framework for energy and poverty is influenced by challenges of policy and regulatory mechanisms. The current focus on electrification and market-based policies to improve competitiveness does not emphasize specific decentralization of the energy agenda. This is similar to the devolvement of services in health and other services. On the regulatory side, the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) has not yet developed guidelines on the Missionary Electrification (under the Electric Power Industry Reform Act [EPIRA]) regarding issues that are applicable to the energy and poverty linkage. There is no policy on the institutional arrangement for public\u2013private partnership. Many projects (such as Alliance for Mindanao Off-grid Renewable Energy [AMORE], Solar Power Technology Support [SPOTS] Project, Global Village Energy Project [GVEP], Asian Alliance of Appropriate Technology Practitioners [APPROTECH ASIA] and other bilateral ones) have been involved in public\u2013private partnership in energy services for communities. These have involved local groups in cooperation with NGOs and private companies that operate and maintain the energy systems in a sustainable manner. However, the policies have not promoted explicitly public\u2013private partnerships. Absence of synergy in policies that prevent conflicts between programmes, the lack of effective policy development to facilitate innovations and capacity development in energy service delivery continue. These coexist with other initiatives of the Government, such as the proposed enactment of an RE Bill that will provide basic policies for RE development and utilization. BOX 2 KEY CHALLENGES IN PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK P Instead of a Government-funded grid extension to electrify the remaining 8 percent of barangays, new approaches have become necessary. P Renewable energy technology is considered a viable alternative to grid electricity in remote barangays, but there is no specific programme promoting and supporting its use. Limited access to modern energy services in remote inland provinces and sparsely populated islands The objective of all energy- and poverty-related programmes in the Philippines is to provide equitable access to energy for all. Even in the 9 Energy and Poverty in the Philippines THE CHALLENGES most optimistic projection, it is not viable for local electric cooperatives to extend their grids to the unserved areas in the next decade. The prohibitively high cost of electricity produced and distributed through small and inefficient generating sets with high fuel cost has also resulted in limited access to modern energy services in inland provinces and small sparsely populated islands. Access to energy for cooking in the Philippines has been limited by a shortage of supply and the high prices of energy in remote and sparsely populated islands. Most low-income households have little capacity to purchase modern energy, and instead rely heavily on firewood and biomass residues. Currently, the fuel requirements of 55 percent of the rural poor are met by firewood, with another 25 percent being met by biomass residues.

Past studies by Sibol ng Agham at Teknolohiya (SIBAT), APPROTECH ASIA and other NGOs have invariably concluded that patterns of rural energy consumption have many implications with regard to rural development, particularly for poverty reduction and gender issues.

Excessive dependence involves a trade-off in agricultural productivity. P Gathering fuel consumes time, which women and children could otherwise use more productively. P Rural development is hampered by the lack of modern energy supplies. The policy does not rule out the utilization of traditional energy services in rural areas. In fact, as projected, traditional fuels will continue to play a significant role in rural energy usage, with access to modern energy sources remaining very limited. Income-generating activities emphasize efforts to increase efficient utilization of available energy resources. Non-proximity to commercial markets creates an access barrier for services related to cooking and lighting energy for many communities in the country (Table 3). Those who are already purchasing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene (8 percent of the population), travel a distance of more than 5 kilometres. The situation is worse in far-flung, calamity-stricken areas that are hardly reached by commercial distribution networks. If at all, these fuels are expected to be unaffordable.

Other aspects that have direct and/or indirect implications on the financial viability of energy systems are people\u2019s inability to afford commercial fuels and lack of resources for proper development. However, with growing availability of commercial fuels, households have an array of options that could encourage modernization and energy usage efficiency.

Many projects \u2013 such as those initiated by APPROTECH ASIA, GVEP, SPOTS Project, Environmental Improvement for Economic Sustainability (EIES) Project, AMORE, and others \u2013 have demonstrated to varying degrees that energy technology provision to improve access to energy in rural areas has indeed improved socio-economic development. This is markedly observed with respect to economic growth and increased interest in energy-based small businesses, productive uses in agriculture, home-based livelihoods, community-based projects and common services, such as school and public places, street lighting, irrigation, information dissemination and access to modern technology. The challenge is to consolidate and integrate different approaches by different sectors in a sustained programme, encouraging self-help and sustainable access to energy using modern technology options for the poor in rural and unserved areas. In general, these programmes have yet to be translated into practical policy guidelines and procedures, so that they can be understood at the local community and household levels. These guidelines and procedures should promote wider decentralization of modern energy services and facilitate decisions towards more efficient technologies. However, there is clearly an unwillingness on the part of rural households to spend additional resources on expensive appliances, no matter how efficient the technology is. BOX 4 KEY CHALLENGES TO ENERGY TECHNOLOGY EFFICIENCY P Excessive dependence on biomass energy and low efficiency in its use. P High prices prevent people from adopting efficient devices and fuels. P Local production of reliable, affordable and clean technologies and the provision of industry services are in the early stages of development. Therefore, imported technology/equipment and parts for solar, wind and biomass energy are still seen. Energy-based entrepreneurship concerns While there is no credible data on rural small and medium enterprises (SMEs), they are significant generators of income and employment in The affordability factor limits access to alternative energy technologies and efficient fuels. 13 Energy and Poverty in the Philippines THE CHALLENGES rural areas. The growing need to improve livelihood opportunities for the rural poor is taking centre stage in the planning and development of decentralized energy-based entrepreneurship. In principle, almost all ongoing energy projects have articulated their intentions to promote energy-based entrepreneurship to develop rural areas, reduce poverty and promote gender equity. For instance, the Government has launched a programme to support new financial mechanisms (particularly microfinance) aimed at encouraging rural development through small enterprises. Several projects and organizations have also incorporated business aspects in rural energy services such as (1) Capacity Building for Removal of Barriers in Renewable Energy Development (CBRED) Project, (2) AMORE, (3) GVEP, (4) the World Bank\u2019s Rural Power Project (RPP), (5) SPOTS Project, (6) SIBAT, (7) Yamog Renewable Energy Development Group, Inc., (8) EIES Project (implemented by the Philippine National Oil Company) and (9) electrification of host communities by independent power producers. There is very limited information available on existing energy entrepreneurs in rural areas or even on the growth of SMEs and micro- enterprises in relation to energy service provision. Hence, the effectiveness of the Government initiatives in this regard is not clear. Issues of energy-based entrepreneurship can be classified into two, often overlapping and complementary, areas: (1) energy provision entrepreneurs and (2) energy- based enterprises. These two types of entrepreneurship can converge to provide more sustainable, reliable, accessible and affordable energy supply, together with other services. For example, the provision of electricity, ice and potable water is packaged as an enterprise. Thus, income-augmenting components of energy provision projects, along with energy providers and users, can improve financial capacity through effective management and creative entrepreneurship. The income level of entrepreneurs, the community and its households can be increased through the introduction of a business model that promotes productive uses of energy at the household and community levels. For electricity-providing entrepreneurs, the additional load from productive applications (brought in by energy-based small businesses) improves capacity utilization and load factors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "415eab59-5156-478f-8d9b-7cbeeafb19af": {"__data__": {"id_": "415eab59-5156-478f-8d9b-7cbeeafb19af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-philippines", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in the Philippines", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-philippines", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3914bfd477486061ff84c7f05e23f4af659e10cdd42bd19c28b9632f4c55cb1"}, "2": {"node_id": "afb9d8e3-409c-4e13-a3f5-5dc4a283f317", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-philippines", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b649f8eee9b4547e361d0a4ce863186e205adaa413dbff78802a3ae197a56dc2"}}, "hash": "175403340ca336abae43e09676ca2d63c6cf0c9dee1858b78156c338b12af5ff", "text": "This helps improve operational efficiency of the power plant and lower energy generation cost per kilowatt-hour produced.

P No system to record information on rural small and medium enterprises, to assess their energy needs and potential for energy-based business. P Use of energy for income-generating activities is often substantial and not always distinguishable from pure household consumption. P Lack of initiatives on information collection and dissemination of best practices and cases that demonstrate viable entrepreneurial concerns in rural energy service delivery. P Need to integrate project-level initiatives into programme-level undertakings, and ensure sustainability of energy-based business programmes and projects. In general, the rural industry sector can be broadly classified into agro- and non-agro-based industries. The former comprises facilities such as those for tobacco curing and rice milling, while the latter would include charcoal- and brick-manufacturing facilities, potteries, bakeries, activities of blacksmiths and carpentry workshops. Shops and establishments that do not fall under either of these categories could be classified under the rural services sector. Energy usage for income-generating activities is often substantial and not always distinguishable from pure household consumption. The rural-energy-based entrepreneurs need energy for lighting, process heat, motive or shaft power, and increasingly need electricity for computers and communication. Lighting requirements are provided by electricity, either from the grid, diesel or gasoline generators, or kerosene (in power-less villages). Motive power requirements are met by electricity where it is available and by diesel engines or human labour using mechanical equipment, where electricity is unavailable. The principal supply sources of process heat for blacksmiths\u2019 work, brick-making and charcoal manufacture are fuelwood and other biomass. In agro-based facilities, the use of biomass is widespread. Access to finance for energy projects In the Philippines, the financing and banking sector has actively provided decentralized services for financing various rural-based development projects. Several Government and private banks have extended their The use of energy for income- generating activities in rural areas is often substantial. 15 Energy and Poverty in the Philippines THE CHALLENGES lending programmes to rural development projects, including agriculture, home-based industries and energy services for poverty reduction. Energy project financing can take two forms: (1) energy provision (both at the national and local levels) and (2) energy use in households, communities and energy-based enterprises. Access to finance for conventional power plants is well established, but for new and RE facilities, financing windows are still being established. Increasing petroleum and conventional fuel prices and the introduction of RE incentives have increased competition in alternative energy projects. Innovative financing for cleaner and indigenous energy technology is now acceptable and entering various bank financing portfolios. Access to finance for energy use is less established and usually not practised. Packaging of energy projects that incorporate energy utilization and application has been initiated in some projects but, as mentioned above, there is a lack of demonstrable cases of viable financial mechanisms. Cases that have incorporated innovative business and service provisions with service delivery are still not the norm. Perhaps one of the most critical issues in rural energy development is the non-monetized nature of several aspects of the rural economy. Traditionally, the bulk of energy supplies comes in the form of wood and other biomass fuels. This has been considered a free source and many do not want to purchase it. At the same time, moving beyond the satisfaction of basic needs towards higher levels of economic productivity does mean the introduction of expensive modern energy sources into rural societies. However, the merits of the Government subsidies designed to accelerate substitution are debatable. Whether intended or not, it is inevitable that at least some of the subsidies will benefit the higher income strata and commercial establishments rather than disadvantaged households. This goes beyond households as their members venture into productive, entrepreneurial activities for livelihood and improvement of living conditions. Therefore, access to finance will be as important as access to energy. Comprehensive inventory of all existing and planned financial mechanisms is being made for alternative energy projects and other business areas by the CBRED Project. The energy provision projects are being viewed as a total marketing and financial package. For instance, the viability of a micro-hydro project can improve tremendously if financing is packaged with livelihood projects and income-generating businesses. On the other hand, certain financing mechanisms do exist for non-energy projects that are designed for the socio-economic development of Access to finance for energy use in households is less established. 16 Energy and Poverty in the Philippines THE CHALLENGES BOX 6 KEY CHALLENGES IN ACCESSING FINANCE FOR ENERGY PROJECTS P Viable,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c68d0ccd-316c-4c08-a4d8-5cf3112e05d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "c68d0ccd-316c-4c08-a4d8-5cf3112e05d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-philippines", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in the Philippines", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-philippines", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b46c1b3bb9829c0fec24cd03efb18dd9a19b3c83409c46229ebfaa64cb09a41"}, "3": {"node_id": "8c290d99-6d51-4984-9a7e-fc341564ab61", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-philippines", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "adbde51507ca5e478a9da521c59788721116d4e8b0bb838c6f2ac6f4eac8c52d"}}, "hash": "5e41d5a1773a5c4bee02ac187609fc0271e3bc5f19ca339bb9251d9f50e0d0bc", "text": "workable financing models for entrepreneurial and private participation in rural energy service delivery are yet to be realized.

The surveys will also determine if the energy components or needs of these projects can be enhanced to provide entrepreneurial opportunities in energy service delivery. Several capacity-building programmes (with different aspects of financing rural development) are in place, particularly with microfinance and private sector financing participation. The Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), the Land Bank, and other Government and private banks have ongoing programmes to train bank staff, private groups, and Government personnel in these areas. Though such initiatives establish the linkage between energy and poverty, capacity development programmes are dispersed across different projects. The DoE itself, through its CBRED Project, has initiated three pilot financing mechanisms. These are project development funding, loan guarantee and microfinance. They are meant to cater to RE development through designated banks as a means of building the capacity of the financial sector. Government financing institutions \u2013 such as the DBP, the Land Bank, and some local banks \u2013 and grant-funded projects, such as the one in Palawan, have also financed RE projects. The programme aims to decentralize financing facilities through selected programme managers who have a wide presence at the local level. In addition, through the CBRED Project, a compendium of available financial mechanisms for RE 17 Energy and Poverty in the Philippines THE CHALLENGES development has been prepared. Another microfinance model has emerged from the Quedan and Rural Credit Guarantee Corporation better known as QUEDANCOR, the credit and guarantee agency of the Philippine Department of Agriculture (DoA). QUEDANCOR has committed to provide 25 million Philippine Pesos (US $0.5 million) in non-collateral, low-interest micro-loans for RE-powered livelihood projects of AMORE\u2019s beneficiary communities. QUEDANCOR has so far awarded livelihood micro-loans to 38 Barangay Renewable Energy and Community Development Association (BRECDA) members of the Tawi-Tawi. Financing for large-scale energy sector development is provided through public institutions that are influenced by policies of poverty reduction across all sectors. Private banks, primarily under social responsibility programmes and policies enacted by multilateral funding agencies, such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB), UNDP and the World Bank, too have direct funding arrangements for energy, poverty reduction and even gender equity issues. Regarding regulatory frameworks for energy financing, ERC is responsible for issuing regulations for all rate-setting proposals in energy-related projects and commercial energy service delivery. It is also responsible for approving petitions for Missionary Electrification. In terms of the cost of energy access, the absence of specific pricing policies for the provision of affordable energy services to the poor poses as a major obstacle. ERC has neither any pricing regulation for off-grid electricity, nor pricing methodologies that can serve as guidelines. For grid electrification, the prices are set at the level of electricity cooperative franchisees, while the NPC\u2013SPUG handles the modality of pricing electricity in missionary areas. Gender concerns in energy issues The emphasis on women\u2019s involvement in all programmes and projects \u2013 as well as the recognition of the need of their economic empowerment \u2013 is evident in the Government\u2019s pronouncements and the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP). The Government has fully recognized the need to increase women\u2019s representation at the decision- making level in the Government, non-government and semi-government sectors. It also plans to monitor any gender discrimination at work. However, in spite of the incorporation of gender equity in the Government programmes, these do not link gender concerns with energy policy.

Absence of a monitoring and evaluation framework, and performance indicators for energy and poverty for sectoral programmes It is necessary to examine the macro-economic indicators that explain the progress or effects of policies and programmes implemented towards achieving a synergy between energy access and poverty reduction. Since there is no comprehensive programme that links energy and poverty for rural areas, a corresponding monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system is also missing. Capacities are project-oriented and need to be consolidated into an integrated framework to undertake M&E and measure programmatic impacts. However, the energy sector needs specific indicators that tie its performance measures \u2013 to track the impact of access to energy on indicators of human development \u2013 for example, the MDG indicators. Ongoing projects have M&E systems to serve individual project requirements only, and local governments use a quantitative community- based monitoring system (CBMS). Indicators and benchmarks have been developed in the Philippines to monitor human development, but these apply to MDG-related activities. Monitoring the electrification of the number of municipalities, barangays and households, however, is not enough. It should be taken a step further to gauge the impact of electrification on income/human poverty reduction. Yet, despite the agencies having capacities to monitor performances in other developmental programmes, energy indicators are BOX 7 KEY CHALLENGES TO MONITORING AND EVALUATION P There are no M&E policies or indicators to integrate various sectoral goals with goals of affordable energy access to the rural poor. P Information on energy M&E is incomplete and inconsistent, with no modalities to share information across related agencies. P Energy services delivery indices are not yet consolidated into a unified framework/system. There are no indicators that link energy and poverty. 19 Energy and Poverty in the Philippines THE CHALLENGES not considered in these M&E processes. There are no indicators that tie up energy and poverty issues with common development objectives in agriculture, industry, commerce, local government and other sectors. Absence of an integrated management information system pertaining to energy and poverty Since the nature of concerns surrounding MDGs and energy and poverty is rather comprehensive, the need for integrated management information systems (MIS) is significant. Many earlier sectoral initiatives \u2013 such as the CBRED Project \u2013 led to the development of an information database and access systems for RE. Yet, the access of energy professionals and consumers to information remains restricted in the Philippines. A reliable and timely database system is urgently needed. To make a start, DoE has initiated (through CBRED Project) the process of making databases available to various RE programme stakeholders. This comprehensive database will eventually be shared by various agencies involved in energy planning and implementation. The integrated MIS would ultimately cover all other sectors that bear relevance to energy and poverty. Rural communities, in particular, lack sufficient and timely information on issues such as traditional energy inefficiencies or financing schemes for energy installations. Additionally, the Government bodies and related agencies and NGOs have recorded their best practices and experiences in databases. However, there is no systematic integration of such databases. Positive developments towards the availability of information include modalities for knowledge sharing at the national, central and project levels. These are supported through different agencies, projects and programmes such as the CBRED Project, APPROTECH ASIA, GVEP, AMORE, World Bank\u2019s RPP and SPOTS Project.

Rural communities, in particular, lack sufficient and timely information. 20 Energy and Poverty in the Philippines THE CHALLENGES A parent agency for issues related to energy and poverty E fforts to align the energy sector with poverty reduction programmes must begin at the central institutional level. If poverty reduction objectives and activities are dispersed in different agencies without an integral platform, the performance measures, resource pooling and desired results too will get dispersed. For this purpose, a coordinating mechanism with definite roles and responsibilities needs to be established to align the activities of the Government agencies and corporations mandated to provide energy services, livelihood promotions, rural development, gender equity and other aspects needed for poverty reduction.

Since these institutions have their own specific mandates to fulfil, it may be necessary to designate a focal agency at the national level, which could integrate policies, programmes and activities on rural energy access and poverty reduction. The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) \u2013 which is also in charge of unifying the MDG programme for the country \u2013 is an appropriate focal agency for this mission. At the local level, specific plans and roles and responsibilities for local government units (LGUs) can be defined to address the challenges of energy and poverty. NGOs, people\u2019s organizations (POs) and the civil society \u2013 in partnership with local cooperatives \u2013 could also be involved. In this context, the environment is already conducive for public\u2013private partnerships, such as on-grid power generation where private qualified third parties (QTPs) are allowed to operate in franchise-waived areas. Incorporating livelihood concerns into the programme framework The Government of the Philippines will need to reassess the national energy programming/strategy framework to incorporate poverty reduction objectives and targets into rural energy programmes. By incorporating income-generating livelihood, energy provision projects and energy-based businesses help improve operating load factors and viability of power plants. Programmes and institutional structures to implement such enterprises will need to be established. The same will also be needed for non-power energy provision, as it will boost efficiency of traditional cooking and heating fuels. Significant momentum has been gained through the Missionary Electrification Programme, the RE MEETING THE CHALLENGES A coordinating mechanism with definite roles and responsibilities needs to be established. 21 Energy and Poverty in the Philippines THE CHALLENGES Commercialization Programme and the RE policy framework. The private sector funded investment programmes on RE are geared specifically for income generation in coastal, lowland and upland barangays. These involve the provision of heat, mechanical energy and electricity to increase economic productivity in rural communities. Additionally, hybrid power systems using a combination of diesel and RE are also being considered for villages on small islands. Such initiatives will require adequate policy and financial support. Funding can be sourced from the universal charge as authorized by EPIRA. Similarly, to address the uncontrolled use of biomass for fuel needs, DoE has put in place an \u2018Adopt a Programme\u2019 framework. This has been done in cooperation with relevant agencies such as the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), the Forest Products Development Company, DoA and the Department of Interior and Local Government to grow trees in managed plantations for fuelwood. This programme could be extended to include the development or adoption of cleaner technology that uses fuelwood efficiently. Improving energy access in rural and unserved areas Many projects \u2013 such as those initiated by APPROTECH ASIA, GVEP, SPOTS Project, EIES Project, AMORE, and others \u2013 have demonstrated, to varying degrees, that energy access provision to rural and unserved areas can result in improved socio-economic development. This can be further enhanced through increased or improved energy use in small businesses, productive uses of energy in agriculture, home-based livelihoods and community-based projects, as well as for common social uses in schools, health centres, public places and for street lighting. DoE already employs several mechanisms to ensure that access to energy can be improved in rural and unserved areas. The modality employed is through the realization of its Expanded Rural Electrification Programme\u2019s goal of total electrification of barangays by 2008. It is necessary to consolidate and integrate such approaches, and encourage self-help and sustainability for energy access to the poor in areas without electricity. Creating a local manufacturing base for energy technologies The focus on improving access to modern energy necessitates a simultaneous push towards newer, cleaner and affordable energy systems. Since considerable progress has been achieved in the RE sector, it is logical for the country\u2019s energy planners to further the gains by extending the reach of RE systems and tapping their livelihood MEETING THE CHALLENGES 22 Energy and Poverty in the Philippines THE CHALLENGES enhancement potential. One way of achieving this is by developing a local manufacturing base for RE equipment, a process that has been initiated by DoE through the CBRED Project. It is important, however, that large-scale RE technology options do not overshadow other small-scale technology improvements needed for efficient use of energy, in particular improved cook stoves (ICS). It is possible to reduce fuelwood consumption for cooking by 50 percent through the use of ICS, which will not only save energy costs for low- income families, but also halt excessive exploitation of forest land and provide health benefits.

Bolstering financial support for rural energy supply and demand The extent of decentralization to address rural energy finance and its management must be further reinforced at the community and household levels. This is essential, for modern energy is to play a larger role in rural development. A model of decentralization is already available in the RE microfinance facility for DoE to expand. An additional area of focus will be a demonstration of the business viability of rural energy service delivery, in an effort to attract private investment in rural energy projects. The Philippines also requires policy guidelines for financing schemes. These guidelines will have to be considerate towards the needs, paying capacity, income-generating pattern and other related factors of its consumers. DoE, in collaboration with the Department of Finance, can issue such guidelines. Finally, electricity tariffs can be re-evaluated and modified (where possible) to make the tariff structure pro-poor. Since ERC develops pricing schemes with DoE\u2019s assistance, both agencies could consider pricing modalities such as the one practised by the Tulong sa Karunungan Institute (TSKI). At TSKI, the \u2018seasonality\u2019 of revenues of farmers is used as a guide. Therefore, rates are higher during harvesting months as compared to those in the lean months. Encouraging energy-based entrepreneurship To devise effective interventions in order to boost modern energy use in rural industries, the Philippines needs a system to capture relevant information to keep track of SMEs and micro-enterprises in rural areas. In this context, DoE will need to mandate all energy programmes (with MEETING THE CHALLENGES Financing scheme guidelines will have to be considerate towards the needs, paying capacity and income- generating pattern. 23 Energy and Poverty in the Philippines THE CHALLENGES linkages to SME development) to document, and report best practices and lessons learnt at the national and local levels. At the policy level, the RE Bill, which is in the final stages of legislation \u2013 along with other policies \u2013 can be further reviewed to explore how these can be harmonized as a common set of policies. Such an initiative will help implement rules and regulations to promote decentralized energy-based entrepreneurship. A monitoring and evaluation framework for energy and poverty, inclusive of community-based activities The efficacy of modern energy towards achieving poverty reduction can be assessed only if a systematic M&E system is in place. Such a system should include performance indicators and benchmarks to track the impact of energy services on poverty reduction and gender equity. Additionally, since the impact of energy on poverty can be better observed at the local level, a CBMS (currently being used by local governments) can act as a platform to monitor energy- and poverty- related projects at the community level. Suitable baseline data and indicators must be built into the system design. Indicators could be aligned to MDGs and integrated with inter- sectoral objectives, along with with the following. P Percentage of households connected P Percentage of population with access to electricity and petroleum fuels P Number of barangays with common energy services for street lighting, barangay hall, hospitals and assembly areas P Energy used and their share in productive application P Volume of fuelwood and other biomass used, and their sources of supply P Literacy level in electrified and unelectrified areas P Prevalence of smoke-related respiratory diseases in barangays P Number of livelihood projects established through modern energy provision Building management information systems Increasing access to energy and development-related information will aid policy-makers in understanding issues of energy and poverty, and also help communities choose their energy options wisely. The information component of each sectoral programme could be incorporated into an integrated MIS. For instance, the CBRED Project can be useful in laying the foundation of information access, starting from the RE database and exchange system that is being developed. Information access (specific to MEETING THE CHALLENGES 24 Energy and Poverty in the Philippines THE CHALLENGES linkages between energy and poverty) can be expanded along with M&E systems to achieve MDGs and other inter-sectoral action plans. With increased accessibility of information systems, the exchange of information covering the broad concerns of energy and poverty can be facilitated.

Beyond these, it will have to focus on improving energy access, encouraging energy entrepreneurship, establishing a community-based M&E framework and building information systems. As a long-term goal, creating local manufacturing bases should also be included to reduce the cost of energy delivery. An overview of other prioritized actions in the context of energy and poverty is listed below. This should be complemented with a strategic planning process, such as a logical framework analysis, to determine more specific plan/resource requirements. Policy/advocacy P Develop specific institutional arrangements, national energy policies and regulatory frameworks, which that define roles and responsibilities at the national and local levels to create the necessary economic, social and institutional conditions in the energy sector. P Promote sustainable use of fuelwood and other biomass resources and \u2013 as and where appropriate \u2013 other REs (through the use of productive management of resources, efficient use of fuels and provision of new or improved energy products, services and technologies). P Support the transition to modern, cleaner uses of kerosene, electricity and LPG, where they are considered environmentally and socially acceptable and cost-effective. 25 Energy and Poverty in the Philippines THE CHALLENGES P Enhance access to reliable, affordable, socially acceptable and environment-friendly energy services as an integral part of poverty reduction programmes. P Strengthen public\u2013private partnerships, including civil society, NGOs, POs, investors, industries, regulators, financial institutions, communities, LGUs and other potential stakeholders. P Undertake awareness and advocacy programmes on energy policies and plans targeted at policy-makers, Government officials, private entrepreneurs, social workers, consumers, NGOs, and people in development committees to encourage their participation in the planning process for a decentralized, participatory approach. Capacity development P Improve capability to supply and access reliable, affordable, socially acceptable and environment-friendly energy services and resources. P Intensify agricultural productivity and promote non-farm livelihood activities through SMEs, including household-based activities and micro-enterprises. P Establish capacity to effectively implement financial and technological assistance and innovative financing mechanisms at the household and community levels. P Estimate and plan required investments at the local, regional and national levels, including those needed for universal electricity access for the poor. P Identify suitable financial resources and mechanisms to meet the investment requirements and operating costs at the above- mentioned levels. Knowledge management P Improve access to knowledge repositories to promote adoption of modern biomass technologies and fuelwood sources and supplies, and commercialize biomass operations. P Urgently assist and facilitate the access of the rural poor to knowledge on reliable, affordable and environment-friendly energy services, with financial and technical assistance from developed country partners, multilateral institutions, and public\u2013private partnerships. P Facilitate the dissemination of best practices and success stories of local NGOs and organizations on energy services. P Carry out relevant data collection and analysis, gather case studies, document relevant RE and clean fuel technologies, and assess energy resources and infrastructures.

Access to affordable modern energy services can improve their productivity and enhance living standards. Even so, there are no specific targets for the energy sector in the Millennium Declaration, a historic document signed seven years ago by the world\u2019s leaders. Affordable and sustainable modern energy services are a necessity for countries to meet their Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Efforts of countries in the Asia-Pacific region to meet these aims will be hindered unless adequate attention is given to the crucial role energy services play in the development process. This is particularly true for the economic, environmental and social well-being of the poor. With fluctuating energy prices, the poor in many of the countries in the Asia-Pacific region face a daunting future. For them, access to affordable and essential modern energy services that could improve their living conditions and ensure a means to earn a living will fall outside their reach. Recognizing the urgency for countries to factor in access to modern energy services, particularly when shaping national poverty reduction initiatives, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provided technical and financial support for national-level rapid energy assessments. The primary aim of this work, carried out through UNDP\u2019s Regional Energy Programme for Poverty Reduction (REP-PoR) and completed in 2006, was to identify gaps and priority needs in linking energy services provision with poverty reduction. The framework for rapid gap assessments linking energy and poverty was developed as a joint effort of the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok (RCB) and UNDP country offices in the region, with the support of experts from the region. The draft framework was discussed at two sub-regional meetings, one held in Bangkok, Thailand (August 2005) and the other in Apia, Samoa (September 2005). The meetings were helpful in customizing the framework to suit specific needs and circumstances of the participating countries. Subsequently, UNDP country offices held national-level stakeholder consultations to consolidate the findings and recommendations of the assessments. This work benefited immensely from the support of government vi Energy and Poverty in Viet Nam officials and representatives of civil society. Documented in individual country reports, this work serves as resource and reference material for programming and planning for access to modern energy services for the underserved, particularly, the poor. This document is a summary of the Country Report on Viet Nam and is part of a series of REP-PoR\u2019s Asia-Pacific publications. It draws on the key findings of the Country Report, summarizes the challenges faced at the national level, and provides priority recommendations. Specifically, critical issues related to energy policy, including institutional structures, regulatory frameworks, priority programmes, financing measures, gender concerns, as well as monitoring and evaluation support are highlighted. It offers a way forward, outlining issues and options for the country. Our hope is that this document will be of relevance to national policy makers, development partners, energy service providers, civil society organizations and academia in implementing various measures to promote access to modern energy services for the poor.

The report also offers options for the country to overcome its energy sector challenges. Over the last decade, poverty has decreased significantly in Viet Nam. In addition, households with access to electricity doubled during 1992-2004, from 48.9 to 90.5 percent. However, there is still a strong economic disparity between urban and rural poverty and a gap between urban and rural access to electricity. Poverty rates in remote, inaccessible areas, such as in mountainous regions and the highlands, are still particularly high. Low income households are highly dependent on affordable but inefficient and unsustainable sources of energy for most domestic and productive uses. Non-commercial biomass consumption includes firewood, charcoal and agro-residues and contributes to up to two-thirds of the national total energy consumption and up to 92 percent of the total rural thermal energy consumption for cooking, heating and food processing. In 2004, while almost all urban households were grid-connected, only 88 percent of the rural areas were connected. This study examines critical energy issues in Viet Nam related to the institutional structure of the energy sector, policy and regulatory framework and sectoral programmes. It analyses reasons for the limited reach of energy services to rural provinces; unsustainable dependence on traditional fuels and inefficient technologies; the limited supply of energy by rural energy enterprises; and inadequate financing for energy. Gender concerns are also examined in rural energy projects and programmes. It highlights the urgent need for key data and indicators to support monitoring and evaluation of energy access for areas that are least served. This report concludes that rural energy provision does not receive enough attention from state energy corporations, which are the main players with a near-monopoly status in energy service provision. Also, PREFACE viii Energy and Poverty in Viet Nam capacities to develop integrated rural energy plans are insufficient. Since Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN) does not reach the household level in rural areas, other players such as cooperatives, private enterprises, and joint ventures between local investors and state-owned companies are allowed to invest and operate in the communes. However, the regulatory framework for rural energy services is not sufficiently transparent and enforcement of tariff and quality standards is inadequate. Furthermore, these non-state rural energy service providers often have insufficient technical and financial capacities to manage the commune grid properly. Consequently, affordability and quality of service to end-users in rural areas remain as major constraints to the creation of a comprehensive pro-poor energy strategy in Viet Nam. In addition, no particular institution focuses on provision of traditional, non-electric energy services to rural areas. This study recommends that corporate entities should be given a greater role to cover remote areas and deprived communities. Speedy implementation of institutional reforms with a clear demarcation of responsibilities could help facilitate provision of modern energy services to low income households and set out terms of delivery and pricing for their benefit. Enforcement of guidelines for commune grid development and technical capacities of EVN and its subsidiaries could be mobilized and enhanced. Lack of institutional focus on rural energy provision for poverty alleviation and decentralization can be further addressed by developing capacity to use tools and frameworks towards planning integrated rural energy development, while also taking into account poverty reduction initiatives. Seeking cross-sectoral synergy could also help reduce dependence on biomass energy for cooking and disseminate widely technological solutions (e.g. improved cook stoves) for increasing efficiency of cooking fuel use and minimizing self-supply of such rural traditional energy types. Encouraging experiences in the energy sector can and do exist in Viet Nam. The sustained policy focus of the Government of Viet Nam on rural electrification is highly commendable. The Rural Electrification Programme (REP) was launched in 1996 to achieve the national goal of doubling electricity access by 2010. REP received assistance from all levels in terms of organizations, finance, planning and resource mobilization and is managed by EVN. After the programme was initiated, education and health care have improved due to the availability of energy services. The availability of motive power for irrigation, industries, handicrafts, agricultural product processing and income-generating opportunities has also increased. REP has improved access to electricity in almost all ix Energy and Poverty in Viet Nam provinces and regions. However, by limiting the scope at the commune centre, rather than reaching out to the households, the impact of REP on poverty is limited since it does not help the poor directly benefit from policies on preferential electricity pricing. Thus the gap between the poor and the rich regarding benefits of present rural electricity services remains.

However, despite government subsidies, electricity prices are still unaffordable for weaker sections of rural communities, leading to low consumption levels in rural households. Equally important is that energy services delivery is followed up to the household level, ensuring that the poor also benefit directly, and if they do not, the gaps need to be assessed and addressed. Programmes targeting improved rural energy access that focus on a wide range of energy types should be established in order to accelerate the accomplishment of these goals. These government- supported activities must be complemented, however, with additional strong recognition and efforts towards the goal of enhanced off-grid electrification and correcting unsustainable uses of fuelwood. The renewable energy development programme and the rural cooking fuel programme should be given more emphasis at the national level. We trust that the report is unique in terms of its insights into the current functioning of the energy sector and into options that bridge the gaps between access to energy and poverty reduction in Viet Nam. Our aim is to provide country specific information on institutional structures, energy resources, policy recommendations, and capacity and financial gaps that can point the way towards improving access to modern energy services, particularly for the poor.

The development of a modern energy sector, in general, and for the rural areas, in particular, is considered a prerequisite for socio-economic development and poverty reduction. Viet Nam\u2019s energy use patterns for lower income households indicate high dependence on affordable yet inefficient and unsustainable sources of energy for most domestic and productive uses. Non-commercial energies consumed in Viet Nam are mainly types of biomass, including firewood, charcoal and agro-residues (e.g. rice straws, rice husk and bagasse). The popular usages are for household cooking and rural small scale economic activities. This category contributes to up to two-thirds of the national total energy consumption (Thang 2003). In 1998, more than 92 percent of households in rural Viet Nam depended on fuelwood for cooking and heating (Figure 1). In 2004, for lighting purposes, kerosene was used by 11.6 percent of the lower income households1. The use of cleaner fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking faces similar barriers of accessibility and affordability. 1 GSO website at: http://www.gso.gov.vn/default.aspx? tabid=417&idmid=4&ItemID =4284.

In the 1990s, foreign direct investment was permitted in energy production, as well as in the distribution of electricity and LPG. The reforms established a number of state corporations that took over business operations from the line ministries, even though the ministries are still involved in planning, investment and development of regulatory frameworks and policies (Table 1). In addition, the State Pricing Committee, a subordinate to the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, has a crucial role in setting and adjusting prices for commercial energy, and providing information and advice to the Prime Minister.

Moreover, MARD is hardly involved in activities of capacity-building for its staff to better manage and use calculation tools and methods of integrated rural energy planning, even though it plays a key role in production and use of traditional biomass products that serve rural households, especially the poor (fuelwood and crop residues for cooking, such as rice straws, rice husks, bagasse, animal excrement for biogas production, etc.). Non-state providers of energy services in the rural areas are recognized in three major forms: (1) cooperatives; (2) private enterprises; and (3) joint ventures between local investors and state-owned companies. International non-governmental organizations (INGOs) provide energy services (biogas and improved cook stoves) for lower income households. Multilateral and bilateral donors have contributed significantly to Electricity of Viet Nam\u2019s (EVN\u2019s) Rural Electrification Programme (REP). At the local level, the role of the Provincial People\u2019s Committee in energy services is limited to the REP. The Commune Electricity Board model, in which the Commune People\u2019s Committee gives full rights to private contractors to deliver electricity services, is dominant in 65 to 70 percent of communes that have electrification (EVN 2005). For meeting energy needs beyond the electricity sector, state-owned companies manage wholesale and retail systems for coal and petroleum products through a partial government subsidy in isolated areas as a way to reduce poverty in ethnic communities and small commercial networks in communes that do not have access to roads (Table 3). Body Role Commune Electricity Board An autonomous body nominated by the commune authority to distribute electricity to households from the nearest transformer Private distributors/ sub-contractors Private investors selected to manage the commune grid Rural Electric Company Buys electricity from EVN and distributes it to commune households Provincial Water/ Electric Board Assigned by the Provincial People\u2019s Committee to operate the commune grid Commune Electricity Cooperative A commune-level, elected cooperative body to operate the commune grid on a non-profit basis 6 Energy and Poverty in Viet Nam THE CHALLENGES Policy and regulatory framework The goal of electricity services in Viet Nam, as defined by the Government, is to achieve adequate provision of electricity in order to meet the demand for industrialization and modernization in lighting, thermal processing and motive usage for households, agriculture, industry, construction and transportation. According to the Government\u2019s plan, 100 percent of communes and 95 percent of rural households shall be provided with electricity services by 2010. It is anticipated that by 2015, the rate of households having access to electricity will reach 98 percent. The key policy areas related to the provision of electricity include: \u2022 Mechanism management for rural electric provision; \u2022 Development and renovation of rural grid; and \u2022 Electricity pricing regulation for different users: industrial, household, rural and urban. To address these areas, various policies and regulations have been developed and adjusted over the years. However, attracting private investments for rural electrification and enhancing public-private partnerships in the development of rural electricity services delivery have resulted in a regulatory framework in rural electricity services delivery to the non-governmental sections (commune electricity boards, electricity contractors, etc.) that is not formulated based on laws and transparency.

BOX 1: KEY INSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES 7 Energy and Poverty in Viet Nam THE CHALLENGES Mismatch between programme framework and existing consumption patterns Not taking into account biomass-based energy consumption in rural areas, the premier rural energy programme is REP. It was launched in 1996 to achieve the national goal of doubling electricity access by 2010. REP and the southern region rural electrification projects have contributed to the delivery of rural electricity services widely, especially in urban areas, through the national power grid. After this project was initiated, education and health care have improved due to the availability of energy services. The availability of motive power for irrigation, industries, handicrafts, agricultural product processing and income-generating opportunities has also increased. REP got assistance from all levels in terms of organizations, finance, planning and resource mobilization and is managed by EVN. Local socio- economic development needs are taken into account because of strict decentralization. However, by limiting the scope at commune centre, rather than reaching out to the households, the impact of REP on poverty is limited because of the fact that it does not maximize the benefit of rural households that have access to electricity. REP does not help the poor directly benefit from policies on preferential electricity pricing, and the gap between the poor and the rich regarding benefits of present rural electricity services remains. To cover remote rural areas, experiments with renewable energy for off-grid electrification involved only pilots for installation of solar, wind and small hydro technologies. The Electricity Law mandates the EVN to develop renewable energy and play the role of a nodal agency while exploiting cross-sectoral synergy in implementation of on- and off-grid rural electrification projects. An off-grid electrification programme, The impact of REP on poverty is limited, because it does not maximize the benefit of rural households that have access to electricity. \u25a0 Policies recognizing high dependence on traditional biomass do not exist. \u25a0 Regulatory framework in rural electricity services delivery to the non-governmental sections (commune electricity boards, electricity contractors, etc.) is not formulated based on laws and transparency. \u25a0 The regulatory framework to enforce compliance with quality standards is inadequate, resulting in poor quality and higher cost of electricity; consequently, affordability and quality of service to end-users in rural areas remain a concern. BOX 2: KEY CHALLENGES IN POLICY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK 8 Energy and Poverty in Viet Nam THE CHALLENGES generating electricity from diesel and renewable sources, for isolated rural areas was implemented during 1997-2003. Despite the emphasis on rural electricity, biomass (fuelwood and crop residues) from fields, hills and orchards is a major energy source for rural Viet Nam. Most rural households using biomass are self-sufficient in terms of energy. In 1998, more than 92 percent of rural households relied on biomass for cooking and heating (GSO 2000). Since the market for biomass is largely self-regulated, with little government involvement by way of policy, it is termed non-commercial energy. Thus, there is no official data on its production, price or consumption levels. Despite the depletion of forests accelerating, a rural cooking fuel programme to reduce dependence on fuelwood was not officially established and put into prime consideration of the Government in a similar way as the REP. \u25a0 By limiting the reach to the commune centre, rather than to households, REP does not maximize its benefits. \u25a0 With the exception of grid-electricity, programmes to enhance rural access to modern energy have been ineffective because of their pilot status and limited upscaling efforts. \u25a0 There is lack of focus on rural cooking and heating fuels, with no specific programme for reducing dependence, especially that of women, on fuelwood through increased efficiency of stoves and provision of substitute fuels. \u25a0 There is no programme for capacity-building and knowledge sharing on the use of improved stoves and other technologies, such as biomass gasifiers that reduce dependence on biomass. BOX 3: KEY CHALLENGES IN BUILDING AN ENERGY FOR POVERTY REDUCTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK Gaps in energy access Subsidies at the national and local levels form the current mechanism for enabling access to rural energy services for poverty reduction and gender equality. Existing subsidy mechanisms for rural energy services through energy pricing for poverty reduction are listed below: \u2022 Subsidy to the lowest tier of electricity consumption corresponding to lower income households \u2022 Subsidy through exemption of freight cost for non-electricity energy services that serve isolated areas \u2022 Subsidy for petroleum products at the national level (decreasing gradually) 9 Energy and Poverty in Viet Nam THE CHALLENGES Pricing is a key element in the expansion of electricity", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71f2503c-95b4-4092-9a27-5e8a505759c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "71f2503c-95b4-4092-9a27-5e8a505759c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy and Poverty in Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ed6ddc8e5d326f9e24f50a62886f2a61067d930435a02ee644ee3677c642fb8"}, "3": {"node_id": "07ccd87c-7184-43da-972c-a79dd312a060", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-and-poverty-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7c6d552888feb3d0b62ed91fa0c8148b6a8406ca8d4f7e24c3cc20694004897e"}}, "hash": "856f0cf5169d5e14c3a9f059d93786293d4b4ebfada2dc874a3f43c2d6d23413", "text": "access to cover the entire country. Viet Nam follows a differential energy pricing policy, focusing on specific groups of users, usage types and geographical areas. The differentiation is between productive and non-productive usages and rural and urban users, with incremental pricing for increasing volumes of consumption. Viet Nam commercially introduced LPG, the cleanest alternative to fuelwood, coal and kerosene, in 1993. By 2000, the average annual demand growth for LPG had increased by almost 50 percent. Domestic consumption of LPG is expected to reach 1.5 million tonnes by 2010 (Thang 2003). Access to LPG cylinders is convenient in major cities, where supply terminals and filling stations are expanding rapidly with door- delivery services. On the other hand, costs of LPG stoves and cylinders limit access in rural areas, slowing the expansion of the supply network. This also brings out a clear relationship between energy consumption and poverty and reinforces the fact that household energy use patterns are income-elastic. The success of REP has improved access to electricity in almost all provinces and regions. Households with access to electricity doubled during 1992-2004, from 48.9 to 90.5 percent, rural households being the major beneficiaries (EVN 2005). However, there is still a gap between urban and rural access to electricity. In 2004, while almost all urban households were grid-connected, only 88 percent of the rural areas were connected. In addition, despite the rapid electrification, consumption levels in the rural areas are still very low. Most of the population that does not have access to electricity resides in remote areas, where grid expansion is expensive and off-grid solutions have not yet made an impact. Additionally, despite government subsidies, electricity prices are still unaffordable for weaker sections of rural communities, leading to low consumption levels in rural households. In 1997, an average lower income household could only afford to pay VND 2,400 (US$ 0.3) per month per head for electricity, while better-off families spent 10 times more (GSO 2000). This disproportionate electricity consumption still continues. The percentage of rural households possessing common electric appliances has not changed much during the period from 1997-2002, and major electricity usage, besides for lighting, is for fans, televisions and radio sets. For example, in 1998, 28.51 percent of rural households had a colour television and in 2002 the figure had increased to 43.61 percent (Table 4). Despite the rapid electrification, consumption levels in the rural areas are still very low. 10 Energy and Poverty in Viet Nam THE CHALLENGES TABLE 4 USE OF ELECTRIC APPLIANCES AMONG RURAL HOUSEHOLDS (PERCENTAGE) * Estimated figure Sources GSO (2000) and GSO (2004) \u25a0 Despite improved access, the price of modern energy alternatives (e.g. LPG for cooking) is too high and unaffordable for lower income households. \u25a0 Government subsidies have enabled increased access to electricity, but the price is still too high for the poor. \u25a0 Off-grid solutions have not yet resulted in significant improvement in access to energy services. \u25a0 Non-state electricity providers at the commune level are constrained by limited capacities and poor access to technology. BOX 4: KEY CHALLENGES IN WIDENING ACCESS TO ENERGY SERVICES The closest point to the commune that the national grid can reach is the transforming station located at the rural commune. Since EVN does not reach the household levels in rural areas, investment from others is required. Therefore, rural electricity distributors and investors are allowed to operate at the commune level; however, they have insufficient technical and financial capacities to invest and manage the commune grid properly. The per-kWh price of electricity in rural areas is often higher than in urban areas due to transmission losses and high management costs.

Kerosene has retained a significant share of rural energy consumption. In 2002, about 26 percent of rural households used kerosene for lighting. Kerosene lamps provide low intensity light, likely resulting in low quality of learning and, possibly, higher dropout rates of schoolchildren in areas without electricity. For cooking, most rural households use inefficient cook stoves. Harmful gas emissions from these stoves likely affect the health of users, especially women and children. Concerning productive usage of energy, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) do not select high technology equipment or change energy types due to lack of information about cost-effectiveness of energy-efficient options and lack of capital investment. For instance, they cannot meet bank conditions to borrow funds for energy-efficiency interventions. These conditions prevent the adoption of efficient technologies and selection of suitable energy types. Energy entrepreneurship and SME-related energy concerns Before 2001, the only non-state providers of electricity were cooperatives registered under the Law on Cooperatives.

Despite this effort, market penetration by private investors remains at a modest level due to low capacity and lack of incentives for investment. Industrial SMEs create important employment opportunities. In 2002, SMEs in Viet Nam employed 26 percent of the workforce, contributing to 25 percent of the GDP. In addition, energy demand is expected to grow fast in the coming years, given the rapid growth in the number of SMEs and micro enterprises during 2002-20052. Viet Nam had an estimated energy consumption of 2.4 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2005, a figure projected to reach 4.5 Mtoe by 2010 (UNDP 2005). SMEs often disregard energy efficiency of technologies and equipment and selection of appropriate fuels, because other issues are considered more important. Management capacity and knowledge on energy-efficient technologies are poor in SMEs, which often use second-hand, obsolete equipment. Such equipment has low energy end-use efficiency and consumes large amounts of energy, leading to low efficiency of energy services, low quality of products, high costs of production and difficulty in competing with large industries. Part of the problem also includes a serious lack of capital to invest in modern technologies. Most commercial banks do not lend to SMEs for energy-saving purposes as the latter cannot meet their conditions for loans. SMEs also struggle to grow because, generally, they are not provided with training courses and materials, forums for information exchange on technologies and equipment with high energy efficiency, awareness-raising activities and management skills for energy-based businesses. The UNDP-GEF Operational Programme 5 project, initiated in 2005, for the Promotion of Energy Conservation in Small-to-Medium scale Enterprises (PECSME) focuses on removal of barriers (financial, institutional, information, market, policy/regulatory, technical) in the widespread application of energy conservation and energy efficiency in SMEs in Viet Nam (UNDP 2005). The implementation of the project started in 2006 and the key SME sectors addressed in the project are brick making, ceramics, textiles, paper and food processing.

BOX 8: KEY CHALLENGES TO GENDER MAINSTREAMING WITH REGARDS TO ENERGY Gender concerns Biomass continues to be a major source of energy for cooking and heating for the majority of rural households in Viet Nam. The dominance of biomass in the energy mix creates drudgery for rural women, as they are the primary collectors of biomass. Although many women are involved in economic activities, their participation in energy-based income-generating activities could be much enhanced through improving their access to modern energy services. This is true especially in the context of agricultural production and associated activities such as small-scale food processing and handicrafts. Gaps in access to information There are few modalities for knowledge and information sharing in rural energy planning. Most of the training, information dissemination and sharing of best practices, such as that which concerns improved cook stoves and biogas production, are conducted and documented at the project level and at specific locations. Dissemination of the existing information is done in an ad hoc manner. There is no formal system for The dominance of biomass in the energy mix creates drudgery for rural women, as they are the primary collectors of biomass. 15 Energy and Poverty in Viet Nam THE CHALLENGES collating and recording experiences that could enable information sharing among the stakeholders concerned with rural energy.

However, a comprehensive energy- and poverty-related M&E system that incorporates benchmarks and indicators related to the development of energy-based enterprises in rural areas, provision of pump sets, provision of electricity for rural clinics and schools, biomass supply and consumption, and energy technology development is yet to be developed in Viet Nam. Biomass supply and consumption levels are often estimated rather than surveyed. A comprehensive energy- and poverty- related M&E system is yet to be developed in Viet Nam. 16 Energy and Poverty in Viet Nam MEETING THE CHALLENGES MEETING THE CHALLENGES O Consolidating institutional reforms and enhancing capacities ne of the key factors for addressing energy- and poverty-related concerns would be the speedy implementation of institutional reforms. There needs to be a clear demarcation of responsibilities and roles, so that the reforms are actually implemented in spirit and form. Corporate entities should be given a greater role to cover remote areas and deprived communities. In this context, a memorandum of understanding between corporate entities and government ministries could be prepared, setting out terms of delivery and pricing for the benefit of lower income households. To facilitate dissemination of modern energy services to lower income households, technical capacities of EVN and its subsidiaries could be mobilized and enhanced, along with those of other research institutions, mass organizations and local authorities. A short-term cross-sectoral committee can be set up to ensure that the division of roles and responsibilities becomes a reality and is directed towards greater institutional decentralization for developing energy services for poverty reduction. Meanwhile, the provincial departments that are responsible for energy development, along with local governments, should also be involved in poverty reduction programmes and projects. Lack of institutional focus on rural energy provision for poverty alleviation and decentralization can be further addressed by developing capacity to use tools and frameworks to be used towards planning integrated rural energy development, while also taking into account poverty reduction initiatives of MARD and MoLISA and its associated bodies. The tools and frameworks for integrated rural energy planning could be used beyond the energy sub-sectors (coal, electricity, oil and gas), which could enhance the cross-sectoral cooperation for implementation of rural energy plans for poverty alleviation. Seeking cross-sectoral synergy could also help reduce dependence on biomass energy for cooking and disseminate widely technological solutions (e.g. improved cook stoves) for increasing efficiency of cooking fuel use and minimizing self-supply of such rural traditional energy types. MARD could manage the rural cooking fuel programme and act as the nodal professional agency. It could also facilitate cross-sectoral cooperation between MoI, Viet Nam Women\u2019s Union (VWU) and other institutions and organizations for the execution of biofuel surveys, distribution of improved cook stoves and selection of rural cooking fuels suitable for each region and sub-region. Also, international agencies should mainstream energy provision into all appropriate rural development and poverty reduction projects and interventions they support. Seeking cross- sectoral synergy could also help reduce dependence on biomass energy for cooking and disseminate widely technological solutions. 17 Energy and Poverty in Viet Nam MEETING THE CHALLENGES Enabling policy and regulatory framework Biomass accounts for a significant share of the total energy consumption of Viet Nam. Thus, national energy policies must take into account traditional sources of energy, afforestation programmes and other mechanisms to increase proliferation of energy-efficient biomass and ensure long-term sustainability of traditional rural energy sources. Policies to support energy programmes concerning traditional energy use are necessary and must be integrated into development plans at the national, provincial and district levels, with specific targets and time frames and regular monitoring and feedback. In terms of regulatory issues, lower income households within a community need to be provided with \u2018enablers\u2019 of electricity and modern energy sources, such as differential energy price, subsidies in supplies and end-use spares, and an increase in off-grid electricity provision. The regulatory framework to enforce compliance with quality standards needs to be strengthened, and guidelines for commune grid development that benefit end-users in rural areas must be included. Energy programme framework for encouraging poverty reduction A balanced programme framework for energy services with the aim to reduce poverty consists of, among others, a grid-connected rural electrification programme; a renewable energy development programme, especially serving off-grid rural electrification in remote, mountainous areas that are not reached by the national power grid; and a rural cooking fuel programme. The programme framework also needs to recognize the existing consumption patterns.

The renewable energy development programme and the rural cooking fuel programme should be given more emphasis at the national level, and, although an inclusion of research components into programme framework is important, these programmes should not only be characterized as research programmes. As of now, many programmes are not given enough attention. The rural cooking fuel programme is an example of an initiative that was not officially established and given prime governmental consideration, unlike REP. Also, the rural cooking fuel research and Lower income households within a community need to be provided with 'enablers' of electricity and modern energy. 18 Energy and Poverty in Viet Nam MEETING THE CHALLENGES development programme should be reactivated, so that better, user- friendly models for cooking can be developed and distributed. An emphasis could be on capacity-building and knowledge sharing components that aim to increase the use of improved stoves and other technologies that reduce dependence on biomass, such as biomass gasifiers. All of these strategies need a master plan for development with specific targets and implementation steps. Energy services delivery should be followed up to the household level, ensuring that the poor also benefit directly, and if they do not, the gaps need to be assessed and addressed. Programmes targeting improved rural energy access focusing on wide range of energy types should be established in order to accelerate the accomplishment of these goals. For example, off-grid electricity programme could be continued and scaled-up. Promoting access to energy for poverty reduction An emphasis on making energy services affordable for and available to the poor is necessary in order to alleviate poverty. The deprivation of electricity in remote areas is one of the major impediments to the socio- economic development of rural communities. In this context, EVN is the key agency set to solve the problems of electricity services delivery to rural and remote areas. EVN\u2019s subsidiaries, local electricity companies and other electricity providers in rural areas can facilitate electricity provision to lower income households through a series of measures that must include enforcement of guidelines for commune grid development. EVN\u2019s and other electricity providers\u2019 capacities in this area need strengthening. After guidelines for electricity service provision are followed, further efforts to mainstream the poverty considerations into energy service provision are needed. For example, this process could occur through the transformation of commune electricity boards or cooperatives into rural energy enterprises. A system to evaluate the impacts of different energy service delivery models in addressing development needs for poverty reduction also needs to be in place. Commune-based and enterprise- oriented electricity provision can be taken forward by setting aside resources for building capacity for non-EVN electricity providers as a way to improve their performance. The communes can be further supported through a scheme of low-interest finance to rejuvenate and increase the capacity of commune electrification. Since energy provision for remote rural areas may not be viable through the centralized grid, lower income households are largely dependent on non-state rural energy service providers. A programme on Programmes targeting improved rural energy access focusing on wide range of energy types should be established. 19 Energy and Poverty in Viet Nam MEETING THE CHALLENGES rural energy services should be established to focus on aspects related to the quality and affordability of all different forms of energy services. This can be facilitated through official development assistance (ODA) support that focuses on these aspects of energy services. An agreement among MoI, MARD and other agencies and international donors can be made to provide guidance tools for mobilizing resources for further development of affordable and quality energy services through decentralized service providers. Local provincial departments and PETROLIMEX networks should be mandated to provide non-electricity energy services to lower income households. To encourage the switchover from traditional to modern energy, mechanisms to encourage use of electricity, coal-based energy and LPG in remote areas should be established. Demonstration schemes for clean coal processing and LPG could inspire such a switch from traditional biomass to cleaner fuels. Off-grid renewable energy technologies (RETs) could also be part of the solution, especially in places where the use of renewable energy is more viable than grid extension. To make progress on this front, some government intervention is likely necessary. The rural communities should be informed about the potential benefits of off-grid RETs, as well as the realities resulting from the infeasibility of grid extension to remote areas. The latter is very important, because high expectations of grid electricity may prevent adoption of RETs.

Both groups need tools to evaluate the technologies and benefit from demonstrations which provide sufficient information on operation and maintenance (Nguyen 2007). As yet another consideration, to increase the level of energy consumption for productive purposes in micro business and SMEs, off-grid renewable energy programmes should be accelerated and decentralized to Provincial People\u2019s Committees so that development is more demand-driven. As with other types of energy services, renewable energy potential requires a thorough assessment of quality and affordability. To enhance the affordable dissemination of RETs at the household level, a number of initiatives could be implemented; for example, a targeted subsidy or consumer credit system could be established for those segments of consumers who need it the most. Consumer credit will provide financial assistance that comes from a financial institute or a local bank, which spreads the investment cost over some years. Usually, an overseeing body is needed for local banks to approve assistance. A more attractive system to rural households, however, could be the establishment of an energy service company (ESCO), which could act as a non-ENV electricity The rural communities should be informed about the potential benefits of off-grid RETs. 20 Energy and Poverty in Viet Nam MEETING THE CHALLENGES provider, using RETs to electrify the rural areas. An ESCO would buy RET systems in bulk and install them for users, who would pay for the energy services, not for the hardware. This way, the investments and costs are spread out over a long period of time. Promoting energy efficiency and opportunities for entrepreneurship Poverty reduction efforts demand that energy service provision be affordable to lower income households and viable to enterprises providing or consuming energy. Hence, the efficiency of energy supply systems becomes a crucial factor, because it impacts both affordability to consumers and viability to entrepreneurs. This can be supported further by, for example, a fresh marketing strategy to change consumer behaviour by aggressive dissemination of power-saving bulbs, targeting households in both urban and rural areas. Energy-efficient light bulbs will be a more cost-efficient choice than traditional bulbs in the longer term; however, increasing awareness of these options may also be necessary. For non-electricity-based energy consumption, a survey of consumer preferences needs to be conducted to support development of efficient, user-friendly biomass technologies, such as improved cook stoves and kilns. MARD can conduct periodic pre-harvest surveys, make inventories and develop efficiency studies regarding biomass use for energy, and then use the results to provide practical steps to improve availability and efficiency of use. To enhance the viability of energy-based SMEs, it is necessary to increase also their awareness of efficient energy technologies and fuels and to build their capacities to access bank loans for financing technology improvement or fuel change. Information about opportunities in energy service provision should be documented and disseminated to SMEs, banks and support agencies as it is to entrepreneurs and consumers in order to facilitate rational choices of technology and energy options. For example, accurate and reliable information about energy-saving projects should be accessible to SMEs, creditors and lending agencies. Also, results from state and academic research and development projects on energy solutions should be made more accessible to SMEs, even as databases of best practices in energy efficiency are established and disseminated. Making finance more accessible Energy service projects for enhancing rural development should be considered eligible for loans. Lower income households in remote areas 21 Energy and Poverty in Viet Nam MEETING THE CHALLENGES need financial support as do entrepreneurs associated with energy service delivery in such areas. For effective results, financial instruments such as soft loans and subsidies for energy service delivery need to be extended in a manner that supports enterprise and competitiveness. Hence, open bidding needs to be applied for subsidy provision so that private and non-state enterprises can participate. Enabling mechanisms that simplify access to finance for small and medium energy providers and energy- based enterprises can support the open bidding process. Banks should share risks with energy service providers and invest in energy projects for SMEs. The Social Policy Bank should also cover rural energy development, particularly for household usages. Since development of energy-based enterprises is crucial for poverty reduction, Viet Nam Techno-Commercial Bank\u2019s loan programme that encourages SMEs to achieve energy efficiency must be strengthened. Also, the current rules on lending need to be revised so that SMEs take up energy conservation and efficiency initiatives.

Donor agencies working closely with the Government can facilitate the involvement of energy auditors, energy consultants, energy service companies and engineering firms, mainly in technical aspects, to appraise energy conservation projects, as it would help build confidence in bankers towards energy-related projects. At the local level, provinces should determine the need for electricity among lower income households and develop their own networks to cater to such needs. The provinces, along with EVN, should be mandated to mobilize resources for upgrading commune grids. Finally, an assessment system to evaluate the impacts of finance models for poverty reduction, including the development of rural energy services delivery, needs to be in place in order to keep track of and learn from new programmes and progress. Mainstreaming gender into energy and poverty initiatives There is little documented information on energy-related gender concerns in Viet Nam. However, issues related to women\u2019s drudgery are well-documented at the international level. Experiences worldwide and some successful initiatives in Viet Nam show that this issue can be best addressed through the provision of efficient energy services for cooking, For effective results, financial instruments for energy service delivery need to be extended in a manner that supports enterprise and competitiveness. 22 Energy and Poverty in Viet Nam MEETING THE CHALLENGES wherein credit-based initiatives for large-scale dissemination of biogas need to be expanded. The efforts need to be complemented by assessing and documenting the ways in which other decentralized power generation technologies, such as small and pico hydro initiatives, have benefited women. Another key issue related to mainstreaming gender into energy and poverty initiatives is the development of gender-related benchmarks and indicators that measure the benefits that arise from energy services, in general, and rural energy service, in particular. In the case of the latter, indicators should take into account gaps between higher and lower income groups, urban and rural users, and women and men (UNDP 2007a). Making information available All forms of documentation, including surveys conducted, concerning specific energy-related projects should focus on questions relating to energy and poverty concerns and related best practices. A database of this information, as well as that concerning rural energy and development needs, in general, must be established. This information system should encompass technology developers, financiers, businesses and their services, energy service providers and low-cost technologies. Building capacity for existing staff working in this field (from national to local levels) to collect, treat, manage and disseminate information is important as well. Better methods for monitoring and evaluation Key indicators and benchmarks for M&E of energy and poverty concerns are not part of the planning and implementation of current rural energy projects and programmes, but the development of such tools would be beneficial. Indicators and benchmarks that measure benefits from energy services, in general, and rural energy services, in particular, and, more importantly, that keep track of those who benefit, can be developed and put into the statistical yearbook. Some of the key objectives in developing a comprehensive M&E framework for addressing energy and poverty concerns in tandem are indicated below: \u2022 Sectoral indicators and benchmarks should be developed for coal, petroleum and electricity \u2022 Rural energy surveys should be conducted periodically, utilizing indicators that measure factors in terms of per geographical unit or per capita, such as levels of household consumption, productive consumption, energy based enterprises and energy provision networks Indicators should take into account gaps between higher and lower income groups, urban and rural users, and women and men. 23 Energy and Poverty in Viet Nam MEETING THE CHALLENGES I CONCLUSION \u2022 Information should be collected from rural development projects, sectors and national programmes/projects \u2022 The periodic VHLSS should include an additional section on linkages between income and energy use and should collect consistent energy data at the household level Technical guidelines and management procedures must be formulated and enforced by local authorities. Requirements and contents of capacity- building for statistical information staff need to be developed so that they can successfully and effectively set indicators and benchmarks related to the specific issues. Then, capacity-building for staff members who are working in energy, economic and statistical information sectors should be conducted so that they have sufficient knowledge and skills in gathering, managing, treating and storing data related to energy- and poverty-related issues. t is apparent that sustainable energy development is a prerequisite to pursuing rapid sustainable economic growth that reduces poverty while ensuring a comprehensive, pro-poor growth strategy.

In particular, although rural poverty reduction and energy services should go hand- in-hand, the required cross-sectoral institutional synergy is lacking at the central and provincial levels. Patterns in energy development focus also contribute to the current inefficiency. Large investment in rural electrification, while resulting in better access for the poor to energy, might compromise investment in and drive away the focus on other types of energy, particularly, the renewable sources that the poor depend on heavily. Also, various existing financial schemes for SME development, rural development and poverty reduction do not address modern energy services at all. The resulting lack of information on the roles of energy services to inform policy and programme development is considerably responsible for the current situation. To fill these gaps, a concerted effort for policy and institutional development and financial resource mobilization should be in place, involving multi-stakeholders, including government agencies, research institutions and academics, local authorities, and civil society. Apart from issues concerning information gaps and lack of resources, biomass potential is a very important factor surrounding the future of energy and poverty in Viet Nam. Despite the fact that biomass accounts for a significant share of the national energy consumption, and is the 24 Energy and Poverty in Viet Nam CONCLUSION almost exclusive source of energy for the poor, it is ignored by the Government at the policy level. Efficient usage of biomass is a key area that could provide opportunities to ensure sustainability, quality and affordability of energy service for the poor. It, however, requires greater recognition in national energy policy and appropriate follow-through and allocation of financial resources. At the immediate stage, investment in R&D for low-cost technology (such as improved cook stoves and kilns) could meet the need for cleaner and more efficient biomass usage. Concerning financial aspects, existing microcredit schemes could certainly provide support for rural energy development with slight adjustment to the considerations and regulations for lending. Regarding information and knowledge sharing, poverty-energy linkage indicators can be included in the existing poverty assessment and household living standard surveys. In the long term, modern renewable energy offers great potential for providing energy services to the rural poor, especially those not connected to electricity grids. At specific locations and petroleum product price levels, they are likely to be cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives, which also impose external costs on the environment and human health. Internalizing these costs will improve the competitiveness of renewable energy vis \u00e0 vis the non-renewable fossil fuel sources. Besides improved living conditions, RETs also offer opportunities for income generation (UNDP 2007b). To facilitate comprehensive energy policy development, a nation-wide survey to inventorize biomass and other renewable energy sources and technology capability should be undertaken on a regular basis. Decentralization in the energy sector should be fostered to give more autonomy and responsibility to local authorities in dealing with local energy needs for local development. 26 SCHEMATIC REPRESENTATION OF CHALLENGES AND MODALITIES TO MEET THE CHALLENGES THE CHALLENGES MEETING THE CHALLENGES No institution with clear mandate and responsibility for providing traditional/ non-electric energy services to rural areas or for managing and regulating rural cooking fuel services delivery Lack of institutional focus on rural energy provision for poverty alleviation and decentralization Strong government control over energy service provision, and state corporations remain close to monopolies Institutional Structure Policy and Regulatory Framework High dependence on traditional biomass energy not recognized in policy framework Inadequate mechanism to provide sufficient energy services to lower income households in rural areas; Existing tariff framework, despite government subsidy, remains problematic Clearly define responsibilities and roles so that implementation of institutional reforms can be sped up Corporate entities should be given a greater role and cover remote areas and deprived communities A memorandum of understanding between corporate entities and government ministries should be prepared, setting out terms of delivery and pricing for the benefit of lower income households Set up a short-term cross- sectoral committee to ensure that the division of roles and responsibilities becomes a reality and is directed towards greater institutional decentralization for developing rural energy services for poverty reduction Provincial departments responsible for energy development as well as local governments should be involved in poverty reduction programmes and projects Develop capacity to use tools and frameworks for integrated rural energy development planning as they relate to poverty reduction initiatives in MARD and MoLISA and its associated bodies;

In response, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) embarked on an ambitious plan to support countries in preparing long term, results-based devel- opment strategies in line with the MDGs. At the heart of the plan is an integrated package of policy advice and technical support, known as \u2018MDG Support Services\u2019, aimed at strengthening countries\u2019 capacity to achieve the MDGs. UNDP started rolling out MDG Support Services initially in 19 countries in 2006 with the target of reaching a total of 120 countries by 2008. Access to energy is central to all aspects of sustainable development, including access to water, agricul- tural and industrial productivity, health care, educational attainment, job creation and climate change impacts. Nearly two thirds of the world\u2019s poor have no access or limited access to this very basic ener- gy input. Affordable, accessible and reliable energy supply is critical for the lives of poor people as well as for the economic growth of a country. Therefore, this Guide emphasizes the need for an inte- grated, multisectoral approach to energy needs assessments and cost estimates. Although access to clean energy facilitates economic development and sustainable livelihoods by improving quality of life for the poor, it is not often that planners of developing countries consider energy delivery as an integrating instrument that supports a comprehensive national development path. Developing coun- try governments can play a major role in addressing poverty by ensuring access to energy services through both centralized and decentralized energy sources. In the recent past, there has been an excessive focus on the provision of electricity to poor people, which is not always the most appropri- ate, cost effective and efficient way of providing energy services to the poor. Thanks to the UN Millennium Project, a number of tools already exist for assisting governments in esti- mating costs for interrelated actions needed to achieve the MDGs. Recognizing the critical role that energy plays in reaching the MDGs, the UNDP Regional Centre for Asia and the Pacific in Bangkok built upon an earlier version of the UN Millennium Project\u2019s energy costing", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6decc24f-de35-4f78-95dc-71cecdca7c49": {"__data__": {"id_": "6decc24f-de35-4f78-95dc-71cecdca7c49", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Costing Tool: User Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d66addb04eb5e2193e25d9ece3831c7951c2ad560e6b9204e42b5b85ae06c81"}, "3": {"node_id": "392edb2d-de63-4c34-ad02-ea212ba83292", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e3d2c284cf4afb8f60619fca44d682cb5257f10e417da575c55299425b37b6b8"}}, "hash": "e70723d896849f87229a6db2bdf321196e945614267e8712972629f2ebe5699f", "text": "tool that was first applied in Senegal, and redesigned it for the context of Asia and the Pacific. This Tool is designed for use by government planners and decision makers as they adapt their national development strategies to meet country-specific targets for the year 2015 based on the MDGs. A cru- cial part of this process is MDG costing, which quantifies the specific financial and human resources needed, as well as infrastructure required, to meet the MDGs. Costing is part of a larger needs assess- ment process in which countries define specific interventions and outcome targets consistent with the MDGs. Pilot runs of the tool make a convincing case for the opportunities it provides for integrat- ed resource planning in support of MDGs. Marcia VJ Kran Head of Policy and Programmes, UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok January 2009 vi Energy costing tool user\u2019s guide Preface ThE PREPARATIoN of national development strategies based on the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) provides a unique opportunity to integrate energy access considerations as a vital element of economic development, along side reducing hunger and improving health care and edu- cation. The need for a multisectoral approach to energy needs assessment and systematic costing of the available options can hardly be over emphasized. The Energy Costing Tool and the User\u2019s Guide are the product of almost two years of effort, extensive consultation and trial runs amongst partner countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The Energy Costing Tool lays out an exhaustive menu of energy technology options and their costs for a country in the context of it\u2019s own socio-economic, geographic and resources baseline. Focus is on modern energy carriers, as well as quality of energy end use services and not the quantum of energy derived. It helps identify likely minimum cost energy mixes, for the short, medium and the long term, especially by aligning energy access investments in the national budget. The User's Guide is organized into three sections. The first provides a brief introduction to the context in which the Tool was developed. It also outlines the national decision-making process that must under- pin an energy costing exercise. This process entails identifying MDG-compatible energy interventions and setting long-term energy access targets. The second section provides a detailed introduction to the Energy Costing Tool itself, including step-by-step instructions on using the Tool. The last part is an annex where descriptions of the calculations performed by the Tool are presented. Sections 1 and 2, and subsections 4.9 to 11 of this Guide have been developed based on the content of an earlier version of the Guide developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the UN Millennium Project. The Tool is Excel-based, which enables transparencies in terms of inputs, methods, relationships, equa- tions and outputs. It is also flexible enough for the user to intervene at every stage of its use. The Tool has 13 worksheets in total, beginning with the \u2018Cover\u2019 and ending with the \u2018Summary\u2019. The summary worksheet reports the results in tables and figures. Out of the remaining 11 modules (or worksheets), there are one each for \u2018Overview\u2019 and \u2018Glossary of technologies\u2019, two are exclusively for data entry (\u2018Design parameters\u2019 and \u2018MDG needs\u2019), three modules are for unit energy cost estimation (\u2018Energy production\u2019, \u2018Electricity production\u2019 and \u2018Energy end-use\u2019), one module for costing (\u2018Capacity devel- opment\u2019) and three modules for MDG scenarios (\u2018Baseline\u2019, \u2018Short-term\u2019 and \u2018Medium-term\u2019 scenarios).

Few PRSPs attempt a comprehensive costing of their priority actions or use detailed cost estimates as the basis for allocating resources for develop- ment priorities in national budgets or mid-term expenditure frameworks. It was with this in mind that UNDP and the Millennium Project developed the original Energy Cost- ing Tool. The Tool was meant to assist countries in assessing the fiscal implications of reaching their development goals and help develop stronger linkages between policy, planning and budgeting by providing them with a methodology for estimating the costs of expanding access to basic energy services in line with medium and long-term development priorities. Subsequently it was felt by many that there is a need for a modified version of the Energy Costing Tool, which has a focus on the needs of Asia and the Pacific region. With this objective in mind, the team from the Regional Energy Pro- gramme for Poverty Reduction (REP-PoR), Energy and Environment Group, UNDP Regional Centre, Bangkok ventured into developing the current version of the Tool. The present version of the Energy Costing Tool is conceptually similar to that developed originally by UNDP and the UN Millennium Project though it differs in perspective of presentation, scope and coverage. Conceptually the tool tried to capture the recommendations of a team of experts that coun- tries adopt a bold multi-year investment framework for meeting the quantitative targets set out in the MDGs, rather than merely considering how to gradually accelerate progress towards the goals. 2 Energy costing tool user\u2019s guide \u201cInstead of asking \u2018How close can we get to the Goals given current financial and other constraints?\u2019 countries should ask the question \u2018Which investments and policy changes are needed to meet the Goals\u2019?\u201d (World Bank/Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), UNDP and UN Millen- nium Project, 2005). The approach involves working backwards from the outcome targets for each MDG to identify what actions and resources are needed now to reach those outcomes by 2015. This is particularly relevant to energy, as current approaches to energy planning by government agen- cies and utilities tend to focus on short-term responses to pressures for urban and industrial growth. Possibilities for expanding energy access to sparsely populated rural areas or poor urban settlements are generally considered only when specific project resources are made available, or when there has been a detailed study in a specific area demonstrating that there are enough customers able to pay for energy services. The Energy Costing Tool, however, provides a methodology for calculating the cost of the overall, long-term investments in energy access required for national development and pover- ty alleviation. It is meant to show national decision makers what is needed to meet the MDGs by 2015, rather than focusing just on what can be accomplished based on current budget projections. Using the Energy Costing Tool, governments and utilities can formulate multi-year plans that incorpo- rate quantitative estimates of the energy requirements and costs associated with national strategies to meet the MDGs. Those numbers can then be integrated into long-term development plans, budg- ets and requests for financial assistance. To better understand how to use the Energy Costing Tool, it is useful to consider, in detail, its role with- in countries\u2019 efforts to move toward MDG-based national development planning, including national needs assessments. 1.1 What is an MDG-based national development strategy? Turning national development plans into MDG-based strategies involves not only longer-term plan- ning \u2013 based on targets for 2015 \u2013 but also results-oriented planning. With the promise of increased official development assistance (ODA) for meeting the MDGs, governments have an opportunity to put together multi-year national budgets based on what is needed to meet the MDGs, rather than only considering shorter-term budgets based on resources they already have available. The current challenge is to get these MDG-based strategies set up and funded in the short term, with continuous resource allocations over the next few years, so that countries can get on track early enough to make significant progress by 2015. For poorer countries, national planning has become primarily focused on the preparation of PRSPs, based on a process of consultations with stakeholders within the country, including civil society groups. The PRSPs are intended to formally incorporate poverty reduction measures into three- to five-year public expenditure plans adopted by governments and international donors. Given the stra- tegic importance of the PRSPs for the countries most affected by poverty, hunger, health crises and environmental degradation, it is critical to link PRSPs with longer-term national development strate- gies to achieve the MDGs using mid-term expenditure frameworks and other budgeting mechanisms.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e3a5873-76c1-49a7-8fbe-8c5966df2be9": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e3a5873-76c1-49a7-8fbe-8c5966df2be9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Costing Tool: User Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bd97ffb6daf3b7c11e805e7ac30be580d292088972b90c1dd37faad7c3877f08"}}, "hash": "bd97ffb6daf3b7c11e805e7ac30be580d292088972b90c1dd37faad7c3877f08", "text": "Because of the crucial need for energy services in poor communities, it is important to enhance the attention given to energy planning within the PRSPs and MDG processes. UNDP has therefore become increasingly involved in efforts to build greater understanding of the energy\u2013poverty nexus and to integrate energy interventions into poverty reduction plans and budgets. 1. Introduction 3 1.2 Why is access to modern energy services important to meeting the MDGs? Without access to an adequate quantity and quality of modern energy services, achievement of the MDGs will not be possible. With human development being strongly linked to sustainable econom- ic development (in terms of scope, growth, reach and spread) energy becomes the natural binder. Expanded energy services are essential to meet the MDGs for reducing hunger and poverty, improv- ing health care and educational opportunities, and addressing gender equity. In addition, energy is central to all aspects of sustainable development, including access to water, agricultural and industrial productivity, health care, educational attainment, job creation and climate change impacts. Afforda- ble, accessible and reliable energy supply for delivering modern energy services is critical for uplifting the poor as well as for economic growth of a country. In many developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, large numbers of people still live without any access to modern energy services. There are currently 1.6 billion people in the world, many in rural areas, without electricity. In addition, 2.4 billion people rely on traditional fuels \u2013 wood, dung and agricultural residues \u2013 to meet their dai- ly heating and cooking needs. This situation has serious impacts on people\u2019s health and the condition of the natural environment. It also severely limits people\u2019s economic opportunities and ability to over- come poverty. Major changes in the energy service delivery system are needed so that expansion of energy access can become an important instrument for sustainable development. Even though there is no MDG directly addressing energy access, it is clear that reaching the Goals will require great improvements in the quality and quantity of energy services in the developing world. The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, which was adopted at the 2002 World Summit on Sus- tainable Development, recognized a direct link between energy services and poverty reduction, and called for joint actions to improve access to reliable and affordable energy services, \u201cbearing in mind that access to energy facilitates the eradication of poverty.\u201d In addition, access to energy services affects many other aspects of sustainable development, includ- ing income generation, gender equality, health care, education and environmental sustainability. The authors of the report Energy Services for the Millennium Development Goals (World Bank/ESMAP, UNDP and UN Millennium Project, 2005), recommend that national governments \u201cplace the issue of energy services at par with other MDGs\u201d. They also recommend that countries systematically integrate their energy sector development strategies into a comprehensive MDG-based national develop- ment strategy. 1.3 What does conducting an MDG needs assessment entail? To assist countries in developing MDG needs assessments, the UN Millennium Project produced Pre- paring National Strategies to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals: A Handbook (www.undp. org/poverty/tools.htm). The Project has also put together a set of costing and needs assessment tools for a number of MDG-related issues, including education, gender, water and sanitation, hunger, and various health topics (www.undp.org/poverty/tools.htm). The Handbook outlines the steps involved in formulating an MDG-based national development strat- egy. The first activity is to adapt the MDGs to each country-specific situation by defining appropriate 4 Energy costing tool user\u2019s guide national outcome targets based on the MDGs. This will require coordinated planning across all nation- al sectors and ministries. Once outcome targets have been set, there are four steps for conducting an overall MDG needs assessment, as illustrated in Figure 1. FIGURE 1: Steps in an MDG needs assessment Develop a list of interventions Estimate resource needs Check results Specify targets for each set of interventions These same steps should also be followed in preparing needs assessments for specific sectors or types of investments required for achieving the MDGs, including energy. Unlike other needs assessment tools that have been developed for sectors such as education and health, the Energy Costing Tool focuses mainly on Step 3 \u2013 estimating the costs of the interventions needed to achieve the MDGs (in this case those related to energy). While Steps 1 and 2 are discussed in subsequent sections for the purpose of providing context, this User Guide is not intended to provide concrete guidance in terms of helping to identify appropriate energy interventions or determine how to set targets.

Implementation of plans to meet the MDGs must be based on many different types of interrelated interventions, including actions to reduce hunger and poverty, promote better health care and edu- cation, and support environmental sustainability. As discussed earlier, in many countries, increased energy investments are critical for achieving goals of improved economic development, poverty reduction and expanded social services. However, despite its cross-sectoral importance, energy is too often considered a single-sector issue, and does not receive enough attention as a development priority. One reason for this is a general unfamiliarity among practitioners and policy makers regarding the links between energy and devel- opment. Energy planning has generally been the realm of specialized engineers and energy-sector experts, and is widely viewed as involving highly technical matters, such as numbers and types of 1. Introduction 5 electricity generators, miles of transmission lines, and facilities for importing, producing and distrib- uting oil, gas and other fuel supplies. As a result, energy policies and interventions tend to be skewed towards a narrow set of issues \u2013 for example, focusing exclusively on electrification, without any spe- cific regard to the needs and interests of the poor. When energy is mentioned in national MDG reports, it is usually analysed in terms of improving efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions rather than as a factor in poverty-reduction programmes. Due to the cross-cutting need for energy services, energy-planning processes can and should bring together representatives from a number of different government line ministries, economic sectors and planning perspectives. Just mentioning that energy requirements should be considered in other sectors of planning, such as health or education initiatives, does not provide decision makers with a sufficient basis for accomplishing that. Planners in a variety of sectors need to be involved with ener- gy experts in figuring out what energy services are needed and what it will cost to get them. This sort of cross-sectoral discussion about a country\u2019s energy needs and investment decisions provides an extremely useful opportunity for debate and coordination among different government offices, plan- ners and stakeholders within the country. Helping facilitate this kind of policy dialogue, by providing practitioners with a relatively simple methodology for estimating the cost of energy needs related to reaching the MDGs, is the key aim of the Energy Costing Tool. 1.5 Identifying interventions to expand energy access Before calculating quantitative cost estimates, country-specific planning exercises are needed to determine what sorts of interventions are most appropriate for expanding access to modern energy services for the poor. The first step for each country committed to implementing the MDGs is to look at each of the MDG targets \u2013 e.g. halving the proportion of people whose income is less than $1 a day, or halving the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, or reducing the child mortality rate by two- thirds \u2013 to determine what types of energy services would be needed in connection with each target. In terms of economic growth and poverty alleviation, countries need affordable and reliable access to energy for productive business and commercial activities. Increased access to energy would have the direct effect of allowing a larger proportion of the population to earn income. In terms of health care and educational goals, new schools and health facilities may be required. In many cases, countries will have already identified specific sector-based interventions as part of their development planning and budget projections \u2013 including requirements for human resources, infrastructure and financing. For MDG purposes, these planned sectoral interventions, and addition- al cross-cutting actions, will need to be put together in a comprehensive policy framework and a detailed integrated plan, with a timeline that extends to 2015. The UN Millennium Project\u2019s Preparing National Strategies to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals: A Handbook, outlines nine areas of activity or \u2018investment clusters\u2019 for MDG-based planning, including: 1. rural development (increasing food supplies and income levels); 2. urban development (promoting jobs, upgrading slums); 3. ensuring access to health services; 4. expanding education systems; 6 Energy costing tool user\u2019s guide 5. overcoming gender inequality; 6. improving environmental management; 7. building national science and technology capacities; 8. increasing cross-national cooperation and trade integration; 9. enhancing government management. In addition, the handbook points out that a comprehensive national needs assessment should include several critical areas not explicitly addressed by the MDGs, including access to energy and transporta- tion services, because these are critical for reaching many of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "acec5a0a-19a8-4677-8aa5-4c56b3780c53": {"__data__": {"id_": "acec5a0a-19a8-4677-8aa5-4c56b3780c53", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Costing Tool: User Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a0ca568bdb18ad2d6d542e63142f85e378f183cfb38cab484919f2bc1df8796d"}}, "hash": "a0ca568bdb18ad2d6d542e63142f85e378f183cfb38cab484919f2bc1df8796d", "text": "MDGs. Clearly, including energy services in an overall needs assessment is important, but it can be a challenge for planners to demonstrate clear, quantitative and causal relationships between energy services and progress towards meeting the MDGs. The Handbook, however, offers some suggestions for energy interventions that would be supportive of MDG targets.

Setting MDG-based national energy access targets 7 Setting MDG-based national energy access targets WhIlE ThE ChoICE oF INTERVENTIoNS involves an analysis of a country\u2019s energy needs and appropriate options for action, selecting targets requires decision makers to determine how much additional access to energy can reasonably be expected to be provided by 2015. Target-setting for energy is complicated by the fact that there is no established MDG target for access to energy services. Decisions about, for example, what proportion of people in rural areas should be provided with electricity or LPG stoves are not addressed in the agreed-upon international targets for the MDGs. Yet this is not actually so different from other MDG-related investment contexts, because even where there are specific MDG targets, every country needs to adapt and translate the goals into nationally appropriate action plans, which can be a complicated process. An energy target-setting exercise first requires collection of a comprehensive set of data about exist- ing conditions within the country. The starting point is to estimate current levels of access to different types of energy services \u2013 for cooking, heating and food processing, illumination and communications, commercial and business operations, transportation, and other applications essential for economic and social development \u2013 and then to consider what minimum levels of access are needed over time to support achievement of the MDGs by 2015. In some countries there may be quite a bit of informa- tion about energy usage and availability, while in others accumulating the necessary data will be a major challenge. Existing levels of energy availability \u2013 and possibilities for increasing those levels \u2013 may also vary great- ly depending on population density and geographical features in different regions of the country, or between urban and rural areas. In some cases, poverty and isolation are both causes for, and effects of, lack of energy access. Setting energy access targets for meeting national MDGs differs from business- as-usual energy planning by focusing on determining what is necessary to reduce poverty, rather than focusing mainly on extending the electrical grid to the places that are close to urban and/or industri- al areas \u2013 where the demand and the ability to pay is the greatest. Political factors, however, will also come into play in defining acceptable development goals and pri- orities, just as the targets set for the MDGs themselves reflected political decisions about what degree of poverty alleviation could reasonably be expected by 2015 \u2013 for example, reducing by half, rather than 90 or 100 percent, the proportion of people suffering from hunger. 2 8 Energy costing tool user\u2019s guide There are many questions that must be asked about expanding energy access, such as: \u2022\ufffdHow many households to try to reach? \u2022\ufffdHow many schools and health facilities, existing and new? \u2022\ufffdIn what parts of the country? \u2022\ufffdHow many in urban areas? \u2022\ufffdHow many in rural areas?

Examples of MDG-based national energy access targets do exist. The targets suggested by Energy Services for the Millennium Development Goals provide one example. The targets mentioned at right focus on a few key priorities for increasing energy access. Any par- ticular country\u2019s own energy coverage targets can be based on these targets, or other sources, or determined independently by the country based on its own objectives, conditions, data and inputs from different sectors and ministries, or arrived at on a regional basis \u2013 as was done recently by the countries in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The regional energy targets set by ECOWAS build on the goals for electrification adopted in 2002 by the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD). They also reflect the sector priorities defined by the Forum of Energy Ministers for Africa (FEMA) at the 2005 Millennium Summit, which were: mod- ern cooking fuels; energy for productive purposes; and energy services for community infrastructure, such as for refrigeration and lighting. 2. Setting MDG-based national energy access targets 9 Box 3 Regional energy targets set by the Economic Community of West African States (ECoWAS) In January 2006, the Heads of State of 15 West African countries adopted a regional policy on access to energy services for poverty reduction in line with achieving the MDGs. By 2015: 1. 100% of the total population will have access to modern cooking fuel or facilities; 2. at least 60% of people living in rural areas will have access to productive energy services in villages, in particular motive power to boost the productivity of economic activities; 3. 66% of the population will have access to an individual electricity supply, or: a. 100% of urban and peri-urban areas; b. 36% of rural populations; and c. 60% of the rural population will live in localities with: (i) modernized basic social services (health care, drinking water, communication, lighting, etc.); (ii) access to lighting, audiovisual and telecommunications; (iii) coverage of isolated populations with decentralized approaches.

This chapter explains how to use the Energy Costing Tool to estimate these costs. 3.1 Energy Costing Tool basics 3.1.1 Purpose, scope and limitations The Energy Costing Tool is an Excel-based model designed to assist countries in estimating the costs of increasing access to energy services to support the achievement of the MDGs. Some of the more important energy services that energy and energy appliances provide include illumination, refrigera- tion, communication, transportation, cooking, space heating, and mechanical power. The Tool covers the following categories of services as part of its analysis: 1. modern fuels and improved cooking systems (e.g. sustainable biomass and improved cook stoves); 2. electricity for lighting, and other important electricity based end-uses (e.g. information and com- munication technologies, cooling, etc.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf7355f7-6845-47f8-b33f-885e6cfb3e09": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf7355f7-6845-47f8-b33f-885e6cfb3e09", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Costing Tool: User Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d0899739d67e0907f7af82d5674dce3e0e7e2191e131d634262c87337630b0a8"}, "2": {"node_id": "0da6cc75-89bb-4519-83f5-17799e4d0768", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6468fcf74df913d207c85faf46cc21729b1256ffbed0e8de982427127531df90"}}, "hash": "8e906d0c5fea44b3e48fcb080f9c509974af9f13dfa4c19bee347fb2382f03ac", "text": "information and com- munication technologies, cooling, etc.); 3. mechanical power for agro/food processing, water pumping, enterprises and other productive uses; 4. modern fuels for heating in rural industries to create livelihood opportunities; 5. rural transport for increased access to livelihood opportunities The Tool\u2019s calculations are based on inputs provided by the country: nationally selected interventions and targets; data collected on population and current coverage rates; technologies that are readily available within a particular country; and unit costs of those technologies. 2.

It is designed to provide a flexible framework and an easily replicable methodology that different countries can use to estimate the energy expenditures needed for meeting their MDG-based objectives. The Energy Costing Tool is not a comprehensive investment model for a country\u2019s entire energy sector. Instead, the Tool estimates only the costs of meeting a minimum set of energy needs deemed essen- tial to achieve the MDGs. It does not cover large-scale interventions to increase a country\u2019s generating capacity, or to provide energy needs for transportation and industry, or to meet household demands above a minimum level. It is important to point out that the Energy Costing Tool is not a financial model. Since the Tool is based on an MDG needs assessment approach, it does not try to identify sources of financing for the inter- ventions needed, such as customer fees, government budgets or outside investments. This means that it does not take into account the amount consumers in a particular area would be willing or able to pay for energy services, or what funding sources might be available for providing energy access to unserved households and communities. Supplementary analysis will be needed to determine the financing framework for MDG investments in energy services, within the context of national develop- ment budgets and the investment frameworks of public and private energy providers. 3.1.2 Some of the data requirements The energy model requires users to supply a number of data inputs and \u2018parameters\u2019. These inputs fall into five basic categories: 1. Interventions and technology options describe the types of infrastructure and services deemed necessary for MDG-compatible levels of energy access, as well as the range of available technolo- gies for each type of service. 2. Categories of settlement (\u2018Rural\u2019 and \u2018Urban\u2019) are used to sort the different kinds of settlements in which people live (e.g. the capital city, other urban areas, or different types of rural settlements). This information will require a basic national census database. It is useful to identify the subre- gions under the categories of \u2018Rural\u2019 and \u2018Urban\u2019, if they are very different in economic or geographic characteristics. The classification of subregions under the two categories could be based on indica- tors related to demographics, economic development or geographic diversification. The selection of subregions should be made considering that there is sufficient data available with respect to required variables. 3. Population and current access figures are needed to establish basic population parameters. Required inputs include: population and household size for each settlement category; numbers of education, health and community institutions in each settlement category; and current coverage rates for each energy service. This information is typically found in national population census- es, administrative data from various agencies and statistical databases. Alternately, the user can estimate some of these inputs by using simple ratios, for example, by assuming that there are X number of educational institutions per community. 4. Targets and minimum needs inputs describe the 5-year terminal year goals for coverage for each type of intervention, as well as minimum MDG-compatible consumption levels (such as kilograms of fuel per household per year). As discussed in previous sections, these targets will be determined by a combination of political and practical national decision-making processes. 12 Energy costing tool user\u2019s guide 3.2 Using the Energy Costing Tool 3.2.1 Important features of the Tool Some of the important features of the Energy Costing Tool are: \u2022\ufffdThe Tool is Excel-based, which enables transparencies in terms of inputs, methods, relationships, equations and outputs.

However, adding new categories (in a few worksheets it is \u2018new columns\u2019 and in some other worksheets it is \u2018new set of rows\u2019 or both) may require establishing linkages between the relevant cells (of the same or another worksheet) and also editing the formulas.

The access targets are to be fixed in terms of percentage access to end-uses, fuels, etc. The technology choices could be either for grid or off-grid energy sources. This decision-making process is facilitated by the readily available information relat- ed to the unit costs of various technologies and alternatives in the Tool. The policy maker can make comparisons between alternatives then arrive at a prioritized decision. The inputs required for all the MDG needs, in terms of access targets and quantum of energy, are consolidated into one work- sheet. This facilitates easy data entry and enables the decision maker to compare different end-uses, technology/fuel alternatives and sectors while prioritizing/fixing targets. \u2022\ufffdElectricity, being the most versatile energy carrier capable of satisfying various end-uses, has com- prehensive coverage in the Tool. This is both in terms of technologies and sectors. 2. Using the Energy Costing Tool to estimate the costs of meeting national MDG-based energy needs 13 3.2.2 Conceptual overview of the Tool The conceptual overview of the overall approach adopted in costing the energy needs for MDGs is presented in Figure 2. In simple terms, the total cost is the sum of two components: (1) the product of the unit cost of energy and the MDG needs targets; and (2) the capacity development cost of ener- gy access. The unit cost of energy is a sum of the unit cost of energy supply (UCOES) and the unit cost of energy end-use. As can be seen in Figure 2, the energy carrier/technology options considered are quite comprehensive in coverage. In the Tool, there is a provision for estimating the unit cost of ener- gy supply for energy carriers that can be purchased directly from the market (the UCOES in this case would be the average prices prevailing in the markets); that need to be produced (which are not typ- ically traded in the market, like sustainable biomass and biogas); and for electricity generation. In the case of electricity generation, the Tool has provisions for estimating UCOES for both small-scale dis- tributed electricity generation technologies, as well as large-scale grid connected technologies. The Life Cycle Costing (LCC) method has been used for estimating the UCOES for options under energy purchased and electricity produced. The methodology of LCC is discussed in detail in the next section. The unit cost of distribution needs to be added to the unit cost of electricity produced, if the gener- ation options are distributed power. Unit costs of both transmission and distribution also need to be added if the alternatives come under grid connected power. The underlying assumptions are that the distributed power generation facility is located near the demand point, whereas (by design) the large-scale grid connected power generation plants are located far away from demand centres.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3534e399-d544-4b1d-82e4-b50bf63520f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "3534e399-d544-4b1d-82e4-b50bf63520f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Costing Tool: User Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "34d18a60fa5d7d92dab69a63133dc77f3c52aaeb6802d3de545e88de2ff61b4f"}, "2": {"node_id": "aec51460-093a-4da1-92c6-e6481f7e0a1d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05976bd5a09a8cafec830471bd846a3f8319442b78c0bdc783e15d6e4513995b"}}, "hash": "40b5a1e9dc22b2cdf81c17088d5946e5653a5798e90a3f65e082fab4a2649699", "text": "The estimation of the unit costs of both transmission and distribution (T&D) systems has also been made using the LCC method.

Instructions for using the Energy Costing Tool 19 In the section \u2018Planning target years\u2019, the user should enter the baseline or base year and appropri- ate short-term and medium-term target years. This should span the whole planning horizon; starting with the first year for which the data is available (as base year), some mid-point year (to track the progress in-between) and the terminal year. The length is basically the dif- ference between the short- and medium-term years and the base year, calculated automatically. \u2018Conversion factors\u2019 or \u2018energy conversion factors\u2019 are the factors used for converting from the pri- mary unit of measurement of the energy carrier to a common unit, gigajoules (GJ). The use of common measurement units for energy facil- itates comparison and summation of various types of energy carriers. The conversion factors used are the standard ones from the literature. The user is free to change these fac- tors only if they find that the factors used are incorrect and the correct factors are available. Table 2 depicts the part of the worksheet where the user needs to identify and enter the subsectors where MDG-related interventions are required. These interventions are defined in terms of energy end-use services and are prioritized according to development needs such as: access to modern ener- gy services; productive livelihood opportunities; energy access for improved quality of education and health services; rural employment; rural transport, etc. While selecting the intervention subsectors, and matching them with the end-uses, the above issues need to be kept in mind.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cdbc8978-6f0a-40e7-b13d-094627d5d2de": {"__data__": {"id_": "cdbc8978-6f0a-40e7-b13d-094627d5d2de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Costing Tool: User Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "019752f2ab027b80c2428d73c65c523857223ed62a6b03c955bf41443371c9ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "95ccead9-85f4-4afd-9ee1-6fbfb914e4b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f4ec1c878d6e83787ce19eaf44c46abbb76dc34e578ebcc652c88feb77dca72"}}, "hash": "3e5618a755ee16c071abed4a58b13df942367b087f3e6e6695b16a3f34c12686", "text": "TABlE 2: MDG interventions: Sectors and end-uses Discount rate (%) 10 Planning horizon (Years) 10 T&D loss (%) 15 Distribution loss (%) 5 Planning target years Term Year Length Baseline 2006 0 Short 2010 4 Medium 2015 9 Conversion factors Fuels 1 unit of GJ Electricity kWh Biogas (M3) 0.023 Biomass tonne 15 Kerosene litre 0.037 LPG tonne 45.5 Natural gas (M3) 0.028 Fuel Oil litre 0.040 Diesel litre 0.039 Petrol litre 0.034 Solar GJ 1.000 Biodiesel litre 0.023 Ethanol litre 0.023 Input currency USD Output currency USD Discount rate (%) 10 Planning horizon (Years) 10 T&D loss (%) 15 Distribution loss (%) 5 Planning target years Term Year Length Baseline 2006 0 Short 2010 4 Medium 2015 9 Conversion factors Fuels 1 unit of GJ Electricity kWh 0.0036 Biogas (M3) 0.023 Biomass tonne 15 Kerosene litre 0.037", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e09fb18b-2f20-4776-8d44-da4da524ee74": {"__data__": {"id_": "e09fb18b-2f20-4776-8d44-da4da524ee74", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Costing Tool: User Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aec0c5ec3a34690fd84b8081a2d69f6acf8befc453c1cf682f543657d8fc4bbb"}, "3": {"node_id": "e3e69e3c-a90c-44ef-bb58-5bc0b3496bd3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "372242f6267551374bc6fd319c34799ce602cbbf0bb64b35e3edfb51571c3d93"}}, "hash": "6f39f09f74ac1ae87332836c64520a9a3389851f39aca8357c48bc0862170f9f", "text": "LPG tonne 45.5 Natural gas (M3) 0.028 Fuel Oil litre 0.040 Diesel litre 0.039 Petrol litre 0.034 Solar GJ 1.000 Biodiesel litre 0.023 Ethanol litre 0.023 Exchange rate (in terms of output currency per input currency) 1 Households cooking/heating & Households electricity lighting Households -

The classification of subregions under the two categories could be based on indicators related to demographics, economic development or geo- graphic diversification. The selection of subregions should be made based on whether there is sufficient data available with respect to required variables. In the illustrated case, provisions are made for entering a maximum of four rural subregions and three urban subregions. The user should name the subregions in a way appropriate for the given country. Users can have a total of seven rural and urban subregions without requiring additional modifications. However, if the user desires to have more than seven subregions they need to insert additional columns, and all the required linkages in all the relevant worksheets need to be created to get the final results. This requires a reasonably high level of expertise in using Excel and understanding the equations/formulas. TABlE 3: Prioritized subregions Sub regions Rural Rural 1 Rural 2 Rural 3 Rural 4 Urban Urban 1 Urban 2 Urban 3 The classification of sub regions under the two categories of 'Rural' and 'Urban' could be based on indicators related to demographics, economic development or geographic diversification Table 4 illustrates the Excel sheet for entering demographic and sectoral information.

The part of the worksheet illustrated in Table 5 contains the various types of energy carriers required, electricity generation technologies and the estimated emission factors (in CO2 kg/unit quantity of energy). The list of energy carriers and electricity generation technologies is quite exhaustive and the need for adding any new alternatives is minimal. The options considered for electricity generation include both conventional fossil-fuel-based as well as renewable energy technologies. Additionally, the options include both large-scale centralized and small-scale distributed technologies.

However, average emission factors for the existing grid depend on the 22 Energy costing tool user\u2019s guide composition of the grid and need to be estimated by the user. In the case of some of the carriers, there may be some variations in the emission factors presented here. If the correct emission factors are avail- able those can be entered appropriately. Solar energy with zero CO2 emissions is recommended for thermal applications such as solar cookers, solar water heaters and solar driers. Emissions from sus- tainable biomass, biogas, micro-hydro, grid-hydro, biodiesel and ethanol have been assumed to be zero. If the users have a different perception they can enter the correct values. The part of the worksheet illustrated in Table 6 needs inputs in terms of energy carrier prices for all the chosen energy carriers. Only in the case of biofuel, is the price determined from analysis carried out in another worksheet. Average prices prevailing in the country could be used. In the case of biomass, the prevailing market price or that estimated in the \u2018Energy production\u2019 worksheet can be used (this esti- mate can be used only if the biomass is sourced from a sustainable energy plantation).

Instructions for using the Energy Costing Tool 23 The third part of Table 6 provides the user with a choice to use either \u2018Average cost of supply\u2019 or \u2018Mar- ginal cost of supply\u2019 in estimating the cost implications of meeting MDG needs through electricity generated from the existing electricity grid (currently available installed capacity of power genera- tion).

The average cost is estimated by averaging the cost of electric- ity generation from all the existing power generation plants. Two components of the average cost, the capital cost and the operating cost (or recurring cost) need to be obtained. \u2022\ufffdThe marginal costs (per kWh) are the cost of generating electricity from the new installed capacity of different types of primary energy (coal, natural gas, hydro, etc.). If the policy maker wishes to use the cost of generating the incremental unit of energy rather than the historical cost then he or she can use the marginal cost. The marginal cost for the existing grid is estimated by taking the weight- ed average of the unit costs of electricity generation from new installed capacity. The weights are determined by the shares of various capacities in the existing grid. In the cyan-coloured cell, the users need to enter \u20181\u2019 if they want to use the average cost of supply, or \u20180\u2019 for marginal cost of supply. The details of average cost of supply need to be entered by the user where- as the details of marginal cost of supply are obtained from the \u2018Electricity production\u2019 worksheet. The average cost of supply is the estimate arrived at by averaging the cost information obtained from all the existing power plants. The marginal cost of supply is the cost of adding the incremental unit of energy. 4.3 Costing energy production The \u2018Energy production\u2019 worksheet (Table 7) has been created for estimating the cost of producing energy carriers which are not traded in the market and for which market prices are not available. Biogas, sustainable biomass and biodiesel come under this category. The first few rows give infor- mation on units of measurement used for various parameters. For example, the unit of capacity for biogas is m3/day whereas it is hectare for sustainable biomass. Similarly, the unit of energy production is m3 for biogas and tonne for biomass. The last rose-coloured row contains information on the type of input fuel required to produce the necessary energy carrier. The part of the worksheet coloured yellow (Table 7) indicates that the user needs to provide the data required for analysis. As mentioned earlier, the Energy Costing Tool has been designed and developed in such a way that the first column provides row-specific descriptions for all the subsequent columns. From the second column onwards, calculations are performed for each of the chosen technologies to estimate the unit cost of energy production based on the input data (entered in yellow-coloured cells). For a given technology (say biogas), the assessment begins with defining units of measurement and ends with various cost estimates per unit of energy (per m3 for biogas). One column of a worksheet is adequate for assessing one technology. For repeating such an assessment for the next chosen tech- nology, just copy the column of data to the next empty column. Make appropriate changes, such as the name of the energy production technology, units of measurement and type of fuel inputs. Enter the relevant data in the yellow cells of the new column. With these changes, the required results for the new technology will be automatically obtained. 24 Energy costing tool user\u2019s guide For example, in the illustrated case (Table 7), if the data entry and calculation procedures are estab- lished for biogas, then replicating this for sustainable biomass and biodiesel is very easy and just requires copying the biogas columns into new empty columns and making the necessary changes as suggested above. The cells in the next two rows (coloured tan) contain data obtained from the linked cells of the \u2018Design parameters\u2019 worksheet. The cells in yellow-coloured rows are crucial for the user of the Tool. The data specific to each technol- ogy needs to be obtained and entered here. Some of the data is standard, which need not be changed and some other data is country-specific. The user has to obtain such country-specific data to make costing valid for a particular country. To support data entry, the following points would be useful: \u2022\ufffdlife (years): Enter the typical life span of the energy production facility. The data needs to be changed only if the user feels that the numbers entered here are inappropriate and they have the correct ones. \u2022\ufffdConstruction time (years): Enter the construction time required to build the production facility. The data needs to be changed only if the user feels that the numbers entered here are inappropri- ate and they have the correct ones. \u2022\ufffdNumber of crop rotations: This is relevant only for sustainable biomass", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c838d361-de56-44f3-a80f-1f5aed4be4fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "c838d361-de56-44f3-a80f-1f5aed4be4fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Costing Tool: User Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6db93aa9a49ee738a5dfecf9433188060889cff093bcceaf44513aafc2feda4a"}, "3": {"node_id": "ea6afa52-856b-4fa6-94e2-f28d56c600c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5e35f26cb79392d7ebb5fb9e9a53991a72b315d957719af8c1086602911ddd35"}}, "hash": "3ee4e48f802e778826ed9279c98dfbcd14f9e9e7b429bce3eb2ecf7000c711b8", "text": "production. Here the assumption is that the energy plantation is of fast growing eucalyptus. It has been estimated that one hectare of eucalyptus gives 64 tonnes of fuel wood three times in 24 years (a total of 192 tonnes in 24 years). That is a rotation period of 8 years with 3 rotations in 24 years. The user can provide new data for an alternative fast growing species if available. \u2022\ufffdCapacity: The user should enter the capacity of the energy production plant. The capacity is given in terms of energy production per unit of any physical measure. In the illustrated case, the biogas plant considered is small scale, with a biogas production capacity of 8 m3 per day. The capacity consid- ered for a sustainable biomass production plant is one hectare and that for a biodiesel plant is 3000 tonnes per year. The user can make appropriate changes to the capacities of the plant with suitable changes to other parameters. \u2022\ufffdProduction per rotation per unit: This is relevant only for sustainable biomass production and the required explanation is given above. \u2022\ufffdCapacity factor (%): This is determined by the number of hours in a year the energy production plant functions.

This is the total capital cost required to establish the distribution system to supply biogas to individual houses. This is country-specific and needs to be revised. \u2022\ufffdAnnual o&M cost per unit of capacity in input currency: This is the annual cost incurred for oper- ation and maintenance (O&M) of the production facility. This cost needs to be given per unit of capacity (as explained above). \u2022\ufffdFuel requirement per unit of capacity: This is an input fuel consumption norm. This data needs to be changed only if new information is available. In the illustrated case, this data is relevant only for biogas and biodiesel. 4. Instructions for using the Energy Costing Tool 25 \u2022\ufffdPrice paid for fuel per unit in input currency: In the situation illustrated in Table 7, the input fuel for biogas (dung) is assumed to be free since equivalent amount of fertilizer can be returned to the supplier of the dung. However, this assumption can be changed and an appropriate price can be entered.

Appropriate formulas have been created to perform this analysis. The cells in the last few rows provide results of the analysis. (Please refer to Annex 1 for detailed explanation of the procedure adopted for unit cost estimation.) 4.4 Costing of electricity production Tables 8 to 11 present the worksheet developed for the estimation of unit costs of electricity genera- tion from various technologies. The technologies considered include both large-scale centralized and small-scale distributed technologies. Further, cost estimations are also made for transmission, distri- bution and final connection. The total unit cost of electricity supply (e.g. USD/kWh) from a large-scale centralized technology would include costs of generation, transmission, distribution and final connec- tion. However, in the case of a distributed technology, the total unit cost excludes cost of transmission because the distributed technologies are expected to be located near the demand centres (e.g. villag- es). The unit costs of the T&D system have been estimated per kWh. It is more common to estimate the T&D cost per km and this is more appropriate for project specific financial estimates where the infor- mation on distances covered by the T&D lines are readily available or easily estimated. Whereas in the illustrated case, the cost estimates are made at a macro-scale and at national levels. It is impossible to get information on distances, which are both project as well as consumption centre specific, at such macro levels. Because of this it was felt that per kWh estimates are more appropriate and adequate for capturing cost implications. As with Table 7, Table 8 contains definitions of units of measurement for various parameters in the top few rows. The units of measurement have been given for input fuel, capacity, electricity, etc. For exam- ple, the unit of capacity for smaller plants (e.g. biomass gasifier power) has been defined in kW, where as it is MW for larger plants (grid coal). Similarly, the currency size is \u2018million\u2019 for larger plants. The next few rows have linked cells from the \u2018Design parameters\u2019 worksheet.

The data specific to each technology needs to be entered here. Some of the data is standard, which need not be changed and some other data is country-specific. The user must obtain such country-specific data to make costing valid for a particular country. To support data entry, the following points are provided: \u2022\ufffdlife of the plant (years): Enter the typical life span of the electricity generation plant. The data needs to be changed only if the user feels that the numbers entered here are inappropriate and they have the correct ones. \u2022\ufffdConstruction time (years): Enter the construction time required to build the generation plant. This is the duration from commencement to commissioning of the power plant. The data needs to be changed only if the user feels that the numbers entered here are inappropriate and they have the correct ones. \u2022\ufffdCapacity of the plant: Enter the capacity of the electricity production plant. The capacity is given in terms of the installed capacity of the power generation plant.

This is country-specific data. All the monetary data needs to be entered in single input currency (preferably the national currency). \u2022\ufffdEngine cost in input currency: This cost is relevant only for small-scale power generation plants which use diesel engines (small diesel power, biogas power and biomass gasifier power). This is the total capital cost of engines given the size of the power generation facility. This is country-specific data and needs to be revised by the user. The engine cost is required separately because the life of an engine is significantly shorter than that of the power plant as a whole. Therefore there is a need for frequent overhauling and replacement of engines during the life of the project. \u2022\ufffdoverhauling frequency (hours): Overhauling is an engineering process to recondition a diesel engine for continued use. A diesel engine needs to be overhauled every 6,000 hours to extend its life. Only three such overhaulings are possible for an engine, after which it needs to be replaced. The data of 6,000 hours only needs to be changed if the user has authentic alternative information. \u2022\ufffdoverhauling cost in input currency: Here the user needs to enter the cost of overhauling, applica- ble in the country. \u2022\ufffdNumber of overhaulings possible per engine: As explained above, this is three per engine. \u2022\ufffdAnnual o&M cost per unit of capacity in input currency: This is the annual cost incurred for oper- ation and maintenance of the power generation facility. This cost needs to be given per unit of capacity (as explained above). \u2022\ufffdPrimary fuel requirement per unit of electricity (per kWh): This is basically an input fuel (primary or main fuel) consumption norm. This data only needs to be changed if new information is available. 28 Energy costing tool user\u2019s guide \u2022\ufffdSecondary fuel requirement per unit of electricity (per kWh): This norm is similar to the prima- ry fuel norm. This is relevant only for small-scale distributed power plants like biogas power and biomass gasifier power, which use diesel engines as part of the generation plant. Here the second- ary fuel is diesel. Even in the case of grid-based coal thermal power plants, a small quantity of oil is required as secondary fuel. This data only needs to be changed if new information is available. \u2022\ufffdhuman resource requirement (No.): This is the number of workers needed to operate the energy production facility. \u2022\ufffdWorking hours per day: This is the number of working hours needed to operate the facility per day. The workers need not work full-time to operate these plants and wages will be paid accordingly. \u2022\ufffdAverage wage rate in input currency per day (of 8 hours): This is the average wage rate prevail- ing in the country. The average wage rates are high in the case of small-scale distributed power generation technologies because the human resource required is of a mix of unskilled, skilled and technical capabilities. The above explanations are also valid for Table 10. Table 9 illustrates the analytical section of the \u2018Electricity production\u2019 worksheet. A series of steps are performed to arrive at the unit costs. The unit costs are estimated per unit of electricity (kWh) and per unit of energy (GJ). The table also contains the estimates of human resource cost per unit of electricity for different technologies. As explained previously, having completed the analysis for one technology, replicating the analysis for the subsequent technologies is a simple process; just copy the completed column and paste it into the next empty column. Only the data in the yellow cells needs to be changed to get the new unit cost estimates for an electricity generation technology. This way one can devel- op the worksheet for all the required technologies. However, in the illustrated case, such a worksheet has already been built containing all currently available technologies. Only country-specific data need be revised. The cells in the last few rows provide results of the analysis.

As in the previous instances, the first few rows are related to units of measurement and the linked data from the earlier sheets. The data required for this analysis is limited to the following: \u2022\ufffdCapital cost of the end-use device in input currency: The capital or purchase cost of the end-use device (e.g. kerosene stove) needs to be entered here. In the case of lighting it may be difficult to provide the capital cost of end-use devices because there is large variety of lighting devices being used, in terms of cost, power input, technology and light output. With this in mind, it is advisable to use the total cost of all the lighting devices in a typical household. This would be the average capi- tal cost of lighting devices in a household. \u2022\ufffdlife of the device (years): The life of the end-use device needs to be entered here. For lighting, an average needs to be estimated and entered. \u2022\ufffdAnnual maintenance cost in input currency: Some of the end-use devices may require some cost to be incurred annually for maintenance. If information on such costs is available then that needs to be entered here. \u2022\ufffdoverall efficiency of the device (%): Again, if the relevant information is available then please enter the efficiency of the end-use device. For lighting, it has to be the overall average efficiency. It is relatively easy to obtain the above details for energy end-use devices used in households. Howev- er, such information would be difficult to obtain for end-uses in other sectors/institutions (represented in Table 13). Even in the case of households, if we want to capture the cost of utilization of electrici- ty for other end-uses (other than electricity) it is difficult to get the above information because of the large variety of devices. Again, we need to rely on average cost, overall efficiency, etc. This is also true for other institutions, such as community organizations, micro-industries, etc. In the case of electricity, the end-use cost estimates presented here also include the cost of provid- ing final connection at the premises.

"Instructions for using the Energy Costing Tool 35 4.6 MDG needs targets Tables 14 to 18 show the various parts of the worksheet that have been developed for entering the MDG needs targets for increasing access to modern energy carriers and end-services. The targets are those arrived at through a consultative process and are the outcome of decisions made by policy makers. The targets are fixed in terms of percentage, keeping the base year achievements as a refer- ence, and are based on the resource potential (capital and energy) and energy needs for achieving the MDGs. Targets need to be estimated for each of the end-use sectors, energy carriers and energy technologies. In the illustrated case, the targets are estimated for two terminal years, short-term (for 2010) and long-term (for 2015). These depend on the planning target years provided by the user in the \u2018Design parameters\u2019 worksheet. Thus, the MDG energy needs assessment is carried out for three sce- narios: Baseline (2006), 2010 and 2015. Compared to other worksheets, the \u2018MDG needs\u2019 worksheet is quite complex in terms of usage of colour codes. Here all possible colour codes are used; for data entry, decisions, decision support infor- mation, linked cells, etc. New colour codes, which are not present in other worksheets, are cyan and blue. Cyan indicates that the user needs to enter the information (as targets) based on the outcome of a decision-making process. Blue indicates that the information available could be used for arriving at some of these decisions. Table 14 represents the part of the work sheet that has been developed for entering targets for access to modern fuels for cooking and to modern cooking systems (or devices) in the household. The first part of Table 14 deals with overall access to modern cooking fuels across regions whereas the second part deals with fuel access. This division has been made to simplify the data entry process. The details of data entry requirements are as follows: \u2022\ufffdAll the information on fuel names, subregions, etc. is obtained from other worksheets and the users should not alter this. \u2022\ufffdBaseline (2006): Access levels to modern fuels are derived from fuel access levels. The cells are linked and therefore coloured tan. \u2022\ufffdTarget", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8089be73-a2bf-4f9d-a084-e9a69e65ef25": {"__data__": {"id_": "8089be73-a2bf-4f9d-a084-e9a69e65ef25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Costing Tool: User Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2423f4351c6974b59ee042b3a85a01085edae10b1cc2801b1dbf5a4e6061e65f"}}, "hash": "2423f4351c6974b59ee042b3a85a01085edae10b1cc2801b1dbf5a4e6061e65f", "text": "for 2010: Based on baseline access levels, the target access levels (as percentages) need to be determined and entered for all the chosen subregions. These targets are the outcome of a deci- sion-making process and are therefore coloured cyan. \u2022\ufffdTarget for 2015: This is similar to the above process but needs to be based on targets set for 2010. \u2022\ufffdBaseline access levels for modern fuels: The user needs to obtain data (or estimates) on current access levels (as percentages) for all modern fuel types across all selected subregions. The cells are coloured yellow, indicating that they are data entry cells. \u2022\ufffdFuel access targets for 2010: To simplify the data entry, as well as the decision-making processes, the fuel access targets need to be entered only for two main regions (rural and urban). The subre- gion targets are calculated using these regional targets and the overall targets determined above. The user needs to determine targets for all the modern fuels specific to rural and urban regions and enter this in cells coloured cyan. The information on cost/unit of useful output in GJ (in blue-col- oured cells) can be used while fixing targets and arriving at prioritization of fuel types. For example, the targets could be high for cheaper alternatives. \u2022\ufffdFuel access targets for 2015: The procedure here is similar to that used for fixing targets for 2010.

This facilitates the prioritization of technologies in order to create access to electric- ity for various end-uses. The information needs to be expressed in terms of the percentage share of contribution to creating this access. In other words, it is the relative share, in terms of installed capaci- ty (MWs) of each technology, of the total installed capacity of all technologies. Most of the information required is obtained from linked cells and estimated numbers, and only cells coloured yellow and cyan (decision outcomes) need data to be entered. The numbers in the blue cells support the decision-mak- ing process for arriving at the targets. This information is required for all the chosen subregions (rural and urban). \u2022\ufffdAccess to electricity technologies \u2013 Baseline (2006): The data on percentage contribution levels needs to be obtained from secondary sources. In the base year, the entries for all grid connected technologies will be zero since they are all accounted for under \u2018Existing grid\u2019. Only the contributions from small-scale distributed technologies need to be entered. Since the entries are based on current data, the information provided in the blues cells is not relevant for the base year.

The informa- tion required is quantity of energy needed for a chosen end-use per year. In the case of households, it is energy consumption per household per year (e.g. for cooking). The information is required for each subregion. For small/micro industry, the information required is a fuel-related average energy con- sumption for heating per year for the entire unit. In the case of agriculture, the diesel consumption per year needs to be entered (for tractors, pumpsets, etc.).

The capacity-building process needs to be multi-layered and include diverse stakeholders. Target stake- holder institutions include government, public and private organizations, civil society organizations and individuals. Considering this, the layers of the capacity-building programme should be as follows. 1. Sensitization programmes for leaders: The target audience for this programme would be the leaders who create policies and strategies. This could be a short one-day programme with expert 4. Instructions for using the Energy Costing Tool 41 talks and panel discussions to sensitize leaders about the need for a comprehensive mechanism to create energy access for those in need. The purpose would be to facilitate the creation of an ena- bling mechanism to implement prioritized programmes. The number of such one-day programmes should be decided based on country-specific requirements. 2. Senior-level empowerment programmes: The target audience would be senior bureaucrats, lead- ers of industry/civil society organizations, senior officials and managers. This could be a two-day programme with expert talks, panel discussions, experience sharing and group discussion sessions. The purpose would be to build capacity to successfully implement programmes. Again the number of such programmes would depend on the individual needs of a country. 3. Advanced middle-level empowerment programmes: The programme would target middle-level managers and officials. This could be a two-week programme (including days off) with techni- cal sessions, panel discussions, group discussions, group/individual exercises, field visits, etc. The purpose of the programme would be to build capacity to effectively implement and manage pro- grammes. The number of such programmes would depend on the individual needs of a country. 4. Basic operational-level skills building programmes: The target audience would be junior operational officers, technicians, and user groups. This could be a longer duration three-week pro- gramme with both classroom and field training. The focus should be on skills-building to operate and maintain the necessary equipment. The number of such programmes would depend on the requirements of a country. 5. Course programmes for new talent creation: The course programme would target pro- spective students who could become future managers, leaders, etc. This should be planned as a one-year diploma programme (both a diploma and a post-graduate diploma). The purpose of this programme would be to create a pool of talent to serve the energy sector keeping the emphasis on MDGs, sustainable development and energy access. This would have to be a course programme with a well-structured syllabus and evaluation system, offered by a university. 6. Enabling documents: All stakeholders would be the target audience. The documents would focus on issues related to regulatory, policy and institutional mechanisms. In addition, training man- uals would need to be prepared covering all the required topics. These training manuals should cater to the needs of all training programmes. 7. Information dissemination: Information packages consisting of brochures, newsletters, audio and video material, papers and reports need to be developed. These packages may be an effective way of building large-scale capacity to make optimal choices with respect to accessing modern energy services.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0474bc3-4bb0-453e-ab0e-abdf83a8e14f": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0474bc3-4bb0-453e-ab0e-abdf83a8e14f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Costing Tool: User Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "697f223d25a06e8ff81f1d2b8c59906597fce29862fd9f4264309a03bdd7b4c7"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae1bd76e-1904-40e1-a2ab-00fe74040371", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a51083645f34fd32886e3be57937dea2b24165b98e5938eaf15c63c6af378ed7"}}, "hash": "f347efe2170fdcdb12a090e5abf86389c0b3c32076d308dec684892d54a8bdc9", "text": "The target audience would be the general public and stakeholders. 8.

Instructions for using the Energy Costing Tool 51 4.9 Adapting the Tool The Energy Costing Tool is designed to be generally applicable to a broad range of countries and sys- tems, but countries may wish to adapt it further to reflect local circumstances. Here, we discuss three adaptations that countries may wish to make to the model: dropping interventions, changing inter- ventions and adding interventions. The interventions could be in the form of types of energy supply technologies, energy end-use services or subsectors of focus. 4.9.1 Dropping interventions In some cases, countries may decide not to use one or more of the interventions built into the model. For example, a country may decide that some of the demand-side interventions are not needed. There are many ways to reflect this in the model, but the easiest is to zero out coverage and costs. To do this, users enter \u20180\u2019 for all coverage targets associated with the intervention. This will eliminate the interven- tion from resource estimates. 4.9.2 Changing interventions To change to a different kind of intervention, users should go to the \u2018Design parameters\u2019 worksheet and change the name of the intervention. If the calculation steps for the intervention remain the same as the one it is replacing, then changing the names of the cells in the \u2018Design parameters\u2019 worksheet should be sufficient.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f4fe416-eee5-4060-b0ad-f8b0fc73765c": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f4fe416-eee5-4060-b0ad-f8b0fc73765c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Costing Tool: User Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc0257531684f2c4a162ad124b05a3011a360c41ee28f7ca66d63fd1c015bc1c"}, "2": {"node_id": "06d7f2c7-0fb0-450e-89d2-1a20f4466d91", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95ceb708ea20b69bd50041f1e14418ace1b04ff8922dee6fbd6b6eaa0ad4c494"}}, "hash": "159732495ea51ec756c76bcd71615143794f4177d7c4d8433cb52133793db141", "text": "Otherwise, the user will need to ensure that appropriate fields (or cells) and for- mulas are entered for the new intervention. 4.9.3 Adding interventions Additions in terms of new energy supply technology, end-use or subsector are possible in the Tool and advanced users should find it relatively easy to add columns or rows and link them throughout to the relevant worksheets.

In the next step, appropriate additions depend on the interventions in the \u2018MDG needs\u2019 worksheet. Next, the new interventions have to be replicated in the scenario worksheets. Finally, the summary page should be updated to include these changes. 4.10 Checking results and trouble-shooting Once results have been derived from the Energy Costing Tool, how can the user tell whether the results are realistic? One way is to check the totals obtained by using the Tool against results for other countries by com- paring the per capita costs. The UN Millennium Project\u2019s \u2018Preparing National Strategies to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals: A Handbook\u2019 provides some illustrative per capita figures (in dollars) for investment needs, including for energy, which can be used for comparisons. 52 Energy costing tool user\u2019s guide Other ways to check results include examining the path of per capita expenditures over a 10-year peri- od and running internal checks on cost drivers: Path of per capita expenditures: One way to check for major errors is to study the 10-year path of per capita expenditures. If there are any unusual spikes or troughs, or other patterns, users may need to re- examine scale-up paths and other formulas in calculations. Internal checks on cost drivers: Another way to assess results is to analyze the major drivers of total resource needs. Cross-country comparisons suggest that costs for improved fuels will contribute 40 to 50 percent of total cost estimates. Primarily because of this, cooking systems typically make up 50 to 60 percent of total costs. If there are large variances in one or more of these costs, the user may wish to re-examine some of the unit costs, the outcome/coverage targets, or input quantity ratios and com- pare them to international standards to identify the source of variance. 4.10.1 Trouble-shooting During the course of the costing exercise, users may also encounter a number of modeling issues and problems. Here, we discuss some of the most common problems and identify simple tools that may help resolve them. 1) Unrealistically high or low resource estimates After comparing results with comparable estimates, the user may find that the model has produced unrealistically high or low values. A bit of detective work will be in order, moving from general to spe- cific issues. \u2022\ufffdAre any of the cost drivers significantly higher or lower than cross-country benchmarks? \u2022\ufffdAre there any large spikes or troughs in the pattern of resource needs? (This might indicate a typo- graphical error in a single year\u2019s entry.) \u2022\ufffdAre all of the coverage and input quantity ratio targets accurate? \u2022\ufffdAre the unit costs reasonable? \u2022\ufffdAre recurrent and capital costs calculated correctly? (If the calculations are mixed up, or based incor- rectly on incremental vs. cumulative figures, results may be unrealistically high or low.) \u2022\ufffdAre results highly sensitive to small changes in variables? If so, users should be very careful in inter- preting results. 2) #VALUE If the symbol \u2018#VALUE\u2019 appears in a cell, the problem is most likely that the user has entered an inap- propriate value for the variable (e.g. text in a cell that accepts only numbers). If inappropriate values are entered into cells that are used to calculate values in other cells, all the dependent cells will also display the #VALUE symbol. If confronted with this problem, the user should click on a cell where the #VALUE symbol is displayed and go to the \u2018Tools\u2019 menu, select \u2018Auditing\u2019, and click on \u2018Trace precedents\u2019. By following the arrows backwards to the cell with the original error, the user should be able to iden- tify and correct the problem. 4. Instructions for using the Energy Costing Tool 53 3) #REF If the symbol \u2018#REF\u2019 appears, a link has been broken, most likely by deleting a precedent cell. If the #REF symbol has just appeared, go to the \u2018Edit\u2019 menu and select \u2018Undo\u2019, which may bring back the deleted cell and solve the problem. If this does not help, select a cell where the #REF symbol appears and try to assess what cell might have been deleted or moved. Many #REF problems can be avoided by following two simple rules.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ecea1f8d-887f-41d8-8ba2-8a0bb51dea90": {"__data__": {"id_": "ecea1f8d-887f-41d8-8ba2-8a0bb51dea90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Costing Tool: User Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5e485aebdc0469ac011a90fd3184a2b320fac072b694efdefc187665bf59294e"}, "2": {"node_id": "730c6ee9-910b-49a0-a399-ad1a9e0be455", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-costing-tool-user-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f175d5d2d84ee157e821efe8b879aca2f4c897cbd839f4bb8fa13dc305abee43"}}, "hash": "aef80dd6cf803485103e232c819500388d1386dbb513f5c9cbe451aeaf711788", "text": "Many #REF problems can be avoided by following two simple rules.

More often than not, the #DIV/0! symbol appears when an entry has been accidentally deleted and used as the denominator in a quotient formula, yielding this readily resolva- ble problem. 4.11 Conclusion and next steps This Guide has been prepared to introduce and facilitate use of the Energy Costing Tool as part of a strategic planning and budgeting process that will bring countries closer to achieving the MDGs. Those Goals were adopted in 2000, with a target date of 2015, so there is an urgent need for action. By making the proper types of long-term investments now, governments and institutions can make it possible to meet the Goals, and bring much-needed relief to the many people around the world cur- rently suffering from hunger, lack of education and health care, and social inequities. At the 2005 World Summit, world leaders reiterated their support for the MDGs by committing to the development and implementation of MDG-based national development strategies, and acknowl- edged that energy is a fundamental element of such actions. This acknowledgement was founded on the understanding that without increased access to modern energy services for the poor, the MDGs are unlikely to be met. Realistic costing information can provide a bridge that will move policy and planning wish lists past the financial constraints that stand in the way of coordinated development initiatives \u2013 by providing a framework for combined pro-poor investments from a variety of sources, including businesses, com- munities, civil society groups and international donors, as well as national governments. The Energy Costing Tool is in the in process of being tested, and is presented as a useful tool for inte- grating energy investments into medium- and long-term fiscal planning. It is hoped that the Tool will prove to be an effective vehicle for helping governments and planners move towards the incorpora- tion of MDG-based budgeting. As it is more widely applied, we expect that additional adaptations and improvements will be developed, and the Tool will be modified and updated in response to further testing and feedback from users. 54 Energy costing tool user\u2019s guide References 1.

Annexes 55 Annexes ThESE ANNExES IllUSTRATE the calculation steps that are included in the Energy Costing Tool. Since the calculation steps and the formulas used are repeated for different types of technologies, end-uses and subsectors, it was felt that it would suffice to give explanations for the step-by-step procedure adopted for one each of these three types. Secondly, these descriptions have been limit- ed to only the relatively complicated calculation procedures because most of the other calculations involve either addition or multiplication operations and they are self-explanatory.

Acknowledgements vi The initation of the Energy Working Group (EWG) in Asia and the Pacific was based on the concept of bringing together staff from regional UNDP Country Offices, who were interested in energy and sustainable development, to form a working group for sharing experiences and lessons learned among energy practitioners. The EWG was launched during the Energy and Environment Regional Workshop, in November 2002, in Kuala Lumpur. The workshop identified the energy focal-point of UNDP Nepal, Tek B. Gurung, as a \u201cChampion\u201d to lead the EWG process, facilitated by the Sustainable Energy Team based at the Bangkok SURF, UNDP. As a first step, a series of electronic discussions was organized to identify key EWG activities. One of the main activities identified was the preparation of case studies based on UNDP supported energy projects implemented within the region. This publication is a good example of the EWG effort. Currently, the EWG has 44 members, of whom 21, from 14 countries, represent UNDP Country Offices; 23 are UNDP Policy Advisors and Programme Specialists. During the Energy and Environment Practice Workshop held in Bangkok in May 2004, the need to expand the EWG into a fully-fledged \u201ccommunity of energy sub-practice\u201d, including practitioners from UNDP supported energy projects was agreed on. It was also suggested that UNDP project professionals/practitioners/policy advisors dealing with UNDP\u2019s core development practices (such as environment, poverty and democratic governance) need to be encouraged to join the team for cross-fertilization of cross-practice initiatives and innovations. Based on the recommendations, requests for lists of selected energy practitioners engaged in UNDP supported projects were made to UNDP Country Office energy focal points. With these additions, the EWG \u2013 expanded into Community of Energy Sub-practice in Asia and the Pacific (CEPAP), \u2013 now has a total membership of 104. CEPAP is envisaged to: \u2022 function as a vibrant community of practice around energy and cross-practice linkages, which contributes to enhancing the effectiveness of UNDP programming in the energy and non-energy sectors; \u2022 heighten awareness of the linkages between energy and other (sub) practices, including contribution of energy to advance development objectives (including achievement of the Millenium Development Goals); and, \u2022 make a contribution from Asia and the Pacific to the evolution of the UNDP as a practice-based organization in the field, including codification of data, information sharing and knowledge management at the global level. For further detail or to express your interest in becoming part of the field-based practice initiative, please contact the facilitator, Sooksiri Chamsuk,at cepap@undp.org Energy Working Group in Asia and The Pacific vii Foreword Poverty reduction remains a profound challenge in Asia and the Pacific Region, and, despite continued economic growth, 800 million people remain in abject poverty. As poverty is seen as a major contributor to increased pressure on the environment and natural resource base, it continues to pose a challenge for formulating sustainable development policies and practices. The availability of energy resources, the demands for energy, and its links to poverty, have thus emerged as a critical challenge in the region. In response to these challenges, UNDP\u2019s second Regional Cooperation Framework (2002-2006) places poverty reduction at the center for achieving sustainable development. The urgency of energy efficiency, and the quest for renewable sources, is underlined by the recent rise in the price of oil.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f3e3eb3-332f-4d6c-b968-940c20e20a3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f3e3eb3-332f-4d6c-b968-940c20e20a3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2e94a9ef0d465eb894c442b188e86aead22ac2f47910b6926607f086905a78d"}, "2": {"node_id": "5970e53a-3e84-4e65-a25f-a69f7cb2f8ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c12c591ad61689428b1d621f403381ec03d71d8327b9f8a7097d2ba3c2089bd7"}}, "hash": "5fb110c749834ce4ed25ef8de866b1465553b9d2298665e75daeefa2bb631fa4", "text": "At over US$ 50 a barrel, energy imports are putting an enormous strain on the balance of payments and development possibilities of many poor countries.

During 1996- 2003, its total energy programme portfolio amounted to US$ 1.96 billion, with over 370 energy projects in 159 countries. The Asia-Pacific Region represents the largest focus in UNDP\u2019s efforts in implementing energy programmes at the country and regional level through its core-funded energy activities and its role as a Global Environmental Facility (GEF) implementing agency. As a follow-up to the 2002 Asia-Pacific Regional Energy and Environment Focal Point meeting in Kuala Lumpur, an Energy Working Group was initiated, with voluntary membership from CO energy focal points, to share experiences and lesson learned. Under the auspices of the Energy Working Group, and facilitation by the sustainable energy team based in Bangkok SURF, the paticipating CO focal points prepared case studies of selected energy projects, as documented in the form of this publication. The aim of this publication is to contribute to the transformation of UNDP as a knowledge-based organization. The results of the exercise offer key lessons for replication and strategic fine-tuning for the development and formulation of energy programmes/projects. The lessons yielded by the case studies have been many, and are invariably influenced by their country contexts, and, institutional backgrounds. Key lessons about participatory approaches, technology choices and policy options are summarized creatively. The role of energy in poverty reduction is a consistent theme through the Report. This publication is the first of its kind and a good example of UNDP\u2019s engagement to codify, synthesize and document lessons and challenges faced during the implementation of UNDP supported energy projects in the Asia and the Pacific Region. I am confident that this publication will strenghten the knowledge base among the energy, environment and development practitioners at all levels, and that the documented case studies will provide valuable insights for our efforts in advancing the achievement of the MDGs.

Energy strategies to support the Millennium Development Goals Access to energy services is indispensable for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)2, foremost of which is halving extreme poverty in the developing world by 2015. Although the MDGs do not explicitly refer to energy, none can be achieved without the availability of adequate and affordable energy (Box 1-1). As noted by the Commission on Sustainable Development at its ninth session in 2001: \u201cTo implement the goal accepted by the international community to halve the proportion of people living on less than US$1 per day by 2015, access to affordable energy services is a prerequisite\u201d. The global community echoed this view at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in 2002 and agreed upon the need for policies and initiatives to accelerate the provision of modern energy services, particularly in rural areas where poverty is most concentrated. To help reduce human and income poverty, energy strategies that support the MDGs need to focus on the issues of energy, poverty and social equity (in particular, gender equity) and how they interact. This nexus includes environmental sustainability. For instance, a focus on productive uses of energy services can help to increase incomes and create wealth to reduce the number of people living below the poverty line. In the process, it can also ensure 1 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Energy for sustainable development: Challenges for Asia and the Pacific and lessons from UNDP projects in the region K.V.

The Asia-Pacific region has featured prominently in UNDP\u2019s energy efforts, in terms of both resources committed and number of projects implemented. Case studies of seven UNDP projects on energy for sustainable development in the Asia-Pacific region offer valuable lessons for the future. The most important are: (a) participation is the key to successful delivery of modern energy services in rural areas; (b) technology options must remain open and be development-needs driven; and (c) policies to promote energy services for productive applications can maximize development effectiveness. The case studies also suggest that country diversities will offer different entry points for energy in the context of poverty reduction and, therefore, a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach should be avoided. 1 Senior Energy Consultant, UNDP. 2 Adopted by the UN Millennium Summit, September 2000. energy security at the local level by enhancing the poor\u2019s economic self-reliance. Implementing such energy strategies requires a major shift in policy and it is a critical challenge for developing countries. Globally, two billion people have no access to electricity and the same number of people rely on traditional biomass for cooking, agro-processing and heating. This means that four out of five people depend primarily on biomass fuels and exist without electricity; they live in rural areas of the developing world, mainly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. That these people also happen to be poor is more than just a coincidence. The lack of access to modern fuels and electricity symbolizes poverty and it is a barrier to improving key indicators of human development including, in particular, income. Energy deprivation critically hampers people\u2019s prospects of escape from the poverty trap, whereas its availability induces a range of benefits capable of triggering wider social and economic changes in their lives. The role of energy in poverty reduction revolves around the issues of access, affordability and choice. Centrally produced electricity and modern fuels do not reach many of the poor who live in rural areas due to the remoteness of their locations and the high costs of delivery. Even in rural (and peri-urban) locations where communities as a whole have access to energy services, the poor among them may lack purchasing power in the absence of financial alternatives, such as micro-financing and consumer credit. Given this situation, poor households have to forego the benefits of energy services, which could have been employed for income-generating activities. Many people, in effect, suffer from a vicious circle of energy poverty whereby the inability to buy energy services results in low productivity, low quality of outputs and an inability to release labour for economic activity which, in turn, lead to low returns on investment and labour inputs, again limiting the capacity for energy investments. Within this context, women are affected more adversely than men. They, together with their children, collect much of the traditional fuel that poor households rely upon in the absence of modern energy, and they spend long hours each day on cooking and household chores; this reflects human drudgery, perpetuated by the lack of modern energy alternatives. The impacts of energy deprivation on women range from serious health effects due to indoor pollution from the use of biomass fuels to lost opportunities for self-improvement and family well-being through the betterment of social and economic status. Ensuring a wider choice of modern energy services is, therefore, critical to meet the needs of the poor. This implies providing them with access to a wider range of options in technologies, service providers and service delivery mechanisms. At the same time, distinguishing between the poor\u2019s energy needs in general and those of poor women in particular can help resolve gender inequity and poverty at large. People-centred and pro-poor approaches are needed if the MDGs are to be achieved in little over a decade from now. 2 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region Box 1-1: Energy and the Millennium Development Goals To halve extreme poverty: Access to energy services facilitates economic empowerment \u2013 micro-enterprises, livelihood activities beyond daylight hours, which will create employment.

UNDP,2002 2. UNDP\u2019s approach to energy for sustainable development UNDP\u2019s current approach to sustainable energy originates in its 1996 Initiative for Sustainable Energy (UNISE), in which sustainable energy was defined as energy produced and used in ways that support long-term sustainable human development. UNDP has a well-defined presence in sustainable energy issues through its core-funded energy activities and its role as a Global Environmental Facility (GEF) implementing agency at national, regional and global levels. UNDP has by far the largest energy portfolio among all UN agencies and its energy portfolio is growing rapidly. From 1996 to 2003, its total energy programme portfolio amounted to US$1.96 billion, with the implementation of over 370 energy projects in 159 countries via the mobilization of local, national and global partners. The World Energy Assessment (WEA)3, established by UNDP, UNDESA and WEC in 2000, conceptually underpins UNDP\u2019s efforts in energy. In 2001, UNDP launched the Thematic Trust Fund on Energy for Sustainable Development in order to further UNDP\u2019s efforts on energy to meet MDGs. In recent years, UNDP\u2019s efforts in energy for sustainable develop- ment have supported the MDG to halve the proportion of people living in poverty by 2015. This has received further impetus from a series of global events, which included the ninth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD-9) in 2001, the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in September 2002 and UNDP\u2019s Plan of Implementation containing specific recommendations on energy access to facilitate the achievement of MDGs and to establish a clear link between energy and poverty eradication. UNDP\u2019s initiatives to promote energy for sustainable human development are centred on the quality of energy service rather than the source of energy supply. This is evident in the most recent version of UNDP\u2019s Multi Year Funding Framework (MYFF) for 2004 to 2007, which clearly identifies access to energy services as a service line to meet the goal of managing energy and the environment for sustainable development. UNDP corporate energy priorities are set around four thematic areas: \u2022 Strengthening national policy frameworks to support energy for poverty reduction and sustainable development; \u2022 Promoting rural energy services to support growth and equity; \u2022 Promoting clean energy technologies for sustainable development; and \u2022 Increasing access to investment financing for sustainable energy. A fifth and cross-cutting area concerns analysis and global advocacy. These elements enable multiple development concerns related to economic growth, environmental protection and social equity to be addressed simultaneously. Energy policy frame- works and their energy service delivery mechanisms are devised to meet the needs of the poor and marginalized groups, especially the rural poor. In the same context, they address environmental concerns, which are crucial to finding compatible solutions. Activities in these areas complement and help UNDP-GEF programmes in the fields of climate change and support to sustainable livelihoods. In addition, UNDP is engaged in a number of global partnerships in sustainable energy, many of which were launched at the WSSD and which will also benefit countries of the Asia-Pacific region. These include UNDP\u2019s Global Village Energy Partnership (GVEP)4, the World Bank and other partners. This initiative is aimed at ensuring access to modern energy services by the poor via support to action plans for energy in development frameworks; capacity development to expand the number and capabilities of rural enterprises; exchange of information and approaches related to improved delivery of energy services; and monitoring of progress on the impact of energy services on sustainable development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da9b67f0-6e80-400c-979c-ed8b4669a455": {"__data__": {"id_": "da9b67f0-6e80-400c-979c-ed8b4669a455", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "772bec6355dc6fce577d8a6ca9bf248d41573b2fe44f05158ae536982d865dec"}, "2": {"node_id": "a0456848-3299-4fa9-be5d-ad66f5ac9def", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ed29a116dd0f452d4762f0ee3c6fd5de809092e064e6936092263f40130b918"}}, "hash": "d311a31e1cbc4a3fbf5a978452fe536b8787bd203f3823d62f4b9ea75b8de500", "text": "UNDP\u2019s LPG Challenge5 and the World LP Gas Association (WLPGA) address barriers to meeting 3 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Energy for sustainable development: Challenges for Asia and the Pacific and lessons from UNDP projects in the region UNDP\u2019s initiatives to promote energy for sustainable human development are centred on the quality of energy service... 3 Provides the best analytical thinking on the social, economic, environmental and security issues linked to energy, and the compatibility of different energy options; it is discussed at length in the World Energy Assessment (WEA): energy and the challenge of sustainability, published in 2000 by UNDP, UNDESA and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "daa1ee35-b66c-44d1-b89d-af23fee67f3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "daa1ee35-b66c-44d1-b89d-af23fee67f3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f6f12d54bd094d045e081c6ac02277a22b6f58cbca1f80ff4656c24b7406886"}, "3": {"node_id": "93332b95-3c55-4e2a-ad95-6825712027cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "530bce088ed93bd2dba50447c50ee057d6882f3840fa203309a45acff4c1c7b3"}}, "hash": "9566257eb4cb7f10cbdc1261543471ab4453f50c30cb16883f44fbeb4e2f0b94", "text": "the World Energy Council (WEC).

Issues and challenges for the Asia\u2013Pacific region In 2000, 1.1 billion people were estimated to have incomes below one dollar a day and nearly two- thirds lived in the Asia-Pacific region: 432 million (39.2 percent) in South Asia and 261 million (23.4 percent) in East Asia and the Pacific. The vast majority inhabited, and continues to inhabit, rural areas with no or minimum access to electricity and can only afford a modicum of modern fuels like kerosene for essential lighting. Their livelihoods revolve around agriculture, often on small plots of low quality land that are subject to the vagaries of weather, and with few income-earning opportunities other than those related to farming. As agricultural activities are largely dependent on human and animal labour, energy is chiefly used in rural areas for heating applications, mostly cooking (more than 85 percent of total energy consumption) based on biomass fuels. As many as 72 percent of the global population who depend on biomass fuels live in Asia. Empirical data show that the higher the level of biomass consumption, the higher the incidence of poverty (Table 1-1) and the lower the values of key human development indicators, such as life expectancy and infant mortality. Poverty in the Asia-Pacific region is also closely associated with low levels of access to electricity. Nearly one-third of the population, more than a billion, in the region\u2019s developing countries had no access to electricity in 2000, with the average electrification rate in South Asia (41 percent) being less than half of the average for East Asia, including China and the Pacific (86 percent) (Table 1-1). On a country basis, approximately 15 percent of the populations of Nepal and Cambodia had access to electricity. Again, global evidence indicates that lack of electricity coincides with poverty conditions. 4 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region Countries/region Population below income poverty line (%) Traditional fuel consumption 2001 (as % of total energy use) Electrification rate (%) Nepal 37.7 88.0 15.4 Bangladesh 36.0 63.6 20.4 India 34.7 24.3 43.0 Viet Nam 17.7 32.5 75.8 China 16.6 7.8 98.6 Philippines 14.6 33.4 87.4 Pakistan 13.4 26.6 52.9 Indonesia 7.5 24.8 53.4 Sri Lanka 6.6 34.8 62.0 Malaysia 2.0 2.3 96.9 Thailand 2.0 15.9 82.1 Cambodia 34.1 95.1 15.8 East Asia and the Pacific 7 23.7 10.9 86.2 South Asia 39.2 23.4 40.8 Table 1-1: Poor people\u2019s reliance on traditional fuels and lack of access to electricity Sources: UNDP, 2004; OECD/IEA, 2002 6 www.gnesd.org 7 This also includes China. Data on traditional fuel consumption (as percentage of total energy requirements), electricity consump- tion, and carbon dioxide emissions per capita reveal sub-regional variations within the Asia-Pacific area as well as similarities with other regions (Table 1-2). While there is still a big gulf between the Asia-Pacific region and the OECD8 on these three parameters, the East Asia region is closer to the OECD figures than South Asia. Regionally, tradi- tional fuel consumption varies from 10.9 percent of total energy requirements for East Asia and the Pacific but is more than twice as high in South Asia. Electricity consumption and CO2 emissions per capita are twice as high in East Asia and the Pacific as compared to the South Asia region. On these two parameters, South Asia shows stronger similarities with Sub-Saharan Africa, with both regions exhibiting closely comparable figures. High dependence on biomass fuels and low electricity and overall energy consumption charac- terize poverty in developing Asia-Pacific countries.

Lessons from UNDP country projects in the Asia\u2013Pacific region The Asia-Pacific region represents the largest focus in UNDP\u2019s efforts in energy (including TRAC10 resources), accounting for approximately one-third of programming endeavours in the 1990s. Also, UNDP is in the process of implementing a three-year Regional Energy Programme for Poverty Reduction (Box 1-2) at the request of regional governments based on the lessons drawn from energy projects supported by UNDP, bilateral donors and multilateral institutions in partnership with various stakeholders at the local and regional levels. From the scores of UNDP-supported \u201cenergy for sustainable development\u201d projects that are being implemented or are ongoing in the region, seven case studies have been compiled to examine their conceptualization, design, delivery and out- comes (Annex 1-111). The impacts of these diverse projects vary according to their country setting, aims and adopted implementation approaches/ mechanisms. However, they have been largely positive in improving access to modern energy services promoting efficient use of energy and increasing access to financing. The results of the exercise offer valuable insights into key lessons for replication and strategic fine- tuning for the development and formulation of 5 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Energy for sustainable development: Challenges for Asia and the Pacific and lessons from UNDP projects in the region 8 The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 9 WEC, 2000. 10 Target for Resources Assignment from the Core 11 Refer to the case studies for more detailed information.

The lessons yielded by the case studies have been prolific and they are invariably influenced by their country contexts, institutional backgrounds and resonance or otherwise with prevailing national policy climates. The following lessons stand out in importance: Participation is the key to successful delivery of modern energy services in rural areas There is a need to adopt a participatory \u201cpeople- centred\u201d approach to programme/project iden- tification, design, implementation and delivery mechnisms in energy programmes/projects. This is necessary to ensure the empowerment of local communities, with a particular focus on the poor, and can be achieved by engaging relevant stakeholders across all key stages of decision- making. The issue of empowerment is as much an issue of project implementation as it is a matter of broader national policies on governance and participation. It is also important to recognize that the introduction of modern energy techno- logies into a rural setting is an intrusion into a community\u2019s way of life. Therefore, helping rural communities, in particular women, to cope with the change \u2013 in terms of social, economic and environmental impacts \u2013 is critical to ensure the success of energy delivery in rural areas. Nepal\u2019s Rural Energy Development Programme (REDP) is a good example of how the extensive participation of local communities can lead to the smooth introduction of modern energy technologies. Women and women\u2019s groups are capable of a high degree of commitment and endurance to ensure project sustainability, as witnessed in Nepal. Therefore, energy policies and strategies should view women as preferred rather than concomitant participants for taking the lead in community energy initiatives that lead to their social and economic empowerment. Technology options must remain open and be development-needs driven There is a need to increase awareness of various technological options for the provision of energy services and their potential to enhance household incomes; it is also necessary to address communities\u2019 perceived needs for sustainable livelihoods. The process must begin with identification of the needs of poor and rural communities in general and matching of these needs with required energy services. This should be followed by identification, by the communities themselves, of suitable energy technology options based on their social, economic and environmental backgrounds. Such an approach is distinct from one that merely \u201cidentifies\u201d a set of needs that best fits a particular energy technology of a particular scale. Since the approach essentially revolves around the end- users, it is necessary to \u201cempower\u201d local institutions and community groups, which are unfamiliar with the range of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2074dad2-9ed2-4de5-9e7e-a65952036cbf": {"__data__": {"id_": "2074dad2-9ed2-4de5-9e7e-a65952036cbf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2d372b38c3fa9f11d4e7f52ef2d6467e9a410c2139b67590bf4fab7ca505671"}}, "hash": "b2d372b38c3fa9f11d4e7f52ef2d6467e9a410c2139b67590bf4fab7ca505671", "text": "energy choices available, with the necessary knowledge and information. The Biomass Energy Project in India has proved successful in empowering local communities by engaging them to plan, implement and operate energy systems by themselves. In addition, it focused on sustainable livelihood issues of the community, which influenced the sustainability of the project as a whole. Policies to promote energy services for productive applications can maximize development effectiveness The central theme of poverty reduction through energy interventions must be to reduce unemploy- ment and create new livelihood opportunities. Rural people are usually ready to work together and are willing to pay for energy services that cater to their multiple needs. At the same time, rural communities also need safe drinking water, health care facilities, schools, roads, communication and other infrastructure and social services. Rural energy projects should seek simultaneous gains on as many of these fronts as possible. A 6 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region Box 1-2: Regional Energy Programme for Poverty Reduction (REP\u2013PoR) This programme focuses on enhancing equitable access to appropriate, reliable and affordable energy services to reduce human and income poverty and to contribute towards the achievement of MDG targets through broad-based interventions in three thematic areas of priority: (i) improving access to energy services; (ii) promoting efficient use of energy; and (iii) increasing access to financing for sustainable energy. Three strategic services (policy advocacy, capacity development and knowledge management) are pivotal for translating the proposed thematic interventions to ensure that poverty reduction is mainstreamed into the energy development agenda. Partnership among various stakeholders at the national/local and regional levels is identified as a tool to sustain and continue the impact of the proposed interventions. judicious mix of appropriate energy technologies and the blending of energy with other aspects of rural infrastructure and services are essential for sustainable rural development. The success of the REDP in Nepal has brought about positive changes in rural energy policies that ensured upscaling/replication of the project approaches in other parts of the country. Policies to ensure external financing through innovative mechanisms \u2013 such as microcredit, public-private partnerships and rural energy service companies operated by communities \u2013 are necessary, as exemplified by the cases of Bangladesh and Indonesia. The review provides sufficient evidence of the potential economic, social and environmental benefits of decentralized rural energy options, their mutually reinforcing linkages with many other aspects of rural development and their ability \u2013 when combined with enabling government policies and good governance \u2013 to trigger social and economic empowerment. 5. Conclusions The role of energy in poverty reduction has become more critical than ever for developing countries. This is especially the case in Asia-Pacific countries that are handicapped by the largest concentration of global poverty, and is associated with large gender differences. The experiences from UNDP energy projects in the region, and from others elsewhere across the developing world, show that while sustainable human development is a shared goal among Asia-Pacific countries, the energy paths to it are neither uniform, nor necessarily prompted by the same reasons. Asia-Pacific countries like Bangladesh, India and Indonesia have a substantial rural population base, high levels of poverty and large proportions of their people still exist without access to electricity or modern fuels. While they all have policies supportive of rural electrification, their people are equally in need of solutions to overcome biomass fuel scarcity and inefficient end-use technologies. The relatively low income levels of the poor prompt them to pay greater attention to productive uses of modern energy services as a means to reduce poverty and gender differences. In other countries like Bhutan and Nepal, there are powerful arguments in favour of decentralized energy options, particularly for electricity. Given their rugged mountainous terrains, the feasibility of extending grid supplies to remote rural communities is unlikely to improve in the foreseeable future. Remoteness, thus, plays a far more compelling role in these countries than in others. At the same time, in spite of their relatively abundant forest resources, both countries suffer from localized fuelwood scarcities, so fuel issues remain equally important for them. The Philippines, in contrast, has a high rate of rural electrification, with 80 percent of its villages and townships having adequate access. Its motivation for decentralized electrification lies more in its desire to reduce fossil fuel imports (which form nearly 58 percent of the national primary energy supply) rather than poverty concerns sensu stricto, although the two issues do coincide. Samoa, which has an even higher rural electrification rate of 95 percent, is motivated by equity and social justice considerations to ensure energy to the population that remains without", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b6dd00c-b152-418b-b9f6-e252f9a6b97a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b6dd00c-b152-418b-b9f6-e252f9a6b97a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2683ab707f420a860d4db6cdd14702af25a1c027a8441ecb085b1798786722cb"}, "3": {"node_id": "dc9268d3-4810-4dda-9ba3-acf95dd5901b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e701498239adb557d52d842102ff96909d8ca3d7cf4b7060a20f9110c24129ac"}}, "hash": "c8b518313ff7aad2ed251cd81e8e084ec38d8e339233119df89f02d2d0a8fade", "text": "access on small outlying islands for which the cost of grid connection is prohibitive. These differences in country situations and priorities indicate that while sustainable energy is a common goal for the region at large, the entry points to it will vary from one country to another. While the lessons gained so far offer valuable guidelines for the future, it is necessary to avoid a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to devising energy strategies. This has special relevance to the ongoing drive towards marketization/privatization of the rural energy service provision process. If rural poverty reduction is the overarching development goal, then energy equipment manufacturers and service providers need to be far more flexible than they are in urban markets. Their marketing strategies should recognize the unique conditions of rural communities in general \u2013 and those of the poor and women in particular \u2013 and be willing to test new ideas to gain policy support where it is most readily available. Policy-makers, in turn, should provide those enabling conditions that can effectively introduce the benefits of efficient new technologies in competitive rural markets for energy while ensuring sufficient safeguards to protect the interests of the poor, women and marginalized groups. 7 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Energy for sustainable development: Challenges for Asia and the Pacific and lessons from UNDP projects in the region Differences in country situations and priorities indicate that while sustainable energy is a common goal for the region at large,the entry points to it will vary from one country to another. 8 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region Bibliography Asia\u2013Pacific region Bussink, M. & Donaire-Pamintuan, A. 2001.

This has resulted in a substantial reduction in fuelwood consumption in households and community centres, reduced smoke and smoke-related health risks to kitchen users, and promoted wider administrative and public interest in the technology. Biomass energy for rural India project 14 This ongoing project is aimed at demonstrating the technical and financial viability of biomass gasification for power generation, and biogas for cooking, drinking water and lighting using participatory processes and public-private partnerships to devise financial, institutional and marketing strategies for commercial replication. The project has been structured along the WEHAB framework to generate multisectoral and multistakeholder impacts, including improvements to agricultural practices for water conservation; fuelwood resource management; enhanced local institutional capacities, and improved economic capacity of the poor to enable them to afford energy services. Microhydro projects in Indonesia 15 Two microhydro systems were commissioned in 2002 in East and West Java to develop local technical capacity to install and operate micro hydro systems for home lighting, to stimulate income generation and to increase the economic value of local natural resources through electrification based on community cooperatives. Water and forest resource conservation were components of project objectives, which were implemented through local village cooperatives. The projects have been economically viable and one of them has been able to enhance revenues through sale of excess power to the grid under a negotiated power purchase agreement. Financing energy services for small-scale end-users (FINESSE) project in the Philippines 16 This project, which was undertaken from 1998 to 2001, intended to strengthen the capacity of the Development Bank of the Philippines to develop and manage a portfolio of renewable energy projects to be implemented primarily by private sector investors. While it had limited success in creating a pipeline of renewable energy projects, it contributed to capacity-building within a national financing institution with the potential for replication among other public and commercial financing institutions. 10 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region The Rural Energy Development Programme in Nepal 17 This comprehensive multisectoral and multistakeholder initiative has been pursued since 1996 to mobilize communities for implementing \u201cenergy embedded\u201d rural development projects to improve rural livelihoods, enhance environmental conservation, develop local human resource capabilities (including those of women) and strengthen community and local organizations. By 2003, the programme had significantly raised rural incomes, improved health, contributed to children\u2019s education, enabled rural communities to acquire knowledge of the outside world and mobilized community savings and credit for energy and other rural infrastructure facilities, including micro-enterprises for income generation. It had also made substantial progress with institutionalizing rural energy development at the national, district and local community levels through the participation of diverse stakeholders. Sustainable power supply project for Apolima Island in Samoa 18 Although this project is still in its planning stages, it has generated several insights as a consequence of its preparatory studies and participatory consultative processes into balancing multistakeholder priorities against feasible technological options through a holistic cross-sectoral approach. A key finding of the project has been the social, economic and environmental cost-effectiveness of solar photovoltaic systems as a sustainable source of island power supply consistent with the needs of the local community. 17 Gurung, 2004. 18 UNDP, 2004b. 1. Context and background About 55 percent of the energy supply in Bangladesh is based on traditional fuels (crop residues, animal dung and fuelwood); 24 percent on natural gas; 19 percent on imported oil and coal and the remaining two percent on hydroelectricity. Currently about 88 percent of power generation is based on natural gas. Presently, 70 percent of the population does not have access to electricity and it is unlikely that they will have access to electricity in the foreseeable future. Annual per capita energy consumption is approximately 100 kgoe (kilograms oil equivalent), which is among the lowest in the world. Using the rule of thumb that each percentage of GDP growth will require 1.5 percent growth in energy use, the 7\u20139 percent growth that Bangladesh aspires to would pre- suppose 10\u201315 percent annual growth in energy use. This situation calls for adoption of sustainable energy strategies that permeate at all levels of the economy and provide the people with the services that they want. Bangladesh is endowed with a wide variety of renewable energy resources and possesses the potential to cater to the unmet demand for energy for socio-economic development.

Aminul Islam19 19 Sustainable Development Adviser UNDP, Bangladesh. Chapter 2 Abstract Bangladesh has a wide variety of renewable energy resources. While 55 percent of energy supply is based on traditional fuels, currently about 88 percent of power generation is based on natural gas. However, 70 percent of the population does not have access to electricity. Since 65 percent of the population lives in rural areas, sustainable rural energy (SRE) development is vital. The SRE project framework is owned by the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF), with financial assistance from UNDP, while projects are implemented through the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED). To achieve a community-based model of development, there are three categories of activities performed under SRE projects: demonstration of renewable energy technologies (RETs); capacity building and the develop- ment of renewable energy information. At the end of the project\u2019s implemen-tation programme, widespread demonstration and dissemination of the RETs in the off-grid areas are expected. In the longer term, the technologies will also provide support as sustainable commercial activities. The SRE activities promote pro-poor, self-sustaining projects and community empowerment. The government is also taking parallel steps to ensure the replication of RETs, through the offices of the LGED located nationwide. However, since activities carried out under the SRE framework are merely for demonstration purposes, it is difficult to assess the cost effectiveness of the project. Keywords: Sustainable rural energy, renewable energy technologies, solar electrification, community empowerment. energy interacts with all aspects of social and economic development, including livelihoods, water, agriculture, population, health, education, job creation and gender-related issues. The development of rural energy resources provides an opportunity to widen the productive sphere of the rural economy, thus contributing to the national efforts of improving the living standards of the rural poor, as 65 percent of the population lives in rural areas. At present, rural people lack access to energy services even for meeting their cooking needs. The burden of managing household energy is increasing day- by-day, and falls disproportionately on women and girls. Biomass fuel accounts for 76.3 percent of the total fuel consumption in rural industries such as paddy parboiling, smithies and potteries and is the common fuel in rural households. Only ten percent of the rural population is connected to the electric grid network. Moreover electricity is too expensive to be used as a cooking fuel. It is mainly used for lighting, listening to the radio and watching television. Villagers who do not have electricity use kerosene lamps, which provide poor illumination; thus time for study at night is inadequate. This seriously limits educational improvement, besides causing respiratory and eye ailments. Concerns have been raised about the current patterns of energy production and consumption that significantly contribute to environmental degradation at the local, regional and global levels. Since access to modern energy services is viewed as an essential prerequisite for increasing productivity and improving people's livelihoods, UNDP has had significant involvement in developing the energy sector through capacity development, technology access, policy innovation, properly designed market mechanisms, integrated energy and development solutions and new partnerships with energy investors. 2. Genesis of the Sustainable Rural Energy (SRE) project Apart from conventional energy sources, there has been a move towards finding a cleaner and more efficient energy source, especially in the rural sector. The renewable energy sources that are available include solar, wind, biomass and microhydro. The average solar radiation in Bangladesh ranges from 4.0 kWh/m2 in winter to 6.5 kWh/m2 in summer. The average monthly wind speed in the coastal regions ranges from 2 to 5 m/s at 25-metre height. There is considerable potential for RET applications in Bangladesh. For example, there is the potential for four million household-based biogas plants as the country is primarily dependent on the agriculture sector, according to the Institute of Fuel Research and Development (IFRD). A survey carried out by the World Bank has found that there is an existing market potential of 0.5 million households for Solar Home Systems (SHS) on a free-for-service basis in the off-grid areas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bddc3926-aba1-4bd8-9223-b0b5ef74ae7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "bddc3926-aba1-4bd8-9223-b0b5ef74ae7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e1e2884c7a99210ca9da244852e664301689b47a2a50e408e93905a60069717f"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca480d6a-b29a-4a59-990a-a6c2add5fb86", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b6e7a934b34e4c88de78e17333f23f916839c6fe1ddac203d46d643aece4cf1"}}, "hash": "73e5d2be31a629eb9675098df7eff71b1a3d40f91876c736c71c53caa8f2828c", "text": "Currently, the national grid only covers 50 percent of the approximate 100,000 rural markets and rural centres \u2013 the remaining sites are excellent candidates for the centralized solar photovoltaic plants.

The component is being implemented by the LGED. The objective of this component is the development of community-based models for sustainable practices of renewable energy as an alternative source of clean rural energy in off-grid areas.

The O&M for the various projects is case-specific and is carried out by the beneficiary. In most cases however, the community, being the beneficiary, is responsible for the smooth operation of the system. Beneficiary training is also being provided for assisting in the operation of the various systems. Funds for periodic maintenance will be mostly borne from the money contributed by the beneficiaries. For example in the case of the solar home systems for household application, the maintenance expenditure will come from the contributed initial down payment and monthly payments received from each household. 3.1 Solar energy-based technologies The introduction of solar photo- voltaic systems and their increasing use worldwide is a major step towards an ecological and sustainable energy system. It is a more environmentally friendly technology than any other means of generating electricity, making power available anywhere; thus the current prohibitively expensive process of extending electrical grids everywhere is avoided. Their modular nature, low maintenance and availability make this new and emerging power source an attractive alternative for its large-scale usage in rural areas. 3.2 Bio-energy-based technology Apart from the LGED's own initiatives on the construction of biogas plants, two Upazillas20 (subdistricts) have been selected as project areas on a pilot basis under the SRE component. The community-based biogas plants not only provide an alternative source of energy but also improve the health and sanitation of the community. All families are provided with improved sanitary latrines connected with a central digester. The demonstration plant benefits the community in many ways: providing energy for cooking and thereby saving fuelwood, ensuring better health and sanitation for the community and also providing good quality pathogen-free fertilizer for agricultural use. From the community, a beneficiary committee has been formed and this committee is entrusted with the proper O&M of the system. In Faridpur, the poultry project of the Mission constructed a poultry house of about one thousand square feet involving 5,000 birds. An electricity generation unit from poultry waste has also been set up at Faridpur. Currently, installed power generation is 4 kW, but it is hoped that this will increase to 10 kW. The children of the Mission are provided with hands-on training. The eggs and owls supply nutrition to the residents. After completion of the project the system will be handed over to the management committee, who will be responsible for the O&M of the power unit. If successful, this project could be replicated throughout the country and contribute significantly to the energy sector. 3.3 Wind energy technology Wind energy is in the early stage of application. Several locations have already been assessed to evaluate the wind energy potential of the coastal region. The scope of utilization of wind energy resources can become effective in certain cases of exclusive applications during wind water pumping and power generation through wind-diesel hybrid systems at suitable locations. The installation of two water-pumping windmills and one wind-solar hybrid system has already taken place. Under the SRE project, in collaboration with BUET (Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology) and BIT (Bangladesh Institute of Technology), Chittagong has also started a study on wind resource mapping. The study has been designed in a comprehensive manner, aiming at systematic observation on wind regimes at 20 suitable locations including the Chittagong Hill Tracts over a longer period of time. 15 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Sustainable rural energy in Bangladesh: A multistakeholder and multidimensional approach towards mainstreaming renewable energy technologies 20 Upazilla means sub-district.

This network has been designed and developed to facilitate the energy planners, project developers, researchers and all relevant organizations. REIN is designed to work as an information platform for compilation of data in the following four categories: \u2022 Resource Database: The database is a compilation of information on the national resources relevant to RETs. The major categories of the resource database available include not only renewable energy resources but also human resources, and logistical resources; \u2022 Renewable Energy Projects: Assistance provided for the development of renewable energy projects; \u2022 Research and Development: Information about completed and ongoing research and development projects will be put online; \u2022 Information Media: Periodic newsletters on renewable energy are posted online by the SRE summarizing the impact and status of renewable energy project activities in Bangladesh. 3.6 Training for capacity building and technology transfer Required training programmes for capacity building and technology transfer are provided through the project\u2019s activities. The novelty of the technologies demonstrated in this project demands a sound plan for training and capacity building. Activities have been undertaken to ensure user-training, technician-training, training-of-the-trainers as well as institutional capacity building. Systematic maintenance and proper use of the systems on a daily basis ensures minimum repair and maintenance work. The users of the systems are provided with written and illustrated guidelines safe usage. The local technicians are responsible for the day-to-day troubleshooting and other maintenance-related work. For the long-term sustainability of the programme, trainers have been trained to meet future training needs and are prepared to offer training to the users in the community on the operation of the community- based systems. 3.7 Expected end result accord- ing to the project document At the end of the project implementation programme, it is expected that there will be widespread demonstration and dissemination of the RETs in the off-grid areas. The impact of such activities will be the mainstreaming of such technologies as sustainable long-term commercial activities. 4. Implementation of project activities Some of the pioneering efforts carried out by the project are described below: 4.1 Solar electrification in cluster villages The SRE project built on the ongoing government priority programme Asrayan (shelter for the homeless) through solar electrification in cluster villages for the landless poor. The objectives are twofold: first to assess the potential of the technology in improving the quality of life of the landless poor and second to verify whether 16 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region The development of an information network for a renewable energy database and its maintenance is the key activity of REIN. the landless groups can organize themselves to support O&M of the system. The installation has been successfully completed in Nalitabari Upazilla21 in Sherpur District providing solar electricity to 60 houses of the landless poor; this has been operating smoothly for the last one-and-a-half years. It also demonstrates the capacity of the landless poor to maintain the technology, which contributes to improving their quality of life. 4.2 Centralized solar market electrification For the first time in Bangladesh, the SRE project has successfully completed solar market electrification in a rural market at Gangutia under the Shoilkupa Upazilla in Jhenaidah District. The objective of this scheme is to install a demonstration plant of a centralized solar photovoltaic system for electrification of a rural market in the off-grid area and to assess its technical and economic viability in the context of rural Bangladesh. 4.3 Gangutia growth This site has been selected for solar electrification because of its remote location (the nearest grid extension is around seven kilometres away). The system has the capacity to produce 1.8 kW of power with a daily consumption of 2,000 watt-hours, providing lighting to 45 shops, three food-processing small industries, one health centre and one bazaar mosque.

Lessons from implementation of the SRE under the LGED 5.1 Reaching the poorest of the poor The project has been designed to have a pro-poor focus in the off-grid areas, which are often the least developed. It is unlikely that in the foreseeable future the majority of this population will have access to electricity, especially in the far-flung areas. Thus the lack of energy sources has a negative impact on the development of these regions. The project has therefore provided new and inventive methods for the provision of non- traditional energy sources in such areas. 5.2 Ownership to the community In almost all cases, the stakeholders of the project are the members of the community. Community building has been emphasized since the beginning of the project through the participatory approach. The project is designed to eventually hand over the plants to the beneficiaries. The beneficiaries will therefore take greater care in their maintenance and increase the lifespan of the RETs. Community ownership thus promotes community empower- ment; it allows greater integra- tion among the members of the community to achieve a common goal. For example, the solar electrification of the bazaar in Jhenaidah provided a means for building community spirit.It allowed the beneficiaries to gain the benefits of the electrification collectively. 5.3 Sustainability of the operation All initiatives are designed in a manner that allows UNDP to exit without hampering their effective operation. The activities are designed to be self-sustaining; the community, which is often the stakeholder, is able to continue with the operation of the plants after the project ends. 17 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Sustainable rural energy in Bangladesh: A multistakeholder and multidimensional approach towards mainstreaming renewable energy technologies 21 An average upazilla population is approximately 200,000. 22 US$1.00 = Taka (Tk.) 58 (approx). 23 1 lakh = 100,000. The installation of solar electricity system in the village also demonstrates the capacity of the landless poor to maintain the technology, which contributes to improving their quality of life. Since technical training is provided to members of the community, smooth operation of the systems is thereby ensured. A system has been set up for regularly collecting funds contributed by the beneficiaries. The necessary funds for the O&M of the systems are therefore borne by this contributed money and do not pose an extra burden. 5.4 Economic empowerment as a result Economic empowerment is being gained by the poorest of the poor due to the activities of this project. For example, the demonstration of a microhydro unit in Chittagong will improve the quality of life and provide income-generating activities. Women are also being empowered as the light is providing them with the opportunity to earn a livelihood. Earlier, the extent of their activities was determined by the presence of sunlight; with sunset, their day was more or less over. But now they can continue with their daily activities, as well as pursue income-generating activities in the evenings and at night. Also centralized solar electrification of the market at Jhenaidah has led to an increase in the daily market activities and boosted rural economic activities. 5.5 Social change brought about in the communities A social change is being brought about due to the availability of an alternative energy source. People are gaining greater knowledge about the subject and are also showing interest in the renewable energy sources. There is a mushrooming of the RETs in the areas surrounding the demonstration sites, indicating the demand for such technologies. Replication by the NGOs can lead to greater dissemination of the ideas. The government-run evening adult education classes have benefited greatly from the project due to the extension of active hours as a result of electrification. There is improvement in the healthcare provided in rural areas through the presence of an alternative energy source. Solar-powered refrigerators can preserve vaccines, blood etc, while solar-powered lights can be used in operating theatres. 5.6 Provision of a cleaner energy source Usage of a cleaner technology is reducing the pressure on the environment. Especially in the rural households, the pressure on the biomass was high due to traditional energy sources such as the burning of wood for fuel. The provision of an alternative energy source therefore benefits the environment by reducing the need for burning wood to provide energy. A decrease in the use of diesel for electrification in the project areas also has a positive impact on the environment. 5.7 Removal of the information barriers through the establishment of REIN The information barriers that were present arlier due to the lack of availability and access to information sources have been diminished considerably", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f327e78-5046-4bca-8641-38ec4326128d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f327e78-5046-4bca-8641-38ec4326128d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6243ff07d693b1dcb6feefb2c4b24a3a7ff6fcd9943a7f0b3bebcbcd4dd0d481"}}, "hash": "6243ff07d693b1dcb6feefb2c4b24a3a7ff6fcd9943a7f0b3bebcbcd4dd0d481", "text": "because of the establishment of REIN. The publication of a newsletter/brochure on RETs provides greater information sharing on this subject both among the producers as well as the consumers of these technologies. Through REIN\u2019s multistakeholder approach, the interaction of the providers as well as the consumers of the RETs has been facilitated. Up-to-date informa- tion is being provided not only about the inputs but also about the organizations that are involved in the renewable energy practices. There is now greater awareness regarding the costs and benefits of the range of technologies available for providing renewable energy- based modern energy services. 5.8 Training on non-renewable technologies allows more effective maintenance Technical barriers for the implementation of sustainable rural energy practices have been broken down. Personnel who design, install, operate, manage and maintain renewable energy-based services are available owing to the training provided under the SRE project. While the training has been provided to a limited number, in the current country context this is still a major step leading to greater national capacity development. 5.9 Drawbacks to the project Since the activities carried out under this component were merely for demonstration purposes, it is very hard to assess the cost effectiveness of the project. 18 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region There is improvement in the healthcare provided in rural areas through the presence of an alternative energy source. The activities were also conceptualized under ideal conditions therefore more demonstrations need to be carried out in order to find out the institutional constraints of the activities. Although the demonstrations have taken place in off-grid areas, their applicability in grid areas also needs to be noted. 5.10 Replication initiatives Interest in sustainable renewable energy practices is high as can be seen by their replication in the areas surrounding the demonstration sites. There is considerable scope for the government to tap into this alternative energy source. NGOs specializing in renewable energy, which are already involved in this sector, could be instrumental in the replication process and thereby aid the development of the energy sector. Due to the overwhelming dependence on biomass-based energy consumption in rural areas and the depletion of bio- diversity, the situation is becom- ing critical. The only alternative to prevent catastrophe is to opt for renewable energy. As a result of the activities of this component, which focuses on decentralized community- based renewable energy in multipurpose applications, the government is also taking parallel steps to ensure the replication of RETs. Through the numerous offices of the LGED located throughout the country, there is greater opportunity for the RET applications to be duplicated. 5.11 Existing barriers to the widespread adoption of the RETs Policy barriers: There is a lack of financial incentive policies to encourage renewable energy develop- ment. Legal, regulatory and policy framework mechanisms for the market-oriented energy programmes are missing. Institutional barriers: Most of the renewable energy programmes are primarily technology driven and the focus is on R&D rather than promotion and encouragement of commercial and private sector involvement in RETs. The lack of coordination between the different ministries, agencies and institutions that deal with the RET sector makes the widespread dissemination of RETs problematic. Market barriers: The high initial cost at the user level is a considerable market barrier to the increased use of renewable energy sources. Financial barriers: No dedicated financing is presently available in financial institutions for renewable energy activities. The financial institutions also lack the capacity to appraise renewable energy proposals and loan requests and judge their viability. 5.12 Future scenario \u2013 case study follow up As part of the exit strategy of this component, emphasis has been put on noting the successes of the various demonstration projects and aiming future endeavours at mainstreaming these activities. It has been suggested that the Solar Home Systems that have proved to be so successful should be mainstreamed in the future. Similar mainstreaming programmes are also being envisaged for Biomass Gasifiers, Solar Thermal Systems and SPV pumping systems. Detailed programming for such main- streaming is currently being worked out. The programme would include some aspects of financial support to alleviate the initial high cost of installation. As a follow up to the activities of this component, UNDP Bangladesh is in the process of formulating a pro-poor environmentally friendly energy programme aimed at achieving energy efficiency, energy conservation and promotion of RETs. There is a need to focus on poor people\u2019s energy needs, and frame energy in the development process.

Background and context 1.1 The wood energy situation in Bhutan Wedged between two giant nations, China and India, the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan is a small country both in terms of population and size. Some 685,000 people \u2013 growing at a rate of 2.5 percent per annum \u2013 live in the 38,394 km2 country. Seventy-nine percent of the population lives in rural areas subsisting on a farming system, which integrates crop agriculture, livestock rearing and the use of natural resources for a wide range of products and services. Most of the population lives in the mountains and valleys of the central belt and in the foothills along the southern frontier. The population in the northern part is very sparse and scattered. The country has a good environmental track record, major indices being a forest cover of 72.5 percent and a protected area system covering more than 26 percent of the country linked by biological corridors that make up another 9 percent. While the country is known for its well-preserved natural environment and large, contiguous forests, it is also known to have some of the highest per capita domestic fuelwood consumption in the world. A wood energy sectoral analysis published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 23 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Working with rural communities to conserve wood energy: A case study from Bhutan Ugyen P. Norbu and Seeta Giri24 24 Seeta Giri is Head of the Environment Unit, UNDP Bhutan, managing the Energy and Environment portfolio; Ugyen P. Norbu is a consultant with expertise in the Environment sector. Chapter 3 Abstract Bhutan has a population of 685,000, growing at an annual rate of 2.5 percent. Seventy-nine percent of the population lives in rural areas. While the country is known for its well-preserved natural environment, it is also known to have some of the highest per capita domestic fuelwood consumption in the world. According to the 1991 FAO wood energy analysis, it was estimated that a Bhutanese citizen consumed 1.27 tonnes of fuelwood annually. Due to no suitable alternatives and socio- economic constraints, fuelwood is the most important source of energy in rural Bhutan. UNDP\u2019s activities in energy and the environment comprise working with the government at the national level, working with local communities and GEF-funded small grant programmes. This case study covers two small wood energy conservation projects. The first project is Improved Community Cooking Stove: an Alternative to Mitigate Fuelwood Pressure in Trashigang. The second is the Biomass Fuel Efficiency Project in Tsirang. The first project has demonstrated a significant reduction in fuelwood consumption as a result of the installation of shielded, metal stoves. The smokeless stoves also contribute to the cleanliness of the community kitchens, shorter cooking time and less smoke-related health risks to kitchen users. Tsirang, in the second project, is a district severely affected by fuelwood shortage. The district is also one of the most densely populated in the country. The project significantly reduces fuelwood consumption, with a good focus on local capacity building. The key lessons learned from the two projects suggest that interventions that demonstrate tangible benefits within a short term would be more appealing to local people. Energy conservation projects have more impact on local people when the intervention is connected to their daily lives. Keywords: Fuelwood, wood energy conservation, cooking stoves,capacity building,rural communities,poverty,gender. United Nations (FAO) in 1991 estimated that each Bhutanese on average consumed 1.27 tonnes of fuelwood a year25. While the scenario in urban areas has changed since then with the availability of modern cooking and heating appliances (e.g. gas stoves, oil radiator heaters) and growing affluence and changing lifestyles, fuelwood consumption in the rural areas is much the same due to lack of suitable alternatives and socio-economic constraints. Fuelwood is by far the most important source of energy in rural Bhutan and is expected to remain so for many more years \u2013 rather decades \u2013 to come. Currently, fuelwood accounts for 70 percent of the national energy consumption (RGOB 2002). Although rural hydropower electrification is gaining ground and many rural homes are now installing solar power systems, these are likely to be largely limited to lighting purpose whereas rural energy use is most intensive for cooking (and space heating in high altitude areas).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c51fbab-7fee-4a59-adb7-6d9aed935084": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c51fbab-7fee-4a59-adb7-6d9aed935084", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cabf9f8545bc3bb4733757e2c2f637b5f3e5882e34422560138d94c436a2ac70"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3bbc474-75ef-4aaf-8f8f-68eb61f41076", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9852b3f5c9947a69e18fb31f96729760474b6ea6ead79a58dc5f28032bd628f0"}}, "hash": "811ee0709db3eaa702f3b5799220f1cd73c91e074186483c76733864e0df2208", "text": "Besides domestic consumption, fuelwood is also used by industries such as Bhutan Carbide and Chemicals Limited, Bhutan Ferro Alloys, and Bhutan Board Products, and during the blacktopping of the roads.

Fuelwood is in short supply in many areas because of high population density and localized deforestation caused by intensive forest use. The dzongkhags (districts) affected by fuelwood shortages include Trashigang, Pema Gatshel, Trashi Yangtse (southeastern part), Mongar (eastern part), Wangduephodrang (central part), Thimphu (areas around Thimphu township), Paro (southeastern part) and all the southern dzongkhags \u2013 Samtse, Chukha, Daga, Tsirang, Sarpang and Samdrup Jongkhar (FAO 1991). 1.2 United Nations Development Programme in Bhutan The involvement of UNDP Bhutan in the area of energy and environment is threefold. One, it is helping the government at the national level through advocacy, policy advice and support for national conservation strategies. Two, it works with local communities through pilot initiatives that show people how to escape from the poverty cycle while conserving the environment on which they rely. Three, the UNDP-implemented/Global Environmental Facility (GEF)-funded Small Grants Programme (SGP) is boosting local community actions to address global environmental concerns, namely biodiversity loss and climate change. The SGP was launched in Bhutan in October 1998. The SGP supports projects of up to US$50,000 by community-based and non-governmental organizations, focusing on local problems and community actions related to global environmental concerns such as biodiversity loss and climate change. It recognizes the crucial role that households and communities, applying locally appropriate solutions, can play in conserving bio- diversity and reducing the likelihood of adverse climate change and operates on the premise that people will be empowered to protect their environment when they are organized to take action, have a measure of control over access to the natural resource base, have the necessary information and knowledge, and believe that their social and economic well-being is dependent on a sound environment. Since its inception in the country, the SGP has supported 16 projects with grants totalling nearly US$400,000. Of these, four were related to climate change and dealt with wood energy conservation. 2. Introduction to the case study This case study covers two wood energy conservation projects, both supported through the SGP during the programme\u2019s nascent phase. The first project was called Improved Community Cooking Stove: 24 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region 25 The analysis was a part of the Master Plan for Forestry Development in Bhutan Project. This is the only comprehensive wood energy study carried out to date in Bhutan. Fuelwood is by far the most important source of energy in rural Bhutan and is expected to remain so for many more years \u2013 rather decades \u2013 to come. An Alternative to Mitigate Fuelwood Pressure in Trashigang and was located in Trashigang District. The other was Biomass Fuel Efficiency Project and was located in Tsirang District. The map shows the location of the districts. The case study is based on an analysis of the project documents, progress reports, evaluation reports and the SGP Biennial Programme Review (October 1998 to June 2002). It seeks to outline the positive features and limitations of the projects and highlight the lessons learnt with the view that such knowledge management will be useful in planning and implementation of similar projects in the future, both within and outside the country. The principal reasons for selecting the two projects for the case study were: \u2022 The projects were initiated at the beginning of the SGP and, therefore, there is enough experience to reflect upon; \u2022 The commonality in the key objective (i.e.reduction in wood energy consumption) notwithstanding, the two projects applied different strategies. One was implemented by an NGO and focused on religious community institutions while the other was implemented by a local women's group and focused on rural households based specifically on women\u2019s participation. 3.

For this case study it is assumed that the fuelwood consumption figure would not have been affected by the bifurcation of the district given that the bulk of the population live in Trashigang and the socio-economic activities of the two districts are more or less similar. The people of the district\u2019 are Sharchhopa27. They are perhaps the most devout Buddhists among all the Bhutanese. This is evident from the numerous lhakhangs (monasteries) and dratshangs (monastic institutions) that are scattered through- out the district. Apart from the rural households, these institutions constitute the largest consumer of fuelwood. Every year on average, it has been estimated that each institution organizes religious festivals and rites for 50 to 60 days and
