Taking into account the special needs of Small Island Developing states, the regional Governance for Resilient Development (Gov4Res) project works with Pacific Island countries to systematically consider climate and disaster risks in all development decisions.

In preparation and negotiations for COP-26 in Glasgow, UNDP made deliberate efforts to consider human health, the planet\u2019s health, and climate change in an integrated manner. Guidance was offered to countries to raise their ambitions for climate action. Asia and the Pacific is the most disaster-prone region in the world. Nearly 45 per cent of the world\u2019s natural disasters occur in the region, and more than 75 per cent of those affected by natural disasters globally live in the region. Accordingly, disaster preparedness and strengthening resilience to withstand climate shocks is a major part of UNDP\u2019s work. This includes a range of climate adaptation support, like the mainstreaming of resilience goals into economic, agriculture, housing, water management and other national plans. Examples include research on development of climate resilient seeds, climate proofing of roads and transport infrastructure, and installation of climate early warning and data collection networks. Support to programme countries has resulted in the development of disaster vulnerability, preparedness, and response plans, and strengthening of governance capacities at national and local levels through Disaster Management Councils. The sub-regional programme on the \u2018Governance of Resilience\u2019 has provided a key mechanism for support. Considerable work has focused on the management of forests, natural ecosystems, and biodiversity. UNDP\u2019s global Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN) supported 11 countries in the region in 2020 and 2021. BIOFIN helps countries develop their national biodiversity finance plans through national \u2018biodiversity finance assessments\u2019 that review policies, existing expenditures, and finance gaps to identify potential finance solutions. Through REDD+, incentives are being provided to conserve tropical forests and reduce greenhouse gases that are released when forests are cut down. Social forestry initiatives are underway in several countries. In the Pacific, UNDP, GEF and the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) have contributed to improved marine resources management with 15 Small Island Developing States (SIDS).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57704766-222e-43db-b267-ffc567c3c37b": {"__data__": {"id_": "57704766-222e-43db-b267-ffc567c3c37b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Asia Pacific Annual Report 2020-21", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56290e035f6e00eb7d3c744cfea05d5e9b38f2bc7d9e7f0277ff53efaff1bebb"}, "2": {"node_id": "8803b3a7-20be-4d9b-befa-920ee0754a8b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d133625b085ea44fddf35caa38a61080185f654bbe3cf7b8a94d29781e00387f"}}, "hash": "54e8e6d360d61555971c73711e4ed559921a812b24dad72afcd61c57a7d0d4e5", "text": "The fisheries are now recognized as the best-managed tuna fisheries globally.

UNDP programmes focus on increasing energy access, promoting renewable energy, and enhancing energy efficiency to meet the different needs of men and women in rural and urban households and businesses. We also work to de-risk investment in renewable energy markets and to attract and leverage private and public sector resources. The Climate Promise Climate change presents the single biggest threat to sustainable development and is already causing a disproportionate impact on the poorest, marginalized and most vulnerable. UNDP\u2019s Climate Promise has become the world\u2019s largest offer of support to governments to adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change. A key principle in the Paris Agreement is that no country should go back on its intentions, which were put forward in climate action plans known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs. UNDP\u2019s Climate Promise initiative supports 27 countries in Asia and the Pacific to ensure that any country wishing to increase the ambition of their national climate pledges can do so. In Cambodia, for example, UNDP is creating an enabling environment for investments in key climate related sectors with stronger gender targets. By providing coordination and policy support, UNDP contributed to the NDCs to ensure that they now include specific targets on the percentage of women who will participate in each climate action. The more robust and comprehensive NDCs now recognize gender disaggregated data as vital in measuring gender targets for climate actions. In addition, the NDCs now include an ambition of 42 per cent emission reduction by 2030, and a target of halving the deforestation rate by 2030. In Papua New Guinea, UNDP supported the country\u2019s Climate Change and Development Authority with finance and technical expertise in the revision of the country\u2019s enhanced NDCs, aiming among other things to reduce CO2 emission by 60 million tonnes over the next decade. These also present a pathway for Papua New Guinea to deliver on its national policy, and a commitment to achieve 100 per cent power generation from renewable energy sources by 2050 and increase electrification rates to 70 per cent by 2030. The government committed to reduce the annual emissions from deforestation and forest degradation to an equivalent of an annual reduction of 8,300 hectares of deforestation and 43,300 hectares of degradation. The Government of Papua New Guinea has also mainstreamed gender equality considerations and youth engagement into the revision of its NDCs. Building resilience to climate change The shocks brought on by climate change could drive an additional 100 million people into poverty by 2030. UNDP assists governments to scale up the integration of climate change adaptation into policy, planning, and investments at national and local levels. It supported nine countries in the region to advance their National Adaptation Plans which reduce vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. Governance for Resilient Development (Gov4Res) is a UNDP project that works with Pacific Island countries to systematically consider climate and disaster risks in all development decisions. This approach, now being replicated in other countries, targets multiple \u2018entry-points\u2019 that can collectively transform an entire system to address vulnerability to climate change. This agile initiative uses a risk-informed lens in a range of areas including local development efforts, national planning and budgetary processes, and large- scale infrastructure investments. The results have meant more programmatic responses to climate risks for community development projects in Fiji and Solomon Islands, new resilience financing mechanisms in the Ministry of Finance in Tonga, integration of climate change and disaster risk criteria in investment processes in Tuvalu, risk- informed community-led planning in Vanuatu, and the inclusion of climate risks in parliamentary budget scrutiny in Tonga. Through this work, the UNDP Pacific Office is advancing its strategic partnerships with Australia, Sweden, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, and the UK.

They are also assured irrigation water through the creation of a sustainable, reliable, and efficient irrigation system. In addition, farmers can now cultivate diversified crops, securing more food while also earning additional income. More than 410,000 hectares of forest have been brought under a sustainable management regime. With support from GEF and UNDP, the Government of Cambodia has strengthened the national climate observation network to improve the production and use of climate information. At the start of the project, the country had only 12 fully functional hydrological stations that manually captured daily data. Now, 24 automated weather stations and 29 automated hydrological stations capture and transmit data every 15 minutes to a central database that enables early warning and climate analysis. The country could produce only three-day forecasts before the project, but can now make seven-day weather forecasts, which are important for farmers to manage climate and weather risks. UNDP assisted the Government of Tuvalu to establish a state-of-the-art Light Detection and Ranging technology which collects baseline data for accurate and detailed analysis of climate vulnerability. The analysis helps assess the relationship between land elevation and sea- level rise which is critical for adaptation action and planning. The technology is fully integrated into mapping systems of the Department of Land and Survey and other agencies. The information has been used for detailed designs of coastal adaptation, including for reclamation in the main island, a project implemented through a Green Climate Fund coastal adaptation project. The technology will be used to develop detailed coastal vulnerability assessments for all islands for planning and development purposes. Enhanced government capacity will improve coastal hazard monitoring and inform long-term adaptation planning. A technological innovation in Nepal is reducing the risk of future climate-related disasters by examining historical ones. UNDP developed a solution in the country to transform nearly 40,000 records from the last half-century of national disaster incidents into illustrative disaster profiles, accessible in Nepali and English. Based on the inherited rich dataset from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, the profiles can illustrate primary hazards, frequency, impact, and disaster trends for any period or administrative jurisdiction, from national, provincial or district levels. These profiles could be a powerful tool for policymakers to quickly grasp the vulnerability of their jurisdictions to make risk-informed decisions. The capability is now being integrated into the National Disaster Information Management Platform for planning and allocating resources. Photo: UNDP Cambodia. Weather Stations. Photo: UNDP Nepal. Bipad Portal. The governance of disaster preparedness and response UNDP works closely with governments to provide integrated support to strengthen governance capacities at central and local levels to keep pace with the changing nature of disasters and climate change. With assistance from UNDP, the national resilience programme in Bangladesh has helped improve the capacity of public institutions to make risk-informed, gender-responsive disaster and recovery decisions for recurrent and mega disasters. In 2020, the programme developed tools for conducting disaster impact assessments that promote risk-informed public investment. In 2021, persons with disabilities participated in the local Disaster Management Councils, which resulted in measures to reduce their exposure to risk in natural disasters. In 2021, 1,723 members of the Disaster Management Council, volunteers, and 76 journalists received training on the concepts of integrating gender into disaster risk management and resilience. The programme provided training and grants to 2,700 women who are most vulnerable to disasters.

The climate and forest programme focuses on implementation of socially inclusive policies and measures on deforestation and forest degradation, and access to innovative finance. Working more than a decade to qualify for payments under REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries), Indonesia received its first financial rewards in 2020. REDD+ was introduced in 2007 to provide incentives to conserve tropical forests and reduce greenhouse gases that are released when forests are cut down. In August 2020, the Green Climate Fund approved a REDD+ payment of US $103.8 million in recognition of Indonesia\u2019s reported reduced emissions of 20.25 million tonnes of CO2 achieved from reduced deforestation and forest degradation in 2014- 2016. The payments will be used to rehabilitate degraded peatland and mangrove, strengthen community empowerment through social forestry and alleviate poverty through eco-friendly economic activities.

The SAFE Ecosystem project introduced a rice intensification system and the use indigenous nitrogen-fixing trees in rice production fields. This approach contributes to sustainable farming, forest conservation and increased farm incomes. In Niue, through the UNDP-supported Ridge to Reef project, 14 management plans for Special Managed Reef Areas were completed, a [ 72 ] [ 73 ] culmination of work over several years. The plans enshrine the commitment by communities to the conservation of 17,213 hectares of terrestrial areas and up to 1,766 hectares of coastal reef areas. The commitments are aligned with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) category for Protected areas with sustainable use of natural resources. Resource Management and Advisory Committees were established in all 14 villages of Niue. The Committees are comprised of key government agencies and all marine and terrestrial biodiversity related representation of stakeholders, including fisherfolk and traditional landowners. Their aim is to ensure the long-term sustainability of the 14 conservation areas. In 2021, the project supported the development of Marine Spatial Planning for the Niue Moana Mahu Large Scale Marine Protected Area (127,000 km2), which had been formalised in 2020. UNDP\u2019s Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN) helps countries develop their national biodiversity finance plans through national \u2018biodiversity finance assessments\u2019 that review policies, existing expenditures, and finance gaps to identify potential finance solutions. In Bhutan, BIOFIN supported local governments to bring biodiversity considerations into their budgeting process and develop an insurance mechanism to respond to Human Wildlife Conflict cases. In Indonesia, BIOFIN helped secure a US $2.7 million investment for a bird conservation center in the Maluku Islands. In the Philippines, BIOFIN supported the formulation of a US $40 million budget proposal for protected areas that was adopted for the 2020 budget. A new \u2018GCash Forest\u2019 app was launched with a payment platform that combines incentives for sustainable behavior with payments for tree planting, raising over US $500,000 a year. BIOFIN has also assisted in reaching a formal agreement between the Biodiversity Management Bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Public Private Partnership Center. The aim is to collaborate on policy development to increase private sector participation in biodiversity financing, and provide feasible business models for private sector investments in nature-based solutions. Sri Lanka has developed a Biodiversity Finance Plan that includes payment for ecosystems services through mini-hydropower plants that invest part of their profits in conserving their immediate catchment areas. In addition, a sustainable tourism certification mechanism was created with the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority. BIOFIN also supports the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to promote sustainable financing in the country. Photo: UNDP Lao PDR. SAFE Ecosystem Project. Supporting the blue economy In the Pacific, UNDP, GEF and the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) have contributed to improved marine resources management with 15 Small Island Developing States. The fisheries are now recognized as the best-managed tuna fisheries globally. In fact, the four key tuna stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean are now within biologically sustainable levels. This is significant because the tuna industry plays a vital role in economic development and food security for Pacific countries. In Samoa, the Green Climate Fund has supported the Vaisigano Catchment Project, a cash-for-work programme for catchment rehabilitation that also provides job opportunities for community members. A total of 4,480 native trees were planted on seven hectares, and 3,434 invasive trees were removed from more than 55 hectares. As part of enrichment reforestation, a total of 12,416 trees were planted in an area of 8.7 hectares. UNDP, with financing from the GEF has been promoting a sustainable blue economy through the implementation of Integrated Coastal Management since the early 1990s.

UNDP also works to de-risk the investment environment for renewable energy markets and to attract and leverage private and public sector resources. UNDP in Iran has been collaborating with the Global Environment Facility, and the government to improve national energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions through institutional shifts towards energy-efficient solutions. The implementation took place in 541 pilot buildings, including 362 residential buildings and 179 non-residential buildings. Measurement and verification of energy indicated energy savings of 10 per cent in natural gas and 15 per cent in electricity, which is annually equal to 24,889 tonnes of CO2. The government subsequently endorsed an updated energy efficiency building code.

UNDP in China has been promoting hydrogen- based clean energy for nearly two decades, in collaboration with the Ministry of Science and Technology and GEF. What began as small pilots in eight cities has now been scaled across 45 cities, with UNDP support to the commercialization of fuel cell vehicles. By 2020, policies that provide incentives for hydrogen and FCV development were issued in 22 provinces and municipalities. Technical assistance and advocacy for hydrogen- based solutions in the energy sector has enabled four large renewable energy-based hydrogen production projects in the country and gradual use of hydrogen in steel production plants. UNDP organized two hydrogen industry conferences that created a platform for technical communications amongst more than 20 countries. In Cambodia, UNDP provided technical assistance to establish a new energy unit at the Ministry of Economy and Finance that gathers economic information to inform energy policies. With the Ministry of Mines and Energy, UNDP provided seed funding to pilot solar mini-grids in four remote villages, with plans to expand to 210 remote off-grid communities. A total of 225 households, including 30 female-headed households and 10 households with people with disabilities, living in remote areas and in indigenous communities, gained access to electricity. These projects contributed to the country\u2019s rural electrification, which grew from a 6.6 per cent electrification rate in 2000 to 97.3 per cent two decades later. UNDP has worked with the country\u2019s Ministry of Mines and Energy, the Electricity Authority of Cambodia, and the private sector to develop business models that influence investors in the country\u2019s 100 per cent electrification target of affordable and reliable electricity through renewable energy. UNDP also trained government staff to bring climate components into their budget decision for infrastructure. With UNDP support, an additional US $4.4 million of infrastructure investments went through climate change screening, increasing cumulative climate-smart investments by 11.7 per cent since 2019. UNDP recognizes the environmental impact of its own operations and is committed to setting an example. The Regional Bureau for Asia and Pacific invested US $800,000 in 2020 and US $540,000 in 2021 to support 18 Country Offices overall through a competition to \u2018green\u2019 their premises to reduce their own carbon footprint and minimize use of natural resources.

At the city level, UNDP works with a public-private partnership in Danang to mobilize businesses and startups to support the circular economy. Its work with the municipal government is creating the first circular economy road map in Danang. In China, UNDP supported the Foreign Economic Cooperation Office with a GEF project that reduces harmful pollutants during the life cycle of electronic equipment. In addition, the project partnered with Lenovo to develop a laptop with eco-design standards that reduce waste. Additionally, 250 management officers were trained in Extended Producer Responsibility concepts, which give producers responsibility for the treatment or disposal of post-consumer products. Three demonstration recycling systems were established, and more than two million e-waste units were collected, removing 284,890 metric tonnes of hazardous chemicals from the recycling chain. The project also resulted in the development of technical guidelines on eco-designs and standards to produce electronic equipment. A UNDP plastics waste management project contributed to India\u2019s flagship programme, Swachh Bharat (Clean India). The UNDP initiative enhances collaboration between municipal corporations, pollution control boards, and relevant government departments to strengthen waste management and improve socio-economic conditions for waste collectors. By 2021, this effort helped process 83,900 metric tonnes of plastic waste, thereby saving CO2 emissions that are equivalent to planting 9,988 trees. This ambitious partnership with 35 urban local bodies in 35 cities plans to process or recycle 85,000 metric tonnes of plastic waste and reach 100 cities by 2024. In Indonesia, UNDP has supported the Ministry of Industry with initiatives to establish a recycling industry that can facilitate the collection and aggregation of plastic waste that contains harmful chemicals. Through the project, in coordination with the Government of Indonesia\u2019s assigned companies, businesses in local communities received training in plastics collection, segregation and disposal that has prevented more than 1,000 metric tonnes of plastics containing hazardous chemicals from re-entering the recycling chains. In the Province of Central Sulawesi, which was severely impacted by the earthquake and tsunami in 2018, UNDP is currently reconstructing two landfills as part of its reconstruction efforts in the region. In Cambodia, the Country Office supported the preparation of the National Circular Economy Strategy and Action Plan (2021-2035). Launched in 2021, the Circular Economy Strategy adopts a life-cycle approach and sets as a national goal to close the loop of production, distribution, consumption, waste generation, and waste treatment. UNDP and the Alberta CoLab conducted a system design workshop on waste management in the Maldives. Subsequently, technical support and equipment were provided to the Waste Management Corporation to support circular economy waste management in the greater Male\u2019 region. In the Philippines, Viet Nam and Indonesia, similar system design workshops on plastic pollution and circular economy were organized that further some of the circular economy principles on recycling waste.

UNDP in 2020 - 2021 rapidly mounted a multi-faceted effort to assist programme countries in assessing the impact of COVID-19 on their SDG plans and indicators, and devise appropriate responses to protect their populations, preserve SDG gains and mobilize the necessary financial resources to implement development and resilience strategies. Building on the years of engagement with national and local partners on formulation and mainstreaming of SDG plans and indicators, UNDP conducted rapid assessments of the impact of COVID-19 at regional, national, and, in some countries, sub-national levels. Where necessary, we helped programme countries to recalibrate SDG targets and plans.

A tiny virus had a significant negative impact on almost all the SDGs. [ 78 ] [ 79 ] emerging and this is the final decade to achieve the SDGs by 2030, there can be no interruption in national efforts to meet the goals. UNDP advocacy and technical support is assisting countries to build forward better from COVID-19 and get back on track to deliver on the global goals. UNDP scaled up its support for SDG financing initiatives in 2020 - 2021. Nearly every country in the Asia-Pacific region is committed to ambitious SDG programmes but lack the necessary financing. Few countries have coherent strategies to mobilize public and private capital flows in support of their development strategies. UNDP has spearheaded the use of innovative instruments in the region, like the Integrated National Financing Frameworks (INFFs) and issuance of thematic SDG bonds, to tap new sources of development finance. In some countries, SDG related Multi-Partner Trust Funds have been set up where interested national and international donors can coalesce around a particular SDG goal or theme. Our experience has shown that such innovative approaches can raise significant resources and build coalitions of like-minded partners that can support other national initiatives. An understanding of the linkages between the SDGs lies at the heart of any poverty reduction strategy. After all, reduction of poverty must go hand in hand with progress on health, education, food security, climate change and all the other dimensions of the global goals. UNDP is an advocate of SDG integration, and a champion of processes and platforms that bring together diverse groups across society to dialogue on SDG priorities and plans. RBAP has pioneered Social Innovation Platforms (SIPs) in several countries that bring together national and international groups, including civil society, the private sector, and investors, to discuss development issues. Socio-economic models for sustainable jobs, strengthening overall labor market resilience, and tackling environmental pollution are some of the topics that have been the subject of SIP dialogues. In addition, Youth Co:Lab is a programme that brings young people together to create opportunities for leadership and entrepreneurship to tackle SDG obstacles. To date, over 200,000 people in 28 countries in the region have participated in Youth Co:Lab, and approximately 1,240 youth-led enterprises have been launched or assisted by the programme. Two other SDG integration platforms have been active. The Climate, Land- use, Energy and Water Systems (CLEWS) model assesses the linkages between natural resource systems to help develop sectoral models for water, energy, and land use, taking into consideration different climate futures. In addition, the SDG Integration Spark Blue Platform offers an online space for practitioners that enables collective intelligence, sharing and co-creation. Integrated National Financing Frameworks (INFFs) UNDP launched programmes in 17 countries in the region to support INFFs, which assist governments to link planning and budgeting, and align and mobilize public and private finance for the SDGs. Examples from Bangladesh, China, Fiji, India, Malaysia, Mongolia, and Maldives show that UNDP not only assists countries in developing their SDG financing strategies, but it also supports them to mobilize the finance for the SDGs and climate action. Bangladesh is now expanding its new financing strategy to map ways that private sector financing can be used in three critical areas: energy, water and sanitation, and climate. For instance, a Local Climate Financing Framework was drafted to identify needs of communities exposed to climate vulnerabilities. The Framework also allocates additional resources that factor in gender and social inclusion issues. In Malaysia, a UNDP-designed Ecological Fiscal Transfer scheme was integrated as a recurring annual allocation starting from the 2022 national budget, providing a strong fillip to the achievement of SDG 14 and 15 on oceans, biodiversity, and forest management at the sub-national level. Operating under COVID-19 restrictions, UNDP pivoted its focus to the local level, resulting in an SDG localization roadmap. In addition, the Indigenous Peoples Microgrant Facility, funded by the Ministry of Finance and managed by UNDP, provides grants to grassroots organizations that work directly with indigenous populations.

Thematic Bonds to finance COVID recovery and the achievement of the SDGs There has been growing interest in the region in thematic bonds, such as green and blue bonds, social bonds, sustainability bonds, Environmental Social and Governance bonds, and recently, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)-bonds to mobilize resources for sustainable development. UNDP\u2019s SDG Impact Standards for Bond Issuers and Enterprises have been gamechangers to accelerate the issuance of sustainability and SDG bonds and engage the private sector. In 2021, the New Development Bank (NDB) in China issued a three-year fixed rate SDG Bond in the China Interbank Bond Market worth 5 billion RMB (US $767 million), adopting the UNDP Sustainable Development Goals Impact Standards for Bonds Issuers and UNDP SDG Finance Taxonomy (China). This was the first time that the standards, which help bond issuers optimize their contribution to the SDGs, were put into practice by a multilateral development bank. The proceeds of the SDG Bonds are going towards an Emergency Program Loan to China to finance SDG-aligned projects. As a technical advisory partner, UNDP will support the NDB to authenticate and benchmark how the capital raised by this bond will have an impact on the way public and private entities raise capital to support the achievement of the SDGs.

To date, Indonesia has raised US $3.9 billion via Green Sukuk for projects in renewable energy, energy efficiency, waste management, sustainable transport and resilience to climate change, which is expected to reduce up to 10.3 tonnes of CO2-eq. Proceeds have also been used for the construction of more than 690 kilometres of railway tracks to foster cleaner transportation. Building on this success, UNDP is working with Indonesia to accelerate progress towards the SDGs by supporting the issuance of its first SDG Bond. The first sovereign SDG Bond in Southeast Asia raised EUR 500 million (US $584 million) with a 12-year tenor and coupon rate of 1.3 per cent. The SDG Bond provides an alternative source of financing for Indonesia to fast-track the achievement of the SDGs. The proceeds will be allocated to the social sector as part of the response to COVID-19, including for social protection, health, and education. UNDP partnered with the Ministry of Finance to conduct a feasibility study, develop a government securities framework, and support the verification process. In addition to social and green sectors, the framework includes the blue sector as eligible for financing \u2013 which will allow Indonesia to issue Blue Bond/Sukuk in the future that will advance the country\u2019s blue economy.

In India, the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) in Maharashtra signed an MoU with UNDP to create India\u2019s first Social Impact Bond. As part of this new finance approach, the Municipal Corporation\u2019s administration will bear the cost of the public welfare project associated with the bond if the pre-defined project targets are fulfilled. This limits the conventional risks of inefficient and ineffective spending. The Innovative Financing Lab in Indonesia and the SDG Financing Facility in India are finance programmes through which these and other pioneering services are delivered. Youth rally around the SDGs Over half of the world\u2019s young people live in Asia and the Pacific. An empowered new generation can drive the 2030 Agenda and help solve the region\u2019s most urgent challenges. Youth Co:Lab is a regional initiative that was created in 2017 by UNDP and the Citi Foundation. It catalyses youth startups and opens opportunities for entrepreneurial young people to pioneer new SDG solutions. It is the largest youth movement for empowerment, equality, social inclusion, and social justice in the region. To date, Youth Co:Lab has built the capacities of over 200,000 people in leadership, social innovation, and entrepreneurship across 28 countries and territories in Asia-Pacific. Youth Co:Lab has also launched or improved over 1,240 youth-led social enterprises offering innovative solutions to meet the SDGs. These include social [ 82 ] [ 83 ] enterprises led by women, Indigenous young people, and young people with disabilities. For example, DeafTawk, a youth-led startup founded in Pakistan, is an online platform that facilitates real-time language interpretation, enabling the deaf community to access health, education, and employment opportunities. DeafTawk has provided more than 90,000 hours of sign language interpretation to 17,000 people with hearing disabilities, while creating 400 jobs. Another youth-led startup accelerated by Youth Co:Lab is iFarmer, based in Bangladesh. iFarmer allows individuals and institutions to fund the capital requirements of farmers. To date, iFarmer has generated over US $1.13 million in funding support for over 53,000 farmers. SDG Integration Many SDGs are interconnected, which necessitates an integrated approach in their implementation. An important step in SDG integration is to understand the linkages among the various goals and targets. Several tools have been designed to tackle integration and policy coherence. UNDP has provided countries with evidence-based insights so they can make decisions and investments that advance towards the SDGs in an integrated and mutually reinforcing way. UNDP uses Social Innovation Platforms (SIPs) as one method to facilitate individuals and organizations to collaboratively develop social solutions to development challenges. The approach also helps to align disconnected initiatives and enhance their impact through better coherence. The methodology is particularly useful in attracting new partners and financial support for integrated policies and programmes. An enhanced SIP approach, which includes engagement with potential international partners and investors, is underway to transform socio- economic models for sustainable jobs and building overall labour market resilience in the Maldives and Bangladesh. In Thailand and Lao PDR, the SIP methodology is being used to shape new socio-economic models of the factors that drive air pollution. With resources from the Republic of Korea and UNDP, a regional air quality monitoring platform will reinforce air pollution monitoring and forecasting capabilities in these Lower Mekong countries. These endeavours will offer a digital space for a range of capacities, technologies, and partners to come together to devise inclusive and sustainable socio-economic models that can be replicated across the region. UNDP has a leadership role in UN inter-agency efforts on SDG Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support (MAPS). The approach has been applied in several countries, including the Maldives, and in Mongolia, where the focus has been on policy support. The prominent role of the UN and UNDP, as the oldest and largest agency in addressing development goals of Bhutan over decades of partnership, was recognized in December 2021 when His Majesty the King gave the UN Bhutan the Druk Thuksey (the Heart of the Son of the Dragon Kingdom) award.

The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 3 The aim of this policy brief is to better understand what type of reinvigorated multilateralism would be fit for purpose, that is, fos- tering more adequate global public good (GPG) provision under the present policymaking realities, and to explore whether there already exists a momentum for such change on which to build further progress. The analysis suggests that such a reinvigo- rated multilateralism would have four distinguishing features. It would operate on the principle of fostering mutual compatibil- ity between international cooperation and sovereignty; recog- nize GPGs as a new, additional type of public policy challenge, ending their current confounding with development assistance; adopt a mission-oriented approach to resolving GPG-related challenges; and integrate the rising number of autochthonous regional organizations as meso-level intermediaries between the \u2018global\u2019 and the \u2018individual,\u2019 including the \u2018individual national\u2019 into global governance. The reason for this fourth feature would be that these regional organizations and the regionalization they drive already play a critical though often still underappreciated role in GPG provision. The policy brief also recommends ways for translating these four reform ideas into innovations at the prac- tical political level. Most just call for a massive rethinking, or put differently, more realism.

They range from communicable disease control to climate change mitigation and from financial stability to the universalization of norms such as basic human rights. Old and new security challeng- es have also come up for consideration, including cybersecurity; the safe use of new technologies such as artificial intelligence; nuclear non-proliferation; ter- rorism control; and the prevention or cessation of war. As the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic taught us once again\u2014and perhaps more directly than ever before\u2014many global challenges may, for better or for worse, affect all countries and all people, irrespective of whether we are rich or poor, living in the Global North or in the Global South. Challenges of this type are referred to as global public goods (GPGs).1 GPGs not only affect all of us directly or indirectly but also re- quire all of us to contribute to their adequate provision. In other words, they call for international cooperation, often even universal multilateralism. While state and nonstate actors worldwide are active contributors to GPG provision, experience shows that the sum of these contributions in many cases falls short of requirements. As a result, GPG-related prob- lems often remain unresolved, even though their sci- entific and technical dimensions are well-understood, and the resources needed to resolve them are also within the bounds of what is feasible. The question thus arises: Is the present system of multilateral cooperation not well equipped to tackle GPG-type challenges?

Accordingly, this policy brief explores these two unad- dressed points of the Declaration. More specifically, it aims, first, to better understand what type of reinvigorat- ed multilateralism would be fit for purpose, that is, fos- tering more adequate GPG provision given the present policymaking realities, and second, to explore whether there already exists a momentum for such change on which further progress can potentially be based. The discussion of these points is structured as follows. The first section analyses the key characteristics of GPGs from the special viewpoint of their governance requirements. Against this background, the second section examines the factors and forces that explain why these requirements are not adequately met today. The third and fourth sections explain how to do better in the future, assuming that the ultimate goal is to foster global sustainable growth and development, as stipulated in the United Nations 2030 Agenda (United Nations, 2015). The fifth section offers suggestions on the next steps that select actor groups could consid- er in order to help promote the needed governance reforms. The concluding section argues that fostering reinvigorated multilateralism and achieving enhanced GPG provision require a massive rethinking at the the- oretical and practical policy level; and that now seems to be the right time for it, considering the broad-based and strong ambition among policymakers and the global public alike to do better in a post-COVID-19 era. INTRODUCTION 1 Drawing on Paul A. Samuelson (1954), standard economic theory distinguishes between two main categories of goods: private goods and public goods. This classification depends on two characteristics of goods: (1) their rivalry, that is, whether one\u2019s consumption of the good reduces another person\u2019s ability to consume the good, and (2) their excludability, or the ability of the owner of the good to prevent its use by another person. A good that is both rival, meaning one person\u2019s consumption prevents another person from consuming it, and excludable, meaning the owner can prevent someone from using the good, is a private good. Conversely, a good that is non\u2010 rival, meaning one person\u2019s consumption does not diminish another person\u2019s ability to consume it, and non\u2010excludable, meaning the owner cannot easily prevent others from using the good, is a public good. The public effects of a good can be local, national, regional, worldwide and cross-generational. Global public goods are goods of which benefits or costs are of nearly universal reach or potentially affect anyone anywhere (Kaul, 2015). \u201cNo clear vision exists of how to realize mutual compatibility between effective international-community and national policymaking sovereignty.\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 6 This section identifies the distinguishing properties of a GPG and then presents a brief overview of the myr- iad inputs that, in many cases, must come together in order for the good to emerge. The discussion summa- ry shows that GPGs constitute a new, additional type of public-policy challenge that does not fit easily into any of the conventional governance moulds.2 KEY PROPERTIES The generic definition of a pure public good (PG) is that it is non-rival and non-excludable and, because of the latter property, public in consumption. Depending on the geographic reach of a good\u2019s public effects, it is said to be a local, national, regional or global PG. This may sound rather straightforward. In reality, however, matters are more complicated. For example, some goods may be non-rival only up to certain points, after which their availability declines due to over-exploitation. An example of a GPG that is subject to over-exploitation is the atmosphere, which, if overloaded with greenhouse gas emissions, causes global warming. Consequently, if global warming is to be limited, the human impact on the atmosphere also needs to be limited by making the good in questions less global and public in consumption through deliber- ate policy choice. Or consider knowledge \u2013 a non-rival good par excellence. However, it can, for example, be patented and thereby taken out of the public domain, in many cases, even the global public domain; it thus be- comes privatized as the property of the patent holder. Therefore, thinking in terms of a public-private contin- uum can help us conceptualise PGs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "294cbf5a-8e1f-41a9-977c-d9a083c5008d": {"__data__": {"id_": "294cbf5a-8e1f-41a9-977c-d9a083c5008d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the Provision of Global Public Goods: Ready for More Realism?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f3f2a10509e08a2806fa35ad234502ccd0a06e5ed6921ebd0e4e6558e921e8b"}, "2": {"node_id": "46afcb66-b0eb-4529-b929-4ed993475e8a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d17d4b21b79f56990cc874de2db155da2dab31eb95d55bd1ff321f8b80b2ceb7"}}, "hash": "0863ddfb2012250b99c9c3027c5ee7b43580df270faa5f9389ace2a9bc0422c9", "text": "The outer poles of the continuum comprise, at one end, purely private (rival and excludable) goods and, at the other end, purely public (non-rival and non-excludable) goods.

Therefore, it is also useful to distinguish between, on the one hand, natural GPGs, such as the already mentioned atmosphere, or the moonlight and the high seas, the existence of which predates the existence of humans, and, on the other hand, human-made GPGs. The latter, for the most part, have arisen from deliber- ate human choices, such as the global institutional and physical communications and transport systems, or else global norms, such as national sovereignty or ba- sic human rights that aim for global public acceptance: in other words, globally public consumption. In several cases, these deliberate policy choices have led to the (often unintended) globalization of essentially national (including local) PGs, such as financial contagion ef- fects, crime and violence, and information and news. In this connection, one might also point to the dif- ference between making a non-rival good, such as knowledge, excludable and making a rival good, such as a vaccine, available for all. The latter proposal has emerged as a possible way to end the COVID-19 pan- demic, with its advocates frequently calling for making the vaccine a global public good. However, due to its innate property of being rival in consumption, techni- cally speaking, a vaccine cannot be turned into a GPG. All one can do is produce it in quantities sufficient to make it available to all who want it, at an affordable price or even free of charge, thus rendering the rival property moot. However, someone would still have to pay \u2013 perhaps several billion times or so \u2013 the price that producers charge per single dose of the vaccine, not counting other transaction costs involved in its safe transportation and administration. On the other hand, if one were to ask inventors of, for example, a critical vaccine or green technology to allow the global and public use of the technology for which they hold the patents, one would perhaps have to reimburse them for the research costs they incurred. However, the invention would not need repeating millions or billions of times. This difference between a vaccine and a knowledge or technology product shows the importance of clarifying the consumption properties of a PG.4 A proper understanding of GPGs also requires us to GPGs: KEY PROPERTIES AND GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS 2 For a comprehensive overview of the evolution and the current state of the debate in the social-science, political-science and international relations literature on GPGs, see Kaul (2016) and Kaul et al. (2016). 3 The term \u2018globalness\u2019 originated in the field of marketing, where it describes how a brand is widely available and accepted across the world; see Liu et al. (2021). 4 For a more detailed discussion on making vaccines available for all, see Kaul (2020d) and Reddy and Acharya (2020). The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 7 clarify the meaning of the terms \u2018global\u2019 and \u2018good\u2019 as used in this context. Global means that the goods have worldwide effects, spanning countries in differ- ent parts of the world, areas beyond national juris- diction (ABNJs) and, perhaps, multiple generations. Im- portantly, they tend to penetrate countries and ABNJs without asking for permission or a visa. Thus, consider- ing that we live in a world of manifold differences, dis- parities and varying preferences among countries and population groups, the border-crossing penetration ef- fects of a GPG may create conflict or contestation. This occurs because of their perceived negative impact on the welfare of the affected countries and because they run counter to the core principles of the present world order \u2013 non-violability of national borders and national policymaking sovereignty.

(2016, p. xxxix) Figure 1: The provision path of a global public good The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 8 consumption entails policy interdependence among countries, which may or may not be welcomed by certain countries and population groups; and, there- fore, when used in reference to a PG, the term \u2018good\u2019 is value neutral. It denotes a thing, product, service or condition, just as it does when used in reference to a private good, such as a cigarette or car. GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS Just like most private goods, most PGs, including GPGs, are composed of various building blocks that need to be assembled in order for the desired final good to emerge. Similarly, once they exist, they need maintenance and care lest they stop generating their expected benefits. The public goods literature has distinguished three main types of assembly processes: summation, sum- mation with a weak link, and best shot (Cornes and Sandler, 1996). Figure 1 illustrates, in a highly styl- ized and simplified form, the provision path of a good following a summation-type provision process, as do many GPGs. Clearly, GPGs are not provided in a lump sum at the international level, by one or another global actor, such as the United Nations or the World Bank. This holds even for goods that follow a best shot pro- vision path, such as the invention of a new vaccine.6 GPG provision is a highly complex process. In order for the final product to emerge, many hands have to come on deck, including multiple state and nonstate actors, who can generate the required inputs at different levels of policymaking and, most likely, also in a wide range of economic sectors. Thus, when considering how best to provide a GPG most efficiently and effectively, policymakers need to consider several aspects and make a number of choices. Crucially important is to determine whether the good in question has specific \u201csystemic integrity requirements\u201d that must be met for it to emerge and generate the expected benefits, or whether it can be improved incrementally (Costanza, 2015). If it is the for- mer, then it is important to accept that in determining adequate provision, not only human interests count but also the interests, the systemic integrity require- ments of the good itself, a requirement of special im- portance now in the Anthropocene. Other provision aspects to consider would include, for example, the balances to strike between horizontal and vertical decentralization; the willingness to cooperate among essential input providers and the incentives they would eventually need; the views and expecta- tions of concerned stakeholders; the necessary types of financing and how to mobilize them; and last but not least, how to share the costs and expected benefits. Ideally, each of the goods to be provided, such as mar- itime security, would have one or more provision plat- forms, along with platform facilitators or focal points to keep an eye on the overall process and to report back periodically to the policymaking bodies concerned. The creation of such networking arrangements would make it possible for the governance processes of GPG provi- sion to match the goods\u2019 global character. Thus, GPG provision, too, involves interdependence, adding to the interdependence among countries and people stemming from the goods\u2019 globally public con- sumption; this consequently strengthens the sense of curtailed sovereignty that policymakers and the pub- lic often associate with GPGs. A NEW TYPE OF POLICY CHALLENGE The foregoing discussion suggests that GPGs consti- tute a new, additional type of public-policy challenge. This rests mainly on the three following characteristics: 1. GPGs do not fall squarely into any of the conven- tional policy moulds, such as domestic policy or foreign affairs. They also go beyond development assistance because they concern all of us, rich and poor, North and South, and, of course, they do not allow for resolution through military force or geoeco- nomics.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65581413-4dcf-4f38-9f98-ff882d751acf": {"__data__": {"id_": "65581413-4dcf-4f38-9f98-ff882d751acf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the Provision of Global Public Goods: Ready for More Realism?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "133a6d5cb8d4a643bb7a882ea7e0e86fb615c0fab074ca2bfc92f3d12a58deac"}, "2": {"node_id": "81798e57-238c-46ca-be79-6cdb08573407", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a9bd928c8fc5357a90cad5982a3eba7d170193caab5780e6ff7a7173b941d89"}}, "hash": "dd0e8b7388586a050879f42bb019d13aca5fa47639d94b226007d886660f9731", "text": "Adequate GPG provision calls for institution- al innovation. 2.

Determining the need, urgency and magnitude of planned GPG interventions requires attention to the goods\u2019 provisioning requirements, not only to human interests, whether those of state or non-state actors. Hence, investment-thinking rather than do- nor-thinking needs to underpin GPG financing. Judging from recent reports on global crisis and gaps in GPG provision, it appears that the needed innova- tions have, to date, only happened in part if at all (WEF, 2021; WMO, 2021). The next section offers some ex- planations for this current state of GPG provision. 6 On the process of vaccine research and development, see Felter (2021) and WHO (2021). The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 9 Psychological and behavioural factors receive the most frequent mention in the social-sciences literature as contributors to GPG under-provision. The most fre- quently assumed impediment is free riding on the part of individual actors in the presence of public goods. By now, however, evidence has mounted that this type of behaviour does not occur as generally as analysts assume. Many individual actors, whether organiza- tional entities, such as state, business and civil-so- ciety groups, or human individuals, act out of mixed motives, or perhaps even out of pure altruism. Often, hesitation to cooperate arises from aversion to change or uncertainty stemming from lack of information or inability fully to grasp complex events. No doubt such psychological and behavioural fac- tors also contribute to GPG under-provision today. However, many seem to have deeper roots and serve as symptoms of more basic systemic and structural problems. Therefore, the following analysis focuses on systemic factors, notably lagging adjustment to today\u2019s policymaking realities within the operational system of multilateral cooperation and structural factors, espe- cially as-yet-unsettled and intensifying global power shifts. The summary notes that concern about their national policymaking sovereignty makes countries reluctant to cooperate today. SYSTEMIC FACTORS Global governance, or the system of international cooperation, consists of two main interrelated process- es: policy-setting or negotiations and operations or implementation. With the rising number of GPG-type challenges confronting us, the policy-setting part has become more and more global issue-focused. Special issue-focused multilateral, even universal multilateral negotiation processes now exist for older and new- er GPGs, ranging from climate change to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), cybersecurity and the combined global public spill- over effects of GPG under-provision, such as swell- ing movements of forced international refugee and migration streams. In these forums, countries forge agreements on global goals, principles, norms and standards. However, on the operational side, governance ar- rangements have largely remained unchanged. For the most part, the operational multilateral system still functions as a development assistance or aid sys- tem: much the same holds for the bilateral aid system. Most of its increasingly numerous agencies, funds and programs, including the multilateral development banks (MDBs), have a country-focused business model and corresponding instruments, and, in the case of the MDBs, for example, sovereign loans. Of course, developing countries \u2013 like many industrialized coun- tries \u2013 have a genuine interest in undertaking projects (even loan-financed ones) in GPG-related policy fields, projects that can generate national benefits and global co-benefits. This becomes evident from their voluntary nationally determined commitments (NDCs) to reduce greenhouse gases. However, the experience in the Global South and Global North has also made it evident that the non-rec- ognition of GPGs as policy concerns sui generis also creates many challenges. While countries, state and non-state actors contribute in myriad ways to numer- ous GPGs, the sum of all these individual efforts often does not meet requirements for adequate provision levels. Individual and global interests overlap only partially, and the present system has no effective pull mechanisms in place. As a result, especially in the case of binary goods, such as climate change mitiga- tion, under-provision problems remain unresolved, and may even worsen and assume ever more serious, costly and potentially catastrophic proportions. The next section suggests that the ongoing global power shifts play a major role in this institutional lock-in and path dependency.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0bfadf9e-867f-4913-9c95-296195800b91": {"__data__": {"id_": "0bfadf9e-867f-4913-9c95-296195800b91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the Provision of Global Public Goods: Ready for More Realism?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef5f02f7b5759856d37367e39aa5e5affc271eb432d6e63dfd9738957770c3e8"}, "2": {"node_id": "e20e8eba-7299-406e-8685-4082895bd56b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b5dcf903376d8aff45c3959e20f1b1ed9f3fc3c0bdfc0289f16f9909b7455717"}}, "hash": "46d696f8676350d1817776edfd0222341c7766d6782b55783a755bf8e795dc88", "text": "STRUCTURAL FACTORS As more developing states have moved up the devel- opment ladder, some have become global powerhous- es and have begun to play a more proactive role in multilateral forums, regionally and globally (Kaul, 2020; EXPLAINING TODAY\u2019S UNDER-PROVISION OF GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS \u201cA continuation of business as usual seems to be highly undesirable, leading us not toward but away from the agreed goal of global sustainability\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 10 7 On this point, also see the 2021", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ee4b3c2-1d7b-4578-a404-7f612a405a4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ee4b3c2-1d7b-4578-a404-7f612a405a4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the Provision of Global Public Goods: Ready for More Realism?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "958a3db6d2ee3f4d654417ef3b522f7b6148b0eee930b614bba8b6f1014a94ac"}, "3": {"node_id": "7e79f0cb-8cd8-4cac-8c1a-392d6e7a3cd9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff994184362a7a372e32454647e433a28b8d61dd39c37e19c49d241159bf03b7"}}, "hash": "f69b5427ca2484fa996cd4f78e4ccce410c4bafa19615bb0f2fd885e0fcabbf1", "text": "Earth Day Summit on Climate convened by the US President and attended by 40 heads of state or government (Neuberger, 2021). Lopes and Kararach, 2019). The world has begun a gradual move away from the conventional constella- tion of a small group of powerful states acting as glob- al policy-setters, often under the leadership of one of the superpowers, with the rest of the countries largely relegated to policy-taker status. In the wake of these shifts, top-down power politics have increasingly lost effectiveness as multilateral- ism\u2019s main operating principle. The industrialized coun- tries have confronted ever more frequently what their developing counterparts have long known: namely, that international cooperation and sovereignty do not necessarily fit together quasi-automatically. Especially under the present conditions of increasing multipolar- ity, any such fit calls for compromises, acknowledging and respecting varying preferences and priorities, and striking win-win bargains to bring all on board. However, rather than accepting that conditions have changed, industrialized countries began partially to re- treat from universal multilateralism, negotiating select issues in mini-lateral forums and promoting club-based governance, for example by institutionalizing regular meetings of the Group of Seven (G7). The developing countries followed suit and set up their own mini-later- al initiatives, such as the BRICS Forum and other new mechanisms, including the Asian Infrastructure Invest- ment Bank or the New Development Bank. Moreover, official development assistance (ODA) flows became more targeted to issues of special concern for donor countries. In fact, the principal change has come in greater reliance on private finance for development. Unsurprisingly, under these circumstances very few if any countries have had a strong appetite for change. Universal multilateralism and perhaps even multilat- eralism in general became shallow. More omnibus agreements were adopted, such as the 2030 Agenda, which covers so wide a range of goals and sub-goals (many already approved in earlier UN resolutions) that adopting it did not require any too-difficult compro- mise. Similarly, the Paris Agreement on climate change could pass because, among other things, it empha- sized voluntary nationally determined commitments to carbon-dioxide emissions reductions. To complicate matters further, rather than seeking new cooperation strategies, rivalry emerged between the major powers, notably between China and the United States. This left the world adrift without any clear vision of how to cooperate on GPG-type issues that, as both sides would perhaps readily admit, no one country, however powerful, can resolve unilaterally and alone.7 A LACK OF REALISM AND VISION HOLDS BACK NEEDED CHANGE Thus, it appears that the under-provision of GPGs to- day stems from two main factors: institutional lock-in, notably the lagging adjustment of the operational sys- tem of international cooperation (IC) to both the grow- ing importance of GPGs and increasing multipolarity; and the ongoing global power shifts, which make both developed and developing countries follow a \u2018logic of hedging\u2019 (Matthews, 2021, p.12). This is a course of shallow, non-committal IC because, for quite differ- ent reasons, both groups of countries are concerned about lacking compatibility between international cooperation and national policymaking sovereignty. Therefore, how could the world escape from this policy trap? The next section offers an initial set of reform ideas, while the fourth section explores whether there already exist change processes that appear to head in the direction of the changes suggested. \u201cClearly, enhancing the provision of GPGs, notably resolving the most pressing problems resulting from their under-provision, requires a major rethinking of current concepts, institutional arrangements and international-community strategies. Isolated ad hoc changes and a bit more money here or there will not suffice\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 11 When taking the previous findings together, it seems that making multilateralism fit for purpose will at least need the following three reforms: first and foremost, to forge consensus on a new principle of mutual compatibility between IC and sovereignty as a new operating principle of multilateralism and, in support thereof, to recognize GPGs as a new, additional type of public policy issue; and to adopt a platform or \u2018mission-oriented approach\u2019 to GPG provision that is focused on actually achieving the resolution of existing under-provision problems (Maz- zucato, 2017; Mazzucato, 2021).

Given countries\u2019 concerns about how to ensure that international cooperation does not undermine their sovereignty, Kaul (2020) argues for replacing power politics as the chief operating princi- ple of international cooperation by a principle of \u2018dual DOING BETTER IN THE FUTURE I: MAKING MULTILATERALISM FIT FOR PURPOSE Source: Kaul (2020d, p.154) Figure 2: A tripod architecture of international cooperation finance The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 12 compatibility,\u2019 referring to the mutual compatibility between international cooperation and sovereignty. To foster such compatibility, the principle would require states to aim for two objectives: 1. Constructing international cooperation bargains that all the concerned parties view as sovereign- ty-compatible, that is, enhancing their national welfare and well-being. 2. Making every effort possible to exercise their na- tional policymaking sovereignty in a way that is com- patible with the global. To elaborate on the second objective, the respectful exercise of national policymaking sovereignty might imply, among other things, respect for other nations\u2019 sovereignty and to this end, willingness to internalize negative cross-border spillovers wherever possible and in line with established global goals and norms of fairness and justice. It would also include respect for the adequate-provision requirements of GPGs and hence, willingness to contribute a fair share of the inputs required, individually and collectively. Clearly, reaching consensus on any one side of this notion of dual compatibility will depend on consensus on the other side. It may also depend on related pro- cesses of consultation and decision-making being fully participatory and transparent. Discussing and agree- ing on a notion of dual compatibility could have the positive effect of changing the language and percep- tion of IC, such that in the minds of many policymakers and the public, it loses its equation with giving up or losing national policymaking sovereignty. However, applying the new operating principle and enabling all concerned parties to judge for themselves whether a particular IC initiative meets the criterion of dual com- patibility would critically depend on states\u2019 concurrent agreement to the reforms discussed next. RECOGNIZING GPGs Given the intention stated in several recent global agreements to promote sustainable global growth and development, the resolution of the most press- ing cases of GPG under-provision ought to be a top priority, not only at the level of rhetoric but also at the practical political level. It is difficult to imagine how an effective and efficient resolution of related problems could be achieved without granting GPGs their long overdue recognition as a policy type sui generis.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19dabdf1-9bbe-4c2d-a747-0493f1d5fbea": {"__data__": {"id_": "19dabdf1-9bbe-4c2d-a747-0493f1d5fbea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the Provision of Global Public Goods: Ready for More Realism?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b02aa9259d9e18f8a87cf70a9b27656c4ab241cd195b6095993024569e92d3b"}, "2": {"node_id": "b7e188b2-df12-4328-bfed-d8a79599d721", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f6d4144c643cc5cb58f6ede5908d11cdcee893c087db5f88a73152b0b6339746"}}, "hash": "a7c4d71f4eaf33810d459baa3b0ee3782afc597a2f6224ffa196049f1cf6e0b6", "text": "To do so would imply accepting both that these goods differ in significant ways from other types of IC challenges, such as development assis- tance and financing for a global crisis response and stabilization facility and that there also exist nu- merous interlinkages and synergies between these different IC strands, as shown in Figure 2, which illustrates the resultant tripod-shaped architecture of international cooperation finance.

In addition, the platform or mission facilitators\u2019 mandate would involve identifying complementa- ry inputs that need to be provided collectively at the international level and to mobilize the requisite financing for those. In this way, it could become pos- sible to actually close the gaps that nowadays remain between the sum of the inputs voluntarily provided by individual actors and those needed to reach the level of adequate provision. To illustrate, in the case of COVID-19, the collectively to-be-provided inputs include, among others, financ- ing for the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facil- ity (COVAX) and the financing needed to support developing countries in coping with the economic effects of the pandemic. However, as the IC approach to COVID-19 is still of a conventional, fractured type, many of the additionally required inputs are seriously underfunded.8 There exists no integrated mission-ori- ented approach to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Clearly, key features of mission-oriented projects that deserve this name would systematically assess what it would cost to achieve their mission, undertake at least rough-and-ready but solid analyses of the financial and non-financial costs and benefits and mobilize the required funds. In cases that require urgent resolution, it could even be desirable to establish a scale of assessed contributions until a project\u2019s mission is accomplished, covering all countries and taking into account such es- tablished burden-sharing principles as the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respec- tive capacities (UNFCCC, n.d.). 8 On the COVAX funding gap, see Farge (2021) and, on financial support for developing countries, see Mazarei (2021). \u201cRegional organizations play an important role in both enhanced GPG provision and in making multilateralism function.

Hirschman\u2019s writings states that at any point in time, societal conditions are likely to contain both destruc- tive and constructive forces (Adelman, 2013). So, can we discern these sorts of constructive forces at the present moment, ones that could help advance the change agenda discussed above. As the following dis- cussion shows, the answer is \u2018Yes.\u2019 Among the many ongoing global transformation processes, one that seems to qualify as constructive is the rising trend towards regionalism in the Global South.

It takes stock of cur- rent RO action in respect to GPGs and examines their models of multilateral cooperation.9 It then assesses the role of ROs to date, suggesting that ROs already serve as pivotal meso-level intermediaries between the global and the individual in GPG provision. To date, this role of ROs has, however, received only limited at- tention, including from the international development assistance community. ROS\u2019 PRESENT ROLE IN GPG PROVISION Most ROs were created with the overarching goal of improving the welfare and wellbeing of their member states through cooperative efforts aimed at fostering integration among them. The expectation, which, in large measure, has been realized, was that integration would give small- or middle-sized countries added economic and political visibility and strength and thus enhanced opportunities to pursue more self-deter- mined development goals and to exercise more agen- cy in international negotiations on global matters. While some ROs, such as the South American trade bloc, MERCOSUR, have a main purpose, often eco- nomic cooperation and integration, most are multipur- pose organizations that deal with economic, envi- ronmental and security challenges and sociocultural concerns, increasingly including human rights and gender equality issues. Importantly, considering the present context, ROs address a large number of GPG- type challenges. In fact, almost all GPGs, human-made or natural, long-standing or of recent origin, figure on some RO agenda, although with varying emphases depending on the RO\u2019s geographic location or its level of integration and institutional strength.

Another important function of ROs is to enable member states to access GPGs, such as internation- al markets by, for example, fostering regional market integration and assisting members to strengthen their international competitiveness as buyers, sellers, inves- tors and investment destinations. Many ROs wish to be seen not as stumbling blocks but rather as facilita- tors of globalization and enhanced GPG provision. To this end, they aim to operate within existing interna- tional laws. By doing so, they promote the rollout and upholding of global norms and standards as well as policy principles that range from free and fair trade to human rights, safe use of nuclear material and free passage for all through the high seas. Yet another way in which ROs contribute to enhanced GPG provision is by supporting regional research and The GPG-related activities undertaken by ROs, of- ten facilitated by their secretariat or other regional entities, fall into a number of different functional cat- egories, including the following: Protecting the region and individual countries in the region against negative \u2018spill-ins\u2019 from underprovid- ed GPGs, such as climate change-related extreme weather events, health threats, excessive financial volatility, and international crime and violence.

This happens in areas such as climate change, biodiversity preservation, dig- italization of the economy and the peaceful use of the outer space. In cases where member states require as- sistance in order to participate in a particular project, ROs offer them support, recognizing that contributing to GPGs often depends on the existence of requisite national capacity and resources. Through these various activities aimed at enhancing member states\u2019 access to GPGs, ROs demonstrate that fairness can be granted, for example, by richer to poorer countries, but that it can \u2013 and, perhaps often, must \u2013 be self-made. Actors must acquire the capacity to benefit from available opportunities. Given their emphasis on a comprehensive and inte- grated perspective on policymaking, ROs demon- strate an awareness of the multiplex nature of GPGs. This can be seen from the Indian Ocean Rim Associ- ation (IORA), which deals with the multi-dimensional GPG of maritime security. IORA not only adopts a multi-issue/sector/actor approach, but has member- ship comprising African and Asian countries. In this case, the GPG is the region or space that determines the organization\u2019s membership. A similar phenome- non can be observed in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region where the health and peacefulness of the South China Sea are important rallying points that make countries cooperate around issues of sustainable fisheries, illicit trade and free passage through the sea. The notion of integrated, continent-wide development obviously also underpins the work of the African Union (AU), as evident from its 2063 Agenda (African Union, n.d.a). Regional public goods (RPGs), such as the aforementioned, clearly show the significant global spillover effects that RPGs can have. They are dual-purpose RPGs, because they serve the region and the world, for example, by mak- ing it possible also for external actors to access and utilize these RPGs, be it in the form of natural-resource mining or enjoying a free and safe passage of their ships through the high seas.10 Many of the ROs\u2019 functions mentioned in Box 1 have become institutionalized in various forms, including regional crisis management mechanisms; research and training centres; centres for disease control; regimes harmonizing physical and institutional infrastructure; regular consultations, monitoring and review process- es; and, in support of these and other functions, the establishment of RO secretariats.11 These entities can be viewed as intermediate dual-purpose RPGs, serv- ing the region and contributing to GPG provision by easing goods under-provision or enhancing their pro- vision levels, thereby making globalization look better than it would without the corrective efforts of the ROs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4daf3ecd-7be0-460e-b387-bf52620fd9aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "4daf3ecd-7be0-460e-b387-bf52620fd9aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the Provision of Global Public Goods: Ready for More Realism?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3cef2a8d1220fbe488a4dc7792636e684f19778707f07eca43e2a873e6ebf054"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9ae3675-aa3c-446a-871b-9726c10ab913", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "767e2959b1083d8e6f5f5f55be29f96e1f39a2892212e49a95f2f7a452cddfe7"}}, "hash": "a85c70094a0e0092a6323df8964c4973556ba14c288df86bea83c0d99d435d65", "text": "The quantity and quality of RO-produced RPGs, in turn, depend on a critically important intangible RPG: the trust that exists among RO member states.

To do this effectively, their representatives must enjoy exter- nal agency; to enjoy external agency they need to be seen by their partners as enjoying internal agency and legitimacy, the trust of their member states. The issue of trust, legitimacy and partnering brings us straight to the next point: the ROs\u2019 models of multilateralism. 10 For more information, see Bergin et al. (2020) and Birdwell and Taherian (2020). 11 Examples of these dual-purpose RPGs are organizations such as the African Union\u2019s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (https://africacdc.org/); the Chiang Mai Initiative, an emergency liquidity facility launched by ASEAN and China, Japan and the Republic of Korea (i.e., ASEAN+3) (https://aric.adb.org/initiative/ chiang-mai-initiative); the Disaster Management Centre of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) (http://saarc-sdmc.org/); and the Caribbean Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) (https://caricom.org/institutions/caribbean-center-for- renewable-energy-and-energy-efficiency-ccreee/). Besides the aforementioned tangible dual-purpose RPGs, there also exist less- tangible ones, such as the normative frameworks that ROs have created, including, for example, the agreements that they forged on economic cooperation and integration; the norms laid down in various charter documents and subsequent declarations calling for commitment to international cooperation within and beyond the region; the peaceful settlement of disputes; and, increasingly, promotion of environmental sustainability, respect for human rights and the strengthening of women\u2019s role in development. 12 See, for example, the case studies presented in Bhattacharjee (2018), Meyer et al. (2019) and Zaum (2013). The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 17 REGIONAL MODELS OF MULTILATERALISM Of course, different ROs function differently, mainly because they operate under varied regional con- ditions and external influences. However, assess- ments of RO effectiveness generally show that these organizations have generated positive results. For example, analysts recognize ASEAN\u2019s major achievement in terms of preventing conflicts relating to the South China Sea from exploding. The recent- ly concluded Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which ASEAN facilitated over several years, marks yet another one of its achieve- ments. Despite the tensions existing between SAARC\u2019s members, notably between India and Paki- stan, it, too, has achieved important positive results. It has kept the communication channels among its members alive. In addition, as noted above, several regional centres were established and continue to function. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have engendered a new, strengthened willing- ness among SAARC members to engage in more active cooperation (PSRP, 2021a). In fact, despite various external interferences and ef- forts to pull RO member states apart, most ROs have survived and are, to varying degrees, able to produce results (Chirathivat and Langhammer, 2020). This appears in large measure to be due to the basic type of multilateralism that more or less all ROs practice, whether located in Asia or other parts of the Glob- al South, which has become known as the \u2018ASEAN way.\u2019 Its hallmarks include mutual respect among RO member states for each other\u2019s sovereignty, terri- torial integrity and independence; decision-making through consultation and by consensus; seeking unity in diversity; promoting a sense of community among member states; and practicing open multi- lateralism by reaching out to external partners while maintaining the RO\u2019s centrality (ASEAN, 2007).

This intermediary role is, in many cases, an explicit part of ROs\u2019 identity. For example, according to its charter, ASEAN has the task of find- ing or, where it does not yet exist, promoting \u2018unity in diversity\u2019 (ASEAN, 2007: article 2.1[i]). It is barely imaginable how, in today\u2019s world, agreement on glob- al goals and their implementation could be achieved without such a commitment to seeking unity in di- versity, both among RO member states and between them and external interlocutors and partners. ASSESSING CURRENT AND POTENTIAL FUTURE ROLES As can be seen from the above analysis and the regionalism literature, ROs are already playing an important role in both enhanced GPG provision and in making multilateralism function. In fact, some of the global challenges confronting the world could prove to be much more serious but for the activities undertaken by the ROs in Asia and elsewhere. Moreover, the existence of ROs has meant that the stark contrast between a few major global policy-set- ters and many policy-takers, characteristic of earlier global governance eras, has begun to fade, gradually giving way to a more even global distribution of power among today\u2019s large countries, such as China, Japan, Russia and the United States, and the RO clusters of middle and smaller countries. In fact, in terms of joint economic strength, a few ROs have already moved up the development ranks closer to some of the top-rank- ing countries. For example, if the member states of ASEAN counted as one economy, in 2020 it was the fifth largest economy in the world, behind the Unit- ed States, China, Japan and Germany (ASEANstats, 2021). Certainly, the high-level attention that some ROs already enjoy depends not only on the critically important role they play in respect to GPG provision, but also on their growing importance as markets and natural-resource endowment. Nevertheless, some ROs by now possess considerable The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 18 internal and external \u2018actorness,\u201913 including strong convening powers, as shown, for example, by the at- tendance at ASEAN and AU summit meetings (ASE- AN Regional Forum, 1993; African Union, n.d.). This strength equips them to play a role as intermediary be- tween the global and the individual in both directions, downward and upward. While some major powers seem well aware of them, links between ROs and the conventional entities of the IC system, notably the development assistance community, appear to be less well-developed. For the most part, development assistance agencies still view regions only as geographic spaces made up of individual countries and not as communities. Conse- quently, for them, integration means mainly furthering, country-by-country, interoperability of physical and institutional infrastructure and less so supporting the development of integrated communities capable of do- ing together what is best done together.14 Of interest, however, is that a number of UN General Assembly resolutions recognized the role of ROs,15 and several ROs have been granted consultative status to the Unit- ed Nations. Moreover, ROs were sometimes invited to meet with the UN Secretary-General or attend a meet- ing of the UN Security Council. These and other signs suggest that the new reality of increasing regionalism is beginning to be recognized and appreciated as a force potentially to be relied on to foster more sustain- able global growth and development and that it is time for IC agencies, including the UN regional commis- sions, to shift gears from doing development for indi- vidual countries in their respective region to enabling individual countries and ROs as regional communi- ties to promote development that is done by and for themselves and the world, in line with the principle of mutual compatibility between IC and sovereignty.

THE FOUR DISTINGUISHING FEATURES OF A FIT-FOR-PURPOSE MULTILATERALISM Clearly, the reforms discussed above require one an- other for each to work, and for all to achieve the goal: the grand mission of making multilateralism more fit for the purpose of enhanced GPG provision. Together, they constitute a four-point reform agenda that, once accomplished, would lead to a fit-for-purpose multilat- eralism with four distinguishing features. It would: 1. Operate on the principle of mutual compatibility be- tween international cooperation and sovereignty. 2. Recognize GPGs as a new, additional type of policy challenge and end their confounding with develop- ment assistance. 3. Adopt a mission-oriented approach to resolving GPG-related challenges. 4. Involve ROs as meso-level intermediaries between the global and the individual, including the specific interests of individual states, in matters of global governance. As several analysts argue, among them S\u00f6derbaum (2016), regionalism is here to stay. Considering that several ROs are already actively interlinked with vari- ous external partners, including ROs outside their own geographic space, it seems reasonable to assume that over time regionalism and its model of multilateralism will increasingly flow upward into the global realm and help generate more understanding and support for applying the principle of mutual compatibility between IC and sov- ereignty, also in the context of universal multilateralism. However, many of today\u2019s global challenges need to be addressed urgently and decisively. The next sec- tion offers recommendations on how to kickstart and accelerate the needed change processes. 13 On the concept of \u2018actorness\u2019 and interregional relations conceptualised in terms of institutions, recognition and identity, and as a relational concept dependent on context and perception, see Mattheis and Wunderlich (2017). 14 For examples of such so far rather rare activities of regional community-building or, perhaps better, region-building performed by development assistance agencies, see ADB (2016) and AfDB (2019). 15 See, for example, UN General Assembly Resolution 75/69 adopted 25 March 2021, concerning cooperation between the United Nations and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (United Nations, 2021). The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 19 Clearly, enhancing the provision of GPGs, notably resolving the most pressing problems resulting from their under-provision, requires a major rethinking of current concepts, institutional arrangements and IC strategies. Isolated ad hoc changes and a bit more money here or there will not suffice, as the analysis in this policy brief shows. Basic constraints require re- moval and new opportunities need tapping. However, mounting empirical evidence demonstrates that sever- al of the present policy paths, notably the present way of addressing GPG-type challenges, are not only be- coming increasingly costly but also posing global sys- temic risks. Hence, a continuation of business as usual seems to be highly undesirable, leading us not toward but away from the agreed goal of global sustainability. But what would it take, then, to set the necessary rethinking in motion? Here some suggestions on pos- sible next steps. Recommendation 1: Most important for policymakers and the global public at large is perhaps to bear in mind Mahbubani\u2019s (2013, p.87) words: \u201cThe world has changed. Our way of managing it has not.\u201d Therefore, most important would be for scholars and experts working in relevant policy fields to, first of all, take stock of, synthesize and communicate in an accessible form for further public debate what we know already about how concretely we could more fully and system- atically adjust to today\u2019s policymaking realities. Addi- tional policy research and development ought to be undertaken and well-documented proof that describes the conditions under which to implement reforms. Without such additional information about the how, when and why, many policymakers and their various constituencies would most likely hesitate to innovate unless a major global disaster would finally compel them to do so.

If similar agreements were reached in other parts of the world, ROs\u2019 capacities could receive a significant boost as could their con- tributions to GPG provision and global sustainable growth and development.16 Recommendation 3: Much could also be gained in terms of strengthening ROs and, beyond that, further- ing the emergence of a more fit-for-purpose multilat- eralism if the conventional development assistance agencies, including the MDBs and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development/ Devel- opment Assistance Committee, would undertake a review of their current activities to determine to what extent they have or have not yet adjusted their oper- ational modalities to today\u2019s policymaking realities. More specifically, have they initiated reforms to help create the new tripod architecture of IC finance dis- MOVING FORWARD: CATCHING UP WITH REALITY 16 On the UNECA/AU relation, see Africa Union (2017). \u201cA reinvigorated multilateralism would have four distinguishing features. It would operate on the principle of fostering mutual compatibility between international cooperation and sovereignty; recognize GPGs as a new, additional type of public policy challenge, ending their current confounding with development assistance; adopt a mission-oriented approach to resolving GPG- related challenges; and integrate the rising number of autochthonous regional organizations as meso-level intermediaries \u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 20 cussed above (Figure 2), which would be an essential step towards realizing a new multilateralism? What ad- ditional reforms are they intending to implement next? And what are the lessons they have learned that could be useful to share with the wider IC community? Recommendation 4: In several respects, the reforms needed to realize the type of a new multilateralism suggested here go right to the core of today\u2019s world order by calling for a modernized interpretation of the notion of sovereignty. Therefore, it would only be fit- ting if the UN Secretary-General would seek member states\u2019 agreement on the establishment of a panel of renowned personalities to hold global consultations on this proposed agenda and offer their advice on how to proceed further. Recommendation 5: Considering the urgency of several of the global challenges we confront, why would the UN member states not dare to be bold and decide to establish two mission-oriented pilots as soon as possi- ble: one for climate change mitigation and adaptation and one for global health, including the fight against COVID-19 and strengthening global preparedness for the next health threats likely to attack the world, such as microbial resistance? Certainly, member states would find it easier to take this decision if there was strong support for it from civil society, the business communi- ty, think tanks and academia, that is, the global public. Of course, the message here is not to halt current ac- tion to address global challenges. All of that can and should for now continue, even with incremental im- provements, but always with the awareness that these measures will not suffice. More fundamental change is needed and hence the call here for a willingness to rethink and innovate so that, come 2030, we may not see ourselves fall too far short of the goal of global sustainable growth and development. The analysis in the first two sections of this policy brief shows that sovereignty is coming under pressure in IC contexts. This demotivates states from engaging in multilateral cooperation, notably the universal multi- lateralism that many GPGs require. So far, however, no clear vision exists of how to realize mutual compat- ibility between effective IC and national policymak- ing sovereignty. The third and fourth sections offer a possible vision of fit-for-purpose multilateralism. As the fifth section argues, translating this vision into policy practice requires a major rethinking and notably more realism: on the one hand, a willingness to accept that the world has changed and, on the other hand, accep- tance of the fact that in GPG-related policy fields that entail interdependence among countries, effective co- operation tends to be the better way forward towards realizing national interests because it solves problems that cannot be resolved unilaterally. Are policymakers and the global public ready for that? The many calls and expressed commitments to doing better in the post-COVID-19 era suggest that now could be the right time to introduce some long-overdue corrective steps and facilitate faster and scaled-up progress towards global sustainable growth and development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90980e6a-f281-4dcd-9315-a875426871fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "90980e6a-f281-4dcd-9315-a875426871fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the Provision of Global Public Goods: Ready for More Realism?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c52307b5a286961b4b86b60198e508b37868074ebb47d42908fb52bc38c3fc28"}, "2": {"node_id": "633db962-064a-4087-8219-4e47ebd35eaa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59fa925c623dacf12e73f84ae6e854b21cd27c0cd7da687c67da24763d6b1873"}}, "hash": "4e09ecb9f1290befcd9faa0b04734002896aa7231d243f44ad4f39d4ec2b342e", "text": "CONCLUSION The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 21 The discussion in the fourth section of this policy brief is based on a comprehensive review of the literature on regionalism and the role of regional organizations in the Global South.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c0fd644-975f-4d97-bfe0-11dcb4367645": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c0fd644-975f-4d97-bfe0-11dcb4367645", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the Provision of Global Public Goods: Ready for More Realism?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "44cc1d49671e571dcbf5acb96974870cc22d12203427896fec162aa8e73660ba"}, "3": {"node_id": "23b8d900-f061-451e-aa7f-486a47882c40", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-provision-global-public-goods-ready-more-realism", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be7119979be16c41fb84d95396808af7c438ba051fe7a44438a41e64c9dc363e"}}, "hash": "1cedebe4070b9777264c0f4fcd8e243a27a11fdff59f0e8057a715c01d9fd5d2", "text": "Included in this review have been contributions from multiple disciplines, including economics, political science, international relations, and peace and security studies, as well as contributions focusing from a regional perspective on particular GPG-related aspects, including, among others, the following: Alisjahbana, 2020; Alston et al., 1996; Acharya, 2008a; Acharya, 2008b; Acharya, 2008c; Acharya, 2015; Barbieri, 2019; Bergin et al., 2019; Berkofsky and Sciorati, 2021; B\u00f6rzel and Risse, 2016; B\u00f6rzel et al., 2016; Chirathivat et al., 2020; Chirathivat and Langhammer, 2020; Cohen and Fontaine, 2020; Cornell and Starr, 2018; Dembowski, 2018; Ergen\u00e7, 2021; Fawcett, 2019; Foot and Goh, 2019; Islam and Kieu, 2020; Jones et al., 2019; Kaul, 2020; Khor et al., 2020; Libman, 2019; Lissovolik, 2019; Lopes and Kararach, 2019; Mahbubani, 2013; Mahbubani, 2020; Meyer et al., 2019; Mirelli, 2018; Pelkmans, 2020; Pizarro, 1999; PSRP, 2021a; PSRP, 2021b; Rivera, 2017; S\u00f6derbaum, 2016; S\u00f6derbaum, 2018; Susantono and Park 2020; Wang and Song 2020.

This briefing covers the two main kinds of MPIs: global and national. The global MPI, first developed by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for in- clusion in the 2010 Human Development Report, receives annual updates. It presents an international measure of acute poverty covering simultaneous deprivations in 10 indicators related to health, education, and living standards. National MPIs are official permanent statistics1 that complement monetary poverty and inform public actions for national governments across Asia, Af- rica and Latin America. National MPIs use indicators that reflect the context and priorities of that country. This document reviews multidimensional poverty in the Asia and the Pacific Region us- ing the global MPI, which allows comparisons across countries. It then introduces the national MPIs in the region and examines how these identify the most vulnerable people, reveal poverty patterns within countries and over time, and enable policymak- ers to more effectively target resources and design policies. ABSTRACT 1 Official statistics are computed regularly, using national or internationally comparable survey data and updated by a designated institution, often the National Statistics Office. Poverty statistics, both monetary and multidimensional, should be permanent and independent. The custom is to update their design (poverty lines, indicators) every decade and, in the year of updating, provide both the old and new estimates for transparent comparability.

The microdata were cleaned, standardized, and produced for further analysis by Alkire, Kanagaratnam and Suppa (2020). The microdata harmo- nization formed part of the global MPI 2020 project that tracked changes over time in 80 countries (Alkire et al., 2020a). We are thankful to Usha Kanagaratnam and Nicolai Suppa, as well as Fanni Kovesdi, Corinne Mitchell, Monica Pinilla-Roncancio and Sophie Scharlin-Pettee for their tremendous work in preparing the data we analysed. We are grateful to Christian Oldiges and Ross Jennings for comments. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 5 The human development approach is holistic and freedom-based, reflecting the richness of human lives. Human development aims to expand all people\u2019s free- doms by directly enhancing human capabilities and creating conditions for decent and fulfilling lives.

The human development approach emerged out of an understanding that economic or monetary indica- tors do not sufficiently measure progress in human flour- ishing; they do not reflect the richness of people\u2019s lives and the diversity of their well-being. Drawing on Sen\u2019s capability approach, the objective became the expan- sion of human freedom and reduction of disadvantages of many kinds. In other words, development aims to im- prove and enlarge human capabilities, along with actual achieved levels of well-being (Deneulin, 2004, p.26).

This means that human development is inescapably multidimensional (Sen, 2000). Participation and empowerment. Participation serves as a key principle of the human development approach, as articulated by Mahbub ul Haq (Deneulin, 2004). Amartya Sen argues that people should be not seen as patients or beneficiaries of development, but as active agents, both as groups and individuals (Sen, 1985; Sen, 2001). The human development approach seeks to empower and support people as agents who determine their own life and the life of their communities (Deneulin, Shahani and International Development Research Centre, 2009). Participation and empowerment also have an instru- mental role in poverty reduction. Indeed, the \u201cMoving Out of Poverty Study\u201d interviewed persons who had exited poverty to ascertain what they perceived as the most important cause of their success: assistance from kinship networks; actions by government or nongov- ernmental organisations (NGOs), faith-based groups, or businesses; transferred or earned income, and so on. In fact, over three-quarters of the respondents (77 percent) responded that their exit from poverty primarily depended on their own initiative (Narayan et al., 2009). Policy. The human development approach is ultimately concerned with change \u2014 specifically, with expand- ing capabilities. Metrics contribute to this end. As this policy brief shows, the MPI provides a unique tool for expanding human development among the poor at the bottom of the distribution, who lack basic necessities. Policy analysts use the MPI not only to identify those in poverty, but to understand how they are poor (thus which deprivations to focus upon), and where they live (hence where to target interventions). For example, the global MPI 2020 is disaggregated by age group, for rural and urban areas and for 1,279 subnational regions, with other studies disaggregating by ethnicity and dis- ability status; all disaggregations include information on deprivation profiles by indicator. This extensive infor- mation platform allows for the design of integrated and multi-sectoral policies in budgeting, targeting, coordina- tion, monitoring and evaluation \u2014 providing the means to effectively address multidimensional poverty and expand human development. Alongside the global MPI, national MPIs also have extensive roles in policymaking. The 2010 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development Report succinctly stated the relationship between human development and multidimensional poverty: human development pro- poses a \u201csystematic examination of a wealth of infor- mation about how human beings in each society live and what substantive freedoms they enjoy\u201d (UNDP, 2010). Multidimensional poverty measurement, as rep- resented by the MPI, goes one step further: It provides a focused and specific examination of a rich informa- tion platform \u2014 one that demonstrates the who, how and where of deprivations in basic capabilities and freedoms. When stakeholders and policymakers2 take action to alleviate poverty, this decreases the MPI, em- powers the poor and raises the floor of basic capabili- ties distribution, directly reducing the most egregious part of overlapping inequalities.

Children under 5-years-old (60 months and younger) are considered undernourished if their z-score of either height-for-age (stunting) or weight-for-age (underweight) is below -2 standard deviations from the median of the reference population. Children aged 5\u201319 years (61\u2013228 months) are identified as deprived if their age-specific body mass index (BMI) cutoff is below -2 standard deviations. Adults older than 19 to 70 years (229\u2013840 months) are considered undernourished if their BMI is below 18.5 m/kg\u00b2. A child under age 18 has died in the household in the five-year period preceding the survey. The child mortality indicator of the global MPI is based on birth history data provided by mothers aged 15\u201349. In most surveys, men have provided information on the occurrence of child mortality, as well, but this lacks the date of birth and death of the child. Hence, the indicator is constructed solely from mothers. However, if data from the mother are missing, and if the male in the household reported no child mortality, then we identify no child mortality in the household. No eligible household member has completed six years of schooling. If all individuals in the household are in an age group where they should have formally completed six or more years of schooling, but none have this achievement, then the household is deprived. However, if any individuals aged 10 years and older reported six years or more of schooling, the household is not deprived.

Table 2 shows the global MPI covers 3.87 billion people in the APR, with 16.54 percent (more than 640 million people) identified as poor. In other words, nearly half of the developing world\u2019s poor people live in Asia. Four in five of these poor live in South Asia (530 million), despite its smaller population, while 110 million live in East Asia and the Pacific (EAP). tremendous diversity at the national level. In none of the 10 indicators do all South Asian countries have higher (or lower) censored headcount ratios, or per- centage contributions, than the East Asia and Pacific countries. We return to this in Figure 3. The incidence of multidimensional poverty varies across countries (Table 3). The Maldives (0.77 per- cent) and Thailand (0.79 percent) have the lowest prevalence of multidimensionally poor people in the region. The intensity of poverty in the Maldives (34.5 percent) is the lowest in the region, as well, but Thai- land\u2019s poor face a similar level of deprivations (39.1 percent) as do multidimensionally poor people in Sri Lanka or Mongolia (38.3 percent and 38.8 percent, respectively).

MEASURING THE EXTENT AND INTENSITY OF POVERTY According to the global MPI 2020, 1.3 billion people (22 percent of the population of the 107 countries measured by the Index) live in multidimensional poverty (see Box 1). The APR is home to 3.9 billion of the 5.9 billion measured, and to roughly half of the poor people. A poor person faces 42.5 percent of all deprivations measured in East Asia and the Pacific and 45.2 percent in South Asia. But the region has Pakistan experience the highest levels of intensity: on average, 51.7 percent of all deprivations. In Paki- stan, 38.3 percent of the population are MPI poor, almost 20 percentage points less than in Afghanistan and Papua New Guinea with 55.9 percent and 56.6 percent, respectively.3 Nevertheless, in numbers, Pakistan houses more than 81 million MPI-poor peo- ple \u2013 more than Afghanistan and Papua New Guinea combined. According to the most recent available data (2015-2016), the highest number of MPI poor people in the APR lived in India (377 million), amount- ing to 27.9 percent of its population.

On average, the MPI for the APR is 0.074, which is equivalent to Kiribati\u2019s MPI. This translates to a regional percentage of 16.5 percent MPI poor, and these experience on average 44.7 percent of all possible deprivations \u2013 just a little bit more than the intensity for Bangladesh. The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 10 THREE POVERTY LINES For the global MPI, a poverty cut-off of one-third deter- mines who is multidimensionally poor. This defines a person as poor if they are deprived in one-third (33.33 percent) of the 10 weighted indicators. Two additional poverty cut-offs are also applied in order to provide a \u2018gradient\u2019 across countries. A higher cut-off of 50 percent identifies people in \u2018severe\u2019 multidimensional poverty, experiencing half or more of weighted depri- vations. Moreover, anyone with a deprivation score of 20 to 33.33 percent of the 10 weighted indicators is categorized as \u2018vulnerable\u2019. People vulnerable to pov- erty currently have a lower deprivation profile than the MPI-poor people, but would become poor with one or two additional deprivations.

They make visible, for example, that while the MPI headcount ratio for Sri Lanka is only 2.92 percent and only 0.26 percent of the population experiences severe poverty, 14.33 percent of the population falls into the vulnerable category. In Kiribati, almost a third (30.22 percent) of the population experiences vulner- ability. More than half of Papua New Guinea\u2019s popula- tion is multidimensionally poor, with another quarter of the population (25.26 percent) vulnerable to poverty. Furthermore, a similar proportion of the population (25.79 percent) lives in severe poverty. Overall, while more than 640 million people experi- ence multidimensional poverty in the APR, a further 633.2 million fall into the \u2018vulnerable\u2019 category. South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific all have around 300 million people who experience vulnerability \u2013 in addi- tion to those identified as poor. However, while severe poverty has an incidence of just 1 percent in East Asia and the Pacific, it affects around 10 percent of peo- ple in South Asia. Overall, nearly one-third of all poor people in the APR region \u2013 32.8 percent and 208 million people \u2013 are severely multidimensional poor.

The MPI technology also allows a breakdown by indi- cator in order to assess how much each contributes to the overall poverty level. Figure 3 presents the indi- cator composition of MPI by country, with the coun- tries within each sub-region ranked from least poor to poorest. The region has a striking diversity of poverty patterns by indicator. Here, the MPI provides new in- formation that can shape policy responses. Nutritional data are, unfortunately, the most frequent missing indicator, unavailable for Afghanistan, Indone- sia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Viet Nam. Yet across APR countries with available nutritional data, this proves one of the strongest contributors to MPI poverty. This single indicator accounts for a con- tribution of 26 percent in East Asia and the Pacific and 25 percent in South Asia \u2013 a significant finding. Other indicators with high contributions include insufficient years of schooling, as well as deprivations in cooking fuel and housing among the living-standards indica- tors. Understanding the composition and experience of poverty helps one identify priority areas for policy action. As we see, these can vary between countries, despite similar levels of poverty.

As we have already seen, the global MPI sheds light on inequality by differentiating degrees and intensities of poverty. Additionally, disaggregation by region and age establishes a better understand- ing of existing inequalities. Subnational MPI data can help to uncover inequalities in poverty levels within countries. For example, Indonesia has a national pov- erty incidence of 3.37 percent. However, while almost all subnational regions have an incidence of poverty below 10 percent, (often even below 5 percent), two regions, East Nusa Tenggara and Papua, have multi- dimensional poverty rates of 16.12 percent and 17.93 percent respectively. Figure 4 shows the information-rich content of the global MPI and starkly illuminates the contrasts. Overall, 16.5 percent of people in the APR are poor, with a range from 0.77 percent in the Maldives to 56.63 percent in Papua New Guinea. But if we look at Lao PDR, the national MPI is 0.108 and 23.7 percent of people are poor \u2013 a bit above the APR average. Yet the spread within Lao PDR nearly mirrors that of the entire region. One could disaggregate the data further to show that the national average spanned regions from 2.0 to 48.8 percent poor.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24f94018-7e6f-464b-9e2c-6f8af68301da": {"__data__": {"id_": "24f94018-7e6f-464b-9e2c-6f8af68301da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/insights-policymaking-multidimensional-poverty-index", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Insights for Policymaking from the Multidimensional Poverty Index", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/insights-policymaking-multidimensional-poverty-index", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "010a47fb027e01cfb66744732aee4a1543ce684cdf52a332703e85853fbdf972"}, "2": {"node_id": "277d3026-55d5-4d27-bac9-fe40d5dd7945", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/insights-policymaking-multidimensional-poverty-index", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ed6cba6f26e24ea74652a7e9263218c081823c0a9cbede9174ea5ce2bc6bd01"}}, "hash": "3c4d674129653bf0aafe14b65f0c83864f806afd46a6680603fd0324a33ab227", "text": "Furthermore, the MPI itself represents the weighted sum of the deprivations poor people experi- ence, as shown by the coloured stripes in Figure 4.

The recent global MPI report highlighted that children (aged 0 to 17 years) make up half of all the multidimensionally poor (Alkire et al., 2020a). In the APR, children (aged 0 to 17 years) comprise only 29 percent of the population but account for 43 percent of the poor. This means that children are dispropor- tionately affected by poverty. In Nepal, for instance, children below the age of 10 years have the highest rate of multidimensional poverty compared to other age groups (10 years and older) (Government of Nepal, National Planning Commission and OPHI, 2018). More than a fifth of children in South Asia (22.7 percent) under the age of five also experience intrahousehold inequality in nutrition \u2014 meaning that some but not all children in the same household experience malnour- ishment (UNDP and OPHI, 2019a). Here as elsewhere, however, stark variations recur across the region. For example, in Pakistan, intrahousehold inequality affects over one-third of children under the age of five (UN- DP and OPHI, 2019a). In South Asia, 10.7 percent of school-aged girls are multidimensionally poor, but in Afghanistan, the rate goes up to 44.0 percent (Alkire, Ul Haq and Alim, 2019). Finally, the global MPI report also publishes a measure of inequality based on variance. It demonstrates that Pakistan has the highest level of inequality, followed by Afghanistan, even though Pakistan has a lower percentage of multidimensionally poor people. Whilst multidimensional poverty in, for example, Bangladesh affects one quarter of the population (and the MPI value is close to Pakistan), it has much more moderate levels of inequality. LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND: REDUCING POVERTY The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1 aims to end poverty in all its forms. In 2020, the global MPI report looked at the progress made in this regard. Information on changes over time is con- sidered here for 12 countries in the APR (Table 4). Within the APR, the poorer countries had the most rapid poverty reduction in absolute terms,4 Timor-Leste and Lao PDR reduced MPI the fastest, followed by Afghan- istan and India; the latter witnessed by far the largest reduction in the numbers of MPI poor. It also cut its MPI value by half in that decade, nationally and among children, with 271 million people moving out of poverty. In contrast to the years prior to 2006, India\u2019s poverty reduction between 2005-2006 and 2015-2016 had a \u2018pro-poor\u2019 character. That means that the poor- est states, caste groups, age groups and religious groups experienced the fastest absolute reduction of MPI. China and Indonesia came close to halving the MPI. Timor-Leste achieved the fastest absolute reduction in the APR, reducing their incidence of poverty from 69.6 percent in 2009-2010 to 46.9 per- cent in 2016. A second way to measure change examines poverty reduction relative to the starting point. This approach usually profiles the achievements of less-poor coun- tries.5 In relative terms, China and Indonesia led the way in poverty reduction, followed by Lao PDR, Thai- land and Bangladesh. China, for example, managed an annual relative reduction of over 19 percent, lifting more than 70 million people out of poverty in just four years. In Bangladesh, 19 million people moved out of poverty over only five years. Happily, the recent global MPI analysis demonstrated that multidimension- al poverty among children (aged 0-17) \u2014 the poorest group in Bangladesh \u2014 reduced fastest. Reductions in poverty per region also show a pro-poor trend. Pakistan reduced its poverty headcount by almost 4 million people, and Indonesia by almost 8 million. Even in less-populated countries, such as Nepal, almost 4 million people moved out of poverty between 2011 and 2016. In Indonesia, 8 million people moved out of pov- erty between 2013 and 2017, with reductions in each of the MPI indicators.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d828f4c9-6b58-45cf-9e98-4e82b1f46096": {"__data__": {"id_": "d828f4c9-6b58-45cf-9e98-4e82b1f46096", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/insights-policymaking-multidimensional-poverty-index", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Insights for Policymaking from the Multidimensional Poverty Index", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/insights-policymaking-multidimensional-poverty-index", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03c6c05449d2a5b890c7211a309560c918c8816ee75501079033111050f798d3"}, "2": {"node_id": "3c3d6c1e-343d-445c-8449-dd37422afdb7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/insights-policymaking-multidimensional-poverty-index", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f18c19d427f1c0800509041e1e10e7496066ca2e3dce16f9d94ff4301e0c5d37"}}, "hash": "4da2571e769e2e100fd00f3b4f7094a80b9c1434e7fed2252b162f25eaf11a17", "text": "In 2017, the great majority of In- donesia\u2019s multidimensionally poor people (77 percent) faced only between 33.3 and 39.9 percent of depri- vations.

Global MPI. The global MPI is a measure of acute poverty, produced by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) since 2010, and re- vised in 2018 to better align with the SDGs. Standing as a complement to the $1.90/day poverty measure and related monetary metrics, the global MPI and its linked information platform show acute deprivations in 10 core non-monetary deprivations (Box 1). Going beyond the $1.90/day measure, the global MPI offers extensively disaggregated data, for example by sub- national regions and rural and urban areas. Together with the $1.90/day monetary poverty measure, the global MPI provides international comparisons, iden- tifying patterns of poverty and progress made to- ward the SDGs. It supports the SDG 1 \u2018to end poverty in all its forms\u2019 because its component indicators pro- vide information on advancements or shortcomings related to SDGs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 11. The global MPI directly reflects the SDG emphasis on understanding interlinked deprivations and responding with integrat- ed policies. National MPI. In the APR, over a dozen countries have launched their own national MPI, or are in the process of designing one. A national MPI provides an official permanent statistic of multidimensional pov- erty that usually complements the national monetary poverty measure. Mexico (2009) pioneered a multi- dimensional poverty measure and Bhutan (2010) and Colombia (2011) released the first national MPIs using the Alkire-Foster methodology. The national MPIs have different dimensions and indi- cators, weights and cut-offs, thereby tailoring them to national definitions of poverty, datasets and priori- ties.

The dimension selection process often involves a variety of inputs: experts; documents, such as the national plan; international agreements, such as the SDGs; civil society; participatory exercises with poor communities, and so on. All these efforts aim to de- fine poverty in a manner that reflects the experienc- es of the nation\u2019s poor and that creates consensus around policy priorities. But all of them still use the Alkire-Foster method and have an overall national headline accompanied by a detailed and policy-rel- evant information platform. In this way, differences across countries become readily intelligible. More- over, the national MPI offers comparable data over time for the same country, providing an excellent tool for dynamic analysis. Table 5 summarises key similar- ities and differences between national MPIs and the global (or regional) MPIs.

In the APR, as noted above, over a dozen countries have equipped themselves with multidimensional poverty measure- ment as a complementary official national measure of poverty, or are in the process of designing it (Table 6). In the APR, Bhutan was the first to do so in 2010; a diverse cohort of countries followed, including Afghanistan, Malaysia, Nepal and Viet Nam (Table 6 profiles countries in the APR with a national MPI). This section provides a discussion of the construction, purpose and use of a national MPI as a measurement and policy tool. THE NATIONAL MPI AS A MEASUREMENT TOOL A national MPI aims to establish a permanent official non-monetary, multidimensional poverty index, one with which accurate information can guide policy over time and across changes of government or political party. One of the core features and advantages of na- tional MPIs is that ownership lies with national gov- ernments. The MPI technology offers flexibility, as the dimensions, indicators, poverty cut-offs and weights can be altered according to the specific context. The national MPIs are developed locally and tailored to the situation and values of the respective country. These factors make the development process of a national MPI a technical, political, and participatory one. Technical development processes The national MPI requires reliable and valid data. The availability of data nearly always constrains the choice of dimensions and indicators for a national MPI. While some countries use the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) or the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), other countries use national surveys (UNDP and OPHI, 2019b). For instance, Paki- stan chose the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement (PSLM) survey, as it provided addition- al information on the quality of education and had more frequent updates, while supplying the neces- sary data at the national, provincial and district level (Tiwari, 2019). In some cases, as, for example, in the Philippines, two datasets, the 2016 and 2017 Annual Poverty Indicator Survey (APIS) and Labor Force Sur- vey (LFS), were merged because they used the same enumeration units (UNDP and OPHI, 2019b). Furthermore, construction of a robust, replicable, and reliable measure requires participation by technical experts and statisticians. In the end, the quality of the data and the rigor of the analysis determine the credibility of the MPI estimations, and credibility is a key requirement for the MPI to become a successful measurement tool (UNDP and OPHI, 2019b).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea66ad09-35e7-403c-a093-1f383c5da9b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea66ad09-35e7-403c-a093-1f383c5da9b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/insights-policymaking-multidimensional-poverty-index", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Insights for Policymaking from the Multidimensional Poverty Index", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/insights-policymaking-multidimensional-poverty-index", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4bd06af1b10f653c2fab274ea1bdbdd421ec2d5a0ff6fbb9f8e3cc002c5ee2a0"}, "2": {"node_id": "179636de-e0c3-4deb-9c4c-c5e0610cb188", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/insights-policymaking-multidimensional-poverty-index", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03cda68e3ae7f162fdca3f9e99bc804fa34bd9eff4160e3a3b404be24f04d0dc"}}, "hash": "c31467df2c97247618a30d620e58ee19f0653074e5e5f69627a993589da05269", "text": "Political development processes The MPI development process often gains a political dimension, since the highest levels of government or other government institutions and stakeholders may need to endorse the national MPI in order to ensure effective implementation and concrete action.

In some instances, efforts to develop and commute a national MPI take place outside the government, as in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Indonesia. China\u2019s International Poverty Reduction Centre, together with OPHI, have written a case study showing internationally valid insights from China\u2019s multidimensional poverty reduction 2012-2020. Mongolia has also taken the first steps to develop its own national MPI. One of the earliest steps in this process is articu- lating the purpose of the MPI, as this clarifies the reasons for developing it. Critically, this stage must involve input from various stakeholders, sufficient information, and transparency (Box 2).6 Naturally, each of the normative exercises requires a complementary assessment of data availability. As the next section discusses, inputs from participatory exercises with poor communities may supplement expert consultations and may rightly attain a similar prominence. Participatory development processes In many countries, the development and selection processes took on a participatory approach involving multiple stakeholders, particularly those affected by multidimensional poverty. For example, in El Salvador and Panama, direct par- ticipatory work enhanced the validity of the national MPIs, both in structure and content (UNDP and OPHI, 2019b).7 Nepal\u2019s 2018 MPI report noted that prior par- 6 See UNDP and OPHI (2019b, p. 21) for a list of country\u2019s purposes. 7 For more information on El Salvador, please, see Moreno (2016).

Monetary poverty measures offer an important but incomplete picture. They do not reflect the joint portfolio of deprivations that many poor people face, nor can they identify those who face deprivations in key areas of their lives, such as education, hous- ing, or health. A study in Bhutan has demonstrated that the monetary-poor population does not always coincide with the multidimensionally poor. In 2012, a similar percentage of the Bhutan\u2019s population fell into income (12 percent) and multidimensional (12.6 percent) poverty. However, only 3.2 percent of the population was simultaneously income and multidi- mensionally poor. In 2017, that figure had fallen to 1 percent (UNDP and OPHI, 2019b). Introducing the MPI in Pakistan demonstrated that, with an incidence of 38.8 percent, multidimensional poverty is more com- mon than income-based poverty, with an incidence of 24.3 percent (Tiwari, 2019). Furthermore, monetary poverty measures do not fully capture the impact of public policy efforts focused on, for example, education, infrastructure and hous- ing (UNDP and OPHI, 2019b). Due to its multidimen- sional character and technology, the MPI serves as a tool to measure and capture improvements in various areas of people\u2019s lives. For this reason, countries in the APR, such as Afghanistan, Bhutan, Malaysia, Pa- kistan, the Philippines, Nepal, Thailand and Viet Nam, have adopted the MPI as an official poverty measure next to their official monetary measure.8 To recapitulate: a national MPI aims to represent a permanent official multidimensional poverty mea- sure; it calls for a design sustainable over time and across governments, and gains its credibility through a nonpartisan technical process and overall transpar- ency. The institutional set-up will depend on national political realities, but it calls for arrangements that ensure sufficient, continuously available capacity and budget.9 THE NATIONAL MPI AS A POLICY TOOL A national MPI can become a key tool for policy, as it can be adapted to the national values and specific contexts of poverty; it also supports crucial steps in poverty reduction efforts \u2014 namely identification and understanding, goal-setting and targeting, policy and resource planning and coordination, monitoring and accountability, and communication. Construction and ownership The process of constructing a national MPI can build ownership and legitimacy by drawing on key national documents and monitoring their priorities. Afghani- stan\u2019s MPI drew on the National Peace and Develop- ment Framework (2017-2021) and the National Citizen\u2019s Charter, as well as consultations. For this, Afghanistan added two additional dimensions, work and shocks, creating an MPI based on 18 indicators in five dimen- sions. While these dimensions are equally weighted, certain indicators within the dimensions received a higher weight due to their importance. One of these indicators is security, covering the vital aspect of per- sonal security from violence. Furthermore, Afghanistan created a gendered adult schooling indicator to illumi- nate gender disparities in education. In Afghanistan, the indicator with the highest deprivation level of all is \u2018Female Schooling,\u2019 with 48 percent of the population are poor and deprived in this indicator; in other words, the censored headcount ratio of female schooling is 48 percent (National Statistics and Information Author- ity, 2019). Other examples abound. The Philippines added the dimension of employment, including indicators on underemployment and working children, to reflect the importance of these issues in the country. Due to the centrality of agriculture and transportation, Bhutan\u2019s national MPI included indicators on road access, land and livestock. Similarly, Pakistan included an indicator on land and livestock and one on overcrowding under the living-standard dimension, as well as an indicator 8 While the MPI is, first and foremost, a measure to reflect non- monetary poverty, some countries, such as Malaysia, have incorporated income as one of the dimensions. 9 For more elaboration, see UNDP and OPHI (2019b, p.36).

Identification and goal setting Effective policymaking and implementation require, in the first instance, accurate identification and under- standing of the poor and their composition of poverty.

It reveals the complexity of simultaneous deprivations and how they contribute to the experi- ence of multidimensional poverty. This was one of the reasons why the Philippines intro- duced a national MPI in 2018 (UNDP and OPHI, 2019b). The Philippines trial MPI captures deprivations in the dimensions of education, health and nutrition, housing, water and sanitation, and employment, using 13 indi- cators. Deprivations in education contributed the most to poverty. Indeed, in 2017, five out of 10 poor families had at least one member aged 18 or above who had been unable to finish basic education (MPPN, 2021b). These findings rippled out to affect education policies. The MPI also contributes to results-based policy frameworks for poverty reduction. For example, in 2017, Nepal\u2019s SDG strategy document set the clear tar- get \u201cto reduce multi-dimensional poverty to 10 percent by 2030\u201d (Government of Nepal, National Planning Commission 2017, p.14). Bhutan\u2019s documents articulat- ed the aim to reduce the poverty incidence to below 10 percent by 2018 \u2013 a target it met in 2017. Individual and geographical targeting One prominent use of the MPI in the APR is identifying individuals, households, or groups for targeted inter- ventions. Targeting becomes particularly important with resource scarcity: when universal provision might not prove necessary, or targeting would offer more efficient and appropriate means of addressing various deprivations. Due to the detailed depiction of pover- ty that the MPI and its technology offer, this becomes relatively straightforward. Group or geographical targeting draws on disaggre- gation by groups (such as between urban and rural areas, subnational regions, gender, age groups, indig- enous groups and disability status). Disaggregation showed that in Nepal, every second person in the two poorest Provinces (2 and 6) faced multidimension- al poverty. This information crucially showed where resources needed to go. Malnutrition and insufficient years of schooling were the strongest contributors to multidimensional poverty and became recognised as priorities in the 2018 MPI report (Government of Nepal, National Planning Commission and OPHI, 2018). Viet Nam also used the MPI as a component of their precise targeting at the commune level. Individu- al targeting requires data collection from all eligible individuals and assessment of their poverty status. In Viet Nam, eligibility rests on registry data that include multidimensional poverty indicators along with some others. Such people are entitled to certain public benefits, such as free health care services, exemption from tuition fees in primary and secondary schooling, cash transfers for electricity use, or credit priority for housing, clean water, hygienic toilets and economic activities (Tiwari, 2019). Targeting vulnerable social groups is also essential. In 2018, Viet Nam presented a detailed analysis of mul- tidimensional poverty among various ethnic groups that revealed important differences in their experience of poverty. For example, only 6.4 percent of the Kinh majority faced multidimensional poverty, as opposed to 76 percent among the Hmong. Such information reveals inequalities that well-targeted policies can address. In Pakistan, the MPI 2004-2005 provided the first di- rectly disaggregated poverty data at the district level. \u201cThe pandemic also challenged all of us in positions of leadership around the globe to be better leaders. It forced us to rethink how we lead, to be more effective, more efficient leaders. It forced us to listen better and act quicker\u201d Ashraf Ghani, President of Afghanistan (Ghani, 2020) The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 20 This information received media attention and proved useful for policy targeting and for SDG localization. Its 12th Five Year Plan 2018-2023 identified less-devel- oped areas (67 districts of four provinces) on the basis of their multidimensional poverty incidence of more than 50 percent. Thus, the ability to see the composi- tion of poverty in a disaggregated manner can support more efficient policy design, policy coordination, targeting and allocation of resources.

These became instrumental in the implementation of the Rural Economy Advancement Program (REAP) and the Targeted Household Poverty Program (THPP) in 2014, as well as the National Rehabilitation Program for landless and destitute people, developed in order to stem the country\u2019s growing inequalities (Royal Gov- ernment of Bhutan, 2018). Budget allocation In one of its most frequent uses around the world, the MPI informs budget allocation across regions and sectors. It does not serve as a stand-alone input \u2013 population size, monetary poverty and universal priorities may also contribute to budget formulae. But, because the MPI provides a direct measure of key poli- cy priorities and often differs from monetary poverty, it is explicitly included in the budget allocation process. For example, in 2013 Bhutan started using the MPI for appropriate budget allocation to dzongkhags and gewogs, with a priority weight of 45 percent. Nepal\u2019s planning documents include the intention to use the MPI for targeting resources to those most in need, in order to accelerate reduction in poverty. This will include multisectoral policies, monitoring and evi- dence-based policy adjustment. Policy planning and coordination Effective reductions in multidimensional poverty will require integrated multisectoral policies. But coordi- nation often poses a challenge. In Latin America, the MPI regularly serves as a tool of coordination and man- agement; it may also become so in the APR. In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, coordina- tion efforts have gained even more importance and urgency. Effective and efficient policies and strong resilience after crises and shocks make cooperation between ministries, government levels and different stakeholders indispensable. The national MPI can serve to bring together and coordinate efforts among these institutions and other stakeholders. Beyond coordination and management, the MPI can in- form cross-cutting policies for outside institutions. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s project, Scoping Potential Economic Corridors in Pakistan, used the MPI esti- mates as a criterion in their effort to increase regional connectivity and trade among districts with high MPIs, through investment in trade and public-private part- nerships (Tiwari, 2019). Monitoring and accountability With regular data updating, the MPI can make visible any reduction of any deprivation, down to the level of the individual; all such reductions will decrease the MPI value. Thus, the MPI can become a powerful tool to monitor positive change. It can also serve as a tool for accountability in the case of less-evident changes. Overall, using the MPI to monitor poverty trends can also provide incentives for policymak- ers to leave no one behind and to reach the furthest behind first. The impact of these efforts will, in turn, become visible in changes to the official multidimen- sional poverty headline figure.

Pakistan\u2019s disaggregation of MPI estimates to a district level proved particularly useful in visualizing and evaluat- ing the changes made in each region: it found that the poorest region in the country had made the fastest progress in a decade\u2019s time (2004-2005 to 2014-2015). Bhutan\u2019s progress in reducing poverty from 12.7 to 5.2 percent within a mere five years (2012-2017) resulted from considerable improvements in access to water and sanitation (99 percent and 66 percent, respective- ly), clean energy for 99.9 percent of all households, and almost 100 percent school enrolment with gender parity at the secondary levels (Royal Government of Bhutan, 2018). Viet Nam determined that \u201cthe proportion of house- holds who are multidimensionally poor and deprived in each of the indicators [\u2026] decreased for almost all indicators\u201d(Figure 7) (Duc, 2019, p.7). For example, sanitation showed a decrease of more than 2 percent- age points in 2018 as compared to 2016 (Duc, 2019). Additionally, as shown in Figure 8, Viet Nam made considerable progress in those regions most affected by multidimensional poverty. For instance, the pover- ty headcount ratio in the central highlands dropped from 19.5 percent to 13.4 percent (Duc, 2019).10 While these are impressive accomplishments that deserve separate attention, the MPI also provides a figure to represent the overall improvements in multidimension- al poverty. Energised by this success, in 2020 Vietnam has moved to update the MPI not only annually, but quarterly. This kind of information can catapult the MPI into becoming a sensitive tool for management and for mid-course corrections. It becomes easier to see outcomes with measurement and tracking of changes. As a result, the MPI serves as a tool of accountability for government and citizens and to demonstrate the impact of government work. Communication with all actors The multidimensional poverty rate, or incidence of MPI, is an intuitive statistic, like the familiar monetary poverty rate, and often rightly appears as such in media communication: used to open a story, and then supplemented by information on the numbers of poor people, MPI value, intensity and the composition of poverty. But for important reasons, most governments use the MPI as the official national statistic. The MPI offers a headline figure that can announce the official level of multidimensional poverty, because it captures two kinds of change: changes in the poverty rate or incidence and changes among people who remain poor, but have become \u2018less poor\u2019 \u2013 have a lower deprivation score \u2013 than before. In this way, the MPI better reflects the SDG goal of leaving no one behind. It provides government officials, the media, and other stakeholders with an enhanced high-level view of the state of multidimensional poverty in their country. It also tends to move more rapidly than other metrics. For example, India halved its MPI between 2005-2006 and 2015-2016 but did not halve its incidence. The MPI information platform is a term that we use to describe the system of coherent and interlinked statis- tics about the MPI (incidence, intensity, indicator cen- sored headcount ratios and contributions to the MPI). MPI reports usually provide these at the national level and then disaggregate them by rural and urban areas, subnational regions, age cohorts and other groups. This means that the MPI provides a broadly available portfolio of crucial information for good communi- cation about poverty levels, trends, efforts and their impact. For example, the state-level media may focus on comparing their results to their immediately neigh- bouring states; a student may write a winning essay on MPI using their district-level figures; an international health NGO may decide to focus activities in the poor- est region with high health deprivations, and so on. To communicate the MPI to a plethora of potential actors, adopting countries often develop an outreach strategy for all government and civil society stakehold- ers, along with journalist resources or training (UNDP and OPHI 2019b).

(2018). The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 23 Fundamentally, the MPI cannot serve its purpose un- less officials at multiple levels of government under- stand it and use it in their work. So, for example, coun- tries such as Costa Rica, Chile and El Salvador, among others, briefed different political parties on multidi- mensional poverty in the run-up to elections. This can ensure that all understand, and use, the MPI to end poverty. At the same time, different political parties have room to formulate their own action plans and strategies on how to advance this overarching goal. As they articulate their plans on the campaign trail, they create more understanding and awareness of the MPI, which then becomes an important permanent tool of policy communication (UNDP and OPHI, 2019b). THE NATIONAL MPI AS AN SDG REPORTING TOOL SDG Reporting In many ways, multidimensional poverty has taken centre stage in national and international poverty and develop- ment efforts. That is as it should be. Yet it aligns tightly with a key goal of the SDGs, \u2018to leave no one behind,\u2019 and also with the first goal, SDG 1: \u2018to end poverty in all its forms.\u2019 In fact, the national MPI appears as indicator 1.2.2 in the SDGs. Since 2020, all countries with official MPIs in the APR have reported them in the global SDG database. Because of this alignment, one motivation for countries to develop a national MPI has been their commitment to re- port progress on the SDG indicators and to meet the SDGs by 2030. And not only is the national MPI a reporting tool, it is the only one of the 232 global-level SDG indicators that the country owns directly. Yet as the last section covered, reporting alone does not determine the MPI\u2019s success, but rather its use as a tool at different phases of the planning cycle. Still, at-a-glance views on how APR countries report on their MPI have their use, as well. In the APR, many countries report the national MPI in the global SDG database and use it in their Voluntary National Reviews to report their progress in accomplish- ing the SDGs (Table 7). Nepal offers one example (Gov- ernment of Nepal, National Planning Commission and OPHI, 2018; UNDP and OPHI, 2019b). Other countries, such as Pakistan, have also used the MPI for monitoring the SDG target 1.2. They mention that the MPI has the advantage of a clear headline figure that can present the overall progress, as well as more detailed analysis of the situation of the poor, one that reflects multiple deprivations and SDGs. The specific functions of the MPI, such as disaggregation and indicator breakdown, allow countries to showcase their respective efforts and improvements in the various dimensions, as well as de- fine clear focus areas and strategies for future actions. Multidimensional Poverty Peer Network (MPPN) In 2013, the rising application of multidimensional pov- erty indices within national contexts, and their unusual position of spanning statistical offices and policy actors, gave rise to the Multidimensional Poverty Peer Network (MPPN), a growing global community of 60 countries and 19 organizations. The MPPN holds annual meetings, active online calls and interchanges, and publishes the magazine Dimensions. It hosts high-profile events at the UN General Assembly with heads of states, ministers and heads of agencies, and at the UN Statistics Commission with Statistician Generals. The MPPN steering committee includes Bangladesh, China, Colombia and South Africa, as well as OPHI at the University of Oxford, which acts as its Secretariat. Ministers and senior officials from 14 APR countries take part in MPPN (Figure 8).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e093a04-fda1-4b37-a0ee-affd68565b51": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e093a04-fda1-4b37-a0ee-affd68565b51", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/insights-policymaking-multidimensional-poverty-index", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Insights for Policymaking from the Multidimensional Poverty Index", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/insights-policymaking-multidimensional-poverty-index", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d4f61970b0702dfe98bce47449be4f648ec1ba3d4770e7d7bc1ca47cb170c1a"}, "2": {"node_id": "4acab4dc-eb8f-4280-b931-67ec9c645281", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/insights-policymaking-multidimensional-poverty-index", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "894c2bb9900371f07d2967ec7066ff7fe76918737cc2f9fc3fa5b92b54d69165"}}, "hash": "87b8e1d3f6b55be97e7fd15095792d22c1c61b70e30e42b1c81abd562a8258b7", "text": "Ministers and senior officials from 14 APR countries take part in MPPN (Figure 8).

The bilingual MPPN magazine Dimensions, annual meetings and round-robin conference calls (in English and Spanish) enable further exchanges between early adopters and newcomers to multidimensional poverty measurement. Informally, the MPPN enables countries to access peer- to-peer technical, statistical and policy support, as well as input into the design and institutional arrangements for successful multidimensional poverty eradication (MPPN, 2020b). As the MPPN mission statement puts it: Through meetings, knowledge sharing and informal exchange, the MPPN supports policymakers in de- veloping more effective poverty eradication policies that are grounded in multidimensional measures of poverty. Its vision is a world in which poverty in all its forms is measured, tracked over time, and eventually eliminated (MPPN, 2021c). The work in the APR on multidimensional poverty is by no means new. But the use of new metrics to design integrated policies and to manage and mea- sure change remains in its initial phase. As the many analyses in this document have shown, countries in the APR have the potential to innovate quickly and skilfully using such metrics. The APR could become a field leader in truly ending acute and abject condi- tions while empowering impoverished persons and communities as agents and leaders. If such momen- tous improvement in human development occurs, it will serve both impacted nations and the entire world.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 5 Does the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic pro- vide lessons for furthering sustainable human devel- opment? Do any of these lessons derive from or apply in particular to the Asia-Pacific Region (APR)?1 Some initial reflections on these questions may now be possible, recognizing that, as Zhou Enlai is famously rumoured to have said about the French Revolution more than 150 years later, \u201cit is too early to tell\u201d (SCMP, n.d.). In this brief, we make some observations about the national, regional and international responses during the crisis, critically evaluate these efforts, and identify institutional gaps and weaknesses that should be remedied to increase preparedness and improve responses to future pandemics and crises. We also use a lens borrowed from English art critic John Berger (1972) to focus on \u2018ways of seeing\u2019 policy rather than on identifying specific policy lessons. One of the most elementary but also consequential observations about the pandemic is that its effects have varied enormously across countries. This obser- vation applies not only to how successfully countries have contained COVID-19 itself, but to how well they have avoided its damaging economic and social con- sequences. The measures governments have taken differ widely, as have the speed, effectiveness, and consequences of their implementation. The weight placed on distinct policy objectives, such as avoid- ance of COVID-19 deaths versus avoidance of eco- nomic contraction, has also varied across countries. Several countries have clearly done better in terms of some, perhaps all, major objectives, and this seems to be due to the specifics of their actions: not merely whether they took early, decisive or substantial action, but where and how they focused interventions. The best performing countries did better in terms of both health and economic outcomes and did not rely on untargeted, generalized lockdowns alone (Box 1). Of course, it is not possible to be certain that differenc- es in outcomes have only to do with policies, since biological and epidemiological features, such as the strains of the virus affecting a country, would also have been relevant.

The estimated regression coeffi- cient is negative for both cases and deaths (although not always statistically significant), suggesting that, on average, greater disease incidence corresponded with greater economic contraction. But the extent of the variation explained by the bivariate relationship was low. The adjusted-R-squared tells us that most of the variation in estimated growth does not reflect varia- tion in confirmed cases (85 percent unexplained) or in deaths (88 percent unexplained). There does not appear to have been a necessary econ- omy-health trade-off. The average relationship tells us that countries that better safeguarded health, as judged by confirmed COVID-19 cases and mortality, also gen- erally experienced smaller economic contractions. The estimated coefficient suggests that, on average, for each additional 10,000 cumulative cases per million, a bit more than half a percentage point of growth was given up. Similarly, for each additional 100 cumula- tive deaths per million, around 2 percentage points of growth was given up on average. No trade-off ap- peared in the average relationship between economic contraction and COVID-19 incidence (cases and deaths), since both tended to worsen together, to the extent that a relationship can be found at all. But these average re- lationships also mask the large variation around the av- erage. The low proportion of the variation explained by the bivariate relationship (the correlation between the two variables is only 0.14) tells us that the more import- ant factor was the variation in the extent of economic contraction among countries that experienced similar health consequences of the pandemic. A more complete model, capable of explaining a larger portion of the observed variation in economic out- comes, would have to introduce additional explana- tory variables. These might include, for instance, the specific form of the policies adopted, such as general lockdowns versus more targeted approaches or the extent of testing and contact tracing. One might also argue that alternative indicators could provide a more accurate picture of the health or economic consequenc- es experienced. For instance, to provide a more precise indicator of the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis in most countries, one might use the shortfall of the per capita income growth rate from trend growth rather than the unadjusted growth rate, that is, the extent of economic contraction. It seems unlikely, however, that introducing such nuances will overturn the overall con- clusion that much of the variation remains unexplained. As the regression results and Figure 3 and Figure 4 show, a weak or non-existent relationship between COVID-19 cases or deaths and contraction in nation- al income due to policies to address the pandem- ic appears in every region during 2020, with some evidence of a stronger relationship, that is, a greater economic contraction associated with more cases or deaths, in the APR than elsewhere. In other words, the magnitude of the regression coefficients describing this bivariate relationship and the proportion of the variation explained by the relationship appear slightly higher in the APR.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "841ea20c-2f15-4bd7-af88-952731635c56": {"__data__": {"id_": "841ea20c-2f15-4bd7-af88-952731635c56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/seven-lessons-development-policy-covid-19-pandemic", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Seven Lessons for Development Policy from the COVID-19 Pandemic", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/seven-lessons-development-policy-covid-19-pandemic", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f665b2a693d3f8bac241cc04b8536688c1b68b0ea25ded6867c5102cd9f2316a"}, "2": {"node_id": "e6f1e5e7-edcb-4c06-ab50-d0e2b23f54a9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/seven-lessons-development-policy-covid-19-pandemic", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8fa9c7c986c144681ac22e2e6c5d6c24d9c8f294e32b882e34b94b76857ff2e0"}}, "hash": "57cfaf44a857e6fe9573a254db6bc840737ec34a7a72e6708e1c0d8cdd2753ea", "text": "Figure 3: Regional cumulative COVID-19 cases per million vs. per capita GDP growth, 2020 Source: Author calculations based on WHO (2021); IMF (2020) 25% 0% -25% -50% Africa Europe Americas South-East Asia Eastern Mediterranean Western Pacific 25% 0% -25% -50% 100000 100000 100000 75000 75000 75000 50000 50000 50000 25000 25000 25000 0 0 0 The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06591364-ec3e-4d83-a54c-d7b063b5daab": {"__data__": {"id_": "06591364-ec3e-4d83-a54c-d7b063b5daab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/seven-lessons-development-policy-covid-19-pandemic", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Seven Lessons for Development Policy from the COVID-19 Pandemic", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/seven-lessons-development-policy-covid-19-pandemic", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88658184cd8e1aaeacc19e45c06da5a24da6126f3dd6564bf827fbb49107acbb"}, "3": {"node_id": "7d5badc5-cfd8-4f92-ae9d-ce491b42820e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/seven-lessons-development-policy-covid-19-pandemic", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a1a25b3b9dcde77c793824348d5a4a9a468c9334df499ad6e2ca9871ec41b92"}}, "hash": "be6b71b1e1164d4c3c58087492719ea0b1baa800f20490cccf17fae1e3974e44", "text": "8 There are marked regional differences in the impact of COVID-19 on morbidity and mortality, with very low rates of cases and deaths in East Asia compared with Europe and the Americas (Figure 3 and Figure 4).

Figure 5 shows cumulative total deaths using a more generally familiar classification of regions (Our World in Data, 2021). Asia had only 366,000 deaths out of 2.13 million world- wide, or 17.2 percent of the world total, as of 28 Janu- ary 2021, despite the region having nearly 60 percent of the world\u2019s population. Similarly, large variations appear in both confirmed cases and deaths per million among countries at similar income levels (Figure 6). Although inter-regional differences account for some of these differences, one can observe that they are siz- able among countries within the same region as well.

In particular, they do not seem to fully explain the relatively favourable performance of Asia. It is also not obvious how these differenc- es would explain the variation in confirmed cases, although some correlation between an older popu- lation and confirmed cases may arise if older people tend to have more serious symptoms and therefore undergo testing. While the proportion of the popula- tion over the age of 65 in Asia is about half of what it is in Europe and North America (9 percent compared to 17 and 19 percent, respectively), the ratio of COVID-19 cases and deaths per million in Asia appears much lower than this difference would explain: as of late Jan- uary 2021, Asia had around 370,000 deaths while Eu- 2 million 1.5 million 1 million 500,000 0 1,500 1,000 500 0 $1,000 $2,000 $5,000 $10,000 $20,000 $5,000 $100,000 Africa Oceania South America North America Europe Asia excl.

But buying time matters little if use is not made of it. China, despite earlier occurrence of the disease, used its period of stringent national lockdown to good effect, isolating the disease to pockets of outbreaks or eliminating it altogether. China implemented widespread testing, effective contact tracing and other measures to avoid and suppress subsequent outbreaks; it also enhanced treatment capacity (Xu et al., 2020). In contrast, the time gained by India does not appear to have been put to good use. When India relaxed its lockdowns, the trajectory of the disease returned to what might have been its expected pattern without such drastic action. COVID-19 eventually spread extensively in the country (Figure 8) in the second half of 2020, even prior to a second wave of the disease in 2021. In some APR countries, such as India, the early pan- demic response attached disproportionate weight to one policy instrument: the on-and-off application of generalized lockdowns. Other countries placed greater emphasis on more specific policy instruments, such as stringent testing, contact tracing, quarantining and uni- versal mask wearing, as in Taiwan (Province of China),3 Viet Nam4 and China, or intensive measures to protect- the elderly, as in Japan.5 Many made efforts to develop capacities rapidly where these did not already exist. Countries that used a broader range of policy instru- ments \u2013 some highly specialized and often deployed in a selective and targeted way \u2013 to achieve specific goals appeared to do better in managing the spread of the disease than those that applied a narrow range of in- struments in a very diffuse, untargeted, and nonstrate- gic way, specifically, society-wide lockdowns.

As scientific knowledge of the virus has expanded during the world\u2019s collective crash course in COVID-19, it has considerably altered initial understandings of effective policies, causing a movement away from, for example, cleaning surfaces and toward minimizing pro- longed respiratory contact (Nature, 2021). In addition, there has been growing recognition that specific en- vironments, such as poorly ventilated indoor spaces, favour viral transmission and a recognition that chil- dren and asymptomatic persons are likely to transmit the disease less (Bulfone et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020).

Even in cases of per- vasive uncertainty, rational planning requires taking note of the possible connections, however tentatively. Sound policymaking requires anticipating causal spillovers that affect the ability to achieve different goals. Some countries had prepared for the possibility of a pandemic by making plans and undertaking scenar- io-planning exercises. But one would be hard put to identify a single country in the world that had an inte- grated policymaking framework in place to respond to the pandemic, one that estimated the diverse benefits and costs of policies as an input to decision-making. For instance, scant attention went to the potential trade-off between preventing deaths arising from COVID-19 and increased deaths from other sources, such as under-nutrition, lack of access to health ser- vices, loss of employment and income and resulting distress, and other consequences. Such trade-offs do not appear to have informed emergency deci- sion-making in the early months of the pandemic, and it is not clear that previous preparedness plans had considered these connections either.8 In many cases, the knock-on effects of COVID-19 poli- cies, which proved significant, appeared to receive lit- tle or no attention in policymaking. Once again, India offers a useful cautionary tale, with a massive portion of the population returning to their natal homes due to a prospective loss of income caused by a national lockdown announced in early 2020 with only a few hours of notice.9 In other countries, national expert ad- visory panels formed in response to the crisis showed a narrow focus on COVID-19-related consequences, with few social or even medical scientists having rele- vant broader expertise involved. The United Kingdom offers one such case. Its widely publicized Scientif- ic Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) appears to have disproportionately favoured specialists in a few narrow scientific areas immediately relevant to COVID-19 containment (SAGE, 2021). As noted by Van Rens and Oswald (2020), \u201cIt may not be widely realized, for example, that SAGE [\u2026] had from the start, and apparently still has, no economists on it.\u201d This is merely one indication of a probable larger failure to integrate all relevant expertise. Even if experts can offer insights on trade-offs, societal decision-making remains outside their remit, since it requires judgments based on ethical values, attitudes to risk and other broader concerns. All interested per- sons should have the chance to participate, with elect- ed representatives ultimately taking due responsibility for the choices made. Politicians in various countries have instead emphasized that they would listen to the scientists, not recognizing that experts focused on a narrow domain could not offer insights into the broader societal questions involved. There is consider- able ambiguity as to whether the phrase, \u201clisten to the scientists\u201d refers to taking science into account, which is necessary, or if it means putting scientists in charge of policy, for which science alone does not provide adequate training or conceptual resources. Scientists themselves have shown understandable resistance to this latter idea (Ramakrishnan, 2020). The lack of an adequate integrated framework for poli- cymaking, even within the health domain, has strikingly emerged as a result of unanticipated, and in many cases still unaddressed, adverse health effects of COVID-19 policies. The national and global health consequences of phenomena, such as missed screenings for health risks and other forms of health surveillance, interrup- tions to immunization and other preventative health campaigns, lack of timely curative interventions, and the physical and mental health consequences of econom- ic and social disruptions, all require consideration in policymaking. There is, however, little evidence that pol- icymakers have addressed such considerations, even at later stages of the crisis (Reddy, 2020a).

Even those countries with the most extensive national strategic reserves for contingencies had inadequate supplies of many essential health commodities, such as person- al protective equipment \u2013 needs that disaster plan- ning might reasonably have anticipated.10 Institutional mechanisms for sharing and analysing information, funding research and development of vaccines and medicines, and otherwise rapidly developing a joint international response had to be improvised after the pandemic declaration because of insufficient prior attention. Such frameworks and practices remain se- verely inadequate even now, as discussed below. The failure to consider economic and social consequences in addition to health when designing the crisis re- sponse was an even greater institutional dereliction. Even if it seems of no benefit in ordinary times, pre- paredness is a cost worth undertaking. Precaution by its very nature does not allow for precision. It requires anticipating possibilities that can be only roughly known, even in the optimistic case that the unknowns are known unknowns. Preparedness entails investing in insurance against the worst outcomes. Such invest- ment has no immediate return and must be undertak- en without full knowledge of what measures will be necessary and how adequate they will prove. In the stocktaking that has followed the pandemic, some discuss preparedness in terms of a trade-off between short-run, or apparent, \u2018efficiency\u2019 versus \u2018resilience\u2019 (Golgeci et al., 2020). Whereas recent decades of out- sourcing and offshoring (globalization) prior to the pan- demic had seen much emphasis on increasing efficien- cy by, for example, streamlining supply chains, using just-in-time inventory and other methods, the pandem- ic has shown that efficiency narrowly conceived may come at the cost of fragility. Where countries wholly lacked their own production infrastructure, it proved difficult to fill the supply gaps that emerged as a result of the crisis. Robust systems, such as supply chains, require adequate provision for resisting or recover- ing from shocks, which in turn demands investment in strategic stockpiles, excess capacity and intentional redundancy of production systems. Adverse shocks can diminish the sustainability of a system, providing a further reason to invest in resilience. For instance, the economic consequences of the pandemic may well lead to unsustainable debt loads for many countries and businesses (United Nations, 2020). The comparatively strong performance of East Asian countries in the aftermath of COVID-19, as measured by lower per capita mortality, underlines that pre- paredness entails not merely governmental or insti- tutional capabilities, but also those of the population, which may in turn depend on prior experiences and societal investment in building understanding and acceptance of public health requirements. One conjec- ture, for instance, attributes the comparatively strong response of the East Asian countries to COVID-19 to prior experiences with severe acute respiratory syn- drome (SARS), avian influenza (bird flu) and other pan- demics, as well as previously established public health practices that enjoy widespread public compliance, such as social distancing and mask wearing, and in- stitutional capabilities, particularly testing and contact tracing (Khor and Heymann, 2020). 10 On the case of otherwise generally well-prepared Switzerland, see Robinet-Borgomano (2020). The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 14 Countries with social safety net institutions and infra- structure that could expand automatically to cushion the adverse social and economic effects of pandemic policy response, such as lost income and unemployment, did better in limiting those harms. In most such cases, the institutions and infrastructure was established under dif- ferent circumstances, but had the capacity to respond quickly and elastically to increases in need for social and economic protection; they were able to scale up rapidly at low incremental costs.11 The case for standing social safety nets and protection measures rests not on- ly on the need to support individuals who fall between the cracks in normal times, but on sustaining society as a whole, or sizeable sections of it, when the cracks become a yawning gulf in a time of crisis. Because the design of such standing social institutions and infrastructure does not necessarily target pan- demic preparedness or preparedness for emergencies as such (even if it has the effect of providing protection in such circumstances), we should distinguish this les- son from the preceding one on anticipation of crises.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a36b2a4-9cc3-4a1c-8e74-2ef724c6b228": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a36b2a4-9cc3-4a1c-8e74-2ef724c6b228", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/seven-lessons-development-policy-covid-19-pandemic", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Seven Lessons for Development Policy from the COVID-19 Pandemic", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/seven-lessons-development-policy-covid-19-pandemic", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f1390eb9bcddd08a270cc63327e702a185be24378050f697fa1743b54255f398"}, "2": {"node_id": "36110e40-8560-4295-b9f7-2d10f7548376", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/seven-lessons-development-policy-covid-19-pandemic", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e9d15c96955936210342df4855c0eebe2616e62362559ebb252c15621efded3"}}, "hash": "c6a3f9ade523f290d16e142e80272a423dd00caaf6de12b20e5815a1c20b5266", "text": "Standing safety nets and other relevant response infrastructure serve as a form of preparedness, but a special kind: They exist in ordinary times and play a function then too, but become especially important in the context of a crisis that increases", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2fdebab8-2bbb-4ba6-8ddb-47342dfccd98": {"__data__": {"id_": "2fdebab8-2bbb-4ba6-8ddb-47342dfccd98", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/seven-lessons-development-policy-covid-19-pandemic", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Seven Lessons for Development Policy from the COVID-19 Pandemic", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/seven-lessons-development-policy-covid-19-pandemic", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0e298ecad59997be34bbe6a37ad9b871ffc9b531f0b34b43ff81a83ea0bc8a4"}, "3": {"node_id": "41878b9d-452b-483b-bce5-58cd97dfa857", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/seven-lessons-development-policy-covid-19-pandemic", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ab0e42d9bd6a3990f330c31cb5fa26f65f6c50ee65e2e58727106e9b5687fb0"}}, "hash": "0ea7156c0dfa8a11a0afd2bc0a4f133e48726948c72835e7bd7cdc0665dd5838", "text": "the need for them. The contrast between societies that possess strong standing social infrastructure to meet growing needs in a crisis and those that do not has appeared most mark- edly among the developed countries. Some of these, such as Germany, which we discuss below in relation to its Kurzarbeit system12 of wage subsidies to encourage firms to maintain employment, possessed mechanisms for labour market intervention to sustain employment or diminish the costs of unemployment that many other countries, notably the United Kingdom and the United States, had to invent from scratch in response to the crisis. These latter countries introduced emergency measures, including loans for small businesses in return for refraining from job cuts, temporary extensions or expansions of unemployment insurance, temporary re- lief from payroll taxes and new temporary provisions for cash supports for individuals and businesses. Such measures often take time to establish and rely on data collected for other purposes to determine eli- gibility or to convey benefits, leading to gaps in social protection. Benefit levels are also often determined arbitrarily and prove inadequate. Although 215 econ- omies spent at least US$800 billion on around 1,400 social protection measures in the first three quarters of 2020, many were brief and offered very low amounts: \u201cRelative to pre-COVID levels, cash transfer benefits nearly doubled, and coverage grew by 240 percent, on average. Yet \u2018large scale\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean \u2018adequate\u2019 [\u2026] cash transfer programs lasted 3.3 months on aver- age, with a mere 7 percent of them being extended; 30 percent of programs were one-off payments; and only one-quarter reached more than one-third of the population. In low-income countries, spending per capita amounted to a scant average of $6 per capita\u201d (Gentilini, 2021). Ad-hoc measures cannot substitute for a standing social protection infrastructure, and the pandemic has highlighted which countries do not have one (Taylor, 2020; Goodman et al., 2020). At the same time, the pandemic has spurred the extension and reconstruction of safety nets now revealed as inade- quate, even in countries with relatively formal labour markets and widespread, if limited, social protection coverage (Kelly, 2020). The large informal labour mar- kets in many countries in Asia and elsewhere, espe- cially those without any social protection system, add a further challenge.13 LESSON 3: PROTECT IN ADVANCE WITH STANDING SAFETY NETS \u201cThe human development approach's insistence on open and participatory methods of public decision-making has great relevance here, as procedural legitimacy can also aid consequential efficacy. How best to combine expertise with democratic values remains an important unsolved problem\u201d 11 For a discussion of this feature of standing safety nets, see Reddy (2006). 12 Kurzarbeit is a social insurance program whereby \u201ccompanies hit by a downturn can send their workers home, or radically reduce their hours, and the state will replace a large part of their lost income\u201d (Financial Times, n.d.) 13 India\u2019s National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme, although well suited to reaching informal workers, appears to have been underfunded in the aftermath of Covid-19, especially as a result of the return of migrant workers to their places of origin, and could therefore have benefitted from further expansion (Deccan Herald, 2020). The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 15 The pandemic has underscored that protection and promotion of the public good is a societal as well as a governmental project. The efforts of private citizens and civil society must supplement those of govern- ments to ensure the rapid adoption of desired be- haviours. Additionally, success depends on citizens having motivation for taking the right actions and doing so in adequate numbers. Motivation, in turn, depends on public understanding and acceptance of the reasons provided for citizens to act in a particular way. As a consequence, the frequently used metaphor of \u2018war\u2019 for fighting a pandemic may not prove wholly appropriate (Sen, 2020). Of course, even effective mo- bilization for war depends on consent of the citizenry and on their accepting the arguments for it.

Such cooperation, if it can be upheld, such as by an enforce- able compact among agents, will serve the self-inter- est of all. But the cooperation sought by public health authorities can extend beyond such narrow self-in- terest, since it can encompass actions motivated by providing benefits for others. The dependence of public cooperation on shared understanding underscores in turn the importance of past experiences and trust in public authorities. As noted above, this may help to explain the relation between prior exposure to the SARS epidemic in East Asia and the region\u2019s apparently high levels of citizen compliance with public health messages. More gen- erally, a belief that public authorities speak truthfully and out of regard for the public interest may prove an important determinant of public cooperation. Several observations from the current crisis show that active public scepticism about the validity of public authori- ties\u2019 pronouncements has acted as a major obstacle to public cooperation, leading to active protests against government policies and disobedience of mandates in some countries. But such trust may in turn depend, especially in democratic contexts, on mechanisms for societal review of public health decisions and on the acceptance of legitimate debate about and scrutiny of the assumptions underlying policies. One of the great questions of our time concerns the role of experts in society. The legitimacy of their role in decisions has increasingly come under question from sections of the public and, indeed, from other experts (Babones, 2018; Easterly, 2014). The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the issue to the forefront, underlining the lack of willingness to defer to experts in many cases, especially where they may be perceived as having made decisions on the basis of non-transparent criteria and selective values (Sandel, 2014). The human devel- opment approach\u2019s insistence on open and participatory methods of public decision-making has great relevance here, as procedural legitimacy can also aid consequential efficacy. Such public decision-making requires consid- ering diverse values and understandings and weighing them on the basis of accepted collective procedures. So- cietal decision-making of this kind must be able to draw upon expertise while also keeping it in its appropriate place (Reddy, 1996). How best to combine expertise with democratic values, both in normal times and during an emergency, remains an important unsolved problem. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the difficulty and may spur thinking and innovation about this issue. LESSON 4: BUILD AND SUSTAIN TRUST 14 The early models of Ferguson et al (2020) assumed adherence to social distancing and other public health mandates non- pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) by a much smaller proportion of the population than has been reported to be complying with them. Whereas the models assumed one-half or two-thirds compliance for many interventions for the United States and United Kingdom, actual compliance has been more than 90 percent \u201call or most of the time\u201d (Kantor and Kantor 2020). 15 See the foundational article, \u201cRational fools\u201d by Amartya Sen (1977) and his subsequent contributions on this theme in Sen (1993). The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 16 An important lesson of the pandemic concerns the modifiability of apparent economic or social con- straints. For instance, the already severe financial con- straints perceived as existing in many countries were incrementally loosened in light of the massive fiscal requirements of responding to the pandemic, such as providing economic stimulus and targeted support to those affected by closures of businesses, loss of em- ployment and other direct and indirect effects. Nation- al and international institutions that have previously acted as guardians of economic and financial probity altered their stances as circumstances changed.

This, of course, does not mean overlooking constraints altogether. The appropriate level of fiscal expansion would reflect country-spe- cific factors, such as indebtedness (The World Bank, 2021). Unsurprisingly, given the circumstances and this newly permissive atmosphere, countries have shown considerable willingness to employ fiscal firepower in response to changing needs \u2013 although the extent of expansion has varied greatly across countries (IMF, 2021). The differences in the extent of the fiscal response to the crisis may play some role in explain- ing variations in the extent of GDP contraction across countries. The benefits of fiscal expansion would have been greater if accompanied by more supportive international measures. For instance, the temporary debt-payment moratorium for low-income countries, announced by the Group of 20 and supported by international financial institutions after the onset of the COVID-19 emergency in 2020, does not bene- fit the majority of countries (The World Bank, 2021a). The IMF\u2019s newly agreed special drawing rights (SDR) allocation as well as new measures under discussion, such as the development of a global minimum tax on corporate income, may help to address these limita- tions (Lawder, 2021; Strupczewski, 2021). Similarly, several factors have alleviated constraints in the health sector over time, including additional hospi- tal beds and equipment, such as ventilators; the devel- opment of new medical technologies, such as mRNA vaccines; the training of additional personnel devoted to certain tasks, such as contact tracing; the increased stock of social knowledge about disease transmission; and associated changes in social and personal be- haviours. Some of the constraints initially thought most likely to bind, such as supply of ventilators, have prov- en much less consequential than originally anticipated, in part because of increases in supply (Siddiqui, 2020). In other cases, constraints have appeared in unantici- pated areas, such as in scaling-up vaccine production rather than in discovering viable vaccine formulae and in hospital oxygen supplies (Iyer, 2021). Scaling-up may entail diverse requirements. For instance, the freeing of intellectual property rights for COVID-19 health com- modities through a waiver on the World Trade Organi- zation (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) waiver on Covid-19 health commodities, as proposed by India and South Africa, might aid in scaling-up vaccine supply in the current situation but will likely need to be accompanied by new production facilities and measures to ensure an adequate supply of physical inputs (Usher 2020; Acha- rya and Reddy, 2020). A diagnostic approach can help determine which constraints bind and must therefore be relaxed in order to further the policy objectives (Hausmann, Rodrik and Velasco, 2005). LESSON 5: QUESTION \u2018CONSTRAINTS\u2019 \u201cCooperation does not take place in a vacuum. It benefits from prior mapping of capabilities, experience in collaboration, and established relationships, protocols and institutions of cooperation. Cooperation is more likely to succeed when it is based on prior experience\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 17 Policies and interventions have the greatest chance of success when they allow for revision over time. This requires the presence of a framework for collecting the data that can inform such revisions. Developing a fruitful learning orientation in policymaking therefore requires forethought. For instance, determining which geographical areas or social groups to focus disease control efforts upon, inferring the probable activities and sites in which transmission takes place, and as- sessing whether specific policies appear to influence prevalence or transmission \u2013 all require collecting detailed information on disease status and on the be- haviours and interactions associated with the reported test results. As obvious as this seems, we have no ev- idence of such systematic data collection throughout the crisis, let alone collection in a format comparable and shareable across jurisdictions. Developing a data-collection framework that can sup- port decision-making requires identifying the relevant kinds of data and their likely application. Policymak- ers have not invested adequately in data for deci- sion-making in the current crisis. For example, stark confusion has remained about basic facts such as the rate of infection in the population, as opposed to formal cases or the proportion of the infected among those tested, due to the lack of adequate random or quasi-random testing protocols.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e6c6d74-387a-4232-981f-16d6147632cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e6c6d74-387a-4232-981f-16d6147632cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/seven-lessons-development-policy-covid-19-pandemic", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Seven Lessons for Development Policy from the COVID-19 Pandemic", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/seven-lessons-development-policy-covid-19-pandemic", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de883e8a1f471450dc517051b16f353bd0ef021ad7f2f5f7b1219918559db89c"}, "2": {"node_id": "5558029f-0517-4e55-a71b-ebfc0bae14df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/seven-lessons-development-policy-covid-19-pandemic", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "20c824a4dd5b5a510b24ac74c476c6c3c632f897e899c5290d9a73fba40be4f7"}}, "hash": "38a5432bc07e8447f679ecbd2b88c8484af661e6e20e554c02320e54563d57eb", "text": "In the absence of such information, decision-making has taken place with- out adequate information and beliefs have persisted without validation or correction by data.

Adaptive policymaking can benefit from flexibility in the choice of models, data gathering to update parameter and data sharing to better under- stand the sources of observed variation.16 Previous experiences from prior pandemics have informed some of the inferences (or guesses) about policies that might prove effective, but this knowledge has remained underutilized. For instance, previous experiences with SARS in 2003 and influenza A (H1N1 or swine flu) in 2009 showed the possibility of opening schools with social distancing, shortened and stag- gered school times, movement of teachers instead of students between classrooms, and other measures, but these prior experiences did not become widely known, even though they underpinned the strategies of jurisdictions that successfully avoided school clo- sures altogether, notably in Taiwan (Province of China) (Viner et al., 2020). Some rapid learning has taken place during the current crisis as scientific knowledge has evolved, such as on the settings that favour trans- mission or the efficacy of various epidemiological and economic measures, leading to policy adjustments, including greater freedom in relation to outdoor rec- reation and gatherings. Many more lessons, both from experience elsewhere in the current crisis and from prior experience, could have informed policy actions \u2013 but did not. We noted earlier that the German Kurzarbeit system has influenced policies adopted by other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Spain, to prevent crisis-induced joblessness and business closures. Similarly, the apparent early efficacy of the gener- alized lockdown applied in Wuhan and later in all of China may have informed decisions by policymakers elsewhere. They were also influenced by the almost singular attention given to this particular measure in quantitative modelling.17 On the other hand, many les- sons from successful East Asian experiences appear to have been neglected (Valli, 2020). Some common sense measures were very slowly adopted or not at all. For instance, the lack of adequate sick-leave provi- sions in certain countries has continued as an institu- tional factor propelling disease transmission in work- places, such as in Australia,18 Canada,19 and the United States.20 Difficulties that some jurisdictions experienced did not influence preparations and policies elsewhere; for example, oxygen shortages in Brazil in late 2020 did not act as a warning to others who later experienced shortages, such as India in April and May 2021 (BBC News, 2021; NPR, 2021). On the whole, it appears that institutions and governments require much more \u2018learn- ing to learn\u2019 so as to develop an effective response to the pandemic (Sabel and Reddy, 2007). LESSON 6: LEARN TO LEARN 16 On the importance of adaptive policymaking and the recognition of fundamental uncertainty in the pandemic, see Collier (2020). 17 In particular, from the widely cited Imperial College group (Ferguson et al., 2020). 18 See Kayarma, Burgess and Fitzgerald (2020). 19 See Sim (2021). 20 See Ackers (2021). The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 18 The crisis has demonstrated inadequacy of existing mechanisms of international cooperation. They have failed in the early identification and containment of the disease, in subsequent gathering, sharing and analysis of data and knowledge, in coordination of policies and responses, and so on. One illustration is the failure to develop a vaccine as a common project among nations, recognizing its nature as a global public good, substituting instead a widely decried \u2013 because both inefficient and inequitable \u2013 \u2018vaccine nationalism\u2019 that prioritizes domestic vaccine access at the expense of the rest of the world (Karp, 2020; Reddy and Acharya, 2020; Acharya and Reddy, 2021). Whether regional or global, what international coop- eration has taken place has mostly appeared too little and too late. Successful international cooperation aggregates efforts to bring about greater benefits for all, as the economic theory of public goods underlines (Samuelson, 1954). But it also benefits from a qualita- tive dimension: sharing diverse but different capaci- ties. Consider, for example, the collaboration between Oxford-AstraZeneca, developers of one of the current leading vaccines for COVID-19, and the Serum Institute of India, which possesses the largest vaccine-making capacity in the world, or the collaboration between BioNTech of Germany and its leading mRNA research and development capability with Pfizer of the United States with its sizable manufacturing capability (SII, 2021; Pfizer, 2020).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "670d52c4-3faf-4436-9e71-82b9dc1c5c47": {"__data__": {"id_": "670d52c4-3faf-4436-9e71-82b9dc1c5c47", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/seven-lessons-development-policy-covid-19-pandemic", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Seven Lessons for Development Policy from the COVID-19 Pandemic", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/seven-lessons-development-policy-covid-19-pandemic", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e8deb4df15fc6ad776d338fcb71eb6a276a30d7b7aab8170f456069a398adb8"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2aa9c56-f2bd-4db6-af42-70af65a743ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/seven-lessons-development-policy-covid-19-pandemic", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4dfe0c76927ce6884ea8c56845d2f8254951a907cc9f768a58e64bce8474596e"}}, "hash": "3da147748036310366778b8abf29846a4008a8dfbd2efb15b27dbe409c943ea9", "text": "These collaborations drew upon the distinct strengths of firms in different countries.

In other words, effective crisis cooperation requires learning to exercise the muscles of cooperation out- side of crises, too. The lack of a global mechanism for modifying the treatment of intellectual property rights during a global pandemic also highlights the failure of international cooperation. While the WHO recognizes a pandemic as a formal concept, and the WTO recognizes national health emergencies as circumstances in which govern- ments may undertake compulsory licensing and other \u2018flexibilities\u2019 no bridge exists to link the two (WTO, n.d.a). The proposal to suspend intellectual property rights relating to vital health commodities during the pandemic, advanced in 2020 by South Africa and India arose to fill this vacuum (Usher, 2020). The WTO could easily have evaluated arguments for such a suspen- sion in a potential pandemic and arriving at some gen- eral principles, even if specific conditions for applica- tion remained undefined. Not only was this not done prior to the pandemic, but there was no move to do this until late in the crisis, resulting in immense health, social and economic costs. The United Nations (UN) could have had a larger role in responding to the pandemic. The WHO, WTO and other specialized organizations were not well-posi- tioned to grasp the complementarities between areas of their respective competence. In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008, the 2009 Stiglitz Commission recommended creating a Global Econom- ic Coordination Council \u201cestablished at a level equiv- alent with the UN General Assembly and the Security Council\u2026[whose] mandate would be to assess devel- opments and provide leadership in addressing eco- nomic issues that require global action while taking in- to account social and ecological factors\u201d (Stiglitz et al., 2010). This recommendation offered a direct response to gaps in the surveillance and response capacities of the international economic governance system that the crisis had revealed: It has never been implement- ed. Although the United Nations undertook some steps, such as to strengthen the UN Development Sys- tem (Reddy, 2018), these fall short of those needed to provide early warning of, and responses to, threats of a global nature. The pandemic of 2020 calls for a similar systemic, and systematic, reappraisal. One can hope that the shock experienced by all may at least help to bring about the required coalescence among member states. It remains far too early to see all the lessons of the pandemic for development policy, but it is not too early to identify some ways of seeing policymaking that would have made a difference and that can do so in the future. This brief has outlined seven such ways of seeing; they include thinking about acting strate- gically in terms of acting specifically, anticipating and preparing for possible spillovers, protecting popula- tions from the possible impacts of a crisis in advance, regarding trust as a vital resource, viewing constraints as revisable, learning to learn and cooperating early, more and often.

This paper reviews how countries have responded to the public health and socio- economic crises during 2020, the first year of the pandemic, and identifies some key strengths and gaps in national and global institutions. First, the paper highlights the importance of institu- tional strengths in states and societies for the effective implemen- tation of basic public health strategies, namely, state capacity in public health infrastructure and social norms and competence in society to take action in pursuit of common interest. These two factors proved crucial in countries at all levels of income, including least-developed countries with little technological and financial capacity. These factors have not received much attention in the in- ternational policy response that has prioritized investments in vac- cines and material supplies. Second, the paper explores the un- equal effects of the pandemic caused by lockdown measures. The resulting global recession remains a priority concern and exposes a number of gaps in national and global governance, including the inadequate support for low- and lower-middle income countries, the lack of preparedness in protecting worker rights in the face of multiple crises, and the failure of the international institutions to provide vaccines as a global public good that is accessible to all.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 5 As the pandemic continues course into the second year, it is now widely recognized that it has worsened inequalities and exposed the longstanding fragilities and fractures in national and global governance (The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, 2021; IMF, 2020a; Oxfam, 2020b). The in- equities in access to healthcare, the toll of job losses falling on low-wage workers, the burden of unpaid care work falling on women and escalating gender violence have magnified already existing vulnerabili- ties and powerlessness among marginalized groups. Vaccine nationalism and the weakness of multilateral cooperation in arranging universal access to COVID-19 vaccinations expose the economic and political fault lines of the 21st Century global order. As Patel and Sridhar (2020) comment in The Lancet Regional Health, \u201cthe relative global success to con- trol the COVID-19 pandemic, keep their economies afloat and avoid longer, harsh lockdown measures are markedly skewed towards the Asia-Pacific region.\u201d This success depends largely on the effective imple- mentation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), combined with strong institutional capacity: primary health systems, effective leadership and active public engagement. This paper further highlights how these successes reflect the importance of institutional ca- pacity. The aim of this paper is to review the conse- quences of the pandemic and the national responses to the public health and socioeconomic crises in order to learn lessons for governing pandemics, now and in the future. The analysis uses the framework of human development and capability approach and considers the objectives of pandemic governance to extend beyond stopping the spread of the virus and address- es broader socioeconomic and human consequences (Sen, 1999).1 Our analysis finds that, while many countries of the regions have had relative success in containing the epidemic outbreak so far, their strategies raise ques- tions about equity, participation and human rights issues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a9b0423-178c-4e4e-8af2-4f9a414c0e7d": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a9b0423-178c-4e4e-8af2-4f9a414c0e7d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pandemic-governance-and-human-development-early-lessons-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pandemic Governance and Human Development: Early Lessons from Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pandemic-governance-and-human-development-early-lessons-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c014a29f80d8736df2852460bcef8d48a9155222a134093dfe6132c090fc630"}, "2": {"node_id": "2dcdba06-b0e9-44ec-bedd-fb538a3e1050", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pandemic-governance-and-human-development-early-lessons-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec3b7bbd0f36d68adb64b5e0cd984182afea033f55697521bfebc5464cb79217"}}, "hash": "89c283d85e5b760811ae0d15e2d05abbf194c5e4bb917b67189cc39ff554c6d3", "text": "Moreover, many of the low- and middle-income countries in the region have felt some of the stron- gest effects from the global recession.

The first section reviews the impact and response of countries in responding to the public health emergency and the global recession. The second section discusses selected policy priorities for governance, focusing on national public health capacity, access to global public goods and protection of workers rights. As of writing this paper (Spring 2021), the pandem- ic and the global recession continue their uncertain paths, creating new threats. The paper represents reflections on the year 2020 at this particular point of time, based on the literature that has emerged in academic publications, media and reports from civil society and international organizations. INTRODUCTION 1 Following Amartya Sen (1999), capabilities here means the ability of individuals to be and do in life according to their aspirations. This is a very different meaning of the term than, for example, Ed Yong (2020) and others who refer to capability as the ability to make use of capacity, including physical infrastructure or financial capital. \u201cAlthough the outbreak of COVID-19 first emerged in the Asia-Pacific Region (APR), many of its countries successfully stemmed outbreaks and kept cases at low levels; morbidity and mortality rates have remained relatively low in comparison with international trends\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 6 Epidemics and economic shocks inevitably place a disproportionate toll on poor and vulnerable people and countries (Farmer, 1996). The COVID-19 pandemic has had a particularly devastating combination of ef- fects, cumulating through three pathways: the spread of COVID-19; the lockdown and other measures to contain the virus; and the economic recession it has engendered. These have different effects on people, and each tends to widen inequalities. First, the epidemic has a direct effect on people's health, but this does not depend on biology alone but on the conditions of life and work \u2013 that is, on the social determinants of health. Inadequate access to healthcare can lead to comorbidities that contribute to severe illness or death from COVID-19. Cramped and poorly ventilated living and work spaces, as well as occupational patterns, disproportionately expose low- wage workers, migrants and informal sector workers to workplace contagion. Additonally, the less bargain- ing power workers have, the less their capacity to demand appropriate safety measures, such as spaced workstations, personal protective equipment, or san- itary facilities. Evidence from across the world shows disproportionate numbers of low-income and minority groups dying and suffering from the pandemic (Pires, Carvalho and Rawet, 2020; Pires et al., 2020). Second, the measures adopted to contain the virus have complex socioeconomic consequences. Work- place lockdowns and school closures in particular im- pact households differently and prove easier to manage for people in white-collar occupations, spacious living conditions and access to services. There are knock-on effects for poor households, such as the loss of access to school meals for children, estimated to put 300 mil- lion children at risk (Cash and Patel, 2020). School clo- sures and other measures have undermined children's education and have led to huge increases in unpaid domestic and other care work (UN Women, 2021). These socioeconomic effects are highly gendered. The burden of care work falls disproportionately on women, leading to reduction in female labour force participation and further widening gender inequalities. The lockdown has also further restricted the mobility of women and has often left them locked in with abu- sive partners. Strikingly, the pandemic has witnessed both an exponential rise in domestic violence and a marked deterioration of women\u2019s mental and physical health (UN Women, 2020b). Third, economic recessions lead to widespread un- employment, loss of income and loss of livelihoods. The pandemic has induced a global demand contrac- tion, affecting a broad range of sectors and projected to shrink global trade and investment flows (UNCTAD, 2020). Analyses to date project that these effects will prove more severe for low-income households and for low- and middle-income countries (UNCTAD, 2020). The latter, particularly least-developed countries (LDCs), will likely find recovery more difficult (UNCTAD, 2020). The global recession is projected to push 88 to 115 million people into extreme poverty (The World Bank, 2020a). This recession also has the potential to induce a longer term restructuring of businesses, industries and the global economy (UNCTAD, 2020).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b570bfd-d488-45fe-96a1-e28e2ad0cc42": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b570bfd-d488-45fe-96a1-e28e2ad0cc42", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pandemic-governance-and-human-development-early-lessons-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pandemic Governance and Human Development: Early Lessons from Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pandemic-governance-and-human-development-early-lessons-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5a13a291cee29b1eb6a3e04af25e97dfc999d8d99d324dcb671c74c83e24f568"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f78cad5-cd18-4803-b32f-159c46e36d11", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pandemic-governance-and-human-development-early-lessons-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a1ea9bffec90323f2e99d390e835431698fcdb50d3b7ce2316320ce6ff6857e"}}, "hash": "2cc36cb403afa732b02b30ba992d38d5be4a268ced7797ecd745df0958a93e03", "text": "Restructuring, too, has also historically tended to put stress on low-wage workers and on low-income countries without the abili- ty to adapt to new opportunities (Stiglitz, 2020).

It is not their technological prowess and financial resources. The geography of this pandemic, with epicenters located in Europe and North America, challenges the commonly held assumption that epi- demic diseases flourish in low-income countries that do not have the capacity to control them. Global me- dia have singled out several Asian countries, such as the Republic of Korea, Taiwan (Province of China), Viet Nam and Singapore, as 'exemplars' (along with coun- tries in other regions, such as New Zealand, Australia and Finland) in having limited the outbreak. But many other countries in the region, including LDCs, such as Bhutan, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR) and Cambodia, have also managed to keep incidence low; Table 1 shows the list of 10 countries with the lowest case and death rates, while the full list of 36 countries appears in Appendix 1.

This stands in contrast to the priorities that countries in Europe and North America placed on treatment infrastructure, such as ventilators and inten- sive care unit (ICU) beds, strict lockdowns of social and economic activities, and investments in vaccines. However, there is no single playbook, and country strat- egies differ considerably. Comprehensive lockdown measures were imposed in China, but not in Singapore, the Republic of Korea or Japan. Enforcement of NPIs entailed different measures, such as the use of technol- ogy, and methods, ranging from persuasion to fines or imprisonment. Massive expansion of testing has been identified as a key to success in Cambodia and the Re- public of Korea, but had limited use elsewhere, as in Ja- pan, Thailand and Viet Nam (Nit et al., 2021; Kim, 2020). Most began vigorous contact tracing with the first identified cases, but with substantial variation in meth- ods: China, Singapore and the Republic of Korea made extensive use of mobile phone apps, while Japan and Viet Nam relied on manual means. Finally, one other feature distinguished a strategy common to many Asian countries but less used in Europe and North America: a more proactive approach to quarantine support, iso- lating asymptomatic or mild positive cases in dedicated treatment facilities, rather than leaving all to quarantine at home without supervision or treatment (Erkhembayar et al., 2020; Kim, 2020). RAPID, EARLY AND PREEMPTIVE ACTION In many countries, health authorities began to prepare for an eventual contagion upon learning about the ap- pearance of a novel coronavirus in Wuhan in Decem- ber 2020. For example, Mongolia initiated measures, such as travel restrictions, school closures and an ag- gressive public awareness campaign, in early January, before WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2021 (Erkhembayar et al., 2020). In the Republic of Ko- rea, only nine days after identifying its first case in late January, the Korean Centres for Disease Control (KD- CC) set up 1,339 call centers to provide public informa- tion and to collect case data; the KDCC also coordi- nated with executives of pharmaceutical companies to scale up production of diagnostic test kits (Kim, 2020). According to public administration scholar Pan Suk Kim (2020, p.1), \u201ceven after its early start in addressing the pandemic, the country placed a premium on work- ing quickly.\u201d Governments in Cambodia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan (Province of China), the Republic of Korea, Viet Nam and elsewhere also took prompt action, introducing measures in late January or Febru- ary. Most opted to mobilize an emergency response \u2013 setting up response committees at the highest political levels, adopting a 'whole of government' approach and including relevant private-sector actors and scientific experts (Erkhembayar et al., 2020). In contrast, most European and North American countries responded to the outbreak once it happened, rather than interven- ing pre-emptively (Erkhembayar et al., 2020; An and Tang, 2020; Han, et al. 2020). These prompt responses reflect the capacity of gov- ernments to make decisive choices, particularly ones involving the coordination of multiple governmental sec- tors and informed by expert scientific advice. Experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan (Province of China) and Viet Nam, and with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in Malaysia and the Republic of Korea, no doubt enhanced pandemic preparedness in these countries (Han, et al. 2020; An and Tang, 2020; Erkhembayer, et al., 2020). However, other countries hit by SARS, MERS or influenza A H1N1 did not respond so promptly.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "59c44dc0-4971-4636-8413-fff30016e305": {"__data__": {"id_": "59c44dc0-4971-4636-8413-fff30016e305", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pandemic-governance-and-human-development-early-lessons-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pandemic Governance and Human Development: Early Lessons from Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pandemic-governance-and-human-development-early-lessons-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3e7528426a711aeb9357f9c896c6cd703cb3db05f6e3b3d226136549b666839e"}, "2": {"node_id": "160ecebe-3ae7-4fca-bc1a-6570bfec299b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pandemic-governance-and-human-development-early-lessons-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a0a5c7c8904753d7fe496281346aea19f1acbde7b3e60becb5436582bf2ca2bb"}}, "hash": "24ec5de8279b4f18f8b2af45c72af028a2d32847466f6b1b5086ab40cf5e4734", "text": "The significant difference is that the prepared countries had listened to repeated alerts in recent decades from the WHO and others about the potential threat of a novel disease that would spiral into a pandemic.

Compliance cannot depend entirely on punitive enforcement, but calls for a public buy-in about the need to address the public health crisis, and about the effectiveness of social distancing, mask wearing, personal hygiene, and compliance with testing, tracing and isolation. Widespread and consistent mask wearing \u2013 evident to casual observers and shown in global surveys \u2013 has marked the response of many countries in Asia-Pacif- ic (Chang et al., 2020). Observers often attribute this to culture, as the practice had met some resistance in other parts of the world. Indeed, this is a longstanding practice in parts of the region, but the cultural expla- nation detracts from a recognition of other key factors: the importance of public information, messaging from community and political leaders, and public educa- tion in creating new norms and reinforcing old ones for public health. Cultural practices shift. For exam- ple, Mongolia had no history of wearing masks, but adopted them without public resistance as a result of vigorous public information campaigns (Erkhembayar et al., 2020). In both the Ebola and HIV/AIDS crises, public information and messaging from community and political leaders and public health experts played a major role in shifting entrenched cultural practices and underscored the importance of public information. Commentators have identified trust \u2013 in government, scientists, institutions and communities \u2013 as a critical factor in the pandemic response; the Independent Pan- el on Pandemic Response (2021, p.24) concludes that a \u201ctrust deficit also fuelled the infodemic and set up a vi- cious cycle of disinformation and inadequate response.\u201d Community engagement, however, does not only rely on compliance with government policy, or trust in gov- ernment; it also depends on the agency of people and the social norms that give value to individuals taking action for public health. These norms may well derive from an education in history and from public debate on the importance of personal hygiene as an essential ele- ment of public health (Watanabe, 2021). These common elements of response combine a reliance on the traditional methods of infectious-dis- ease control with institutional strengths. Here the term 'institutions' is defined as \u201chumanly devised constraints that structure political, economic institu- tions,\u201d encompassing organizational structures and rules of behaviour, both formal and informal (North, 1990). Implementing these measures costs little and does not require massive investment in material re- sources or new technologies. But doing so requires two types of institutional strengths: state capacity in the social infrastructure of public health, including leadership, know-how, human resources, organiza- tion, and capacity in society, including values regard- ing the importance of public health, social norms of behaviour, and the ability to mobilize collective action for a shared goal, what Ibrahim (2011) refers to as \u201ccol- lective capabilities\u201d and Stewart (2013) terms \u201csocial competencies\u201d. However, as noted above, the objective of pandemic governance in the human development perspective goes beyond simply containing the virus. The past year has seen less evidence of policy attention given to equity as a priority objective, or attention to the social determinants of health. Containing the spread requires special attention to marginalized populations with particular exposure to risks. For example, in Sin- gapore, the vast majority of positive cases (54,000 out of 58,000) have taken place in the migrant community, revealing stark inequalities and the poor conditions of their housing. When an outbreak occurred in dormi- tories for migrant workers, 47 percent tested positive (Ministry of Health, 2020). Despite a prompt govern- ment response, little policy attention seems to have gone into the disproportional risk of COVID-19 among vulnerable population groups in Singapore. As pan- demic governance seeks to go beyond containment, it will need to broaden and add to these capacities, the better to ensure equity and respect for human rights. UNEVEN CONSEQUENCES OF LOCKDOWNS AND OTHER MEASURES While containment measures, such as lockdowns, stem the spread of the virus, they come with a multitude of socioeconomic costs and raise concerns about equity, gender disparities and human rights. These costs will likely weigh most heavily on low- and middle-income \u201cA public-health emergency requires political leadership in crafting a policy response and public-health infrastructure to implement public interventions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb74ae2f-ec7e-42dc-aa58-7f5ff3052390": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb74ae2f-ec7e-42dc-aa58-7f5ff3052390", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pandemic-governance-and-human-development-early-lessons-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pandemic Governance and Human Development: Early Lessons from Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pandemic-governance-and-human-development-early-lessons-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d179fe27c22430ce51c1292ba3f4d0f9e5f1ae394daf4ad383c85b8cbeababd"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae9490de-c990-4c83-83fa-3d3a005536b7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pandemic-governance-and-human-development-early-lessons-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f5802e26e95a7ffc433be74ae07fd4a47cdbafafd59dfd11d0c65812096ff806"}}, "hash": "af23c2cc9e7e2dfb3a971dce406775300d46e954daab3ed776c5631f8453ed62", "text": "It also needs social consensus and norms\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 11 countries with widespread poverty, weak social safety nets and large informal sectors.

DISPROPORTIONATE INCOME EFFECTS OF LOCKDOWNS ON THE MARGINALIZED Lockdown-induced job and livelihood losses dispro- portionately affect those whose work cannot move online. For people living at the edge of subsistence on daily wages, this becomes nothing short of catastroph- ic. Food insecurity and homelessness are on the rise. Migrant workers and women, as well as workers with precarious employment arrangements and informal sector subcontractors, are particularly vulnerable to layoffs. In India, the lockdown that shut down transport systems and overnight workplaces led to a veritable humanitarian crisis, where millions of migrant workers lost their jobs and had to walk home to their villages. Border closures in Myanmar, Nepal, Singapore and elsewhere stranded migrants, unable to repatriate (IHRB, 2020; Narayan, 2020). STATE-CITIZEN RELATIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES IN IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT The implementation and enforcement of social dis- tancing rules requires a social contract between the citizen and state based on human rights principles. Countries in the APR have a wide-ranging experience to date in this respect. Some have taken a proactive- ly participatory approach, actively communicating government policy through information meetings and parliamentary debate, ensuring transparency. As noted above, this has worked well in achieving high levels of compliance on a voluntary basis without in- troducing punitive measures. Several countries have released thousands of prisoners in a public health and humanitarian move. On the other hand, other coun- tries have used heavy-handed and inhumane meth- ods for enforcement, such as mass beatings, huge fines, or imprisonment, raising widespread concern (Narayan, 2020; ICNL, n.d.). Many countries have de- clared a state of emergency that gives governments new powers to restrict movements and gatherings for public health. But these powers also open the way for the state to exercise greater restrictions for political purposes, for example, to detain political opponents on the pretext of quarantine, crack down on journalists on the grounds of misinformation about COVID-19 and broaden surveillance of citizens through smartphone apps (ICNL, n.d.). GENDER INEQUALITY UN Women's rapid assessment surveys in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sa- moa and Thailand document a general increase in un- paid domestic and care work, although gender norms seem to have changed somewhat since the pandemic began and men have become more likely to share in the domestic work. Combined with the impact of the global recession, this has led to a disproportionate decline in global female employment (5 percent) com- pared with male employment (3.9 percent) (ILO, 2021). UNDERMINING OTHER HEALTH PRIORITIES The pandemic is not the only public health crisis. While COVID-19 has become a leading cause of death in countries with high mortality rates, WHO estimates that for 2020, COVID-19 would stand in sixth place globally among all causes. In low- and middle-income countries, it would rank further down the list. The lockdown severely restricted access to healthcare for non-COVID conditions and primary care. In India, data for March 2020 compared to March 2019 show a dras- tic reduction in the use of health services because of the closing of public transport; usage declines include sharp falls in childhood vaccination (69 percent), insti- tutionalized births (21 percent) and clinical attendance for acute cardiac events (50 percent) (Cash and Patel, 2020). The pandemic has also had a significant impact \u201cAt the national level, pandemic governance calls for more debate on the design of policies and processes in order to ensure equity and respect for human rights\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 12 in reprioritizing health system resources, including personnel, supplies, efforts and finance.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSION The global economic downturn will have a wider im- pact than the Great Recession that followed the 2008- 2009 financial crisis, shrinking global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 by an estimated 4.4 percent and global trade by 10.4 percent. For low- and mid- dle-income countries (LMICs) of the APR, the Interna- tional Monetary Fund (IMF) projects output growth in 2020 for emerging and developing Asia at -1.7 percent. However, the rate varies greatly by country, with China estimated to show positive growth of 1.9 percent and India to contract by -10.3 percent while the five largest Southeast Asian economies (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand) contract by -3.4 percent (IMF, 2020b). Although the high-income Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Develop- ment (OECD) countries have seen less severe con- tractions in terms of aggregate GDP, as noted above, LMICs and, particularly, LDCs will find it more difficult to recover from the recession and protect the vulnera- ble. Moreover, in the longer term, the recession expos- es the vulnerability of countries in their dependence on the global economy. However well a country con- trols COVID-19 within its borders, it will struggle with the recession induced by demand contraction in large economies. This will prove a particular challenge for Asia-Pacific LMICs and exposes them to the risks of a development strategy dependent on low-wage labour in global value chains (GVCs). As elsewhere, within-country inequalities are ex- pected to worsen in the region, reflecting existing structures of employment, conditions of life, access to resources and opportunities as documented in multi- ple reports (IMF, 2020b; ASEAN, 2020; Oxfam, 2020b; Oxfam India, 2021). In 2020, poverty increased by an estimated 4.41 million people in East Asia and 23.28 million in South Asia \u2013 reversing gains made in the past three decades (UNCTAD, 2020). LMICs in the region adopted fiscal stimulus packages, totaling US$1.8 trillion or 7 percent of GDP between March and September 2020; many of these include unprecedented social protection measures that have introduced systemic changes to existing arrangements (ESCAP, 2020; ASEAN, 2020). However, this stimu- lus pales in comparison to the size of the response in high-income countries, estimated at 20 percent of GDP. In LMICs, the scale and composition vary by country \u2013 for example, from 13 percent of GDP in Thailand to 10 percent of GDP in Mongolia and 1 percent or less in Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Lao PDR, averaging only 1.4 percent of GDP for the region's LDCs (ESCAP, 2020). Critics have raised concerns about the inadequate size of these packages and their lack of attention to human development priorities, such as the expansion of cash transfers, wage subsidies, unemployment benefits, health and care services, small-enterprise and informal sector support and environmental impact controls (Ox- fam, 2020a). Here yet again, these responses expose the existing gaps. Countries with least means will likely find economic recovery more challenging; countries with high debt burdens may have limited scope for financing and could well face fiscal and debt crises. Loans from the IMF and multilateral development banks have played a major role in financing the packages, but overall bilateral official development assistance (ODA) declined in 2020 (ESCAP, 2020). The most powerless and vulnerable face the highest risk of devastation; for example, worker support benefits omit low-wage, \u201cThe vulnerability of workers in precarious employment vividly highlights key institutional worker- empowerment and -protection gaps while underscoring the need for investment in education and training and for ensuring inclusion of women and others\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 13 informal sector and home-based workers, along with migrants (ESCAP, 2020).

Workers have not only remained poorly paid but subjected to exploitative conditions that seem immune to reform. In the garment sector, for example, wages have seen a secular decline over recent years, even as the Rana Pla- za disaster in 2013 set off significant efforts in the indus- try to provide better protections for workers (ILO, 2018). Once the pandemic hit Europe and North America, demand shrank and global brands promptly cancelled orders. Most declined to pay for these cancellations, leaving local suppliers in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and elsewhere to bear the costs (Anner, 2020). Workers at the end of the supply chain have little or no bargain- ing power, and the widespread unpaid furloughs, layoffs and factory closures meant losing an already precarious livelihood. On-the-ground accounts from civil society and media give little sign of any compensation or other payments for these layoffs. On the contrary, reports highlight cases where the crisis opened up new oppor- tunities for violating the human rights of workers, such as through wage cuts, suspension of collective bargain- ing and disregard for COVID-related workplace safety demands (Weber, 2020). The pandemic also exposes the structural vulnera- bilities of workers in the longer term. For firms and investors, it highlights the risks of labour-intensive pro- duction and may accelerate the trend toward automa- tion already under way. Economists, such as Joseph Stiglitz (2020), have contemplated the potential for a major structural change in the economy, in patterns of production and consumption and in the organization of production, predicting that this would lead to a re- duction in unskilled labour. The speed and scope will vary by industry, but across sectors, more repetitive and non-cognitive tasks will likely become candidates for automation. New jobs may be created, but access to them will require training and educational prepared- ness. Historically, defeminization of employment has accompanied technological upgrading in manufactur- ing because social norms favour men for higher-skill positions, as well as for the educational, vocational and sciences training that lays the groundwork for working with more advanced technology (Kucera and Tejani, 2014). \u201cContainment requires buy- in and engagement from the community and empowered citizens who value health as a priority, understand individual behaviour as affecting others and having an impact on the community\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 14 While many countries of the APR showed institutional strengths in containing the outbreak as it emerged in 2020, this will not suffice for ending the pandemic as the global contagion continues into 2021. Social distancing will prove increasingly difficult for people and economies to maintain over the long term. While the vaccine is a game changer, its slow rollout across the world and the virtual absence of access for most low- and middle-income countries will facilitate the emergence of variants and hamper the resumption of economic activities. At the same time, the socio- economic consequences of the pandemic-induced recession have exposed the vulnerability of economic strategies dependent on low-skilled and low-wage labour, as noted above. PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS AND CONTAINMENT The experiences of countries in the region described in the preceding section show that it is possible to stem the tide of the pandemic without a high level of financial or other resources, using basic public health measures or NPIs. Low-income countries and LDCs, such as Bhutan, Lao PDR and Viet Nam, have succeed- ed in keeping down the spread and suppressing out- breaks, while high-income countries have the highest morbidity and mortality rates. It is also evident that no single one-size-fits-all recipe will succeed across the board; different countries had different strategies and strengths, set diverse objectives and used different methods of implementation in areas such as testing, tracing, isolation and lockdowns. Pandemic control does not simply aim to contain the disease; its public policy objectives also include managing the socioeco- nomic crisis and rising inequality. Designing pandemic control strategies that address the social determinants of health and build in greater equity will require great- er attention. In particular, stringent lockdowns are a blunt and regressive instrument that call for rethink- ing and better understanding of consequences. Coun- tries of the region have varied their approaches; even in China, testing, tracing and isolation proved more im- portant than lockdown (Jomo, 2021).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "768cbf03-8266-4916-9bce-bbc84416334d": {"__data__": {"id_": "768cbf03-8266-4916-9bce-bbc84416334d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pandemic-governance-and-human-development-early-lessons-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pandemic Governance and Human Development: Early Lessons from Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pandemic-governance-and-human-development-early-lessons-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "91259270a8118fb9a9e2aaed695af39b4bcae29290623f007d2cd2a48ff90060"}, "2": {"node_id": "b5f7d3ee-8b78-42ac-b776-09d1cfb63727", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pandemic-governance-and-human-development-early-lessons-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d1f9fcacdfc541c6428a04ae80a84266e48f5ace0422dc64238316e31cee1192"}}, "hash": "6505757e678f76b99ed0c4685f618f98a624d59d7024b267a9b5a2a916a8a885", "text": "The disease itself, the containment measures and the recession have had huge and highly inequitable human consequences, ex- posing many existing gaps and posing major challeng- es for the future.

PUBLIC HEALTH CAPACITY The experience in the APR to date highlights the cen- tral role of basic public health measures for infectious disease control and the importance of robust public health infrastructure. Yet public health infrastructure has remained chronically underfunded and, in re- cent years, has deteriorated further. Public funding of health as a percentage of total government expendi- tures in 2018 ranged from 15 percent in Thailand to 3 percent in Bangladesh, and averaged 8.5 percent for the region, compared with the OECD average of 15 percent (OECD, 2020) (Figure 2). With dramatical- ly rising costs, the share of household expenditures on health has also risen. While WHO estimates that countries require at least 2.5 medical staff (physicians, nurses and midwives) per 1,000 population to provide adequate coverage for primary care, several coun- tries in the region fall below that norm. For example, Bangladesh has 1 staff per 1,000, Cambodia 1.2 (see Appendix 2 for complete national data). PRIORITIES MOVING FORWARD FROM HERE \u201cThe global recession remains a priority concern and exposes a number of gaps in national and global governance, notably inadequate support for LMICs and workers' rights and the failure to provide vaccines as a global public good\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 15 The priorities of development cooperation have not focused on public health infrastructure, but rather on treatments and vaccines. For example, the $38.1 billion multilateral initiative, ACT-Accelerator, includes four so-called \u2018pillars\u2019: diagnostics, treatment, vac- cines and health system strengthening. This last pillar has received the least funding so far, meeting only $0.3 billion out of the budget target of $9.5 billion (ACTaccelerator, 2020). Investment in public health, with priority to primary healthcare and expanded universal health coverage (UHC), offers a key instrument for addressing inequal- ities. Countries of the region have made progress, but still have a long way to go; for the 10 countries with da- ta, the overall regional average for UHC is 61 percent (2019), up from 46 percent in 2010. GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS: VACCINES AND OTHER DIAGNOSTICS AND TREATMENTS While NPIs can go a long way in keeping outbreaks in check, they will not suffice to bring an end to the glob- al spread of the disease in the way that vaccines can. The failure to arrange for universal access to vaccines and make global immunization possible reveals a massive gap in global governance. Not only does this present an ethical issue, but it lengthens the pandem- ic and stymies recovery from the global recession; a recent study estimates the cost of not vaccinating the entire world at $4 trillion (Kalemi-Ozcan et al., 2021). Without global immunization, the pandemic cannot come fully under control, and economic recovery cannot take hold. Vaccine distribution remains highly skewed, advancing in high-income countries while most of the Global South has little to no access. As of January 2021, some 39 million vaccine doses had been administered globally, virtually all in the high- est-income countries; by contrast, one lowest-income country had seen only 25 doses administered (Ghe- breyesus, 2021a).2 Under current agreements, and taking account of population size and vaccine supply deals, production constraints and adoption, estimates give high-income countries widespread coverage by late 2021 and middle-income countries by the end of 2022, while low-income countries would wait until 2023, if they ever receive vaccine access at all (Econo- mist Intellligence Unit, 2021).

As United Nations Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has repeatedly urged to the international community, \u201cwe must ensure that vaccines are seen as a global public good \u2013 people's vaccines \u2013 accessible and af- fordable to all.\u201d The European Union and many govern- ments have endorsed this as a principle, yet they have not voted for or funded removal of intellectual property obstacles to scaling-up production. As efficacious and safe vaccines begin to rollout, they remain private goods supplied by a handful of corporations, for which national governments compete to negotiate bilateral purchases. The APR includes countries having their own pharma- ceutical research and development capacity to create vaccines and treatment (China, India) as well as those with massive generic manufacturing capacity (Bangla- desh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Thailand and others). While each country must necessarily develop its own strategy for internal vaccination campaigns, countries of Asia and the Pacific can also contribute to promot- ing multilateral arrangements or consider developing regional approaches, as countries in Africa have done. WORKERS The pandemic has highlighted the importance of capac- ity to protect workers from the effects of global crises. For LMICs in the region, the vulnerability of workers, particularly those working in GVCs, poses a priori- ty challenge given the strategic importance of these industries in long-term development. National gov- ernments undertook a number of initiatives to support workers through employment and sickness protection, cash and in-kind transfers, family leave and childcare support. For example, China issued a directive, Notice Number 5 of January 2020, that prohibited the dismiss- al of workers absent due to illness or emergencies and required employers to continue payments. The Republic of Korea provided a subsidy equal to 90 percent of wag- es for all firms for a period of three months. Bangladesh offered low-interest loans to firms in the export sector to pay salaries for a period of three months (IMF, 2020b). And as already noted earlier, countries have instituted major stimulus packages. Nonetheless, the measures remain far from adequate for protecting livelihoods, with millions pushed into poverty and food insecurity. Considering the structural causes of the insecurity \u2013 the asymmetries of power in the structure of value chains that inevitably make both low-income countries and low-skilled workers vulnerable \u2013 a structural response will be required. This underscores the need for robust legal protection for labour rights, including collective bargaining. At the global level, the United Nations\u2019 guiding principles on business and human rights, endorsed by UN member states, should proactively hold national and foreign firms to basic human rights standards. At the same time, the pandemic also serves as another reminder for the future of global industries and the growing demand for Industry 4.0 skills. This under- scores the need for investment in education and training, and ensuring inclusion of women and other groups vulnerable to being left behind. The vulnerabilities of workers in precarious forms of employment vividly highlight key institutional work- er-empowerment and -protection gaps: legal regu- lations and enforcement of worker rights, including collective bargaining, adequate social safety nets, and a pursuit of economic models that do not rely on ex- ports built on low-wage labour.

This should not come as a surprise. Technology and resources can only go so far in the ab- sence of vaccines and known treatment protocols. On the other hand, a public-health emergency requires political leadership in crafting a policy response and public-health infrastructure to implement public inter- ventions. It also needs social consensus and norms, including informal standards of individual behaviour. Curbing the spread of disease depends critically on NPIs \u2013 testing, contact tracing, quarantining, isolation, physical distancing, limiting travel and gatherings, hand-washing and mask wearing \u2013 that entail changes in the daily habits of individuals. Often, government regulation alone will not suffice to ensure such chang- es. They call for consensus about accepting such behaviours as necessary to curb the pandemic, for col- lective and not only individual benefit, and compliance with those standards. Containment requires buy-in and engagement from the community and empowered citizens to act for the community. Norms and values regarding health as public health, the shared value of health as a priority, the understanding of individual behaviour as affecting others and having an impact on the community \u2013 all will prove essential in achieving a degree of compliance with NPIs. This requires capac- ity for action in organizational structures in the state and civil society and the capacity of communities to coalesce around shared norms. Such factors have been underplayed in global policy debates and neglected by many governments and organizations. The global response has focused on in- vesting in vaccines and other technologies, rather than on strengthening public health infrastructure. Clearly, these material tools will prove essential to combat, and ultimately end, the pandemic. But the reliance on technology and the neglect of institutions reflects a strategic choice, one favouring a vertical approach to addressing global health challenges to the detriment of building horizontal health systems. The experience of countries with rampant community spread may well expose the high cost of neglecting in- stitutional capacity. The United Kingdom, United States and other high-income countries invested heavily in vaccine development, a critical step for ending the pan- demic; yet their difficulties in implementing NPIs cost a year of lost lives and health for hundreds of thousands of people. As former United Kingdom Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt commented in a recent interview, \u201cWe did exhaustive pandemic preparations: we were lauded by the Johns Hopkins University as being the second-best prepared country in the world. But we were also part of a groupthink that said that the primary way that you respond to a pandemic is the flu pandemic playbook (with a focus on areas like vaccination and boosting hospital capacity), rather than the methods that you would use for SARS and MERS (surveillance and con- tainment, community testing, contact tracing and iso- lation, and stockpiling personal protective equipment, and ventilators)\u201d (Dalton, 2021). Even the development of vaccines emphasizes the need for institutional ca- pacity: the ability to get the vaccines into the arms of people, particularly the most vulnerable. As technolo- gy writer Yong wrote in a recent article \u2013 using the term \u2018capacities\u2019 to refer to physical infrastructure \u2013 \u201cin retro- spect, many Western health experts were too focused on capacities, such as equipment and resources, and not on.... how you apply those in times of crisis\u201d (Yong, 2020) [emphases added]. The pandemic also highlights other major gaps in national and global institutions. Pandemic governance aims not only to reduce prevalence and mortality, but to promote broader human development priorities of equity within a participatory process that addresses the socioeconomic consequences of a pandemic-in- duced recession. At the national level, this calls for more debate on the design of policies and processes in order to ensure equity and respect for human rights. The pandemic has exposed the most glaring gap in global governance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac9bb70a-be2b-42e2-a129-391f4155b9c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac9bb70a-be2b-42e2-a129-391f4155b9c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pandemic-governance-and-human-development-early-lessons-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pandemic Governance and Human Development: Early Lessons from Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pandemic-governance-and-human-development-early-lessons-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c76690987bb7e3209cb8c82c6e248618d56e6c97c79132f6cec02de875077ac5"}, "2": {"node_id": "62a94da3-4cde-4175-9ea5-79aa2d4c7cdc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pandemic-governance-and-human-development-early-lessons-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21d9dfd517da35ce72bfcd13170596e208279f3c51b7b90915e8cbe60d0b579b"}}, "hash": "335ec001bba5b66c0d7ab351265c8d47fe0780b882739c04ed88dc326089e782", "text": "The pandemic has exposed the most glaring gap in global governance.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for global connectivity, especially for access to education, work and healthcare. Universal connectivity is a fundamental element of an inclusive and sustainable world; thus, as with income inequality and other human development indicators, digital inequality trends must be reversed. Universal, affordable broadband availability can largely improve a population\u2019s quality of education, healthcare, standards of living, and more. Digital inequalities disproportionate- ly impact low-income populations, people living in rural areas and small island developing nations, those who lack literacy and digital skills, and people from traditionally disenfranchised groups, such as women and girls, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities. The lack of regulations, funding, infrastructure, and digital skills all contribute to the unavailability of universal, affordable broadband access across the APR. This chapter discusses how addressing digital inequality should be at the forefront at both the public and private sectors\u2019 agenda. Efforts should include expanding acces- sibility, creating relevant content, enabling digital literacy, and ensuring affordable connectivity and digital solutions, therefore better preparing individual countries and the global community, as a whole, for a more connected, inclusive and sustainable future. ABSTRACT The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 4 Abstract Table of Contents Introduction Overview The impact of COVID-19 The status of digital connectivity in the Asia-Pacific region Hurdles to attaining greater connectivity Costs and financing options for universal connectivity Options in technology and infrastructure Policy approaches and suggestions Conclusion List of Figures List of Tables References About the Author 3 4 5 8 9 11 17 19 20 21 23 24 24 24 26 TABLE OF CONTENTS The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 5 Even with all the progress made over the last few de- cades, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has reported that widespread disparities remain in human development and continue to widen across many dimensions and regions (UNDP, 2019).1 The digital divide, or lack of universal affordable dig- ital connectivity, is one manifestation of this trend. As depicted in Figure 1, gains have occurred in basic capabilities (UNDP, 2019). As with other measures Enhanced Capabilities Examples of Achievements - Access to quality health at all levels - High-quality education at all levels - Effective access to present-day technologies - Resilience to unknown new shocks Examples of Achievements - Early childhood survival - Primary education - Entry-level technology - Resilience to recurrent shocks Basic Capabilities Source: UNDP (2019) of human development, those at the bottom have made advances in the basics of Internet access, such as basic mobile connectivity and limited Wi-Fi kiosk access. However, divergence appears in enhanced capabilities, including unlimited data consumption on high-speed mobile and fixed connections at home and access to cloud-based productivity tools. Gaps in enhanced capabilities exceed those in the basic ones, and gaps have continued to rise. INTRODUCTION 1 According to the UNDP, income inequality is on the rise\u2014the richest 10 percent have up to 40 percent of global income whereas the poorest 10 percent earn only between 2 to 7 percent. Income inequality has increased nearly everywhere in recent decades, but at different speeds. And if one takes population growth into account, inequality in developing countries has increased by 11 percent (UNDP, 2021). Figure 1: Human development, from basic to enhanced capabilities The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 6 With rapid progress in technologies, digital inequality runs the risk of widening at an accelerating pace over time. This undermines the achievement of fundamen- tal freedoms to make life choices. As with income inequality and other indicators of human development, reversing trends toward digital inequality calls for ur- gent steps in the near future. The foundational role of connectivity in human develop- ment has found wider recognition in recent years (UN- DP, 2019; Broadband Commission, 2020a).

COVID-19\u2019s impact on child- hood education has proven particularly acute. With its tremendous economic and cultural diversity, the Asia and the Pacific Region (APR) very much exem- plifies what we see globally on broadband availability and adoption. The data show that the APR has made significant progress over the last decade increasing the availability and affordability of Internet connec- tivity, but more than half of people in the APR remain offline, and fixed and mobile broadband remains un- affordable in most APR countries. The data also show that digital inequality disproportionately impacts the following groups in the APR: low-income populations residing in the least developed countries; those locat- ed in rural areas, in small island developing nations and in landlocked developing countries; those lacking literacy and digital skills; and those from traditionally disenfranchised groups, such as women and girls, per- sons with disabilities and ethnic minorities. The Broad- band Commission for Sustainable Development, a joint initiative by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the United Nations Educational, Scien- tific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to promote universal broadband Internet access, has observed that digital inequality persists around the world even in countries with high-speed connectivity infrastructure (Broadband Commission, 2020b). Global efforts to close the digital divide have not aimed high enough. Basic connectivity targets will sim- ply lead to greater inequalities in basic and enhanced capabilities in the future. New goals should reflect where technology is going, not where it is today (or, worse yet, where it was 10-20 years ago). Achieving aggressive digital inclusion targets will need a coor- dinated and concerted effort, one that incorporates proven, as well as new, technological, financial, and regulatory approaches. Currently, regulatory, marketplace and technological hurdles impede efforts to achieve universal affordable broadband access across the APR. These include reg- ulatory uncertainty and fragmentation, lack of access to financing, uneven availability of infrastructure and technologies, lack of service affordability and consuma- bility, uneven digital skills attainment (and literacy), and unequal relevance and accessibility of online content. \u201cUniversal connectivity calls for more than simply creating access; it also will entail creating relevant and accessible content, making intensive efforts to expand digital literacy, and ensuring affordable connectivity for all\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 7 Fortunately, governments and network operators have a growing menu of technology options available to them for delivering cost-effective, affordable con- nectivity to underserved and unserved communities. Funding for digital infrastructure primarily comes from three sources \u2013 the private sector, governments, and international financial institutions (IFIs) (in the case of emerging markets); but providers will need to consid- er innovative financing mechanisms in order to spur market entry, expansion, and technology and busi- ness-model innovation. In this chapter, we discuss efforts across the APR to accelerate universal digital connectivity.2 In the first section, we provide an overview of the state of global broadband access and UN and ITU goals and efforts to achieve global universal digital connectivity and discuss the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for global efforts to expand Internet connectivity. In the second section, we provide an overview and analy- sis of digital connectivity across the APR. In the third section, we discuss marketplace, technological, and regulatory hurdles that impede efforts to achieve uni- versal and affordable broadband across the region. In the fourth section, we provide an overview of different approaches both the private and public sectors have taken and could adopt for financing the extension of affordable broadband access. In the fifth section, we assess various technology options available to gov- ernments and network operators looking to extend affordable broadband access to underserved and unserved communities.

One cannot achieve the SDGs without it\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 8 According to the latest ITU data, global Internet user penetration is currently at 51 percent, or about 4 billion people online, meaning that about 3.7 billion people around the world still do not have access to the Internet (ITU, 2020a). Global Internet user pene- tration is 44 percent in developing countries, but only 19 percent in the least developed countries (LDCs). Ac- cording to the ITU, the proportion of all women using the Internet globally is 48 percent, against 55 percent of all men (ITU, 2020a). More men than women use the Internet in every region of the world except the Ameri- cas, which has near-equality (ITU, 2020a). Lack of Internet access also stymies the potential of children and young people. According to a new report commissioned by United Nations Internation- al Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and the ITU Development Sector, 2.2 billion, or 67 percent of children and young people aged 25 years or under, lack Internet access at home (UNICEF and ITU, 2020). In East Asia and the Pacific, 46 percent of children and young people aged 25 years or under (369 million) lack home Internet access. In South Asia that number is 86 percent (768 million young people) (UNICEF and ITU, 2020). Stark differences appear between rich and poor countries, with 94 percent of children and young people in low-income countries lacking Internet access compared to 13 percent in high-income countries. In 2016, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution stressing the importance of \u201capplying a comprehensive human rights-based approach in pro- viding and in expanding access to Internet,\u201d request- ing \u201call States to make efforts to bridge the many forms of digital divides\u201d (UNDP, 2019, p.233). This expansion must be consistent with general human rights princi- ples: \u201cThe same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, in particular freedom of ex- pression\u201d (UNDP, 2019, p.233). UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u2019s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation represents a call to connect, respect, and protect the online world. It includes con- crete actions in the following areas: achieving univer- sal connectivity by 2030\u2014everyone should have safe and affordable access to the Internet; ensuring digital inclusion for all, including the most vulnerable\u2014un- der-served groups need equal access to digital tools to accelerate development; and strengthening digital capacity\u2014fostering skills development and training around the world (UN Secretary-General, 2020; UN, 2019). The Broadband Commission for Sustainable Develop- ment,3 established in 2010 by the ITU and UNESCO, aims to boost the importance of broadband on the inter- national policy agenda and expand broadband access in every country, thus accelerating progress towards national and international development targets (Broad- band Commission, 2020a). The Broadband Commission has established seven Advocacy Targets seeking to expand broadband infrastructure and Internet access and use by populations around the world: \u2022 Advocacy Target 1 (policy): By 2025, all countries should have a funded national broadband plan or strategy, or include broadband in their universal ac- cess and services (UAS) definition. \u2022 Advocacy Target 2 (affordability): By 2025, devel- oping countries should make entry-level broad- band services affordable, at less than 2 percent of monthly per capita gross national income (GNI). \u2022 Advocacy Target 3 (connectivity): By 2025, broad- band-Internet user penetration should reach 75 percent of the world\u2019s population overall, including 65 percent in developing countries, and 35 percent in least-developed countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28993d82-fbee-49c6-8cd5-def0caa38a85": {"__data__": {"id_": "28993d82-fbee-49c6-8cd5-def0caa38a85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-universal-digital-connectivity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Universal Digital Connectivity", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-universal-digital-connectivity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e1abf8cbd4ca0c655a54aa1dcd8cb8301548646b9ac2f6ee19720f384effb8f"}, "2": {"node_id": "64dd4e3a-76fa-4c4c-8eab-0c914c1faff5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-universal-digital-connectivity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b18d7851162cde2705bf1bc4f74ccc367901b366f268f8fd51789c8ec2b7f90f"}}, "hash": "13870e2e3f7c14ab6a006d29c215b217137c43c090395d3c551029396bfc3011", "text": "\u2022 Advocacy Target 4 (skills): By 2025, 60 percent of youth and adults should have achieved at least a minimum level of proficiency in sustainable digital skills. \u2022 Advocacy Target 5 (digital finance): By 2025, 40 percent of the world\u2019s population should be using digital financial services.

The Broadband Commission has observed, \u201cachiev- ing affordable universal connectivity is essential for achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and making good on our pledge to Leave No One Behind\u201d (Broadband Commission, 2020a, p.20). According to the Broadband Commission, four of the 17 SDGs include targets related to information and communications technologies (ICT), and at least 38 other targets rely on universal and affordable access to ICT and broadband to reach SDG achievement (Broadband Commission, 2020b, p.4). THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 As noted above, the global COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the importance of connectivity for social and economic inclusion. According to the Broadband Commission, \u201cthe pandemic and its socio-economic impacts have underscored the urgency of concrete, coordinated actions across all sectors and geogra- phies. With less than ten years remaining until 2030, now is the time to establish digital connectivity as the foundational pillar for our shared Global Goals\u201d (Broad- band Commission, 2020a, p.2). While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has manifested in numerous settings implicating con- nectivity to the Internet, its impact on childhood education appears particularly acute. Based on an August 2020 UN policy brief, school closures and learning disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted 94 percent of the world\u2019s student population; in low- and lower-middle-income countries, up to 99 percent of the student popula- tion has been affected (UN, 2020). This amounts to nearly 1.6 billion learners in more than 190 countries and on all continents, producing the largest dis- ruption of education systems in history (UN, 2020, p.2, 5). According to the UNDP, as a result of school closures and the lack of affordable broadband, 60 percent of children are simply not receiving an edu- cation, leading to global education levels not seen since the 1980s (UNDP, 2020a; UNDP 2020b). Some 23.8 million children and youth (from pre-primary to tertiary schools) may drop out or not have access to school in the coming year because of the pandem- ic\u2019s economic impact (UN, 2020, p.2, 10). According to a recent UNDP report, \u201c[t]he closure of schools can widen the digital gender divide due to unequal access to the Internet and technologies\u201d (Rivera et al., p.8). As discussed below, there is a persistent gender gap in Internet utilization, with women and girls less likely than men and boys to own Internet-enabled devices and connect to the Internet, especially in South Asia. If women and girls are less likely than men and boys to access the Internet at home and therefore have less access to online educational content, then a school closure is likely to more acutely and detrimentally impact girls than boys. \u201cThe lack of regulations, funding, infrastructure, and digital skills all contribute to the unavailability of universal, affordable broadband access across the Asia-Pacific Region. Reversing trends toward digital inequality calls for urgent steps in the near future\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 10 The broader social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic appear equally startling. The World Bank has projected that \u2013 for the first time in 20 years \u2013 an additional 150 million people could sink into extreme poverty in 2021 as a result of the pan- demic (The World Bank, 2020; UNDP, 2020c). Another study, by the Pardee Center for International Futures at the University of Denver, finds that COVID-19 could drive the number of people living in extreme poverty to over 1 billion by 2030, with a quarter of a billion as a direct result of the pandemic (UNDP, 2020c). Because of COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s triple hit to health, education, and income, the UNDP has forecast an overall decline in the global Human Development Index for the first time since 1990 (UNDP, 2020a). These factors surely will place a drag on efforts to close the digital divide.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee49fc3d-a9e9-46e9-ba32-ad080bd11082": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee49fc3d-a9e9-46e9-ba32-ad080bd11082", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-universal-digital-connectivity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Universal Digital Connectivity", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-universal-digital-connectivity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ed0c9ccad588e466762d8a61fc1f5ff677be20c12bc6b35b4904691aac84ed9"}, "2": {"node_id": "e3f0070c-52c8-4fa9-84ce-0f13b6ad4754", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-universal-digital-connectivity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d0b8dd2ee895f95152c37bdf39288f355572abfa711e7668bfec95a944eee3d"}}, "hash": "0915721f16df642778b5fe37fe99ccc156a6f18803b2a677b539e6efc869f84b", "text": "These factors surely will place a drag on efforts to close the digital divide. In its most recent State of Broadband report, the Broadband Commission has conceded that, at current rates of growth, it will probably not achieve its 2025 connectivity goals (Broadband Commission, 2020b, p.21). Forecasts based on current growth projections suggest that global Internet adoption by 2025 may only reach 70 percent, five percentage points below the 2025 Advocacy Target (Broadband Commission, 202b, p.21).

Barriers include poor quality throughput and reliability, cost of Internet access and devices, and lack of relevant content or digital skills, among other factors\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 11 Below is an overview of the current status of digital connectivity across the 38 countries of the APR. The region has seen significant progress; indeed, many of its countries are global leaders in digital connectivity. At the same time, more than half of people in the APR remain offline, with significant and persistent rural and gender divides in access, while affordability remains a challenge in less-developed and insular countries across the region. Global Internet user penetration currently runs 51 percent, or about 4 billion people online (ITU, 2020a). In the APR, penetration currently runs 45 percent, or about 2 billion people online (ITU, 2020a; ITU, 2020b). As a reference point, in 2005, the APR had an Internet user penetration rate of 9.5 percent, or about 355 mil- lion people online. At the country level, Internet user penetration varies widely across the APR. This is consistent with patterns seen globally. Internet user penetration is over 80 percent in countries such as Australia, Brunei, Hong Kong (China), Japan, Republic of Korea, Macau (China), Malaysia, New Zealand and Singapore. By contrast, in populous and less-developed countries, such as Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, user penetration only reaches 20 percent (ITU, 2020c). A significant gender gap persists in Internet utilization as well. The proportion of all women using the Internet in the APR runs at 41 percent, against 48 percent of all men (versus 48 percent and 55 percent globally, as noted above), and \u2014 cause for even greater concern \u2014 the gap appears to be growing (ITU, 2020a; UTA, 2020b, p.3-4). The gender gap in Internet use also cor- relates with one in mobile device ownership, globally and in the APR (ITU, 2020a, p.6). At the same time, the mobile gender gap varies widely across Asia (GSMA, 2020). South Asia has the largest mobile gender gap of any region worldwide \u2013 a 23 percent gender gap in mobile-device ownership and a 51 percent gender gap in mobile-Internet use \u2013 while the most digitally ma- ture low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in East Asia and the Pacific have more equal levels of mobile ownership and use (GSMA, 2020). Most of the world\u2019s population accesses the Inter- net through mobile networks. While 97 percent of the global population and 95.4 percent of the APR population live within reach of mobile network cov- erage, only 51 percent globally and 45 percent in the APR are online (ITU, 2020a, p.8).4 This indicates that Internet access alone is not sufficient to induce online activity. As discussed below, the quality (throughput and reliability) and cost of Internet access (including data consumption limits), as well as the cost of devic- es, availability of relevant content, digital skills and other factors, impact whether and how people access the Internet. The Broadband Commission\u2019s second 2025 target would make entry-level mobile and fixed broadband services affordable in developing countries, at less than 2 percent of monthly per capita GNI. For mobile broadband, the Commission defines entry-level ser- vice as providing at least 1.5 Gigabytes (GB) of monthly data consumption on at least a 3G mobile network connection; for fixed broadband, this would mean at least 5GB of monthly data consumption on a connec- tion providing at least 256 kilobits (kbits)/second (ITU, 2020a, p.5). On these measures, the APR as a whole has made significant progress over the last decade or so and now fares well compared to other regions. Figure 2 shows how the cost of fixed broadband in the APR has declined from 26.76 percent of per capita GNI in 2008 to 5.1 percent of per capita GNI in 2019 (ITU, 2021a). Figure 3 shows how the cost of data-only mobile broadband in the APR has declined from 7.92 percent of per capita GNI in 2013 to 2.36 percent of per capita GNI in 2019 \u2013 approaching the Broadband Commission\u2019s target.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eed014d1-34ae-4761-9efa-fab6fe22ef94": {"__data__": {"id_": "eed014d1-34ae-4761-9efa-fab6fe22ef94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-universal-digital-connectivity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Universal Digital Connectivity", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-universal-digital-connectivity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b042ea4be95451d1506a2c1cb965a86dea1d73a3fafe75957222f13614b4929"}, "2": {"node_id": "5ed025c6-855f-4432-8f81-212d4f720956", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-universal-digital-connectivity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "849e155d1ff445da34f521e0d243c04a13acee649ec220210bde920e79cf2b06"}}, "hash": "5f46979f1ab207c5faacc7690a3899b5afeecb2a879b51741c4d465096b754c6", "text": "However, the rate of decline in the percent of monthly per capita GNI for both fixed and mobile broadband has slowed in the last few years, indicating a need for further interventions to achieve the Broadband Commission\u2019s goals.

Good regulations can literally change the cost-economics of broadband deployments, allowing unprofitable investments to become profitable.5 On the other hand, the absence of a regulatory framework can discourage investment. In addition, the lack of harmonized regulations (i.e., fragmentation) across a region can discourage invest- ment, especially in small markets, such as small island developing states, which might not attract investment on their own. Moreover, regulatory uncertainty (or a constantly changing regulatory environment) creates risk and can also discourage investment.

This also holds for satellite communications. Some forms of fixed-wireless infrastructure have lower upfront capital requirements and, therefore, lower bar- riers to market entry. Access to financing poses one of the greatest chal- lenges facing companies looking to deploy digital ser- vices in emerging markets. Below we discuss costs and financing options for achieving universal broadband. According to the GSM Association for the mobile industry, 3.3 billion people live in areas covered by mobile broadband networks but do not use mobile In- ternet \u2013 a usage gap more than four times greater than the coverage gap (GSMA, 2019). In low- and middle-in- come countries, in addition to unaffordability and low digital literacy and skills discussed above, a perceived lack of relevance and safety and security concerns pose the next most important barriers to mobile Inter- net use from a consumer point of view (GSMA, 2019). Addressing these barriers will prove critical in further reducing the usage gap and driving digital inclusion (GSMA, 2019). These same issues hinder adoption of fixed broadband services. If we intend to achieve universal broadband, we will need to make it affordable for more of the world\u2019s population. One important piece to the affordabili- HURDLES TO ATTAINING GREATER CONNECTIVITY 5 An example of this might be infrastructure-sharing regulations that enable network operators to share the costs of fibre and tower deployments, instead of each network operator having to deploy its own infrastructure. Regulatory Certainty Access to Financing Infrastructure Deployment Affordability of Service Digital Skills Attainment Relevancy of Content The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 18 ty puzzle is selling broadband access in a way that allows for different types of customers. A post-paid monthly subscription (often with annual or multi-year commitments) is common in developed markets; it also serves higher-income consumers, businesses and gov- ernment customers in emerging ones. By contrast, the prepaid or pay-as-you-go model offers Internet access to low-income consumers in developed markets and to most customers in emerging ones. These latter cus- tomers often purchase their Internet access in small increments, measured in 10s of Megabytes (MBs) of data consumption, in the same way that they purchase other goods and services. In many markets, such cus- tomers are unbanked: Fully \u201ctwo billion adults are still without access to a bank account, but some 1.6 billion people in this group have access to a mobile phone, presenting the opportunity to explore strategies that leverage the widespread use of mobile phones to offer financial inclusion options\u201d (Broadband Commission, 2020b, p.28). As discussed above, the Broadband Com- mission\u2019s Advocacy Target 5 calls for at least 40 percent of the world\u2019s population to use digital financial services by 2025. Even as more of the world\u2019s population gains access to such services, Internet service providers need to have payment infrastructure in place that can accommodate both post-paid monthly subscription customers and prepaid pay-as-you-go customers. However, even with access to affordable services, many people in the APR still do not use them: a lack of literacy and digital skills and the lack of relevant content ranked higher than affordability for low- and middle-income-country consumers surveyed in South Asia and East Asia (GSMA, 2019, p.33). Digital skills \u2013 in essence, understanding how to use technology \u2013 are critical for fully benefiting from digital services. The Broadband Commission\u2019s Advocacy Target 4 calls for 60 percent of youth and adults to achieve at least a minimum level of proficiency in sustainable digital skills by 2025 (GSMA, 2019). For mobile Internet use, literacy and skills remain the most significant self-re- ported barrier across the world, accounting for 37 per- cent of responses in South Asia and 35 percent in East Asia. For example, in Bangladesh\u2019s recent National ICT Household Survey 2018-2019, the number one reason for non-connectivity is \u2018[c]annot use Internet\u2019 (GSMA, 2019, p.35).

Additionally, several major technology companies, such as Microsoft and Amazon, have launched digital skilling programs (Microsoft, 2020; Amazon, 2020; Amazon, 2021). 7 For example, the Internet Society works with governments, local entrepreneurs and civil society on efforts to develop Internet content in local languages (Internet Society, 2016). In addition, technology companies have various efforts underway to enable consumers to translate content into their first language, including tools such as Google Translate, Bing Translator and Microsoft Translator (Microsoft, 2021). \u201cIn instances when the market alone cannot be relied upon to deliver affordable mobile or fixed broadband to an underserved or unserved community, universal service programs have a role to play\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 19 Below is an overview of different approaches open to both the private and public sectors in financing afford- able broadband access in underserved communities. Funding for universal service connectivity comes from three primary sources: the private sector; govern- ments; and international financial institutions in the case of emerging markets (The World Bank, 2019). Network operators and service providers will probably play a critical role as key investors in broadband net- works through continued and increased levels of com- mitment to expand network coverage beyond urban population centres \u2013 essentially deploying funding from existing operations gained through cost reductions and by raising capital from commercial banks and private in- vestors. Other options include the network as a service, in which infrastructure and equipment vendors share investment risk with service providers (e.g., through revenue sharing). In addition, network operators focus- ing on underserved and unserved communities could benefit from the emergence of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, in which investors tar- get investments and accept lower returns in exchange for socially beneficial outcomes (Garnett, 2020; Digital Ubiquity Capital, 2021). The World Bank has observed that achieving commercially sustainable investment will require innovations that lower the capital expenditure and operating expense of towers and infrastructure overall, while enhancing demands for mobile and fixed broadband services and corresponding market growth (The World Bank, 2019, p.110). Some areas will not have scope for profitable deploy- ment of networks and services, and therefore the mar- ket alone will not support investment needed for univer- sal broadband. In such cases, governments must take an increasing role as \u2018investors\u2019 in broadband infra- structure in order to ensure that countries can achieve their national development agendas. Governments have adopted various approaches to funding these plans: dedicated funds, universal service funds (over- seen by the national regulator and in some cases inde- pendently administered), direct government subsidies and grants, government equity and loans, public-private partnerships and investment tax zones.8 It is critical that governments not only invest their resources effectively but also, as discussed below, that they develop policy and regulatory environments that will incentivize and promote investments and market growth. Multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank, and regional development banks, such as the Asian Development Bank, have supplied funding for infrastructure and projects in general, alongside other donors (The World Bank, 2019, p.110-110). These organizations may lend at preferential rates for long- term projects in some cases, focusing their resources on projects with high economic development impact (Broadband Commission Working Group, 2014). They can also provide equally critical research, consulting, and other resources, usually through non-refundable grants, as well as expertise and knowledge \u2014 very useful, for example, in a public-private partnership process. The ITU also has a key role in coordinating technical, economic and regulatory matters relating to ensuring universal, affordable and good-quality broad- band connectivity. COSTS AND FINANCING OPTIONS FOR UNIVERSAL CONNECTIVITY 8 According to the Broadband Commission Working Group on Financing and Investment, sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are another possible source of financing for telecommunication infrastructure projects. SWFs are investment funds owned by the governments of sovereign states and funded mainly by foreign exchange and reserve assets (Broadband Commission Working Group, 2014).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d082ad2-bef2-4723-b0d5-00d9983870ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d082ad2-bef2-4723-b0d5-00d9983870ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-universal-digital-connectivity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Universal Digital Connectivity", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-universal-digital-connectivity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a9ffffc1e55c897b9949e635727986cc5045c8cf0282b2bc35140d36882a12b2"}, "2": {"node_id": "83ec467f-d7ff-4e00-b8d5-d7758febaa6c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-universal-digital-connectivity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "84e43b377f22eb1dbd52f942b9159838a7c7d2b8782c573ea7eda46317e56107"}}, "hash": "f9efffdada64c125d97f433bb9b5884b0f8975ae654d4e61496eca0dfe8d4a1d", "text": "\u201cIt is critical that governments not only invest their resources effectively but also, as discussed below, that they develop policy and regulatory environments that will incentivize and promote investments and market growth\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 20 There are various technology options available to governments and network operators looking to extend affordable broadband access to underserved and un- served communities, including traditional fibre, coax- ial cable and copper infrastructure, various fixed and mobile terrestrial wireless solutions, geo-stationary and low-earth-orbit satellites,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4be140e6-4600-43be-9d7b-48b87840acd3": {"__data__": {"id_": "4be140e6-4600-43be-9d7b-48b87840acd3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-universal-digital-connectivity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Universal Digital Connectivity", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-universal-digital-connectivity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2bff4c80752ed32ebe7fed0020e18c10e4a1083bbd0715f1b53dec1961d26130"}, "3": {"node_id": "f3e49b83-9548-441a-9c64-55e008b5ee80", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-universal-digital-connectivity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a21ce9c33b36badb5dbd1b74bec09f850b0f65dea2b59d69952b4266e3a7bc64"}}, "hash": "25157b92876f06e1dd31155f7f59cd660c29c9e5a5cf3739affe397f23ea723c", "text": "and other emerging and exper- imental technologies. Governments and network oper- ators have a growing menu of options available to them for cost-effective delivery of affordable connectivity. The broadband network value chain (or building blocks) for developing universal, affordable, and high-quality broadband Internet access comprises four broad segments: first mile, middle mile, last mile and invisible mile (The World Bank, 2019). Delivery of fixed or mobile Internet access requires connecting all parts of the value chain, along with supporting infrastruc- ture, such as data centres and a reliable electricity supply, and devices used to access the Internet. The first mile is where the Internet enters a country (The World Bank, 2019). The network components include international access infrastructure, such as submarine cables, landing stations, satellite dishes, cross-border microwave and fibre links, domain name registration and so on. Countries need connections to undersea cables or via cross-border terrestrial links, particularly for landlocked countries. Many countries in the APR have access to submarine cable systems, either directly through local landing points or through terrestrial connections (ITU, 2020d). However, some small island developing states in the APR, such as Nauru, Kiribati and Tuvalu, lack access to submarine cable systems and therefore must rely on satellite con- nectivity in the first mile (ITU, 2020d). The middle mile is where the Internet passes through a country (The World Bank, 2019). The network com- ponents here are the national backbone and intercity networks, including the fibre optic cables or copper wires, microwave, satellite links, Internet exchange points (IXPs), local hosting of content, and so on. Once connected to high-speed Internet at the border, countries in the APR require fibre backbones to carry Internet traffic from the border to urban and rural cen- tres; they also require backhaul or metro networks to extend further. Satellite transmission remains import- ant in the APR small island developing states and other rural or remote locations that lack access to terrestrial first- or middle-mile networks. In addition, while most APR countries have IXPs, with the exception of Vanu- atu most of the small island developing states do not, nor do Bangladesh, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste and Sri Lanka (Internet Exchange Map, 2021). These countries have their domestic In- ternet traffic exchanged through points outside their borders, usually through satellite or fibre across inter- national hubs, to reach their destinations. The last mile is where the Internet reaches the end-user (The World Bank, 2019). Once high-speed Internet arrives at a population centre, via the first and middle miles, network operators provide mobile or fixed Internet access services to consumers, businesses and governments. Network components include central of- fice exchanges, the local loop \u2014 historically composed of copper cables, but now increasingly replaced with fibre for last-mile connections in urban or suburban ar- eas \u2014 and wireless masts for mobile and fixed wireless connectivity, as well as satellite connections in remote locations that do not permit an economic deployment of terrestrial networks (ITU, 2020e). New developments have also enabled network operators to cost-effectively deploy high-speed last-mile networks to locations out- side of population centres. For example, new high-ca- pacity terrestrial fixed-wireless access solutions have become viable in more places, and pilot projects have begun to test other innovative solutions such as drones or balloons. Additionally, new Low Earth Orbit satellite solutions promise to deliver lower latency and higher throughput Internet connections to locations around the world (Broadband Commission, 2017). The invisible mile consists of the hidden elements vital to ensuring the integrity of the value chain (The World Bank, 2019).

Fortunately, increasing invest- ment in rural electricity mini-grids and off-grid solar has started to offer more cost-effective solutions than grid extensions to remote and rural areas (IEA et al., 2019). This section provides an overview of policy approaches that Asian-Pacific and other governments have adopt- ed to help close the digital divides in their countries through a review of competition, spectrum, universal services, and other policies; also included are brief sug- gestions for further steps that policymakers and regula- tors could take to improve their chances of success. A well-designed broadband plan can offer an import- ant blueprint for addressing digital inequality. The Broadband Commission\u2019s Advocacy Target One aims for all countries to have a funded national broadband plan or strategy, or to include broadband in their uni- versal access and service (UAS) definition, by 2025. In 2012, the ITU Telecommunication Development Sector developed best practices for national broad- band plans, digital agendas, and digital strategies (ITU, 2012).9 Today, 174 countries worldwide have a nation- al broadband plan, with several countries currently in the process of adopting one (Broadband Commission, 2020b). Broadband plans can also be developed at the regional level. For example, the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ad- opted an ASEAN ICT Masterplan in 2015 (AIM, 2015) and subsequently updated that plan in 2020 to focus more on consumer choice, quality and price (ASEAN, 2020). That plan seeks to move beyond focusing only on connectivity to identifying and supporting isolated or underserved communities, and increasing the demand, usage, affordability and connectivity of broadband ser- vices across ASEAN member states (ASEAN, 2020). While some countries have developed new or updated national broadband plans, many countries have shifted their focus to other matters, such as upgrading their universal access and service definitions or terms of service, or developing broader digital transformation strategies and plans, with connectivity as a core com- ponent, among other major issues (Broadband Com- mission, 2020b). In addition, governments and regu- lators need to monitor and evaluate the current state of national plan implementation (Broadband Commis- sion, 2020b). In some cases, even after publishing and endorsing a national plan, government transitions and competing priorities lead to situations that interrupt or impede effective national plans, calling for revised targets in order to maintain progress on broadband adoption (Broadband Commission, 2020b). The Alliance for Affordable Internet Access (A4AI) notes that in 2020, Malaysia stands out with one of the highest three scores for national broadband planning. Malaysia earned this distinction due to the quality POLICY APPROACHES AND SUGGESTIONS 9 Data unavailable for Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Marshall Islands and Tuvalu. \u201cNational broadband plans should have five key elements: (1) data collection and broadband definitions, (2) competition policies, (3) spectrum policies, (4) universal service goals and policies, and (5) measures to address adoption gaps.They also need an impartial, independent regulator\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 22 of its national broadband plan targets and the wide- spread impact of these targets. Malaysia set targets, led the sector and left evidence of impact in its wake. An array of supply- and demand-side regulatory inter- ventions helped achieve the plan\u2019s broadband avail- ability and adoption targets. As a result, Malaysia now enjoys widespread affordable access to the Internet (Alliance for Affordable Internet, 2020). Regardless of where a country stands in its develop- ment process, it should have a plan in place to address digital inequality. While a variety of efforts have tried to develop best practices for national broadband plans, each country will design its own plan based on its unique needs. We would highlight five key ele- ments of national broadband plans: data collection and broadband definitions, competition policies, spec- trum policies, universal service goals and policies, and measures to address adoption gaps. Prerequisites for good policymakers include a stable, transparent, im- partial \u2013 and ideally independent \u2013 regulator, one not subject to undue influence by market actors (Broad- band Commission Working Group, 2014).

The definition of broadband changes over time to reflect advances in technology, market offerings, and consumer demand. Broadband definitions vary widely across the APR and necessarily require some balancing of the realistic and the desired. If governments adopt an antiquated broadband definition and update it too infrequently, they risk further increasing the digital divide. To the extent that a national regulator wants to pro- mote competition, it will need to establish competition rules. Effective competition needs effective protec- tion, particularly at the early stages of market open- ing (Broadband Commission Working Group, 2014). An investor seeking entry into a given market will look for competition rules that offer protection from anti-com- petitive behaviour by a dominant incumbent or a col- lusive group. Effective competition requires two main elements: clear rules and effective enforcement by the appropriate authorities. Anti-competitive practices subject to proscription \u2014 either by general competi- tion, if it exists, or by telecommunication legislation \u2014 usually include predatory pricing, undue price discrim- ination, excessive pricing, margin squeeze, refusal to supply, or other strategies to foreclose the market (Broadband Commission Working Group, 2014). As discussed previously, most of the world\u2019s popula- tion accesses the Internet on a mobile or fixed wireless connection. For this reason, spectrum policy, or the way in which regulators manage their national radio frequencies, will play a critical role in achieving uni- versal connectivity goals. Smart spectrum policy can literally change the cost-economics of deploying wire- less networks11 \u2013 expanding access in underserved and to unserved communities, increasing competition, and reducing costs for consumers. To support net- work operator deployments, regulators should make spectrum available across a range of low-band, mid- band, and high-band frequencies. They should also allocate sufficient spectrum on an exclusive-use basis for mobile operator networks. Spectrum should also be made available on a non-exclusive unlicensed or li- cense-exempt basis for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a variety of other technologies used for providing fixed-wire- less last-mile access. These fixed wireless technolo- gies include those that can operate on low-band (e.g., TV white spaces12), mid-band (e.g., 5GHz bands), and high-band spectrum (e.g., millimetre wave bands). The emergence of various types of spectrum-sharing technologies have enabled something called dynam- ic spectrum access, giving regulators tools to allow 10 The Broadband Commission noted \u201c[s]ome of the data available for measuring progress against the targets is more robust for developed countries and remains a challenge for some developing countries. There may be other methodologies to collect similar, or proxy, datasets, and/or consider reporting on a semi-annual basis rather than annual. As such, further discussion on these challenges, possibilities and trade-offs is required\u201d (Broadband Commission, 2020b, p.39). 11 By opening up more large swaths of spectrum across complementary the low-, mid- and high-band spectrum, a regulator will enable a wireless network operator to optimize the placement of towers and other network infrastructure and thereby enable the network operator to serve more customers in more places at lower costs. 12 The TV white spaces are frequencies that have not been assigned or are otherwise not being used by broadcasters and other licensees in the VHF and UHF broadcast bands. The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 23 wireless networks operators access to new spectrum bands without displacing governmental or other users. In addition, regulators need to consider licensing for space-based satellite communications and experimen- tal high-altitude platforms. Universal service programs also have a role in the regulator\u2019s toolkit, especially in instances when the market alone cannot be relied upon to deliver afford- able mobile or fixed broadband to an underserved or unserved community. The ITU estimates that delivering high-quality broadband to the remaining global unconnected will require US$428 billion in additional investment over ten years (ITU, 2020f). To know when to intervene in the marketplace, regu- lators should establish clear and transparent uni- versal access goals and policies. For example, the Broadband Commission\u2019s Advocacy Target 3 states that, by 2025, broadband-Internet user penetration should reach 75 percent of the world\u2019s population, 65 percent in developing countries and 35 percent in least-developed countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2977c37-abd1-45d3-a428-8f8271072182": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2977c37-abd1-45d3-a428-8f8271072182", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-universal-digital-connectivity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Accelerating Universal Digital Connectivity", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-universal-digital-connectivity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "91c14385cd1c534865fac65c71a3f027bf2cab3fd9953e76965bbe5cf55801c7"}, "2": {"node_id": "804aecb8-9801-4a92-99b8-81c0be1ff47d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/accelerating-universal-digital-connectivity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e22c420d809d2aa82397bb984bff9888dda4538667bb5b7f77f80610c5efafaf"}}, "hash": "5da721086d0db40ff55086935e38a5332eec1eeac68bb4c239d66da39296dc45", "text": "This would typically require universal service programs focused on both broadband availability and adoption for the general population and for specified groups.

This paper has provided an overview of efforts across the APR to accelerate universal digital connectivity. A consistent theme is the persistence of digital inequal- ity that impacts people across the entire region. The COVID-19 pandemic has shined a bright light on these inequalities and increased the urgency of addressing them. With rapid progress in technologies, digital inequality runs the risk of widening at an accelerating pace over time. Addressing digital inequality, there- fore, should be at the top of any government\u2019s agenda. This inequality disproportionately impacts people in several classes: residents of low income and least de- veloped countries; those located in rural areas, in small island developing nations, and in landlocked develop- ing countries; those lacking literacy and digital skills; and those from traditionally disenfranchised groups, such as women and girls, persons with disabilities, and ethnic minorities. These digital divides will pose challenges central to development and economic policy as well as the SDGs. We have examined some of the policy decisions that governments will need to make and ways that the private sector and the international community may contribute to digital expansion. Ultimately, universal connectivity will prove a matter of more than simply creating access; it also will entail creating relevant and accessible content, making intensive efforts to expand digital literacy, and ensuring that connectivity and oth- er digital solutions are affordable for all.

This paper explores how governments can safeguard multiple features of human security, including ending depriva- tions, upholding rights and freedoms, protecting people from un- certainties and unpredictable events, and creating a strong foun- dation of human development. In order to create strong human security across the region, it is a government\u2019s responsibility to put policies into place that will protect its people \u2013 especially vulnerable populations, such as women, those who are impov- erished, people with disabilities, ethnic or religious minorities, children and the elderly \u2013 from lack of steady income, hunger, a lack of medical access and means of paying for it, abuse, perse- cution and discrimination. Governments must play a proactive role in enhancing capabilities, building people\u2019s agency and pro- moting human security by providing sufficient protection against downside risks. Three concerns should be at the forefront of future action: the role of the state vis-\u00e0-vis the private sector in the provision of basic social services; forming strategies to \u2018leave no one behind\u2019 rather than focusing only on economic growth; and promoting a more active engagement with the public to ensure greater involvement of different stakeholders in public decision-making. Nations need to re-envision their human devel- opment strategies to prioritize building resilience and empower- ment that can overcome insecurities, especially in the event of future unforeseen crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic.

The helplessness and lack of preparedness among individuals, families, communities and govern- ments during the pandemic has underscored the need to focus on human security \u2013 an idea first introduced in the 1994 Human Development Report and later articu- lated in the 2003 Report of the Commission on Human Security, chaired by Sadako Ogata and Amartya Sen (UNDP, 1994; Commission on Human Security, 2003). This paper revisits the idea of human security by examining efforts made over the past 25 years by Human security has many dimensions: economic, food, health, environmental, personal, community and politi- cal. Manifestations of insecurity include lacking a steady source of income, suffering from hunger, needing medi- cal attention without the means of paying for it, living in fear of abuse and feeling persecuted for belonging to a particular race or religion. As the 1994 Human Develop- ment Report states: In the final analysis, human security is a child who did not die, a disease that did not spread, a job that was not cut, an ethnic tension that did not explode in vio- lence, a dissident who was not silenced. Human se- curity is not a concern with weapons-it is a concern with human life and dignity (UNDP, 1994). Of the many dimensions and features of human securi- ty, four have prescriptive importance and will inform the rest of the discussion. First, human security means an end to deprivations. At a minimum, this requires a guar- anteed, steady source of income, freedom from hunger, good quality education and affordable healthcare, prevention of child abuse and domestic violence, and insurance of equal participation and non-discrimination.

Individual states, there- fore, need to create policies and programs that protect people from uncertainties and unpredictable events that could threaten their peaceful survival and dignity. For example, these policies should protect people from financial crises, natural disasters that destroy property and leave families homeless, and from future pandem- ics or health crises. Fourth, human security and human development complement each other. Human develop- ment has an inherently optimistic quality, given its focus on expanding freedoms, enhancing capabilities, in- creasing opportunities and guaranteeing human rights. Human security complements human development by focusing on protection from unforeseen downside risks. This paper begins by assessing the current state of hu- man development in Asia-Pacific countries and the im- mediate effects of the COVID-19 crisis before identify- ing a set of priority actions urgently needed to promote human security. INTRODUCTION: THE IDEA OF HUMAN SECURITY 1 See, for instance, the text of Amartya Sen\u2019s acceptance speech of 18 October 2020 after being awarded the 2020 Peace Prize of the German Book Trade by the German Publishers and Booksellers Association (Peace Prize of the German Book Trade, 2020). The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 6 Discussions of Asia-Pacific development often over- look one of its distinct achievements. Between 1990- 2019, South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific record- ed the highest annual rates of increase in the Human Development Index (HDI) (Table 1). ment, whereas 14 were in the \u2018medium\u2019 human devel- opment category (UNDP, 2020a). The backlog of human deprivations in the APR remains large. The benefits of economic growth have reached only a few, and not the poorest and most vulnerable: An estimated 400 million continue to live in extreme poverty. Unequal economic growth has, in many in- stances, worsened the power asymmetries between rich and poor, weakened social cohesion and under- mined stability. Large disparities continue to prevent millions of families from leading secure lives and living in dignity. Despite gains in health, access to health- care and other basic services remains unequal and far from universal. Gender inequality continues to hamper development. A rising proportion of older people risk social exclusion, and a growing number of persons with disabilities face marginalization. Migrant workers and their families remain highly vulnerable.3 Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Asia and the Pacific had emerged as the world\u2019s fastest-growing region, leading the world in poverty reduction. Incomes ex- panded over the past three decades and pulled millions out of poverty. Impressive improvements in access to goods and services have resulted in significant gains in child survival, life expectancy and standards of living. Despite these achievements, many countries in the APR continue to face serious human development challenges. In 2019, 31 out of the 46 countries in the APR fell in the category of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Only 15 were high-income coun- tries.2 Levels of human development also vary widely within the region. In 2019, Hong Kong (China) ranked fourth in the Human Development Index (HDI), while Afghanistan \u2013 a low human-development country \u2013 ranked 169th out of 189 countries. 22 countries fell into the category of \u2018very high\u2019 and \u2018high\u2019 human develop- HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC 2 Low-income economies are defined as those with a gross national income (GNI) per capita, calculated using the World Bank Atlas method, of US$1,035 or less in 2019; lower middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita between $1,036 and $4,045; upper middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita between $4,046 and $12,535; high-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $12,536 or more (The World Bank, 2021). 3 The discussion on the backlog of deprivations in the APR draws on ESCAP (2017).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93353e98-918b-4d0a-a5f2-3fbd92f026d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "93353e98-918b-4d0a-a5f2-3fbd92f026d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "COVID-19 and Human Insecurity", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "75328c7377314e362045c60947e5be240706296c3c6be1e41129eee38d8ed6e2"}, "2": {"node_id": "1d328a09-0df7-41e7-8319-276991b46afe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0cb02f4b931aa4a5dc711992a667fecbc554b74371f6cae9a1ab01f19136d60b"}}, "hash": "d42c128e94cf5e5b7253621dc517050eaebea2e3ced147279e383ef0eeb1843f", "text": "Table 1: Human Development Index trends, 1990\u20132019 Source: UNDP (2020a) Regions South Asia East Asia and the Pacific Sub-Saharan Africa Arab States Latin America and the Caribbean Europe and Central Asia World Human Development Index (HDI) Value 0.437 0.517 0.404 0.556 0.632 0.662 0.601 1990 2015 2010 2018 2000 2017 2014 2019 Average annual HDI growth % 1990- 2019 0.620 0.724 0.535 0.691 0.759 0.775 0.724 0.580 0.688 0.501 0.676 0.736 0.739 0.699 0.637 0.740 0.544 0.702 0.764 0.787 0.734 0.501 0.595 0.426 0.614 0.690 0.675 0.644 0.635 0.735 0.542 0.699 0.762 0.785 0.732 0.612 0.718 0.530 0.687 0.756 0.772 0.720 0.641 0.747 0.547 0.705 0.766 0.791 0.737 1.330 1.280 1.050 0.820 0.670 0.620 0.710 Note: Regions have been ranked in descending order", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d383cbdb-db09-4bd4-ab09-5de586956181": {"__data__": {"id_": "d383cbdb-db09-4bd4-ab09-5de586956181", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "COVID-19 and Human Insecurity", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "93e89662c08b49b1beeb537b5083a49c272d493f47b2f013b51e44e2722f538d"}, "3": {"node_id": "729e3480-cf53-4a35-94a9-878f86c23226", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e326d93252b0a49f375b5559e6977e6679d2c5855eed10132583f43bf374c22"}}, "hash": "a348266a2bd969993414441ec72084e0861be9d3e1f6bb7cdab27a34db106d1c", "text": "of the 1990-2019 average annual HDI growth. The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 7 A recent analysis by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reaffirms that policies in many Asia-Pacific countries have failed to translate high economic growth into tangible benefits for people in terms of better health, improved education, cleaner environments, or better access to basic social ser- vices. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the APR was on an unsustainable development trajectory. Rapid demographic growth, migration, high popula- tion density, displacement of animals and changes in land use had created ripe conditions for the rise of zoonotic diseases and their transmission to humans. The high dependence of growth on fossil fuels, as well as unsustainable production and consump- tion patterns, had begun to push against planetary boundaries. Rising inequality within most countries had exacerbated social tensions and several coun- tries were experiencing protracted conflicts (UNDP Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific, 2020). Children\u2019s lives in South Asia remain insecure in many different ways (UNICEF, 2021). More than 60 percent of deaths in South Asia among children younger than 5 occur during the first month of life. Of the 144 million children who are stunted worldwide, 56 million, or nearly two in five, live in South Asia. Maternal mortality rates also vary widely with Afghanistan being among the countries with the highest rates globally. In 2017, South Asia had the second highest share of children living in extreme poverty (at 10.2 percent) and ac- counted for 18 percent of the world\u2019s extremely poor children (Silwal et al., 2017). Young girls in most parts of South Asia lack the freedom to pursue their ambitions. Early marriage, in particular, remains a stumbling block. Levels of child marriage vary greatly across South Asia, with the highest prevalence in Bangladesh \u2013 home to 38 million child brides married before their 18th birthday, including 13 million who mar- ried before the age of 15 (UNICEF, 2020a). The backlog of human deprivations in the APR suggests that the region has not been able to convert economic expansion into tangible benefits and increased securi- ty in the lives of its peoples. Among the many reasons for the region\u2019s under-performance in advancing human development and human security, six stand out: 1. Failure to create decent jobs. Although the APR has seen robust economic growth, many govern- ments have proven unable to create sufficient job opportunities, especially for the more than 700 million young people in the region. According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), 20 percent of the region\u2019s workers aged between 15 and 24 account for almost half the jobless (ILO, 2021a). A majority of the employed young people (about 300 million) do not have decent4 jobs. For many, the option of staying unemployed does not exist. As a result, they often have no choice but to take up jobs that offer poor pay, poor conditions and poor pros- pects. As a consequence, they struggle for econom- ic security and dignity, and to build a secure future for their families. The youth employment challenge is made more complex given the interconnections between economic development, child labour, rural livelihoods, urban and trans-border migration, gen- der, poverty and vulnerability. 2. The neglect of health justice. Most of the coun- tries in the APR have yet to fully embrace the idea of universal health coverage. More than 40 years after the 1978 Alma Ata Declaration, health is still not recognized as a fundamental right, and nation- al governments, as well as the world community, have not taken the necessary actions to protect and promote the health of all (WHO, 1978). The 1978 Declaration underscored gross inequalities in health status across and within countries as politically, so- cially and economically unacceptable. They remain a concern even now. The Declaration had called for attaining \u2018Health for All\u2019 by the year 2000 \u2013 a goal that required making primary healthcare (PHC) the cornerstone of health systems. The reach of primary healthcare remains extremely limited in many coun- tries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "729e3480-cf53-4a35-94a9-878f86c23226": {"__data__": {"id_": "729e3480-cf53-4a35-94a9-878f86c23226", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "COVID-19 and Human Insecurity", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "93e89662c08b49b1beeb537b5083a49c272d493f47b2f013b51e44e2722f538d"}, "2": {"node_id": "d383cbdb-db09-4bd4-ab09-5de586956181", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a348266a2bd969993414441ec72084e0861be9d3e1f6bb7cdab27a34db106d1c"}}, "hash": "7e326d93252b0a49f375b5559e6977e6679d2c5855eed10132583f43bf374c22", "text": "The reach of primary healthcare remains extremely limited in many coun- tries.

It involves opportunities for work that is productive and delivers a fair income, security in the workplace and social protection for families, better prospects for personal development and social integration, freedom for people to express their concerns, organize and participate in the decisions that affect their lives and equality of opportunity and treatment for all women and men\u201d (ILO, 2021b). A joint ILO-Eurofound report identifies the following seven dimensions of job quality: the physical environment, work intensity, working time quality, the social environment, skills and development, prospects, and earnings (ILO, 2019). The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 8 also resulted in extremely high private out-of-pock- et expenditures in the APR. Such expenditures run as high as 50-60 percent in Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, 62 percent in India and 74-75 percent in Afghanistan and Bangladesh (WHO, 2021). These private health costs have emerged as a major cause of impoverishment. 3. The neglect of basic education. Education is a valu- able achievement in itself and a key component of a flourishing life, regardless of whether the individual earns an income or not. Education also has instru- mental significance. It contributes to health and wealth and adds to a person\u2019s freedom to do the ma- ny things they value. Education develops civic skills, particularly important for strengthening responsible citizenship, promoting public participation and deep- ening democracy. Finally, education has powerful empowerment and distributive roles \u2014 the ability to resist oppression, to organize politically, and to nego- tiate better conditions, even within families.5 Despite the significant role that education plays in society, many countries in the APR have failed to provide uni- versal quality school education to children. The mean years of schooling in South Asia (6.5 years) is only marginally higher than in Sub-Saharan Africa (5.8 years) and considerably lower than the average in the Arab region (7.3 years) and the world (8.5 years) (HDRO, 2020). Insufficient investment in teacher edu- cation and training, as well as in school infrastructure, has hampered quality education provision. Curricula often tend to be outdated and do not align with the needs of future labour markets. 4. Gender inequality and lack of women\u2019s economic empowerment. Sustainable and inclusive societies must prioritize women\u2019s equal access to ownership and control of land, property and other resources. A study by the McKinsey Global Institute estimated that with gender parity, Asian countries as a whole could gain US$4.4 trillion of additional gross domes- tic product (GDP) by 2025 if they matched the fast- est-improving country in the region; the full potential could go even higher.6 Women in most Asian-Pacific countries do not enjoy the same freedoms as women living in other parts of the world. In societies without systematic discrim- ination against girls and women, women outnumber men in the total population. In South Asia, with the exception of Nepal and Sri Lanka, men outnumber women in the total population \u2013 indicating the anti- female biases that still dominate society. These biases deny girls and women equal opportunities to study, work, or even marry when and whom they choose to. This reflects the dominant patriarchal character of most Asian-Pacific societies. Girls in many Asian-Pacific countries face more edu- cational deprivation than boys. Except in Sri Lanka, the youth literacy rate (15-24 years) is lower for girls than for boys in all countries of South Asia. In Afghan- istan, for instance, the female youth literacy rate is only 32 percent against the male rate of 62 percent. Attitudes towards the abuse of wives also capture the subordinate position of women. According to the Demographic Health Surveys,7 in Afghanistan, for instance, eight in 10 ever-married women and more than seven in 10 men agree that a husband may be justified in hitting or beating his wife (CSO, MoPH and ICF, 2017). 32 percent of women and 17 percent of married men in Indonesia consider wife-beating justified in at least one of the five specified circum- stances (National Population and Family Planning Board et al., 2018). In India, the percentages run to 42 percent of men and 52 percent of women (IIPS and ICF, 2017). 5.

The methodology and survey questions are standardised across countries. Attitudes towards justification of wife-beating are based on response to a set of five questions regarding the conditions under which hitting or beating one\u2019s wife would be justifiable. The five questions are: 1) if she goes out without telling her husband; 2) if she argues with her husband; 3) if she neglects the children; 4) if she refuses to have sexual intercourse with her husband; and 5) if she burns food (Guide to DHS Statistics, n.d.). 8 See, for instance, the discussion in ESCAP and ILO (2021). The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 9 catastrophic medical expenditures continue to im- poverish a large number of families that do not have access to affordable treatment, and push vulnerable households back into poverty. Even where pension schemes exist, the amount individuals receive is insufficient to cover basic needs. Significant under- investment in social protection bears much of the responsibility for the situation. According to United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and ILO (2021), excluding health, many countries in the region spend less than two percent of GDP on social protection, compared to the global average of 11 percent. The limited coverage of social protection programs in the APR also arises from the employment of a large workforce in the informal sector. More than 80 percent of all South Asia's workers, for instance, engage in informal activities, and more than 90 percent of the region's businesses are informal (Bussolo, Sharma and Timmer, 2020). Even in many formal firms, a large proportion of employment con- sists of informal workers, for instance in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Women make up a disproportionate percentage of workers in the informal sector and re- main particularly vulnerable because they typically work for lower wages and in unsafe conditions. Migrant workers face particularly bad conditions in many countries. For instance, according to the Thailand Migration Report 2019, there were ap- proximately 3.9 million (non-Thai) migrant workers in Thailand, constituting almost 10 percent of the work- force (Harkins, 2019). Of these, some 21 percent undertook so-called \u2018irregular\u2019 work (working with- out work permits). Persistent labour abuses against migrant workers of any gender in regular and irreg- ular work continues, including forced labour, such as deceptive recruitment practices and withholding wages. Most migrant workers find themselves de- nied fundamental rights, including access to basic social services. Migrant sex workers in Thailand, in particular, experience stigma and live in constant fear of harassment and arrest, as well as uncertainty in their family-supporting incomes. 6. Neglect of the most disadvantaged. Most of the countries in the APR have failed to ensure that benefits of economic expansion accrue to the most disadvantaged groups in society. The list is long and includes broad categories of vulnerable wom- en, children (including children in care institutions), youth and adolescents (particularly girls), older per- sons and people with disabilities. Economic insecu- rities concentrate not only among those in poverty, but also those with insecure incomes, low-income and informal economy workers, including those in the gig economy, internal migrant workers and mi- grant workers in foreign countries. People infected with COVID-19 and those in quarantine and their families, healthcare providers and frontline workers (especially during pandemics) face severe health insecurity, as do those living with HIV/AIDS and other chronic medical conditions, those in need of mental health and psychological support, those with general medical needs, and people with alcohol de- pendence and substance abuse disorders.

Several recent reports have documented the devastating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lives and livelihoods of millions of people in the APR.9 Only a small minority of privileged has escaped relatively unscathed. A recent UNDP report on the APR (2020) identifies three major adverse impacts of the pandemic: Global value chains and the supply and demand shock. Governments face twin supply- and demand-side shocks. Loss of livelihoods and higher unemployment have greatly reduced the demand for goods and ser- vices. At the same time, the pandemic has severely disrupted global value chains, halted production and reduced the supply of goods and services. The adverse effects on economies highly integrated in value chains, such as China, have negatively impacted the closely integrated economies of other countries in the region, including Cambodia, Hong Kong (China), Japan, Malay- sia, Singapore, the Republic of Korea, Thailand and Viet Nam. Moreover, restrictions on cross-border move- ments \u2014 and associated delays and cost increases \u2014 are likely to amplify the impact on value chains, affect- ing China and much of East and Southeast Asia. These shocks severely affect small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in particular, because of their limited access to resources and working capital; these firms account for more than 96 percent of all businesses and for two thirds of private sector jobs. The social crisis. The cascading effects of the pan- demic on employment in Asia and the Pacific have drastically cut production and increased trade barriers, reduced global demand and imposed restrictions on movement. As a result, the situation has worsened in many countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Myanmar and Viet Nam that had already faced crises in employment and job losses even before the pan- demic. While poverty has substantially declined in Asia and the Pacific, its rate of reduction has slowed down since 2010, and the COVID-19 pandemic will likely reverse a considerable part of these gains. The World Bank expects over 11 million people in East Asia to fall into poverty in 2020, with many more likely to do so across South Asia (The World Bank, 2020a). The gender impacts. A third type of crisis has also emerged: the crisis in caregiving, severely impact- ing the already high gender inequality in the APR. Although large-scale evidence, specifically from Asia-Pacific, remains limited, it is clear that women have experienced a particularly adverse impact from COVID-19, given the gendered nature of the health workforce and the accompanying risks that predomi- nantly female health workers face, as well as their low- er wages, higher share of unpaid care and the burden of domestic work. Additionally, the load on women has risen steeply compared to normal times because of school closures affecting over 850 million learners in the APR. Moreover, women principally shoulder the in- creased need for care of elderly relatives more at risk for COVID-19-related complications.10 Recent evidence points to a marked rise in domestic violence, and in discrimination at the workplace, as employers may see women overloaded with care obligations as less com- petitive and committed than male colleagues. The crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic had, in the initial phase of the lockdown, brought South Asia in particular to a near-standstill. Reports on the impact of the pandemic pointed out, for instance, that the economic disruption was visible from space. South Asia had darkened between March and August 2020, and night-time light intensity had declined in more than three quarters of South Asia\u2019s districts (The World Bank, 2020b). The temporary school closures in South Asian countries had kept an estimated 391 million students out of school in primary and secondary ed- ucation. The pandemic may cause up to 5.5 million stu- dents to drop out of the education system altogether. In 2020, an additional 3.9 million children in South Asia under the age of five could suffer from wasting \u2013 and therefore become dangerously undernourished \u2013 as a result of the socioeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (Headey et al., 2020).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf3be811-7ff2-4612-94ab-b475d6ce39fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf3be811-7ff2-4612-94ab-b475d6ce39fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "COVID-19 and Human Insecurity", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2ac0ddb65f11376f3efb123707b99bd859adc59e39f229e38bc3c28029c4021"}, "2": {"node_id": "f6470334-2946-4abf-8d91-83d870df86b0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "638a0a289ef7844b1b59ebe2368f5b6304a33cf234ae3e2b82af537f4728fc80"}}, "hash": "e593526596bf9a8a9ef0321983837057cf10f727751a1b51849138f517ebd115", "text": "Additionally, approx- imately 29 million babies that were expected to be born in South Asia in the approximately nine months since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020, risked hav- ing no access", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81e59585-fc1f-40b9-ab3b-eb8f0757f6dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "81e59585-fc1f-40b9-ab3b-eb8f0757f6dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "COVID-19 and Human Insecurity", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fafd1fd6c657254d9b8e548c9fbe603c799cfef86e352b7ab8dfb2895e911708"}, "3": {"node_id": "86a1733b-eca5-4928-96ee-070f781f345a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1dc49d8137b6517ff50fbd007fe89437f8c4725543fcb3e529cca0be6c9d2a4"}}, "hash": "2b7a4e817fb0d8f7f9f4578fcfb8baeb464af45d7a1a258ed8c9eba40920840f", "text": "to primary healthcare due to stress on existing health systems and medical supply chains (UNICEF, 2020b).

The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 11 We can learn much from the experience of countries in the APR, both those more and less successful in promoting human development and reducing insecu- rities (especially those exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic). A number of Asian-Pacific countries have received global recognition for their successes in han- dling the pandemic. These include Japan, New Zea- land, Hong Kong (China), Republic of Korea, Thailand, Viet Nam, Singapore and Bhutan. Japan does not have large national public health agencies, such as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, that it can draw on for technical support during pandemics. Instead, Japan was able to minimize the adverse impacts of COVID-19 through its unique model of regionalized public health delivery. This consisted of local pub- lic health centres (PHCs), hokenjo in Japanese, that doubled as \u2018miniature CDCs\u2019 within their respective communities (Hamaguchi et al., 2020). While PHCs illustrate the importance of strong local public health institutions, capable of swift adaptation to their local context, it is notable that these centres proved unable to facilitate testing. New Zealand demonstrated the importance of con- tinued surveillance. It also pioneered a social bubble model that allowed a defined group of people to have close physical contact with each other while practising physical distancing rules with others outside of that group (Cook et al., 2020). Hong Kong, Japan and the Republic of Korea had an advantage: the habit of mask-wearing by people with respiratory conditions \u2014 already widespread before the COVID-19 pandemic as a way of protecting others from seasonal viruses or as a reaction to air pollution. After making mask-wearing mandatory in April 2020, Singapore's Government provided reusable cloth masks to the entire population (Han et al., 2020). Several factors seem to have underpinned Thailand\u2019s success: a combination of government action, social responsibility and community solidarity ensured con- tinued vigilance. Thailand also adopted a whole-of-so- ciety approach and ramped-up testing as borders reopened and full economic activities resumed (Sabharwal, 2020). Viet Nam\u2019s successful tackling of the COVID-19 pan- demic highlights the importance of preparedness in dealing with infectious diseases, critical for protecting people and minimizing their insecurities. Viet Nam had the advantage of an existing long-term plan for coping with public health emergencies, built on its previous experience with disease outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To that extent, Viet Nam\u2019s success in dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak rests, at least in part, on the investments made during pre-pandemic \u2018peacetime.\u2019 Collectively, early pre- paredness, contact tracing, isolation and mass molecu- lar (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) testing, coupled with timely border closure, physical distancing and community adherence, have determined the success of Viet Nam\u2019s control of COVID-19 (Malhotra, 2020; Van Tan, 2021). Several similar factors have contributed to Bhutan\u2019s success in containing the spread of the pandemic (Drexler, 2021). The country prioritized investing in preparedness, and, as early, as mid-January 2020, had drafted and put in place its National Preparedness and Response Plan. A rigorous and altruistic state and pub- lic health response was accompanied by genuine civic compassion and engagement from King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, the Queen Mother, Bhutan\u2019s mo- nastic community, cabinet ministers, political leaders, government officials and ordinary citizens, including farmers, volunteers, hoteliers and others. The govern- ment drew on its existing strengths and enhanced its capacities by shifting technicians from livestock-health and food-safety programs to its COVID-19 testing corps and by instructing non-specialist doctors and nurses in the clinical management of respiratory infec- tions and WHO protocols.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86a1733b-eca5-4928-96ee-070f781f345a": {"__data__": {"id_": "86a1733b-eca5-4928-96ee-070f781f345a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "COVID-19 and Human Insecurity", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fafd1fd6c657254d9b8e548c9fbe603c799cfef86e352b7ab8dfb2895e911708"}, "2": {"node_id": "81e59585-fc1f-40b9-ab3b-eb8f0757f6dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b7a4e817fb0d8f7f9f4578fcfb8baeb464af45d7a1a258ed8c9eba40920840f"}}, "hash": "a1dc49d8137b6517ff50fbd007fe89437f8c4725543fcb3e529cca0be6c9d2a4", "text": "Notably, the above exemplary governments also made it possible for citizens to follow public health guidance LESSONS LEARNED \u201cUnsustainable growth and unequal human development, coupled with high levels of vulnerability, has meant widespread and unequal impacts from the economic and health crises caused by COVID-19\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 12 by providing those required to quarantine with eco- nomic and social support.

New Zealand\u2019s Prime Minister and the Director General of Health have also won credit for their firm yet empathetic direct communications with the public (Han et al., 2020). In Singapore, close to 95 percent of confirmed cases appeared among migrant workers living in overcrowd- ed dormitories. The government responded by imme- diately improving disinfection regimens, establishing medical facilities onsite and shielding workers older than 45 years by moving them to less dense accom- modation (Han et al., 2020). Beyond these successes lie the broader challenges of ensuring human security. But most countries today do not yet have in place the needed institutions, policies and priorities. This needs to change. The Commission on Human Security has proposed mobilizing a global initiative to place human security at the top of local, national, regional and global agendas. This initiative would aim to prevent conflict and advance human rights and development; protect and empower people and their communities; deepen democratic principles and practices; and overall, promote a human security culture and framework. Promoting human development has to go hand- in-hand with enhancing human security through measures that focus on protecting and expanding freedoms during downturns as well as in prosper- ity. Countries needs to fulfil its legal obligations to protect and promote human rights, including the right to social security, and ensure their exercise with- out discrimination. Governments should create the enabling conditions and forge partnerships with civil society organizations and other stakeholders, both to safeguard people from threats, and simultaneous- ly empower them to take charge of their own lives (Commission on Human Security, 2003). THE WAY FORWARD The three pillars of human development - embedding values, enhancing capabilities and promoting agency \u2013 spotlighted by the 2020 Human Development Re- port (2020a) have an equally central role in guarantee- ing human security (Figure 1). Figure 1: Three pillars for promoting human development and security Source: UNDP (2020a) Human Development and Human Security Embedding Values Enhancing Capabilities Promoting Agency The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 13 EMBEDDING VALUES A new approach to development must begin with reaffirming human values enshrined in the constitu- tions of countries. These would include, for example, adherence to social, economic, cultural and political justice, liberty of thought, expression, faith, belief and worship, equality of status and opportunity, and solidarity assuring the dignity of the individual as well as the unity and integrity of the nation. The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development foregrounds these values as central to transforming the world. There are, of course, numerous instances where communities in different countries of the APR came forward to help stranded migrant workers and others who lost their sources of livelihood. Never- theless, states and societies, as a whole, will need to commit much more conscious investment to instilling a sense of community, non-discrimination and solidar- ity. This might require revisiting how school educa- tion inculcates values in the young, and also finding new mechanisms and platforms that can proactively strengthen actions by community organisations and others to build social solidarity and social cohesion. ENHANCING CAPABILITIES The following priorities have a particularly critical role in developing human and institutional capabilities. Establishing effective social protection systems. The umbrella of social security and social protection broadly includes universal social protection, including benefits for sickness, unemployment, occupational injury and survivorship; and a social protection floor consisting of essential services \u2013 ensuring availability, continuity and accessibility in public services, such as housing, water and sanitation, education, health in- cluding maternal and child care as well as family plan- ning services, and family-focused social work support \u2013 and social transfers \u2013 a basic set of essential social transfers, in cash and in kind, paid to the poor, older persons and the vulnerable to enhance food security and nutrition, and to provide a minimum-income secu- rity, particularly in cases of sickness, unemployment and disability. This will call for correcting the historical under-invest- ment and prioritizing the provision of basic social ser- vices, with the following as primary goals: Universal health coverage. Progress towards universal health coverage will require renewed political com- mitment, adequate investments in people and infra- structure, as well as an effective regulatory framework to ensure accountability. An increase in public spend- ing will be necessary to reduce the burden of private out-of-pocket expenditures on healthcare.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3eccf13a-9040-4df7-8838-f74863f03dfc": {"__data__": {"id_": "3eccf13a-9040-4df7-8838-f74863f03dfc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "COVID-19 and Human Insecurity", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c1c5c458886772eaac637a8d2b29a9262b778ad23759190db43ce7b8b0cfe4f"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7213e29-13be-481b-8919-23ae33f52251", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "50eb07238a247620e46f0754b074284ecf3b0dd98f9fef53b8d7b713904c7220"}}, "hash": "50faf8159e8cab2d7e8d62b00ab8eee89b8b4d6bfb0cd852071b8bbcf3009755", "text": "Commu- nity-based health initiatives will need to be strength- ened to ensure access to primary healthcare for all.

The present mo- ment seems opportune for revisiting the Commission on Human Security\u2019s recommended approach to work and work-based security. Secure livelihoods depend on finding sustained and creative ways of ensuring both income and meaningful work. This will require addressing issues of access to land, credit, training and education, especially for poor women. Equally critical measures would ensure a social and economic minimum for all, including the working poor and those in unpaid work. Special measures should increase pro- tections for those in chronic poverty as well as those most vulnerable to economic hardship during econom- ic downturns, disasters and crises, including women, children, people with disabilities and the elderly. PROMOTING AGENCY Individual states and societies must make concerted efforts to ensure four conditions that can promote agency and empowerment: 1. A well-educated society in which everyone has the freedom to express their views without fear. 2. A free press whose reporting on the failures of the ruling administration or the sufferings faced by the poor does not stand compromised because of pres- sures from the government in power. 3. A culture of open public discussion where opinions can be expressed without fear and in the true spirit of encouraging public debate. 4. A listening government open to engaging and learning in an effort to come up with solutions \u2013 as opposed to a government that uses its majority to pass legislation without a debate and discussion. Fulfilling these conditions will go a long way toward deepening democracy and establishing a supportive framework for other security needs. Even as nations step up to mitigate and reverse the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, it be- comes necessary to re-envision the role of state gov- ernments. Governments must play a proactive role in enhancing capabilities, building people\u2019s agency and promoting human security by providing sufficient pro- tection against downside risks. Three concerns should provide a focus. The first addresses the disconcerting absence of serious public discussion on the role of the state vis-\u00e0-vis the private sector in the provision of basic social services. In a number of countries (and in South Asia in particular), governments appear to have abdicat- ed their responsibilities to assure adequate protection to citizens. No country in the world has managed to pro- vide universal healthcare or universal schooling without the dominant presence of the public sector. It is, there- fore, disturbing to see a sharp increase in the share of both health and education delivery now in the hands of the private sector \u2013 along with a possibly unwitting withdrawal by the public sector. Second, governments in many nations appear to have reached their limit in evolving strategies to \u2018leave no one behind.\u2019 Differentiated strategies under the umbrella of universal coverage could ensure that the most disadvantaged groups also gain access to basic social services and social protection benefits. Third, states often appear overly preoccupied with promot- ing economic growth. Policymakers need to pay equal attention \u2013 if not more \u2013 to creating conditions for human development, including deepening of democ- racy, mitigating and preventing the human impacts of climate change, reducing human insecurities, decreas- ing inequalities and addressing social injustices. At the same time, states and societies should promote more active engagement with the public and ensure greater involvement of different stakeholders in public decision-making. Many schisms in society have roots in misconceptions and entrenched belief systems that obstruct the building of social cohesion and social soli- darity. Advocates fighting violence against women and children, for instance, have called for changing social norms, but progress in changing behaviours has", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3c855ac-9b89-4c99-8a18-319dc606a5f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3c855ac-9b89-4c99-8a18-319dc606a5f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "COVID-19 and Human Insecurity", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2eb12f8cc67a6f55633ea1ac02ff9cea3b6639e057edc1795bae891cd2087c66"}, "3": {"node_id": "a85cc901-23d9-4670-b32d-c5447ce647d1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "584fbacd0fcb031b7b94b0735e43cc4fdbd5a5b37e447f7150f28e3566e64f21"}}, "hash": "774c5f61792f2e017f2e8007ba4e52cae35066fc1d99f2f892796054a1f53176", "text": "not kept pace with recorded economic gains. The avail- able means and media for influencing social norms and behaviours have increased phenomenally over the past two decades. Whereas the role of traditional com- munications media seems to have declined, the expan- sion in social media has brought phenomenal disrup- tion. One could cite many instances of social media platforms used effectively in critical public health out- reach. At the same time, the misuse of these platforms has also propagated hate speech and violence. CONCLUSION The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 15 Addressing these gaps in development requires proactive measures to change social norms and be- haviours. Towards this end, the 2020 Human De- velopment Report recommends promoting learning and ensuring an alignment between self-interest and common goals. Governments need to create more favourable conditions: making behavioural change feasible, attractive and profitable for the majority of people, promoting agency through participatory ap- proaches, and introducing laws and incentives that encourage desirable behaviour and innovation. Much remains to be learned about which efforts in this area will work best. Careful design and execution of such efforts, along with documentation and disseminating outcomes, will foster that learning. One final, crucial lesson: the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that high incomes alone cannot guaran- tee health security. The Global Health Security (GHS) Index 201911 benchmarks 195 countries according to the Index\u2019s definition of their level of \u2018preparedness\u2019 for dealing with epidemics or pandemics (Table 2). High-income countries filled the list of the GHS top five \u2018most prepared\u2019 countries, with Thailand a lower-in- come outlier (GHS rank 6). The United States and the United Kingdom ranked first and second, respective- ly, for pandemic preparedness on the GHS Index, but by 15 April 2021, the two countries showed among the poorest rankings for preventing deaths due to COVID-19 per 100,000 population. Looking at preparedness in terms of actually being able to prevent pandemic deaths instead of using the GHS-defined preparedness, of the 178 countries that had COVID-19-related cases and deaths as of 15 April 2021, the United States and United Kingdom rank 164th and 167th \u2013 in other words, they registered the 14th and 11th highest death rates, respectively. This disastrous re- al-world performance compares especially poorly to low- er-GHS-ranked but higher-death-preventing countries in Asia, such as the global leaders, Viet Nam (49th on GHS vs. 1st for low death rate), or Bhutan (83rd on GHS vs. 4th for low death rate). Only Thailand ranked highly for both pandemic preparedness and performance. 11 The Global Health Security (GHS) Index, developed by the Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health Security, the Economist Intelligence Unit and the Nuclear Threat Initiative, is the first comprehensive assessment and benchmarking of health security and related capabilities across 195 countries. The measure aims to gauge the capacity of national health systems in contributing to global health security. The GHS Index uses 140 questions to make this assessment, organised across six categories: prevention of the emergence or release of pathogens; early detection and reporting for epidemics of potential international concern; rapid response to and mitigation of the spread of the epidemic; sufficient and robust health system to treat the sick and protect health workers; commitments to improving national capacity, financing plans to address gaps, and adhering to global norms; overall risk environment and country vulnerability to biological threats. Among its 140 questions, the GHS Index prioritizes not only country capacities, but also the existence of functional, tested, proven capabilities for stopping outbreaks at the source (GHS, 2021).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a85cc901-23d9-4670-b32d-c5447ce647d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "a85cc901-23d9-4670-b32d-c5447ce647d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "COVID-19 and Human Insecurity", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2eb12f8cc67a6f55633ea1ac02ff9cea3b6639e057edc1795bae891cd2087c66"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3c855ac-9b89-4c99-8a18-319dc606a5f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "774c5f61792f2e017f2e8007ba4e52cae35066fc1d99f2f892796054a1f53176"}}, "hash": "584fbacd0fcb031b7b94b0735e43cc4fdbd5a5b37e447f7150f28e3566e64f21", "text": "Table 2: GHS Index 2019 predicted pandemic preparedness rankings versus actual pandemic death prevention rankings as of 15 April 2021 (top and bottom) GHI predicted pandemic preparedness rank 2019 Overall Score Cumulative total COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 population 15 April 2021 Country 2019 World Bank country classifications by income level 2019 GNI per capita, Atlas Method (current US$) Actual pandemic death prevention rank 15 April 2021 Source: GHS (2021) High Income High Income High Income High Income High Income Lower-middle Income Lower-middle Income Upper-middle Income High Income High Income United States United Kingdom Netherlands Australia Canada Viet Nam Bhutan Thailand Singapore New Zealand 1 2 3 4 5 49 83 6 23 34 83,5 77,9 75,6 75,5 75,3 49,1 40,3 73,2 58,7 54.0 65.850 42.220 53.100 55.100 46.370 2.590 3.140 7.260 59.590 42.760 168,88 187,36 96,86 3,57 62,12 0,04 0,13 0,14 0,51 0,54 164 167 137 48 120 1 4 5 11 12 Note: Of the GHS 195 ranked countries, this table excludes countries in the WHO database that reported zero cumulative deaths per 100,000 population and the Global Health", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4db624b-67c7-49b5-83f7-4744528da752": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4db624b-67c7-49b5-83f7-4744528da752", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "COVID-19 and Human Insecurity", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a45277196c192e60bbd34a750770c7c67e75425791b6deba70eb00e82aedb0e8"}, "3": {"node_id": "f5181e9d-9162-4884-9254-202d3b4db221", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/covid-19-and-human-insecurity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "81f695903c41c8af25e9cf7b54b2258ddc85eeb838b2beadd4f8c8bf07965472"}}, "hash": "5ca611f88da8b0297e0de8b423193846fd232e511543785ebf1b87991c2db2cb", "text": "Security rankings have been recalculated for the remaining 178 countries. The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 16 Rich nations were perhaps overly confident and unpre- pared when the COVID-19 virus was detected. Both the United States and the United Kingdom (at least initially) floundered in their response, and their handling of the pandemic proved far worse than that of many much poorer nations. Many Western nations prioritised capac- ities, such as economic activity and equipment, and not capabilities, such as effective quarantining and efficient contact tracing (Yong, 2020). The poor handling of the COVID-19 pandemic reveals that many rich nations had little experience in deploying their enormous capacities, in contrast to East Asian and sub-Saharan countries that regularly deal with epidemics. These pandemic results imply that countries do not have to become rich first to reduce vulnerabilities, enhance security, and promote the dignity of human lives. It is possible for LMICs to protect people from downside risks. What seems less clear is how to do so, especially in a world undergoing rapid transformation led by the tech- nology and communication revolutions. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the fragility of the development foundations of most countries of the APR. A new ethic rooted firmly in human values should now guide policymaking. Such an ethic should recognize the importance of promoting and protecting not just eco- nomic and social freedoms, but civil, cultural and political freedoms, as well. Human insecurity stands heightened by increasing economic uncertainty, rising social inequal- ities and reduced mobility, all going hand-in-hand with increasing social fragmentation, growing authoritarianism and regressing democracy. The evaluative evidence remains limited, on what works, when and why, and for whom in different cultures and contexts, across and within nations. Tapping existing knowledge, encouraging innovations and generating new evidence will become critical in reimagining the approach to enhanced human security and accelerated human development. \u201cGovernments need to make behavioural change feasible, attractive and profitable for the majority of people, promoting agency through participatory approaches, and introducing laws and incentives that encourage desirable behaviour and innovation\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 17 REFERENCES Bussolo, Maurizi, Sharma, Siddharth and Timmer, Hans. 2020. \u201cCOVID-19 has worsened the woes of South Asia's informal sector.\u201d World Bank Blogs. 7 December.

MONTES ALIGNING SOVEREIGN DEBT FINANCING WITH CLIMATE ACTION IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 3 The Asia-Pacific Region (APR) has experienced prolonged eco- nomic growth in the past decades. However, these growth trends have come with great environmental costs, mainly through manu- facturing activities, consumption, and urbanization. Global climate change poses a risk to the APR\u2019s continued development. This Policy Brief explores how individual nations and the region must address these environmental concerns to avert an economic stall. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the degree of interdependence among APR economies through its network of global value chains; thus, climate change presents a clear threat to the region's entire economic model. The dominant features of the international financial system severely hamper climate finance options. Developing economies in the APR must contend with high financing costs for their physical climate investments. This Policy Brief investigates how nations can reorient investment decisions and mobilize necessary finances to sustain growth. It is also essential that the APR develop the social and political resolve to upgrade the social provisioning and care sectors (upon which APR economies depend) in tandem with economic growth and in the context of global climate change. Remedies would not only be appropriate for financing climate action; they would also prove necessary for the long-term sustainability and efficiency of inter- national financial markets.

One could see this as a kind of \u2018Great Re-emergence\u2019, since the territories in the APR had accounted for this same proportion of the global economy before industrial development began in the West. Whole swaths of the APR have undergone permanent change, accompa- nied by corresponding disruptions and widespread adjustments in social and political arrangements. These permanent transformations have been enabled by decades of vigorous economic growth, and these growth trends have, themselves, spawned an acceler- ating pattern of environmental costs, many induced by enlarged manufacturing activities, increased incomes that have in turn spurred expanded consumption baskets, and urbanization. Global climate change, in- teracting with the APR\u2019s achieved economic success- es, threatens to increase the steepness of the climb toward development. Without the necessary course corrections in its current growth path, which has relied heavily on installing the fossil-based technology of the West\u2019s industrial dominance, development in the APR may stall sometime in this century. This paper argues that acting now, both as individual nations and on a regional basis, can both avert this stall and mitigate the human and economic costs of the action itself.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d6039740-238a-453f-920d-d57673fee2cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "d6039740-238a-453f-920d-d57673fee2cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Aligning Sovereign Debt Financing with Climate Action in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1646c55d400b19f9df757845ba18b3cd349e6b396b89a061ef5e40ad9753a135"}, "2": {"node_id": "39f51d42-2907-4a55-a35a-aec7dc0c1eaa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4db85f4e7ce38ff71ccff2d79290c1e0dc2b79fabe209979d047b921aa752863"}}, "hash": "32bd92edeb88c8830c25880f98d48340ce80184d521db220d2c269e1f6a7fe0d", "text": "In fact, if climate change marks out a path of technological, social, and economic develop- ment, the question becomes one not of reducing costs but instead of accelerating investment in pursuit of de- velopment ambitions (UN, 2011; UN, 2015; Stern, 2015).

With increasing urbanization and the region\u2019s dependence on ports for trade and on food production from coastal and river-basin areas, climate change pres- ents a clear threat to the economic model. How can societies reorient their investment decisions (and mobilize the necessary finances) to sustain growth and the degree of interdependence among the APR\u2019s nations? Second, the pandemic reveals that economies in the APR depend upon their social provisioning and care sectors, the capabilities of which may either hinder or stimulate their develop- ment successes. Will societies in the APR summon the social and political resolve to steadily upgrade these sectors in tandem with their economic growth to keep their populations safe and thriving in a climate-warm- ing world? Third, the pandemic exposes the human limits of technological capabilities needed to respond to natural events. Will capabilities in the APR advance rapidly enough in all societies to access, adapt, and innovate with the technologies required for climate change? This paper examines how the APR might reorient in- vestment and its financing as forms of climate action, focusing on economic restructuring, a strengthened care economy and technological development as key problems. It warns that the hazardous features of the international financial system may frustrate the climate actions needed to keep the APR on its development trajectory. As discussed below, these hazards would pose problems even in a non-warming climate and demonstrate the need for thoroughgoing reforms in global finance. The first section surveys the climate challenges confronting the APR and their correspond- ing economic costs. The second section examines the limitations of the current financial system in gener- ating the kind of finance required for climate action. The third section offers recommendations for further unpacking the question of climate-action investment and financing in the APR. INTRODUCTION \u201c All my life, though some have changed, Some forever, not for better\u201d John Lennon and Paul McCartney (1965) \u201cIn My Life\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 6 Asian-Pacific countries find themselves confront- ing escalating development costs because of three forces: natural disasters; domestic pressures, such as those arising from public health concerns and the need to reverse environmental degradation; and the combination of national requirements and inter- national obligations, such as commitments in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions. Global climate change trajectories domi- nate the first and third cost sources; thus, the coun- tries in the APR do not fully control the costs con- fronting them. The second source arises from rapid economic growth and human habitation expansion interacting with a natural environment not given enough time to regenerate itself. All of these costs would hinder the APR\u2019s current development models unless they evolve rapidly enough to undertake the appropriate physical investments. Could the APR simply continue current development paths without the extensive and expensive alterna- tive investments? Recent events suggest that the answer is \u2018No\u2019, and that the business-as-usual option may be no more feasible than desirable. Most climate assessments issue a warning, exhorting governments and societies to do more and sooner to keep warm- ing to well below 2 degrees Celsius at most. This sec- tion assumes probable delays in the emergence of an effective global response. Policy actions should re- flect an extrapolation from the most recent costs and allow for their acceleration in the near term, although the scale of future acceleration remains uncertain. ESCALATING HUMAN AND PHYSICAL IMPACTS First of all, based on the recent record, Asia-Pacif- ic nations cannot evade the human and physical impacts of globally driven climate change. With its diverse geography, including the Tibetan plateau, the APR has witnessed a variety of both long-term trends (also called \u2018slow onset\u2019 events) and extreme weather events, with climate change driving the duration and frequency of both. One emblematic case of an ongoing climate change trend is the melting of the Himalayan glaciers. In 2017, around 1.9 billion people lived in the ten river basins with headwaters located in the Hindu Kush region, in- cluding 240 million people in the region itself (Wester et al., 2019). These populations face the prospect of wide- spread livelihood dislocation, vulnerability to flooding events and increasing outmigration pressures. In the last two decades, the APR has suffered more from extreme weather events than other world re- gions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f47db417-6c2c-48bc-bf33-7a413ca9896a": {"__data__": {"id_": "f47db417-6c2c-48bc-bf33-7a413ca9896a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Aligning Sovereign Debt Financing with Climate Action in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d4c04e09a1219871683ab15adcf31fcdc06387a5c9b626920ec4bfa31c9305da"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd73e9a0-2ba6-4a0d-ac2b-8a9775d89b03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a7396f307d0bd955dfd75c8334d245a1e8747adeade256222dd11c2554d3a094"}}, "hash": "e6204ee5fca72fb2c79d261e601ea1ac2d11cfaacb08f9dbd1bda46fb28be8da", "text": "Between 2000 and 2018, 82 percent of natural disasters in Asia came from extreme weather events (ADB, 2019).

At an estimated annual average of almost 38,000 fatalities in the same period, the APR accounted for 55 percent of the 60,000 global disaster fatalities (ADB, 2019). As elsewhere in the world, the poor, the rural, the marginalized, and the isolated absorb most of the costs of these disasters. Isolated Pacific Island nations, with limited economic diversification, are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events. Under the current global climate trajectory, countries in the APR must find a way to absorb these kinds of costs, even once an effective global regime begins to deflect the path of emissions and warming. Most countries will experience an increasing number of warm days and decreasing number of cold days. Water demand will also increase, exacerbated by poor water management policies. In the case of the second cost source \u2013 reversing en- vironmental degradation \u2013 the more rapidly growing economies in the APR have already absorbed signifi- cant costs in terms of human health and economic pro- duction. For example, in China, smog-inducing ozone and fine particles cause an estimated 1.1 million prema- ture deaths annually, while destroying 20 million tons of rice, wheat, maize and soybeans (Gu et al., 2018). Despite the locally generated character of pollution and its principally domestic impact, domestic efforts to mitigate pollution nevertheless would also advance global objectives to reduce greenhouse emissions. CLIMATE CHALLENGES IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 7 ECONOMIC IMPACTS ALREADY BORNE Second, the economic impacts of climate-related events indicate that the affected countries already bear the costs and will continue to do so regardless of policy. While responses cannot produce instantaneous results, in the long run, countries would benefit from investments that reduce these cumulative costs. In the 11 years between 1989 and 2018, countries in the APR absorbed US$687.6 billion in physical dam- age from weather-related1 causes, affecting 5.2 billion people (ADB, 2020b). In 2014, India bore $16 billion in physical damage from flooding in September. In 2017, floods in June and July and a storm in July caused $6 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, in physical dam- ages in China (ADB, 2020b). A widely cited 2015 model covering most2 countries estimated 13.6 percent to be the average (among countries) of the amount taken off per capita GDP pro- duction capacity by mid-century (defined as the span of years 2040-2059) by climate change (Burke, Hsiang and Miguel, 2015). These estimates are considered on the high side because of an assumption that gives cumulative negative impacts for higher temperatures (Aufhammer, 2019). This estimate of climate impacts suggests that the average country could afford to invest 13.6 of their per capita output over the 44 years between 2015 and 2059 \u2013 much less than one percent per capita annually \u2013 to evade or mitigate its harmful impacts on production capacity. However, assessing the affordability of climate invest- ments requires at least four caveats. First, climate investments and related spending, compared to other investments, tend to require high upfront costs, with a declining cost or positive benefits afterward. Second, climate costs entail cumulative processes, as implied in the cost methodology cited above, although early action to obtain financing for upfront costs can arrest the pattern. Third, national climate efforts must con- tend with the fact that the action, inaction, or inade- quate action of other nations determines the scale of national action. If, for example, certain countries maintain higher fossil-fuel subsidies over an extended period, then the costs become shared among oth- er countries. This underlines the indispensability of international cooperation and the essential practice of common but differentiated responsibilities in climate action (Montes and Williams, 2017). The mitigation efforts of large countries in the APR - China, India, In- donesia, Japan, and the Republic of Korea \u2013 have pro- found global impact. Regional authorities must actively engage in global climate rule making and evolution. These large countries can also contribute immense- ly as global innovators in technological development and the economic and social aspects of climate action.

Five developing economies, two already industrial- ized, and five fast-growing middle-income converging economies \u2013 India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, People\u2019s Republic of China, Republic of Korea, and Thailand - have led the others in an economic model that relied on link- ages to export markets beyond the APR. Climate change imperils the sustainability of such production chains. For example, catastrophic flooding in Thailand in 2011 se- verely disrupted production activities far beyond its bor- ders (Haraguchi and Lall, 2015). Therefore, these leading countries have important roles in global value chains that require safeguarding against climate change. The APR also has important commodity exporters, ma- ny among the less-diversified (least-developed ) coun- tries (LDCs).These countries have not been immune to extreme weather events, such as the devastating 2019 floods in Myanmar. They share an important character- istic in their vulnerability to external financing difficul- ties; Lao PDR, in fact, appears as a country facing high probability of debt distress in the International Mone- tary Fund\u2019s (IMF) annual debt sustainability framework for 2019 (World Bank and IMF, 2019). All APR countries will be compelled by their circum- stances, national and international requirements, and their development ambitions to undertake all three of the standard categories of climate action: loss-and damage, adaptation, and mitigation.

These by no means exhaust the list of adaptation requirements; it only names those that might offer private investors reasonable returns. Such returns would be possible once inadequate facilities are remedied through investment and the resulting savings get redirected to investors from the present publicly borne costs. For mitigation, investment requirements are strongly shaped, in part, by international commitments \u2013 the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) of coun- tries under the Paris Agreement. Investment require- ments are even more strongly shaped by the most significant of these costs: human health and premature deaths in urban areas. The national studies for China have consistently shown that the costs of pollution ex- ceed the costs of investments to avoid harmful effects. For example, air pollution in China costs an estimated 6.5 percent of GDP per annum (Crane and Mao, 2015). 3 TThese countries also fall into Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust fund (PRGT) eligible grouping of the IMF. 4 The UNFCC has not agreed on an official definition and this formulation is from Warner et al.

The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 10 FINANCING NEEDS FOR INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS ON MITIGATION Countries in all the major Asia-Pacific subregions have made time-bound commitments to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under the Paris Agreement. International journals are rife with anal- yses of these NDCs; a recent study of South Asian NDCs raises doubts about how strongly these plans have elicited stakeholder support (Haque et al., 2019). The APR has an extraordinarily strong climate mitigation potential, not only given the low level of clean energy sources currently installed, but also in terms of sources of wind and insolation8 power (Cli- mate Analytics, 2019). For any country, meeting their NDC commitment raises the question of financing the investment and installing the supporting regu- latory and market frameworks for transitioning to clean energy generation and transport. Presuming an extension of their high-growth record, Southeast Asian countries have committed to ambi- tious mitigation targets in the future under their NDCs. NDC plans involve transitions to cleaner sources of primary and indirect energy, including increased de- pendence on gas and biofuel. One should note that the increased biofuels may create a potential impact on food security, especially if climate change impairs agricultural productivity. The commitments also pro- pose significant conversions in the transport sector, including public transport. Among Southeast Asian countries, the Philippines offer the most ambitious emission cuts, which include a 50 percent reduction in CO2 emissions below 1990 level. The implied target of per capita CO2 emissions below 1 ton would be one of the lowest in the world (Fulton et al., 2017). Fulton et al. (2017) underscore that Southeast Asian NDC com- mitments are highly contingent on flows of external finance. This amounts to 70 percent in the Philippines, 41 percent in Indonesia, 45 percent in Malaysia, and 25 percent in both Thailand and Vietnam. The cost of finance for the most credit-worthy bor- rowers has remained near zero since the onset of the 2008 subprime financial crisis. Logically, this situation presents an exceptional opportunity for governments and private investors to mobilize finance for climate investment. In this section, we seek to explain a crucial part of the anomalous situation, one that has seen enormous growth in financial investment, as opposed to investment in the physical, long-term requirements for climate action.

Many central banks in industrialized countries revert- ed to quantitative easing policies with the onset of the COVID-19 crisis in February 2020. As in the previous episode, global liquidity has expanded enormously. In this instance, the US Federal Reserve System has engaged in generous purchases of high-risk (\u2018junk\u2019) private bonds. The resulting liquidity in private com- panies may either go to purchases of equipment or increased hiring (the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred channel), or to investments in other financial assets.

The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 11 ing country debt balances have dramatically wors- ened because of the pandemic, coming on the heels of already proliferating debt difficulties in 2019. The pandemic has thrown a harsh light on the limitations and vulnerabilities of the international development financing system. NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE Structurally, the international financial system mobiliz- es too little financing for physical investments required for the \u2018dirty\u2019 business-as-usual (BAU) economy. Thus, it is also unable to finance investment in newer, more technologically appropriate \u2018green\u2019 activities in pro- duction and consumption. Climate action also requires securing long-term financing. For the global communi- ty to have any chance of mobilizing adequate financ- ing for climate action, thoroughgoing changes in the international financial system will be required (UNEP 2015). Asian-Pacific developing countries, most with open capital accounts, must manage their macroecon- omies to fend off surges of inflows to avoid unwanted exchange rate appreciation and avoid sudden capital outflows in the short-term (Montes, 2013b). The great bulk of investment by private actors lies in other finan- cial assets, with an eye to capital gains within a short period of time. In the starkest terms, UNEP (2015) char- acterized the system as \u2018not fit-for-purpose\u2019 and the \u201cstability and effectiveness of key parts of the financial system, for example, remain at risk from short-termism and excessive leverage.\u201d The dominance of capital-gains-seeking investments follows from reforms in regulations (such as the 1980s reforms that weakened prohibitions against corpora- tions9 buying back their own shares) and in accounting and tax treatments (such as lowering tax rates on capital gains). The structure of international finance caters to profitability through elevated financial returns without necessarily stimulating real (physical) investment. With market outcomes dominated by short-term consider- ations, climate-vulnerable countries and sectors will be unable to finance investments (Mackenzie 2021). Under a capital-gains dynamic, profit from portfolio investments arises from changes in the price of a fi- nancial asset between the time of its purchase and the time of resale. This means that profits are also avail- able on a portfolio position, called a \u2018short,\u2019 based on a contract to sell an asset at a future date, after the asset price has fallen. Investors do not have to make a judg- ment about whether a project will succeed in the long run; they can make money on positions that an asset price will fall. For example, a position based on the judgment that a project will fail, or a particular coun- try\u2019s exchange rate will fall, can become enormously profitable within a short time frame. Shorts exacerbate the short-term bias of financial markets. In contrast, the returns on physical investments are only recovered in the long term, in fractional annual amounts.

Labour\u2019s flagging capacity to protect its share of value added had been greatly abetted by the col- lapse of the Soviet Union and China\u2019s entry into world markets; both greatly augmented the global labour force and drove the consequent reduction in consum- 9 This rule, instituted in the 1930s to obviate stock market speculation in company shares, was weakened in the United States\u2019 Reagan administration to encourage savings and financial investment. Along with the Friedmanesque (1970) admonition that the sole social responsibility of private companies is to increase profits, and the tying of management compensation to the company\u2019s share price, the rule change fostered management obsession with manoeuvres, such as stock buybacks and mergers and acquisitions involving substantial job cuts. As a result, companies have redirected profits towards supporting share prices without increasing physical capital investments by the enterprise (Lazonick, 2014). 10 For more information, see Caballero, Farhi and Gourinchas (2008). The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 12 er goods prices as mobile capital moved production to lower-wage areas (Goodhart and Pradhan, 2020). Weak macroeconomic demand sustained by inequality ensconces a trend toward lower secular growth and lower fixed capital investment in advanced countries. Because the safe-asset trap arises from income in- equality (or wealth inequality), and because reversing income inequality cannot happen instantaneously, the differences in financing costs between advanced and developing countries can hold sway for quite some time. Among countries, a stark gap has arisen in the cost of accessing funds from the same internation- al pools. While borrowing rates remain near zero in advanced economies, developing countries borrow at rates of about 5 percent and higher.11 Global governance mechanisms lack a process for sovereign debt resolution: a non-arbitrary (rule-based), comprehensive, predictable, and equitable method. In- ternational creditor committees currently manage such matters with little or no oversight \u2013 notably the Paris Club, properly called a club with the cachet of exclu- sivity, and one that violates common notions of good governance. In debt restructuring episodes, the debtor country barely sees12 the so-called \u2018bailout\u2019 resources, which pass through the debtor to the creditor claim- ants in exchange for an increased level of indebted- ness. Moreover, with the default risk transferred away from creditors by the debt regime, restructuring has triggered the vigorous restart of lending to debt-dis- tressed countries, as we see in the enthusiastic private resumption of lending to Latin American countries. The outbreak of developing country debt difficulties triggered by the pandemic has exacerbated could provide another opportunity for the establishment of an effective sovereign debt regime. In 2001, the IMF spurred a substantial but failed attempt to establish a sovereign debt restructuring mechanism (SDRM), while, in 2014 and 2015, Bolivia and Argentina led a United Nations centred initiative with the support of the Group of 77 and China (El-Erian, 2021; Montes, 2016). Neither produced lasting results. The analysis presented here assumes that the inter- national financial system will remain substantially un- changed for at least a decade. During this decade, cli- mate action cannot be set aside. The economies in the APR as a whole form one of two regions in the world that are net savers, excluding North America and Eu- rope; the other region is the Middle East. Authorities in the APR need to acknowledge that, while these sets of countries have privileged access to international finance, they remain rule-takers, not rule-makers, in international finance.

Interest for most developing country sovereign borrowing has increased with the pandemic (Chilkoti 2020). 12 Greece as an international debtor is a recent example. See, among many other narratives, Nelson, Belkin and Jackson (2017) in which the persistent debt resolution issue always revolved around whether Greece would be able to meet the next payment owed to external creditors. \u201cTo achieve the SDGs, domestic resources would need a ramping-up. Developing countries in the APR would do well to expand their participation in efforts to change international standards of allocating taxing rights among jurisdictions\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 13 wide commercial usage. This section will focus on the matter of financing climate action. There is an urgent necessity to ramp-up public revenue performance within the ongoing global tax reform effort (Montes, Uribe and Danish, 2018). For climate mitigation action, Asian-Pacific countries seeking to introduce domes- tic13 carbon surcharges to lessen public deficits and reliance on foreign funding will require the sacrifice of part their international competitiveness in exports and in attracting foreign investment. A threat looms in recent European Community discussions about carbon border adjustment measures (CBAM);14 such measures could have implications for the APR\u2019s trade-based growth model, given its dependence on internationally dispersed production processes. Standard economic theory posits that such policies could tilt the terms of trade in favour of developed countries as a whole. International public resources offer a second source of climate-action financing. Asian-Pacific countries have strong access to international finance institutions (IFIs). The emergence of new IFIs \u2013 notably the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the New De- velopment Bank, both under the leadership of China \u2013 has expanded the opportunities for the APR. The third source is private financing from large inter- national pools that are hypothetically available for cli- mate finance. In the pursuit of effective climate action, with private financing mainly available as short-term placements as depicted above, governments may increasingly need to fully finance investments from tax revenues, or else compel the private sector to redirect the resources it now principally keeps in liquid finan- cial assets towards physical investments for climate action. To compete with the private-profit bias toward quick asset-price gains, the public sector must also set priorities in extensive regulatory and standard setting actions congruent with climate priorities. These will not reduce the cost of climate action but can mobilize private investment; based on the record, public sub- sidies would also be required to prod private-sector behaviour towards new arrangements. A direct route would introduce strong regulations designed to trigger private actions; such regulations would be strengthened by enforcing them via private insurance markets. For example, governments could upgrade building codes to limit new construction permits to climate-resilient facilities. These types of policies do not, however, reduce the costs of climate investments. The introduction of environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards into the activities of private companies resident in Asian-Pacific countries can, of course, reduce the attractiveness of host coun- tries. Climate-motivated regulations, including ESG stan- dards, aim to compel economic actors to internalize the prospective costs of climate change.15 These standards would apply both to public and private ac- tors. Volz et al. (2020), for example, suggest that the countries most vulnerable to climate-change damage have paid 275 basis points more on the average on their sovereign debt. The finding derives from research measuring the implicit relationship between observed climate change costs and the sovereign risk premia. The result does not mean that finance providers have incorporated these costs directly in setting their risk premia (see the next section for a discussion on this.) Credit rating agencies, for example, have not incorpo- rated these considerations in assigning bond ratings, although this practice has changed for large, interna- tionally active companies. These kinds of results bolster the argument that gov- ernments should invest and introduce regulations to reduce climate costs and strengthen environmental risk management, aiming to trigger market-driven adjustments. They have also been used to suggest that credit rating agencies should begin to incorporate climate considerations in their evaluations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "618cbb8d-158a-4933-807c-7e8ef5e5d944": {"__data__": {"id_": "618cbb8d-158a-4933-807c-7e8ef5e5d944", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Aligning Sovereign Debt Financing with Climate Action in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7649018bb192c806805efefafaa21b783919e9e20afaabb9b728748f747d6ac8"}, "2": {"node_id": "70f57e71-b296-4820-ba4c-2a576c2ef5a8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a64530ce1ddfa33ab90588e69179d1d393aecf5cec37c558b10cdd7df00d4c1"}}, "hash": "50e0bcfacd6a88beb4b7964c31ad4ff4a9fd843aa701b7c46be56c847802094a", "text": "However, credit agencies will only gradually apply these crite- 13 \u2018Domestic\u2019 is important here to preclude violating national treatment obligations in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other trade obligations. 14 For more information, see", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16662ea6-f88e-4330-80d4-6a6ad0ca1762": {"__data__": {"id_": "16662ea6-f88e-4330-80d4-6a6ad0ca1762", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Aligning Sovereign Debt Financing with Climate Action in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6ffa4d31ed35fc4f061b3528a572bad9431bb54cb8fbe22303fc0bbb3f2feb3d"}, "3": {"node_id": "ed2fa31f-16e4-4d8a-99f4-f3b978edf477", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6e29a09ca5cc52005211a6b027a0737692669813dcfe220c6be5eb013cc47d6"}}, "hash": "454a1ea1c45beec7d52ecb7ff8194945cbe0573f7140b60ca11dfa797baf0be1", "text": "European Commission (2020).

International private debt markets still bear the same pitfalls as in the past\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 14 ria to corporate bond ratings because of the lack of agreed standards on methodology (see next section). This brings us to the concept of \u2018stranded assets,\u2019 those that suffer from unanticipated or premature write-downs, devaluations, or conversion to liabilities (Caldecott, Howarth and McSharry, 2013). Collapses in the value of assets apply to all kinds of physical facilities, including farmland, manufacturing plants and power generation, and strike at the heart of the capital-gains dynamic of international financial markets \u2013 but not all at once. An effective response to such vul- nerability would introduce regulations that force assets to be priced to fully reflect their climate vulnerabilities. On 2 November 2021, during the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26), former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who orig- inally warned of the systemic dangers of stranded assets (Carney, 2015), announced the formation of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), with $130 trillion in private capital committed (GFANZ, 2021). We take the view, in line with UNEP (2015), that such an operation has the potential to wreak enor- mous damage on developing countries, similar to crises seen in the aftermath of petrodollar recycling in the 1970s, if global regulatory frameworks and private incentives are not comprehensively recast. ESG STANDARDS AND FINANCE ESG measurement methodologies involve reforms accounting standards in the first instance, augment- ed by other metrics to ensure that financial actors appropriately consider the climate impacts of their actions. A burgeoning global civil society movement that aims to require IFIs \u2013 all owned by state parties \u2013 to halt all financing for all fossil-fuel energy proj- ects is a regulatory version of this kind of consider- ation. In the private sector, as reflected in the start-ups of numerous international task forces, intense interest has developed in finance, and most especially in the matters of ESG standards and climate-contin- gent debt instrument designs. These activities react to a mounting interest on the part of investors and willing-to-lend savers in increasing their exposure to climate change-related financing. Government climate action must emphasize the introduction of mandatory annual financial disclosures on climate risks for large enterprises. A truly valuable development would be genuine be- havioural change on the part of private companies (financial and non-financial), one that fully incorpo- rates climate costs in their operations and in their investment decisions. Incorporating climate costs in operations will reduce accounting profits in the same instance that it can create reserves that could feed into climate-insurance pools. \u201cA truly valuable development would be genuine behavioral change on the part of private companies (financial and non- financial), one that more fully incorporated climate costs in their operations and in their investment decisions\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 15 In arranging their financing for climate action, APR economies must operate within the international finan- cial environment. Countries will have to raise climate finance in competition with external opportunities offering short-term returns. This section examines the various options countries could consider. DOMESTIC FISCAL AND MONETARY ACTIONS Prioritizing domestic action appears prudent in the uncertain and volatile international development climate. A first and necessary step in this direction is for Asian-Pacific countries to incorporate their climate change objectives and actions into their development planning and implementation. The all-inclusive SDG framework poses a challenge for each Asia-Pacific society in aligning its social progress, industrialization and poverty eradication ambitions with the frame- work\u2019s urgent call to combat climate change and its impacts.

The authors cite Ghosh, Ostry and Qureshi (2016) on the dangers of capital surges through open capital accounts as a predicate for many of these crises. The IMF has al- ready gone on record as supporting macroprudential controls during balance-of-payments crises.16 For expanding climate finance, capital controls offer a key advantage: a borrowing rate for physical projects that does not compete with short-term external finan- cial returns. China supplies one example of a country that has made good use of its gradual capital account opening. China\u2019s controls help its state banks provide low-interest-rate loans to businesses. Capital controls also help China limit volatility that could otherwise im- pair the soundness of its commercial banks\u2014especial- ly given the country\u2019s weak regulatory institutions\u2014 and induce price volatility in its real estate market, the main investment opportunity for Chinese households (Shaw and Eidelman, 2011). The Republic of Korea also has a well-known record of extensive capital controls during its period of rapid growth within its state-led development strategy (No- land, 2007). Park (2011) characterizes the shift in the view towards capital controls as one from cardinal sin to policy agenda, based on Korea\u2019s experience with financial crises from 1997 to 2011. The 2010 Seoul G20 summit, over which the Republic of Korea pre- sided, discussed policies to reduce balance-of-pay- ments imbalances, including capital control policies (Park, 2011). One should recognize caveats concerning the perils of reintroducing capital controls in countries that al- ready have open capital accounts. For these coun- tries, whether they would have benefited on a net basis or not, private portfolio inflows and outflows remain critical for balance-of-payments health. Any reintroduction of controls should take place in a phased manner that gives external portfolio investors time to understand their purpose, to avoid drastic reversals in portfolio positions that would themselves trigger a crisis. In the APR, private financial flows have earned a hair-trigger reputation \u2013 one susceptible to \u2018herd be- haviour\u2019 as seen in the Asian financial crisis (Montes, 1998). For example, at the beginning of COVID-19 pan- demic, to provide fiscal space for eligible low-income17 economies (such as Myanmar), the Group of 20 (G20) introduced a Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI)18 that suspended developing countries\u2019 debt service payments to G20 bilateral lenders effective RECOMMENDATIONS 16 Note that capital controls should remain available even in normal times, in order to reinstate monetary and fiscal policy tools that industrialized country authorities have increasingly made available (Montes, 2013b). See also Shaw and Eidelman\u2019s (2011) elaboration. 17 Eligibility included the least-developed countries and those participating in the PRGT or Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), a concessional lending vehicle of the International Monetary Fund. 18 In November 2020, the G20 began replacing the DSSI with the Common Framework for Debt Treatments Beyond the DSSI, applicable to the countries qualifying for DSSI but now recognizing the need for debt restructurings (euphemistically termed \u201cdebt treatments\u201d) to address solvency issues whilst DSSI only dealt with liquidity shortfalls (Ministry of the Economy and Finance, 2020). The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 16 May 2020 (Reuters, 2020). As of early November 2021, only 46 of the 73 eligible countries have applied for the suspension, owing to their authorities\u2019 fears of a credit rating downgrade (Kaiser and Kopper, 2020). The interpretation that debt-service suspension re- duces the credit standing of an economy conflicts with a view that having greater fiscal resources improves it. To manage the introduction of capital controls, Asian-Pacific countries should seriously consider negotiating a set of mutually acceptable standards on these kinds of policies. Reforming regulatory approaches to elicit cli- mate finance As discussed earlier, some of the needed financing can flow through regulatory changes. Well-known actions of this kind include feed-in tariff regimes or the upgrading of construction and building standards and codes, enforced by insurers. Authorities can withdraw incentives and subsi- dies for \u2018dirty\u2019 economic activities at a rate that avoids em- ployment dislocation.

TAPPING EXTERNAL SOURCES OF FINANCE The modalities, the volume, and the possibility of ex- ternal financing for climate action have garnered the greatest policy and diplomatic attention; the discus- sion of the previous section must serve as a corrective and a caution. Given the potentially enormous resourc- es required for climate action, Asian-Pacific countries must take care not to walk into the trap of external indebtedness from climate action financing. Here we shall review various actions for accessing external finance and examine their implications for national in- debtedness and development space. Borrowing from international sources Sovereign borrowing from international sources has evolved in a variety of ways. The number of funds has proliferated, driven by donor interest and the variety19 of needs with perceived climate-related purposes. For example, dedicated funds now exist for adapta- tion, but these remain of a much smaller size than the variety of mitigation funds set up by donor countries. Each of these funds has its own modality of access, but all share the feature of lending based on intended projects (or programs) for repayment. The Green Cli- mate Fund, the financial agency under the UNFCCC, has the distinction of having a board providing equal representation among industrialized and developing countries. This section will not evaluate these funds from the point of view of APR climate funding. Mariama Williams (2019) provides a useful summary and state of play of these funds. Instead, this section will focus on new de- velopments in borrowing for climate financing. Many of the caveats identified in this section would also apply to other funds with a longer record. 19 For a listing of the existing funds, see Henrich B\u00f6ll Stiftung and ODI (2020). The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 17 Green bonds and SDG bonds In keeping with the overall growth of debt finance globally, green bonds have recently shown robust growth. While no single standard exists for what constitutes a green bond, the equity fund Blackrock (Weng, 2020) reports an estimated $700 billion of green bonds outstanding \u2013 less than 1 percent of the size of the global bond market (about $128.3 trillion). Nevertheless, these kinds of bonds have attracted much attention, and the largest equity and hedge fund companies\u2019 home pages trumpet their interest in financing climate sustainability. In the APR, China is one of the large issuers globally; other countries have done issues on a much smaller scale, including Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, even though the attractiveness of green bonds suffers in comparison with standard bonds given their higher costs to the issuer (O\u2019Donnellan, 2019). The SDG bond has emerged as a new and significant type, with its first example in an offering that UNDP (2020) helped to facilitate in September 2020, gener- ating substantial interest. Because a key feature of the first SDG bond involves domestic economic reforms, questions that bedevilled the conditional lending that IFIs undertook as part of the structural adjustment effort in the 1980s and 1990s resurface. In those years, indebtedness in exchange for economic reforms did facilitate a faster rate of access to foreign exchange but did not necessarily bring about the necessary increase in output and domestic incomes required to service external debt.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80e8f8a9-4b33-41f8-883b-252ac02ba606": {"__data__": {"id_": "80e8f8a9-4b33-41f8-883b-252ac02ba606", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Aligning Sovereign Debt Financing with Climate Action in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33a854117a4df5933d6a870622f5ac7bfce233611008805bfdf213c0501fdcd3"}, "2": {"node_id": "288c9c9e-80ad-4530-b482-3e9c8a5657ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c53f4409ee9cfcfa1f75348ddc1643126c0b4390c040627752a7b55273439073"}}, "hash": "12c1637889b834aafdc8e960327ee8c24c6971ce9cc78799080b99ab5b372a72", "text": "In the case of structural ad- justment loans, trade liberalization was supposed to bolster exports performance (for example), but such in- creases did not materialize in a timely manner, and the loans instead resulted in higher external debt20 when imports increased much faster.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77fb02db-fb7b-4c10-978d-91386c6a44fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "77fb02db-fb7b-4c10-978d-91386c6a44fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Aligning Sovereign Debt Financing with Climate Action in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c9461ac8c9a0fc6fa36debe8f5f612ed089818f63cd24bec5dc04aae083f6514"}, "3": {"node_id": "3bb48daa-8b8d-4a92-9eac-56efa967516e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90d7562427c32e97fbec27aa061e99c4990dff233fd7172f4ad8fa1ce7eb6f5c"}}, "hash": "9d5d9478f8b2d5faa94078fd8e13f7dc4010d80210f375e910116f1827c84929", "text": "In the case of climate finance, the main issue \u2013 par- alleling the one that authorities should have paid attention to in the case of structural adjustment \u2013 concerns timing: the point when shadow prices from environmental considerations will generate actual user payments and additional tax revenues, making it possi- ble to service the green or the SDG bonds. How much longer will fossil-fuel prices remain low in actually existing markets? These considerations also argue for giving more attention to adaptation and loss-and-dam- age projects, which may generate user fees or savings in terms of avoided damage from climate disasters. International private debt markets also still bear the same pitfalls as in the past, though now with a greater variety of lenders and investors. The main drawback is the debtor-bearing-all default-risk feature, as in other external funding instruments. In an important sense, and even as green bonds have already become more expensive to the issuer, these debt instruments are mispriced, in that they do not reflect the possibility of restructuring and debt service delays if the underlying assumptions prove overly optimistic. Asian-Pacific countries must consider restricting ex- ternal borrowing for climate finance to those portions of a project or program that genuinely require hard currency: for instance, features requiring imports. Relying on green bonds or SDG bonds to fund chronic trade deficits that externally-obtained resources will not directly alleviate could eventually prove inimical to climate action. DEBT RESTRUCTURING FOR CLIMATE FINANCE Since the developing country debt crises of the 1980s, various mechanisms have been proposed that might generate climate finance. Debt-for-nature swaps The periodic onset of developing country debt crisis has elicited debt-for-nature swap proposals; a few of these have been tried, with mixed results (Fresnillo, 2020; Kessel 2006). While debt swaps for environ- ment projects could serve as part of the climate fi- nance toolkit of those Asian-Pacific countries in need of debt restructuring, they call for very judicious use to avoid the pitfalls of previous projects. Almost all debt-restructuring operations have in- volved the swapping of one bond for another - a debt-for-debt swap, with the new debt extinguishing a portion of previous debt service obligations but with an upgraded seniority status. Debt-for-nature swaps apply to specific loans and projects, instead of involving an overall (national) debt workout; in this lies the basis of many of their difficulties. These kinds of swaps came from suggestions made by the international environmental movement. Their pitfalls and vulnerabilities have generated a longstanding literature arising from public priority distortions. Solv- ing the debt-servicing problems of a particular loan or project raises the priority of that project in the uni- verse of domestic economic priorities. In many cases, 20 See, for example, K\u0131z\u0131lg\u00f6l and \u0130pek (2014) for Turkey and Zafar and Butt (2008) for Pakistan. The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 18 these kinds of swaps create privileged claims for cer- tain policies and for specific sectors in the domestic economy whose agendas coincide with the interests of the foreign financing party, but not necessarily with domestic priorities. Indebted countries should only consider such swaps if they are willing to reorder do- mestic priorities in their favour. Swaps raise the issue of the role of policy condition- ality. These debt manoeuvres have often required the mediation of international financial institutions whose policy preferences may clash with those of distressed sovereign states. There are cases where these swap projects have ridden roughshod over the rights of in- digenous groups, as have other foreign-funded proj- ects, especially since national governments may pay little attention to these local issues, such as the need for a livelihood (Bryant and Bailey, 1997). Because of their complex payment schedules, there could be cases where a straight write down of the face value of the debtor country\u2019s external liability could free more resources for climate action than a debt-for- nature swap. Swaps can also create claims on future public current expenditures if they trigger yet-unbud- geted operating and enforcement activities. Voluntary debt buybacks Developing country debt crises create opportunities for voluntary debt buybacks. Savings from debt buybacks can go towards financing climate action, as recently proposed by Stiglitz and Rashid (2020).

Stiglitz and Rashid (2020, p. 19) further propose an al- ternative conditionality \u2013 that debtors \u201cagree to spend the savings on creating and promoting global public goods,\u201d in which they include public health expendi- tures and climate change mitigation and adaptation (but not loss-and-damage). They argue that this will en- hance donor buy-in and inhibit creditors whose bonds do not receive buyback from resorting to litigation. Nothing would prevent developing countries from buying their own bonds using the resources they have on hand, for example using some of their international reserves, especially with steep discounts available. This will create climate finance space in the future at the cost of drawing down current reserves. Unlike a new-issue SDR, voluntary debt buybacks do not create additional fiscal space instantaneously. They have usually appeared in debt restructuring pro- cesses involving conflicts with private creditors or with credit-rating agencies. These agencies have the power to determine the market basis of such actions \u2013 that is, whether they are truly voluntary or the equivalent of a default that could affect the indebted country\u2019s credit standing. Even with the bespoke participation of a market-maker, such as the IMF, credit rating agencies could very well classify a buyback as a loan restruc- turing, effectively a default, just as in the case of the Brady bond swaps in the late 1980s (Federal Reserve System, 2011). Furthermore, in previous experiences (most recently for Greece), news of the possibility of a generous buyback shrank the discount and thus the level of debt reduction achieved, although that did not prevent large hedge funds from making enormous asset gains from the transaction by buying early at the lower price (Thomas, 2012). SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS- FACILITATED CLIMATE FINANCE SDRs are international reserve assets of the 189 mem- ber states of the IMF. SDRs are not issued by the IMF staff but by IMF-member countries, as provisions to increase their supply of bank reserves useful for inter- national transactions. Countries can use SDRs to meet external financing needs, help ward off financial crises, balance payments crises, and maintain the confidence of financial markets. New issues of SDRs SDRs are a liability of the IMF, which is a cooperative, rather than the debt of any single country. The IMF pays interest on SDRs based on the weighted average of the short-term rates of the five currencies in the SDR basket (US dollar, Euro, Japanese yen, pound sterling, Chinese renminbi). Developing countries pay much higher interest rates on their external borrowings. Newly-issued SDRs thus provide developing countries access to the holiest of holies, usually only reserved to the world\u2019s largest economies \u2013 expansion of their fiscal space using international resources at the lowest interest rates possible. The standard method of SDR allocation follows ex- isting quotas, which means that countries with more The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 19 votes in the IMF get considerably more resources. Industrialized countries, with their greater weight of IMF votes, will receive an overwhelming proportion of a standard SDR distribution (Mnuchin, 2020). However, large SDR distributions may have considerable scope without risking global inflation, as suggested in a study commissioned by the IMF that finds the probability of SDRs igniting global inflation highly unlikely, with other factors serving as more important determinants (Coo- per, 2011). Larger SDR distributions can augment the reserves of the smaller countries, which can convert these new reserves to hard currency for financing cli- mate action, without taking on more debt. Another possibility is the use of SDRs as asset back- ing for the issuance of international bonds to finance climate action, as explored in Bredenkamp and Patillo (2010). IMF member states could authorize issuance of new SDRs for this purpose. Countries that do not need their SDRs could donate their balances as equity to the fund. Such a fund would borrow on international capital markets and on-lend the resources for climate projects. A third possibility would be to issue SDRs independent of the IMF quota allocation, as proposed by the Group of 77 (G77) and China at the United Nations \u201cConfer- ence on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development\u201d (24-30 June 2009, New York).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3634fd1-f835-4ba0-b1f3-79fa46e52a45": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3634fd1-f835-4ba0-b1f3-79fa46e52a45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Aligning Sovereign Debt Financing with Climate Action in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c8a777f91a2f86ab6e57718a2979b9ee999a00e407f0a0a3b793324cb3ee57b"}, "2": {"node_id": "dda7b37d-72be-4dad-9a88-6bbdf7cc8f84", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b5a057839a3280924b55631b69971a975ff9b8e51acd825571c1aac40c47aef0"}}, "hash": "322c0a0a0775c9397dba4c65f6c1d2fa74ab3617118c631e9ea32b232179cd98", "text": "Both this kind of action, and one for a new SDR issuance beyond the current capital corpus of the IMF, will require US Congressional approval.

With its 16.5 percent voting weight in the IMF, and seigniorage advantages in the global payments system, the United States has an essential role in situations when SDRs are urgently needed. Under its new administration, the United States joined other IMF members so that on 23 August 2021, a new general allocation of SDR 500 bil- lion (about $650 billion) became effective (IMF, 2021).

New SDR issuances can support climate finance in two ways \u2013 first on a coun- try-by-country basis, second as backing to raise inter- national finance. The first option would provide hard currency resources for Asian-Pacific countries without creating new debt. The second one would create a pool of funds that provide a lending facility. Should the prime minister\u2019s proposal find concurrence, it could finance a significant proportion of the commit- ment made by developed countries in 2010 under the UNFCC (United Nations, 2011a) to provide $100 billion annually in climate finance beginning in 2020, a dead- line they missed. The most climate-secure path to turn this proposal into a reality would start with a decision of the coun- try-Parties in the UNFCCC. That would be followed by the IMF board of governors enacting the annual SDR distribution to its members (who are the same coun- try-Parties), because new SDR distributions require an 85 percent majority of weighted IMF-member votes in order to be accepted. Once again, the United States, which controls 16.5 percent of the weighted votes, must be part of this UNFCCC and IMF decision. Such an SDR distribution, when distributed in the stan- dard way according to quotas of member states, would be deposited as additional balances in IMF members\u2019 international reserves. When distributed according to existing quotas, the group of developing countries would receive 39.5 percent of the issuance. Because the resources originate with the UNFCCC, the devel- oping countries would be morally bound to apply them to climate action. Developed countries would be similarly bound to apply their share of the new resources to financing climate action in developing countries. The devel- oped countries could either donate these resources directly to an IMF-managed trust fund or they could make grants directly to developing countries, using facilities mediated by the IMF. The advantage of di- rect grants is that they do not require conditionality and do not increase developing-country debt. The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 20 This analysis rests on the premise that the structural features of the international financial system severely hamper climate finance options. Developing econ- omies in the APR must contend with high financing costs for their physical climate investments because they must compete with the higher returns available to their private investors. The remedies proposed in this paper, beyond a proliferation of genuinely national climate action plans, call for greater regulation of inter- national capital flows, strengthened tax systems and support from authorities in the APR for reformed sover- eign-debt processes and increased use of SDRs. As an analysis addressed to the APR, these proposals carry important political economy considerations. While the APR is not a dominant venue of financial centres, a few of its countries have sought to expand their reach and ascendancy in these markets. These countries would tend towards scepticism and hostili- ty to greater national interventions regarding capital flows, in taxation and sovereign-debt resolution re- forms. This paper argues that the proposed remedies would not only be appropriate for financing climate action; they would also prove necessary for the long- term sustainability and efficiency of international finan- cial markets. The differences among sovereign states in the APR also arise from dissimilar notions about what consti- tutes efficiency in international markets, or about the most effective strategies for development. Even with these differences, more detailed research can inform progress toward action \u2013 for example, on the borrow- ing rate needed to finance physical investments that reduce the cost of extreme weather damage. From this basis, the APR may to consider how to facilitate finance for such requirements.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b35544ac-814d-4f75-a451-02167de60d72": {"__data__": {"id_": "b35544ac-814d-4f75-a451-02167de60d72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Aligning Sovereign Debt Financing with Climate Action in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "826e7616a0e5672605a211c53b205d8f26aa4f72c16adf802d02f672cb6b5dba"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b0224ff-79d7-4a91-af16-d3511da28e80", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aligning-sovereign-debt-financing-climate-action-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3918a96d01aede5fb5e9ce5df3cd9898a291f555718ec0e94f335356b7cef4af"}}, "hash": "b2e9832b836a7d711f85123a35e2aa51d173eb342e1ab3006d105885727f401e", "text": "From this basis, the APR may to consider how to facilitate finance for such requirements.

Higher exter- nal funding costs will increase the probability of debt restructuring events in developing countries, a trend which had already begun in 2020 (Munevar, 2021). There is a non-zero probability of a global financial crisis beginning in 2022 if real economic recovery in industrialized countries proves unexpectedly strong. Authorities in the APR should move quickly toward a more proactive stance in addressing the sufficiency of climate finance and placing their financial sectors on a surer footing.
