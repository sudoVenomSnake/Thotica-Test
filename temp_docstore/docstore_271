INDICATORS 195 Readers\u2019 Guide and Notes to Tables The following tables contain data on gender equality and human development in countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including UNDP programme countries. The data are grouped into 11 dimensions that attempts to capture different aspects of gender inequality, including in human development and the macroeconomy, demography, health and mortality, education, assets and income, paid and unpaid work, political voice, influencing decisions, international conventions, legal instruments and gender measures. The most popular are composite indices of gender inequality are also presented. Data and indicators that track the relevant Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are also included in the tables. Data Coverage For this Report, countries have been grouped into three categories: East Asia, South and West Asia, and the Pacific. The total number of countries is 39: 16 from East Asia (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, China, Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Japan, Lao Peoples\u2019 Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Viet Nam); nine from South and West Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Islamic Republic of Iran, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka); and 14 from the Pacific (Australia, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu). Within sub- regions, countries are arranged according to HDI value (2007) in descending order. Countries that do not have an HDI ranking are placed at the end of the sub-sections in the tables. Data Sources and Inconsistencies For the production of the Asia-Pacific Human Development Reports, the Regional Human Development Report Unit is a user of data, not a producer. As such, it uses data pro- duced by international institutions with the resources and expertise to do so. Data sources are given in abbreviated form at the end of each table, while the full citations are available in the statistical reference. These sources include online databases, reports of international institutions, the official web- sites of governments, public universities and websites showing national legislation. The databases include the United Nations Statistics Division, United Nations Treaty Collection, UNESCO Institute for Statistics, World Development Indicators online and GenderStats online of The World Bank, ILOLEX Database of International Labour Standards of ILO, the Institutions and Development Database (GID-DB) of OECD, and the Inter Parliamentary Union (IPU).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c3110b6-7f89-4e4d-8ff6-933d3947db37": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c3110b6-7f89-4e4d-8ff6-933d3947db37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45bd00e07708221d4547511953c5c762e6314da2862ecf3254d91b17473c4277"}, "2": {"node_id": "48f7940b-5003-454c-a37b-ff9f68a127aa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cfc7101311524ad5e69f3c8b768f9263e0e8d579c0dd4d4c510743e11df5a2cf"}}, "hash": "4c669cf8b077300f5c73b67c474e4ac08df5b4e0d6ad6e60e1932d8c070286e0", "text": "Reports include UNDP\u2019s global Human Development Report 2009 and 2007/2008, UNDP\u2019s Human Development Indices: A Statistical Update 2008, UNIFEM\u2019s Report on the Progress of the World\u2019s Women 2008/ 2009, the UNDP Pacific Centre and UNIFEM Pacific Regional Office Report on Translating CEDAW into Law 2007, reports of State Parties to the UN Committee on CEDAW, the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 196 Report 2009, and the 2008 Social Watch Report. URLs of online sources may change over time, which explains why the date of access of a given website is mentioned for all online sources. Because international sources often rely on data supplied by national authorities, there can be inconsistencies between the data reported by these two sources. There are several reasons for this. International data agencies often apply international standards and harmonization procedures to improve comparability across countries. Missing data points for a country may be produced by an estimate based on various methodologies, even a small national survey. Because of the difficulties in coordination between national and international data agencies, international data series may not incorporate the most recent data, which often explains the time lag in data from international sources. All these factors can lead to inconsistencies between national and international estimates.

Time Period This Report uses the most recent information available at the time the material went to print. Data are presented at different points in time in order to capture trends, starting from 1990. For most indicators, data are reported at ten-year intervals (i.e. 1990, 2000) and the latest year for which data are available. For example, the latest Gender Gap Index of the World Economic Forum refers to 2009, while the latest year for most socio- economic indicators is 2007. In cases where data for all three reference points (1990, 2000 and the latest year) are not available, data for the year nearest the reference points are used. NOTES ON SELECTED INDICATORS Acceptance of polygamy within society. Produced by the OECD, this indicator sheds light on the acceptance of polygamy (where a person has more than one spouse). The indicator scale varies between 0=no and 1=complete acceptance (OECD n.d.-a.). Adult literacy rate (% aged 15 and older). See definitions of technical terms. Contributing family workers (% of emp- loyed). A contributing family worker is defined according to the 1993 International Classification by Status in Employment (ICSE) as a person who works without pay in an economic enterprise operated by a related person living in the same household (UNDP 2007). The indicator shows the percentage of contributing family workers (female/male) to total employed (female/male). Early marriage (women). Produced by OECD, this indicator refers to the number of girls between 15 and 19 years of age who are currently married, divorced or widowed as a percentage of all persons in that age group. These percentages are derived from census data classified by current marital status, sex and age group (OECD n.d.-a.). Expected years of schooling.

Gross (tertiary) school enrolment (%). Gross enrolment rate is the total enrolment, regardless of age, as a percentage of the population of the age group that officially corresponds to the level of education (World Bank 2009a). It is thus possible that gross tertiary enrolment rate will exceed 100 per cent. Labour force participation rate (% of female/ male population aged 15+). See definitions of technical terms. Life expectancy at birth. See definitions of technical terms. Market activities (% of total work time). This encompasses time spent on activities such as employment in establishments, primary production not in establishments, services for income and other production of goods not in establishments, as defined according to the 1993 revised UN System of National Accounts (UNDP 2007). Maternal mortality ratio (per 100,000 live births). See definitions of technical terms. Missing women. Amartya Sen coined the term \u2018missing women\u2019 to refer to those who have died as a result of discriminatory treatment in access to health and nutrition (Sen 1990a, 1990b). There are several estimates of \u2018missing women\u2019 based on different methodologies. The latest and most robust estimate was given by Klasen and Wink (2002). Mortality rate under age five (per 1,000 live births). This is the probability that a newborn baby will die before reaching age five, if subject to current age-specific mortality rates (WHO 2008). Net (primary/secondary) school enrolment (%). Net enrolment rate indicates children of official school age (based on the International Standard Classification of Education 1997) who are enrolled in school as a percentage of the population of the corresponding official school age (World Bank 2009a).

This indicator shows the share of female ambassadors as a percentage of total ambassadors appointed by a country, as per data compiled during June 2009. The HDRU used the following metho- dology for the calculation of this indicator: First, the list of embassies of the country was obtained from the official ministry website. Second, from each embassy website the name of the ambassador (ambassadors are named as high commissioners in commonwealth member states) was obtained. Third, all ambassadors of a country were disaggregated by male and female. Finally, the percentage of female ambassadors was calculated. Data was compiled for the following Asia-Pacific countries: Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, year of primary school. It is calculated by taking the total number of students in the last grade of primary school, minus the number of repeaters in that grade, divided by the total number of children of official graduation age (World Bank 2009a). Progression to secondary school (%). Progres- sion to secondary school refers to the number of new entrants to the first grade of secon- dary school in a given year as a percentage of the number of students enrolled in the final grade of primary school in the previous year (World Bank 2009a).

This constraint, together with those of time and resources, allowed for the compilation of this indicator for a small sample of countries covering all the sub- regions: Cambodia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Viet Nam from East Asia; New Zealand and Samoa from the Pacific; and Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka from South Asia. Judges in higher judiciary (% female). This indicator shows the percentage of female judges in the higher judiciary of a country, as per data compiled during June 2009. Higher judiciary refers to high and supreme courts (or their equivalent). The HDRU used the following methodology for the calculation of this indicator: First, a list of judges was collected from the official websites of the supreme and high courts in a country. Second, the total number of judges was disaggregated by males and females. Finally, female judges were calculated as a percentage of the total number. Issues in compiling this indicator included: the absence of official websites, availability of data for only Supreme Court judges (Nepal and Mongolia), and availability of data for only High court judges (Bhutan). These limitations, together with those of time and resources, allowed for the compilation of this indicator for only a small sample of countries covering all the sub-regions: Japan, Malaysia, Mongolia and the Philippines from East Asia; Australia and Papua New Guinea from the Pacific; and Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka from South Asia. The Court of Appeal in the Philippines is equi- valent to a high court, the Federal Court in Malaysia is equivalent to a supreme court, and the National Court in Papua New Guinea is equivalent to a high court. In addition to above three indicators, the HDRU compiled information on the legal status of women vis-\u00e0-vis men in terms of seven indicators vital to the three main sub- themes of the Report. The indicators include inheritance laws, marital property rights in case of divorce, nationality laws, gender based violence (three indicators) and paternity laws; they are not available in any database. They are, in effect, an innovative attempt to show gender inequality in legislation in Asia- Pacific countries. The main sources for compiling these indicators were reports of States Parties to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). National legislation is used for countries where no information is available from these reports on specific indicators, or where laws have been changed and new laws have been promulgated since the last report to CEDAW. ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200 For Pacific countries, the UNDP Pacific Centre and UNIFEM Pacific Regional Office Report 2007 is used. This joint study (Jivan and Forster 2007) assesses de jure national legislation in terms of its compliance with CEDAW for nine Pacific countries. Since only a few Pacific countries have submitted reports to the committee, the study is a useful source of information. A detailed discussion of each indicator of legal status and its sources follows. Inheritance law (land and property).

Gender Measures As is now well known, UNDP introduced two new composite indices in its 1995 Human Development Report. The Gender-related Development Index (GDI) assesses the impact of gender inequality on human development. It adjusts the Human Development Index (HDI) by imposing a welfare penalty on gender gaps in the HDI\u2019s three components. The Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) measures the extent to which there is gender equity in economic and political power. It reflects gender equity in participation in governmental and managerial decision- making and professional roles, and economic activity. Since 1995, there have been several other attempts", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d43c49d-4c94-48cc-b7e1-9dec9e7a2fd9": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d43c49d-4c94-48cc-b7e1-9dec9e7a2fd9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb5801c684d2d25caa2a1e2dc70af5e17efb82dcc9d1b91b30aa60fbb668ddcf"}, "3": {"node_id": "da5f7a7e-0a37-403c-8a90-c733ea8eb573", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7bc09e850d44b58383cb8771473e1fd170d6e7b61707b0624c90155f14b7fb3f"}}, "hash": "a8f46f2400b0b0797f7f008bef8458499959363745b5723dfc73d8d989ed7efc", "text": "to construct indices based on gender- disaggregated data. This Report presents the five most popular indices that aggregate gender-differentiated data on most countries of the world (Hawken and Munck 2009). Besides the GDI and GEM, these include Social Watch\u2019s Gender Equity Index (GEI), the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Index (GGI) and the OECD\u2019s Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI). These are briefly introduced here. I. UNDP\u2019s Gender-related Development Index (GDI) While the HDI measures average achievement in basic human development capabilities, the GDI adjusts this to reflect the inequalities between men and women in three dimensions: a long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living (UNDP 2007). The GDI covered 155 countries/areas in 2007, varying between 0 (minimum) and 1 (maximum). Higher values indicate greater gender equality. Dimensions and Indicators 1. A long and healthy life is based on one indicator Life expectancy at birth. 2. Knowledge is based on two indicators Adult literacy rate; and Combined primary, secondary and tertiary gross enrolment ratios. 3. A decent standard of living is based on one indicator Estimated earned income (PPP US $). II. UNDP\u2019s Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) Focusing on women\u2019s opportunities rather than their capabilities, the GEM captures gender inequality in three key areas: political participation and decision-making power, economic participation and decision-making power, and power over economic resources (UNDP 2007). The GEM covered 109 coun- tries/areas in 2007, ranging between 0 (minimum) and 1 (maximum). Higher values indicate greater gender equality. Dimensions and Indicators 1. Political participation and decision-making power is measured by one indicator Women\u2019s and men\u2019s percentage shares of parliamentary seats. 2. Economic participation and decision- making power is measured by two indicators Women\u2019s and men\u2019s percentage shares of positions as legislators, senior officials and managers; and Women\u2019s and men\u2019s percentage shares of professional and technical positions. INDICATORS 203 3. Power over economic resources is measured by one indicator Women\u2019s and men\u2019s estimated earned income (PPP US $). III. The World Economic Forum\u2019s Gender Gap Index (GGI) The GGI captures gender gaps by drawing on 14 indicators, grouped into four dimensions: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival and political empowerment (Hausmann et al. 2009). The GGI covered 134 countries/areas in 2009, varying between 0 and 1. Higher values indicate greater gender equality (or a lower gender gap). Dimensions and Indicators 1. Economic participation and opportunity comprises five indicators Ratio of female labour force participation over male value; Wage equality between women and men for similar work (female-over-male ratio); Ratio of estimated female earned income over male value; Ratio of female legislators, senior officials and managers over male value; and Ratio of female professional and technical workers over male value. 2. Educational attainment comprises four indicators Ratio of female literacy rate over male value; Ratio of female net primary level enrol- ment over male value; Ratio of female net secondary level enrolment over male value; and Ratio of female gross tertiary enrolment over male value. 3. Health and survival comprises two indicators Ratio of female healthy life expectancy over male value; and Sex ratio at birth (converted to female- over-male ratio). 4. Political empowerment comprises three indicators Ratio of women with seats in parliament over male value; Ratio of women at ministerial level over male value; and Ratio of number of years of a female head of state (last 50 years) over male value. IV. Social Watch\u2019s Gender Equity Index (GEI) This index captures gender inequity by drawing upon 10 indicators in three different dimensions: empowerment, economic activity and education (Social Watch n.d.). In 2008, the GEI covered 157 countries, ranging between 0 per cent (maximum gender gap) to 100 per cent (no gender gap). Dimensions and Indicators 1. The empowerment dimension comprises four indicators Percentage of women in technical posi- tions; Percentage of women in management and government positions; Percentage of women in parliaments; and Percentage of women in ministerial posts. 2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da5f7a7e-0a37-403c-8a90-c733ea8eb573": {"__data__": {"id_": "da5f7a7e-0a37-403c-8a90-c733ea8eb573", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb5801c684d2d25caa2a1e2dc70af5e17efb82dcc9d1b91b30aa60fbb668ddcf"}, "2": {"node_id": "4d43c49d-4c94-48cc-b7e1-9dec9e7a2fd9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a8f46f2400b0b0797f7f008bef8458499959363745b5723dfc73d8d989ed7efc"}}, "hash": "7bc09e850d44b58383cb8771473e1fd170d6e7b61707b0624c90155f14b7fb3f", "text": "2.

As opposed to the above four indices, higher values of the SIGI show higher gender inequality. Dimensions and Indicators 1. The family code dimension refers to institutions that influence the decision- making power of women in the household. It comprises four indicators Early marriage measures the percent- age of girls between the ages of 15 and 19 who are married, divorced or widowed, providing an indication of forced or arranged marriages; Polygamy measures the acceptance within a society of men having multiple wives. Women in polygamous relation- ships are frequently prevented from pursu- ing a pro-fessional or academic career and are generally much younger than their husband; Parental authority measures whether women have the same right to be a legal guardian of a child during marriage, and whether women have custody rights over a child after divorce; Inheritance measures whether widows and daughters have equal rights as heirs. In many countries, inheritance is the only way in which women can obtain owner- ship of land, for example. 2. Physical integrity comprises two indi- cators Violence against women measures the existence of women\u2019s legal protection against violent attacks such as rape, assault and sexual harassment; Female genital mutilation measures the share of women who have been subjected to any type of female genital cutting. 3. Son preference reflects the economic valua- tion of women. It is based on one indicator Missing women measures gender bias in mortality due to sex selective abortions or insufficient care given to baby girls. 4. Civil liberties comprises two indicators Freedom of movement measures the level of restrictions women face in moving freely outside of their own household, for example by being able to go shopping or visit friends without being escorted by male members of the family; Freedom of dress measures the extent to which women are obliged to follow a certain dress code in public; for example, in some countries, women may be required to cover their face or body when leaving the house. 5. Ownership rights cover women\u2019s rights and de facto access to several types of property. It includes three indicators Women\u2019s access to land measures women\u2019s rights and de facto access to agricultural land; Women access to property other than land measures women\u2019s rights and de facto access to other types of property, especially immovable property; Women\u2019s access to credit measures women\u2019s rights and de facto access to bank loans. Even though women generally have the legal right to obtain credit, they frequently face restrictions, as when banks ask for the written permission of a woman\u2019s husband or require land as collateral, an asset women frequently don\u2019t have.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3348ecfd-c5f5-4dbd-a735-a1bb6185837d": {"__data__": {"id_": "3348ecfd-c5f5-4dbd-a735-a1bb6185837d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7172751c5bcdadf4d9f2b5d0e0f094ec724afcd648a12cff7906736f560c181f"}, "2": {"node_id": "3c907001-150a-4c98-bda7-84221cc6b598", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f905bac8e247ab289502aa5b68f91abd805687823a61e257e48a6eacdd8fe7c4"}}, "hash": "1390f6de0a22c7ee569e44042e75d735134b04c76e0b8d0e9062bb42a24c70ac", "text": "INDICATORS 205 HDI AND MACROECONOMY TABLE 1 HDI TRENDS HDI trends By HDI rank (2007) 1990 1995 2000 2007 East Asia 10 Japan 0.918 0.931 0.943 0.960 23 Singapore 0.851 0.884 .. 0.944 26 Korea (Republic of) 0.802 0.837 0.869 0.937 30 Brunei Darussalam 0.876 0.889 0.905 0.920 66 Malaysia 0.737 0.767 0.797 0.829 87 Thailand 0.706 0.727 0.753 0.783 92 China 0.608 0.657 0.719 0.772 105 Philippines 0.697 0.713 0.726 0.751 111 Indonesia 0.624 0.658 0.673 0.734 115 Mongolia .. .. 0.676 0.727 116 Viet Nam 0.599 0.647 0.690 0.725 133 Lao People's Democratic Republic .. 0.518 0.566 0.619 137 Cambodia .. .. 0.515 0.593 138 Myanmar 0.487 0.506 .. 0.586 162 Timor-Leste .. .. .. 0.489 Korea (Democratic People's Republic of) .. .. .. ..

Notes: Missing women: \u2018Missing women\u2019 refers to those who have died as a result of discriminatory treatment in access to health and nutrition. The figures here are calculated by applying 2007 female population on estimate of percentage of missing women by Klasen and Wink 2002. Early marriage (women): Number of girls between 15 and 19 years of age who are currently married, divorced or widowed in a particular age group as a percentage of all persons in that age group (OECD n.d.-a.). Polygamy: Acceptance of polygamy (i.e. the practice of marriage in which a person has more than one spouse) within a society (between 0 = no and 1 = complete acceptance) (OECD n.d.-a.).

Aggravating factors \ufffd Climate change exacerbates horizontal inequalities through compounding stress on existing socio\u2010economic disparities. For example, different groups within a single society are affected disproportionately, e.g., indigenous1 peoples, women, rural\u2010urban peoples, etc. 1 Note that the definition for \u201cindigenous\u201d is problematic in Asia and does not have full acceptability. 5 \ufffd Climate change\u2010related natural hazards and disasters can push people who are already vulnerable beyond their coping capacities, leading to forced adaptation rather than the more favourable planned adaptation. Opportunities \ufffd New economic opportunities such as \u201cgreen jobs\u201d and investment areas for countries embracing green technology. Countries in the region who are at the forefront of a green economy today will be in a stronger position in the future to whether the financial costs of climate stresses. Asia\u2010Pacific countries have made important strides in using green technology and energy such as harnessing wind power and producing electric\u2010powered bicycles. Policies have made important contributions to these successes. \ufffd Strengthening low carbon and climate resilient societies in the region will help to ensure citizen safety and provide democratic dividends through popular support for clean air and water and stronger livelihood strategies, especially for the poor in the agricultural sector. \ufffd Traditional knowledge can play an important role in bolstering coping capacities and also with South\u2010South cooperation in the region. Complex issues \ufffd Attempts at solutions can lead to new or \u2018second generation\u2019 problems that affect people\u2019s lives. \ufffd \u201cVulnerability\u201d is not a static concept and can many different dimensions. For example, migration from coastal regions to inland areas creates new vulnerabilities inland. There is no concrete measure or definition of vulnerability. Map and Measure Human Development (HD), taking account of Climate Change (CC) \ufffd By attempting to map and measure climate change more concretely, it can increase visibility of the challenges as well as provide entry points to policy and programmatic responses which target critical barriers to change. The effects of climate change are complex and less visible unlike, say, pollution. The latter gets much more attention due to its visibility. \ufffd Capture emerging good practices of climate change adaptation, mitigation and local wisdom from communities at the forefront of the phenomenon. 6 \ufffd Explore vulnerability mapping by expounding on disaster risk reduction hazard mapping and Geographic Information System (GIS) instruments in order to get assist in forming action\u2010oriented solutions. \ufffd Build on the existing work of other indices, Human Development Index (HDI), Happy Planet Index (HPI), etc., to reflect on CC vulnerability indicators and indices which may aid policies in addressing climate change impacts to vulnerable groups. Barriers to change \ufffd Lack of knowledge and awareness on the human impacts of climate change and on existing good practices in the region to combat the problem. \ufffd Prevailing work on the subject of climate change does not factor in the on the ground realities of disadvantaged and marginalized communities, who are often the most vulnerable to its effects. Lack of focus on \u201cvulnerability\u201d as a dimension of analysis when planning and implementing climate change related policies and programmes. \ufffd A country\u2019s internal political circumstances and conditioning can have an adverse effect on efforts to tackle climate change. Often politicians have short\u2010term horizons of 5 years or less election timelines, thus, priority is often placed on getting short\u2010term results for political gains. Climate change has to be mainstreamed as part of the public administration through institutional capacity development. \ufffd Attitudinal barriers are important to recognize in action plans. There is a sense of helplessness among people, especially those who are the forefront or most vulnerable to climate change such as the poor, as the gravity of the phenomenon seems insurmountable.

Climate\u2010related disasters are increasing in frequency and intensity, leaving little time for planned adaptation. \ufffd Climate change has traditionally been worked on by policymakers as a technical subject in the realm of environmental science, however, it should be looked at as a development issue as issues of governance, socio\u2010economic conditions, transboundary issues such as migration and livelihoods, affect people, especially the most vulnerable. \ufffd CC impacts and vulnerability are often location specific. \ufffd There is a need to qualify the debate on growth vs. addressing climate change by using the human development lens as a bridge to address concerns over the long term sustainability of current growth patterns. \ufffd As climate change impacts do not respect national borders, recognizing and understanding the interconnectedness in the region is critical to catalyze regional cooperation \ufffd There is a need for specific indicators to measure climate change as it relates to human vulnerability. Recommendations for the AP HDR \ufffd The human development perspective and APHDR provides an innovative niche to bring divergent perspectives together through evidence\u2010based research and analysis, focusing on the human impacts and vulnerabilities resulting from climate change and their corresponding implications for policy, programmes and advocacy. \ufffd Given the fact that most climate change issues are transboundary in nature, it is important that regional cooperation is strengthened to adequately address its impacts. Thus, the APHDR should engage with regional organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). 8 \ufffd By applying a human development perspective to climate change it can refocus the debate from an exclusive technical/environmental to a \u2018people issue\u2019. \ufffd Avoid presenting only technical related arguments only. Consider also \u2010 Moral, physical, existential perspectives. \u2010 Intergenerational issues i.e. what will we bequeath to our children? \u2010 Faith and values can be important tools to support and explain complex issues. 9 East Asia Consultation 26\u201027 April, 2010, Bangkok, Thailand Summary of Main Issues and Key Suggestions Priority Issues \ufffd Mitigating the effects of climate change in the region require focusing on the two major sources of carbon emissions \u2010 energy and transportation. These two areas are and have been some of the most powerful drivers of economic development in the region, which demonstrates a central trade\u2010off between solely pursuing growth and mitigating the effects of climate change in the region. \ufffd Many of these countries\u2019 systems and processes have gone down a road of \u2018path dependence\u2019 when it comes to using such \u2018climate unfriendly\u2019 energy and transportation systems, making it increasingly difficult to shift to new energy and transportation models which are more low carbon in nature. Changing to more \u2018green\u2019 methods can also mean greater capital investment is required initially, as many of these technologies are newer than and not as efficient as coal or other high carbon energy sources. \ufffd Vulnerable groups of people are often those who lack the capabilities, freedoms and opportunities in life such as capital, knowledge and technology. \ufffd Women in rural areas are especially vulnerable to climate change, as users and managers of natural resources, and it is becoming difficult for them to secure local natural resources for which they are highly dependent on for cooking and heating, key activities in the unpaid care economy. \ufffd Women and children are particularly vulnerable when key sectors such as water and sanitation are affected. Negative impacts in these sectors often act as an additional stress to vulnerable groups being forced to migrate and relocate, often affecting access to regular education, which can decreases capabilities for future generations contributing to a cycle of poverty and vulnerability. \ufffd Adverse climate impacts on agriculture, fisheries and livestock due to drought and fluctuation of water cycles would affect the entire household income of farmers, fisher folks and other communities which thrive on such natural resources for livelihoods and health (nutrition). 10 \ufffd Ethnic minorities face issues of land rights from forced migration and resettlement due to lack of recognition and control to such productive resources. \ufffd The elderly and disabled are also vulnerable as they are prone to health risk and lack access to quality social services without additional support.

People in uplands and lowlands are often dependent on the same resources. The linkages between the upstream and downstream are often very weak however the negative effects of climate change makes any response to one dependent on action in the other. \ufffd Poverty and poor adaptive capacity: Vulnerability is high due to high poverty and low adaptive capacity to increased climate variability and intensity. Data analysis which is representative at national level is lacking, hence the number and dimension of the most vulnerable groups remains inconclusive. \ufffd Farmers bear the brunt of climate change, which can have its impact on small and big, highland and lowland farms. \ufffd Herders and shifting cultivators are more vulnerable to climate change with decreasing capacity to adapt over time with increased climate variability. They are changing their risk aversion practices due to the climatic variability and, in turn, becoming more vulnerable. These communities are found giving up agriculture and migrating to other sources for their livelihoods. \ufffd The degree of vulnerability differs among different groups of people, geographic location, ecological zones, etc. Vulnerability has to be contextualized, like linking mountain ecosystem to lowlands or coastal ecosystems. In coastal areas, vulnerability to food security is due to salinity and inundation, risk of shelter and livelihoods, food sovereignty, river bank erosion etc. The urban poor are another vulnerable group which has not been studied adequately in the context of climate vulnerability. \ufffd Mountain specificity: Mountain areas such as Bhutan and Nepal share similar landscapes \u2010 except for the low lands (terai belt) of Nepal \u2010 and have common issues related to climate change. Pressing use of water resources has become an issue in both countries. For instance, 50% of Bhutanese mountain revenue comes from water resources. The rising cost of delivering good health services to people and minimizing vector\u2010borne diseases has been compounded with rising temperature in higher altitudes. Some opportunities like rice planting in higher altitudes are increasing and, with the rise in temperature, local inhabitants have started changing cropping and eating patterns as well. These changes could be associated with health risks that farmers are not yet aware of. 20 \ufffd The tendency to focus exclusively on \u201cadaptation options\u201d may miss out on important mitigation threats and opportunities and long\u2010term poverty reduction, \ufffd Adaptation is considered to be more a local issue but mitigation is more market driven \ufffd Mitigation programmes in the region need to be scaled up as existing ones are mostly at a pilot stage and, increase in emissions due to population growth will only compound the problem further.

I. Asia\u00adPacific Human Development Report on Climate Change (By Anuradha Rajivan, HDRU Regional Programme Coordinator, UNDP Asia\u00adPacific Regional Centre) The presentation defined the Human Development Report (HDR) and highlighted the latter\u2019s emergence as the only UN report with backing from the UN General Assembly through a series of resolutions (latest 57/264 in 2003). The HDR\u2019s uniqueness was laid out in terms of its: credibility as a standalone publication for a wide external audience; potential for capacity\u2010building and advocacy; and reliability as a tool to provide a forum for public policies and advocacy. It was indicated that the HDRs are commissioned and facilitated by the UNDP inputs from leading scholars, development practitioners, advocates and members of the HDR teams within UNDP offices. It was noted that the East Asia Stakeholder Consultation aimed to introduce the Asia\u2010Pacific Human Development Report (APHDR) and to provide a platform for sharing experiences and brainstorming priority issues, barriers to change, solutions as well as better ways of measuring climate change effects on ordinary lives. The outcome is expected to enable the APHDR to identify and sharpen concerns in the subregion, paying particular attention to vulnerable groups and communities, thus, to enable the Report to reflect priorities and experiences for climate change and human development consistent with examining and measuring climate change from a human development angle. By building a critical mass of capacity and promoting buy\u2010in, the Report, thus, will strengthen its policy advocacy potential. Good practices presented have the potential to serve as policy pointers. 29 The presentation included a technical section on the human development key dimensions (Sustainability, Equity, Empowerment, Efficiency, and Participation). It was also necessary to explain the 2\u2010way relationship between human development and climate change and the birth process of climate change as a Regional HDR theme and that the Report will address climate change beyond geographical or environmental phenomenon. Notwithstanding the need to balance political sensitivity and credibility, it was stressed that focusing the APHDR on climate change will require adopting a constructive and balanced approach throughout the process of selecting strategic areas that are transformative; presenting clear policy content; and contributing to something new/different. The presentation concluded by urging all to explore and contribute to what could be key messages that link up issues with human development, help issues to \u2018pop\u2010out\u2019 and identify solutions to point the way forward. II. Climate Change and Human Development: Some key issues for the Mongolia HDR 2010 (By P.B. Anand, Principal International Consultant \u00ad NHDR, UNDP Mongolia) The National Human Development Report (NHDR) of Mongolia messages the complementary role of economic growth and environmental conservation in the human development equation. Hence, it is not a question of choosing one over the other as economic development, at the expense of the environment, stands to annul growth achievements in the long run. While in the short run, an increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) may boost Human Development Index (HDI), adverse effects of unchecked pollution may ultimately affect life expectancy. Results of a survey of local governors demonstrated that more than 50% of the sample believed that environmental challenges and human development are highly relevant to soum and aimag (districts and territories, inhabited primarily by nomadic herders).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eac5d0c7-190c-45af-abb7-3c24474c4f4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "eac5d0c7-190c-45af-abb7-3c24474c4f4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report on Climate Change: Asia Stakeholders Consultation Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2eb0ea555d947f126e22970c1683861935975c06eb1e0853ea9eb1dfe7a49e6b"}, "2": {"node_id": "df550870-c46b-44fd-a956-3605c930cf00", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f05ca1bc02111edd70d345874bd1d190b802d4b60f9161c942836d9ee5a6b83f"}}, "hash": "144c24b8f812f12ed31b929d67cfaf17be04a2e715eb21b9d9867162b6e5c057", "text": "Environmental challenges and human development nexus calls for the following: i) Putting people at the centre of discussions; ii) Using human development as an integrating framework; and iii) Deliberating processes to decide priorities and focus of the report.

III. Climate change impacts and barriers to adaptation in Viet Nam (By Koos Neefjes, Policy Adviser for Climate Change, UNDP Viet Nam) The Viet Nam\u2019s National Target Program on Responding to Climate Change (NTP\u2010RCC) which encompasses all sectors puts forward plans and strategies, including: disaster risk management and preparation for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD); dyke building; relocation; and energy efficiency. Viet Nam\u2019s development ambitions should remain high in the face of climate change vulnerability. Nevertheless, climate change negotiators are increasingly active in international climate change negotiations. The primary challenge is to strengthen the country\u2019s adaptive capacities of all sorts, which includes its research base and collaboration; and coordination with and between new institutions. Fast rising energy demand and rapid urbanization along with rising climate change threats are some of the critical greenhouse gas mitigation challenges which Viet Nam is experiencing. While \u201cefficiency\u201d seems to be the \u201clow\u2010hanging fruit\u201d for cutting GHG emissions, there is a need for international capital and technology transfer, and knowledge for emissions mitigation. With dedicated action, technology can give social benefits in a gender neutral way. Moreover, for Clean Development Mechanisms (CDMs) to be effective, supporting regulations must be in place. A good level of awareness is key. 31 It was highlighted that Viet Nam is \u2018particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change\u2019, by UNFCCC definition. Sea level rise, enhanced saline water intrusion, drought, river floods, enhanced typhoons and storm surges, heavy rainfall and heat waves are examples of pressures that particularly affect the most vulnerable women, children and the elderly, ethnic minorities, migrants and poorer urban dwellers. Geographically, the deltas and coastal lowlands are affected, as well as the highlands, including both rural and urban areas. The sectors particularly sensitive are agriculture, transport, industry, education and health care are affected, and other sectors too. Climate modelling data produce average changes over a range of scenarios, but they are not conclusive evidence enough to show that weather are become increasingly extreme. Weather extreme\u2010related disasters are slow\u2010onset that gradually accumulates stresses on lives and livelihoods. Thus, there is a need for information to show how much worse waves, floods, droughts, and storm surges can get, when will they occur and where? It was indicated that the overall objective of climate change adaptation should be to strengthen the resilience of people, regions and sectors, and enhance the ability of authorities and businesses to deliver services despite climate change stresses. Some of the most pressing challenges, needs and barriers reveal the need for investment in R&D to support policymaking and adjustments including migration policies, and knowledge of migration advantages; training; infrastructure development including climate proofing; capacity\u2010building and raising awareness. IV. Exploring linkages: Climate change adaptation and human development (By Ajaya Dixit, Expert, Institute for Social and Environmental Transition (INSET), Nepal) This presentation offered valuable insights into the science that forecasts the future climate variability of Nepal in terms of increase in temperature along with more erratic precipitation. It also warned that the latter scenarios must be interpreted and used cautiously due to complexities linked to highly varied topography over short distances. Moreover, there are weather station data limitations, namely, accessibility, station placement, lack of resources: finances and human, which would prevent understanding of precipitation distribution. 32 However, it was stressed that uncertainty does not imply absence of vulnerability and adaptation. The latter also means more than \u201ccoping\u201d. For example, in well adapted systems people, environment and other features \u201cdo well\u201d. The continued development and improvement in the quality of life should not lead to ill effects. Adaptation may be regarded as the ability to switch strategy. The presentation made a distinction between autonomous and planned adaption: see illustration below.

V. Climate Change, Poverty, and Vulnerability in the Hindu Kush \u2013Himalayan Region(by Andreas Schild, Director General, and Brigitte Hoermann, Action Area Team Leader, International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD)) This presentation discussed three theses: (i) Adaptation to climate change and vulnerability reduction in the mountains as closely linked to poverty reduction and MDGs; (ii) Reducing vulnerabilities in the mountains is part of a global strategy for sustainable development; and (iii) Climate change creates not only increased vulnerabilities but also opportunities For illustration and description of drivers of change and vulnerabilities using the position of the \u201ctree line\u201d: see illustration below. 34 The Drivers of Change \u2022 Above the tree line climate change is a major driver The affected: Trans-himalayan traders, herders (Ethnic minorities). \u2022 Below the tree line the main drivers of change are Govern-ment interventions (infrastructure, \u2022policies) Globalization(Communication transport, urbanization, migration, Climate change Most Affected: minorities, women, poor people \u2013 basically the hill community Downstream Hill population Tree line Level if ice melts The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) predict that the fragile mountain areas are particularly vulnerable to climate change effects. In South Asia, climate\u2010related specificities of mountain vulnerabilities are linked to patterns change in temperature and precipitation; impact on snow and glaciers; and water availability from river systems. It was noted that climate stress induced by natural hazards aggravates poverty and inequality when it adversely impacts biodiversity, ecosystem services, agriculture, and food security, thereby, threatening traditional livelihoods. The call for equity in the adaptation debate focused on higher poverty, lower reduction rate, pronounced climate change, constraint by mountain specificities, inequality and regional stability and security, and sustainable up\u2010 and downstream linkages. Below are some illustrations of food and non\u2010food poverty trends in Nepal 35 Trend of People in Nepal under the Food Poverty Line (in %) 0 20 40 60 1996 2003 year Mountains&Hills Terai KTM Valley Total Food Poverty Trends according to Ecological Zones Mountains/Hills National Average Plains Capital City % of Population living in Food Poverty Trend of People in Nepal under the Non-Food Poverty Line (in %) 0 20 40 60 1996 2003 year Mountains&Hills Terai KTM Valley Total Non-Food Poverty Trends according to Ecological Zones Mountains/Hills National Average Plains Capital City % of Population living in Non- Food Poverty The presentation concluded by emphasizing the need for action and that this requires understanding realities and intensifying poverty reduction and ensuring climate sensitivity for 36 sustainable upstream\u2010downstream linkages. Climate change may create opportunities for mountain people at three levels: local, national, and global. The way forward towards an equitable, secure and sustainable future for both up\u2010 and downstream people and transboundary linkages have shown that, among others, local knowledge and context play a key role in adaptation planning. Moreover, adaptation should be linked to poverty alleviation strategies while identifying common solutions and problems. Regional knowledge and debate forum serving regional policymakers and international development actors are good platforms for addressing specificity of mountain communities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d92b192-5df9-48fe-a611-8812ae40293c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d92b192-5df9-48fe-a611-8812ae40293c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report on Climate Change: Asia Stakeholders Consultation Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fbae7d159658f07b98c82e77f8c80b0f4590b41cf930c1ba3263ddfde9294ccd"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb80346f-6c5d-4194-a25d-122cdb47797b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a2efaefcf23cc0c801a3c173fb0ddf82a36a43beb83e8b1b4c03d29605f0031"}}, "hash": "bc25be69843ee9f7e0530dd34855bcb3c992bddbd5e23bd210b2394a54c5cbd7", "text": "Appendix 2: Matrix to Apply the Human Development Lens to Climate Change in Asia CLIMATE CHANGE AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT HD DIMENSION & ISSUE: SUSTAINABILITY \u2010 EQUITY \u2013 EMPOWERMENT\u2010 EFFICIENCY \u2013 PARTICIPATION (S\u2010E\u2010E\u2010E\u2010P) CAUSES CONSEQUENCES (THREATS) INDICATORS / EVIDENCE POLICIES/LAWS/ PROGRAMS/ (OPPORTUNITIES) SUSTAINABILITY Survival: coastals;

it is one that has been around and would continue to be shaped by the current multiple crises that face society, especially the poor. Even though categorized as the less\u2010exposed country to climate change, the main issue for Cambodia remains its vulnerability to natural disaster, given the unique hydrological regime and limited coverage of water control infrastructure. These phenomena are more pronounced in prolonged and frequent droughts and floods. Most rural households reply heavily on subsistence agriculture for their livelihood, with an estimate of 72%.

While affected by the burden of economic crises and idiosyncratic shocks, the vulnerability of the poor is aggravated by the adverse effects of climate change, thus building up and bringing about deeper impoverishment. The household property, agricultural inputs, and finally land, were mobilized as negative coping strategy. Finally, the dilemma linked to barriers to change is not whether policies demonstrate willingness but that of adaptive capacity as actions: 1. The way that climate change is addressed around \u201cBusiness as usual\u201d at the policy level has yet to be well integrated and systematic in the context of current poverty profile. 2. As mentioned early, because everybody is at risk of climate Change but more pronounced for the poor and vulnerable, addressing to the issues must take an integrated approach. Using social protection strategy to address climate change through public work programme(s) and community awareness development is yet an issue to be taken into consideration. In fact, it is a crucial issue since adaptive capacity of Cambodia to climate change is relatively low. 3. The coordination among stakeholders towards a harmonized action (Act Now, Act Together, Act Different as stated in World Development Report) is met with willingness in Cambodia but it has to progress beyond the current situation. This can be achieved when climate change is no longer seen as a standalone field but a cross\u2010cutting and cross\u2010sector issue by stakeholders. 4. The coordination of dialogue and implementation of climate change adaptation intervention programme(s) (as an integral part to an overall social protection programme) is not only to 41 ensure policy cohesion among policymakers at national level but also to ensure the active participation from grass root levels to private sectors. Yet, the issue remains questionable. The scheme of new approaches such as REDD, CDM, or Payment for Ecosystem Service (PES) will encourage the participation of the two main latter stakeholders. 5. Financial resource, while expected to increase under adaptive intervention to climate change, will hit a dilemma when competing with poverty reduction objectives. In the context of social protection, pro\u2010poor climate change expenditure has to be seen as an investment rather a burden. 6. Last but not least, information and knowledge exist at different levels and there is a need to collect and collate them. Cost\u2010effective technological innovation along with demands from community need to be promoted. Education for bringing about attitudinal change towards environmental concerns By Dr. Jaishree Sharma, Professor of Chemistry, DESM, NCERT, India In India, as early as 1937, serious attempts have been made to connect the school education with local environment. The roots of the present status of environment education can be traced back to the Indian Education Policy document of 1964. The National system of education is based on curriculum framework that is evolved depending on the needs and aspirations of the nation. In general, it consists a common core which includes values like protection of environment, egalitarism, removal of social barriers, development of scientific temper etc. The common core is deliberated by cutting across different subject areas. Environment education is therefore a compulsory part of school syllabus throughout the country. The children therefore are well aware of their responsibilities and rights. Studies show that what needs is to make all children take judicious steps in favour of environment. Though the present curriculum framework, attempts are being made to expose children to the real life natural and social situation where they are encouraged to critically evaluate, analyze and draw inferences about various environmental problems and issues, prior to taking any action. The environmental concerns are woven through the texts of difference subjects at appropriates places with ample opportunities of doing activities and projects. The project books on Environment Education (EE) brought out by the National Council of Education Research and Training (NCERT) aims at bringing out the desired attitudinal changes among the children so that when they enter the world of work they think critically towards environmental issues and act accordingly. Children are encouraged to observe the various R\u2019s\u2010 Reduce, Reuse, Refuse, Recycle, Rethink etc so that they work for conservation of energy and material. The Supreme Court of India has also intervened by directing to make EE compulsory for all stages of education, including Higher Education. 42 The NCERT through an annual event Jawaharlal Nehru Science Exhibition (JNNSEC), where at least one of the five sub\u2010themes is on the environment, also provides a platform to children in the age group 13 to 17 where they exhibit various innovative methods and techniques. Though many concerted efforts are being made to bring about the desired attitudinal changes among the children and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ae1284b-1e28-4051-af9b-4c36977dd876": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ae1284b-1e28-4051-af9b-4c36977dd876", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report on Climate Change: Asia Stakeholders Consultation Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ba498cbb6d9c9936b30636bc33ca4435baf546fc28b894d260859cf977b42cb"}}, "hash": "7ba498cbb6d9c9936b30636bc33ca4435baf546fc28b894d260859cf977b42cb", "text": "there are many success stories also like, saying no to crackers, switching off the energy devices when not required; saying no to any wastages of material like food, paper, cloths; keeping the surrounding clean etc but still a lot has to be done before the environmental concerns become a way of lifestyle. Mongolia National Human Development Report (NHDR) 2010 By P.B. Anand, Reader, Department of Development and Economic Studies, University of Bradford, UK; Shoko Noda, Deputy Resident Representative, UNDP Mongolia; Tsetsgee Puntsag, PREF II Project, UNDP Mongolia For Mongolia, climate change is not an issue of concern about things in distant future but something that is already impacting livelihoods today. Examples of issues: 1. Agriculture is the second biggest contributor to GDP. Within that, pastoralist livestock keeping is the key livelihood for more than a third of all households in Mongolia. Climate variability has increased vulnerability of herder households in the various ecological regions within Mongolia differently. For those in the southern region (around the Gobi), increasing summer temperatures are an issue while for those in the northern and central regions, increasing frequency of \u2018dzuds\u2019or harsh winters are a major challenge. Introduction of private property rights and enormous increase in herd size by some of the large herders have weakened traditional pastoral land allocation mechanisms and in some aimags [districts], increasing pressure on land is contributing to degrading of pastures and forests. 2. More than one half of nation\u2019s population now lives in urban areas. Domestic heating, transport, industry and energy production activities are the principal users of energy and thus principal contributors of consequent greenhouse gas emissions. Some studies and popular perceptions point a finger of blame at the so called \u2018ger\u2019 districts in cities such as Ulanbaatar where more than 55 per cent of all households live. However, part of the problem lies in the fact that heating distribution systems from combined heating and power plants do not supply to residents in gerdistricts. As a result, such households end up using coal, firewood and even wastes collected from streets (plastics, tyres). A related issue is that of localized air pollution especially in winters and its potential impact on morbidity and mortality especially among the poorer households. Mitigation measures of climate change would require a serious evaluation of energy use patterns. Though technology can play a role in improving energy efficiency, there is a need for a host of other interventions also including creating appropriate 43 policies, developing appropriate incentive mechanisms, consumer education, creating a role for market or quasi\u2010market mechanisms where this is appropriate, improving regulatory capacity of the state and connecting energy issues with climate change mitigation strategies. Examples of barriers: 1. In Mongolia, scientific evidence is very clear. However, it can also lead to a certain sense of helplessness as climate change is seen to be something beyond control. There is a need to highlight the need for actions now and how these can still prevent or minimize lasting negative changes. 2. There is a tendency to consider climate change to be mainly affecting rural economy. There is a need to highlight the connection between climate change and all sections of society i.e. increasing food prices, increasing rural to urban migration and climate refugees, impoverishment of those who remain in countryside]. Climate Change: The Case of Myanmar By Htun Paw Oo, Forestry and Environment Specialist, Post Nargis Recovery Programme, UNDP Myanmar Myanmar is endowed with one of the largest forest covers in the Asia and the Pacific region. The country\u2019s population was estimated to be about 57 million in 2009. About 75% of the country's total populations are rural and dependent greatly on goods and services from the forests to meet their basic requirements including food, fuel, fodder and timber. To achieve sustainable forest management the Government of Myanmar formulated and adopted the Myanmar Forest Policy in 1995. The old Forest Act of 1902 was replaced by the new Forest Law in 1902, and enacted Protection of Wildlife and Wild Plant and Conservation of Natural Areas Law and related rules . The environmental policy was formulated in 1994 and followed by the formulation of \u201cMyanmar Agenda 21\u201d which underscores the strategic course guiding to promote and sustain the overall development in the country. Considering the aforementioned national policies and legislations on forestry and environment as well as broad consultation with relevant stakeholders, seven environmental concerns were prioritized to evaluate the effectiveness of environmental management policies and protection measures within the last one and half decade.

Temperatures are warmer, southwest monsoon is advancing later and later and also withdrawal is becoming earlier and earlier, so duration of monsoon is shorter and shorter. However cyclone duration season becomes longer, frequencies are increasing and cyclones are becoming stronger and stronger also takes more abnormal tracks. Rainfall pattern also changes and there are heavier rain spells causing more risk of landslides and floods. Myanmar\u2019s average temperature has increased at a rate of 0.1\u20130.3\u00b0C per decade and sea level rise has also noticed especially in Ayeyarwady Delta. The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts, floods, and tropical cyclones in recent decades are also evidence that climate change is already affecting the country. Climate change is worsening water shortages; constraining agricultural production and threatening food security; and causing forest fires, coastal degradation, and greater health risks. The government of Myanmar signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on 11 June 1992 and ratified the convention on 25 November 1994. Myanmar is also a party to several international and regional conventions and agreements relating to the climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction. Myanmar is preparing its National Adaptation Plan of Action (NAPA) and the Second National Communication under the UNFCCC. Myanmar ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2003 as a non\u2010Annex I party. Myanmar implemented a GHG emission inventory project, titled \"Asia Least\u2010cost Greenhouse Gas Abatement Strategy\" during 1995 and 2007. The project assessed the GHG emissions in energy, forestry and land\u2010use change, and agriculture sectors setting 1990 as a base year. Based on the data collected during the project, the projection of GHG emissions to 2020 was estimated. Moreover, formulation of a national least\u2010cost GHG abatement strategy, a portfolio of least\u2010cost GHG abatement projects, a national GHG action plan and recommendations and future actions on GHG emissions in Myanmar were also done during the project. Myanmar has initiated to develop CDM since 2005 through awareness workshops and meetings. Designated National Authority (DNA) was established in 2006 in order to approve the proposed CDM projects at national level, to coordinate and facilitate implementing CDM projects in various sectors of Myanmar, to connect with international organizations for CDM project activities, and to provide information on CDM projects to related ministries, organizations and private sectors. DNA of Myanmar is led by Minister of Ministry of Forestry, the secretariat and joint secretariat, who are senior officials from the Forest Department, and is formed by 22 members representing 15 ministries. DNA is now preparing the procedures and to form the technical teams which are necessary to approve a proposed CDM project in Myanmar. Recently, a National Workshop on Reduction from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) has been held on 7 April 2010 jointly organized with the Ministry of Forestry and UNDP Myanmar.

Major Climate Change Related Concerns The most important climate change potential threats to Pakistan are identified as: \u2022 Increased variability of monsoon; \u2022 Rapid recession of Hindu Kush\u2010Karakoram\u2010Himalayan (HKH) glaciers, threatening water inflows into the Indus River System (IRS); reduction in capacity of natural reservoirs due to glacier melt and rise in snow line; \u2022 Increased risks of floods and droughts; \u2022 Increased siltation of major dams resulting in greater loss of reservoir capacity; 46 \u2022 Severe water\u2010stressed and heat\u2010stressed conditions in arid and semi\u2010arid regions, leading to reduced agriculture productivity and power generation; \u2022 Increased upstream intrusion of saline water in the Indus delta, adversely affecting coastal agriculture, mangroves and breeding grounds of fish; and \u2022 Threat to coastal areas including the city of Karachi due to sea level rise and increased cyclonic activity due to higher sea surface temperatures The above threats lead to major concerns for Pakistan in terms of its Water Security, Food Security and Energy Security. Some other climate change\u2010related concerns of Pakistan are identified as: Increase in deforestation; loss of biodiversity; increased health risks (heat strokes, pneumonia, malaria and other vector\u2010borne diseases) and risks to other vulnerable ecosystems (e.g. rangelands, degraded lands, mountainous areas etc.). Mitigation Pakistan is a small GHG emitter and, like other developing countries, its emissions are bound to increase considerably as the country climbs over the development ladder and strives to provide adequate amount of energy to support its growing socio\u2010economic developmental needs. Still, as a responsible member of the international community, Pakistan would like to contribute to the global GHG mitigation efforts without compromising on its basic minimum energy and food needs consistent with its socio\u2010 economic developmental requirements, energy security considerations, and financial and technological constraints. Energy Energy efficiency improvement at all levels in the energy system chain; energy conservation measures and use of energy\u2010efficient devices; rapid development of hydropower resources; large scale use of various renewable energy technologies; expansion of nuclear power programme; acquisition and adoption of clean coal technologies such as Coal Bed Methane Capture (CBMC), Integrated coal Gasification Combined Cycle power generation (IGCC), and CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS); development of mass transit systems in large cities; and greater use of CNG as fuel for urban transportation. Agriculture and Livestock Development and adoption of (i) new methods of rice cultivation that have lower methane emissions, (ii) new methods for reducing nitrous oxide releases from agricultural soils, (iii) new breeds of cattle which are more productive in terms of milk and meat but have lower methane production from enteric fermentation, and (iv) new economical feeds that reduce methane production activity of cattle besides providing them with better nutrition. Forestry Promotion of afforestation and reforestation activities to the maximum possible extent. 47 Adaptation Water Resources Addition of sufficient reservoir capacity on IRS rivers so that even during high flood years no water flows down Kotri in excess of what is necessary for environmental reasons; local rain harvesting and building of surface and sub\u2010surface storages for agriculture and other local needs; adoption of stringent demand management and efficiency improvement measures in all water\u2010use sectors, particularly in the supply, distribution and use of irrigation water; reuse of marginal quality irrigation effluent.

Source: Final Report from the Task Force on Climate Change, Planning Commission, Government of Pakistan, February 2010. 48 Climate Change: A Major Cause of Concern for Pakistan By Arshad M. Khan, Global Change Impact Studies Centre, Islamabad, Pakistan Pakistan is extremely vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change because of its location in a highly climate\u2010sensitive world region. Its economy being primarily agrarian is prone to vagaries of weather and changing climate. Of the many climate change\u2010related concerns that Pakistan faces today, the two most serious concerns are the threats to its Water Security and Food Security. Water Security: Pakistan is a water\u2010stressed country heading, under population pressure, to become a water\u2010scarce country (with per capita availability less than 1000 m3/y) by 2035. The country\u2019s primary sources of water are rainfall brought down by monsoon and westerly winds (averaging about 60 billion m3/y), and river inflows in the Indus River System (IRS) (averaging about 175 billion m3/y) fed largely by glacier and snow melt from the Hindukush\u2010Karakoram\u2010Himalayas (HKH) mountain ranges. The climate change is threatening the water security of Pakistan through impacts such as (i) rapid melting of the HKH glaciers, resulting in the loss of Natural Reservoirs (ii) increased variability of river flows due to increase in the variability of monsoon and winter rains, coupled with the loss of natural reservoirs in the form of glaciers, (iii) increased frequency and severity of extreme events such as floods, droughts, cyclones etc., (iv) increase in sediment flow due to increased incidences of high intensity rains resulting in more rapid loss of reservoir capacity, etc., which hardly corresponds to about 30 days of average river flows, and (v) increased demand of irrigation water due to higher evaporation rates and of environmental flows in the deltaic region to prevent excessive intrusion of saline water due to sea level rise. The main barriers to the Adaptation effort to counter these challenges are: (a) non\u2010availability of adequate, reliable data (b) lack of technical expertise to monitor glacial changes and project future patterns of monsoon and climatic changes in the KHK region and their impacts, (c) lack of financial resources, coupled with socio\u2010political constraints preventing rapid development of additional reservoir capacity, and (d) lack of technical know\u2010how and financial resources to improve the efficiency of water supply, distribution and use in various sectors, particularly agriculture. Food Security: Agriculture and Livestock subsectors together contribute about 22% to the national GDP (about 11% by each). The agriculture system in Pakistan is mainly irrigated\u2010 to the extent of 88% of the cultivated area Climate change is likely to result in reduced crop productivity due to heat stress, as the temperatures in most regions are already above optimum, as well as due to water stress, since higher evapotranspiration at elevated temperature would require more irrigation water, which will be difficult to supply. Coupled with this will be the higher production losses due to more frequent and intense floods and droughts and more incidences of pests and insects. The Climate change will also affect the productivity of livestock due to heat stress and degradation of rangelands. At present the major constraints to avoiding these adverse impacts are inability to increase the supply of irrigation water (as discussed above) and absence of regulations to preserve rangelands. 49 Mainstreaming Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation in the Development Agenda: Key Policy Issues in the Philippine Context By Arsenio M. Balisacan, Professor of Economics, School of Economics, University of Philippines For the Philippines (as well as most other developing countries), responding to the challenge of climate change is complicated by the fact that the country is faced with serious pre\u2010existing development problems, particularly persistently high poverty and a widely degraded natural and man\u2010made resource base. Viewed from the development experiences of the country\u2019s neighbours, these problems have their roots in policy and governance failures to create productive employment opportunities and sustained income growth for the rapidly burgeoning population. Fiscal resources to fix these problems are extremely limited, even assuming that the country can raise its low tax effort to the norms of its neighbours.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f438118-210e-4dd2-958f-f990199633bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f438118-210e-4dd2-958f-f990199633bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report on Climate Change: Asia Stakeholders Consultation Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d910be5771476c386e25095e0b4f84a157cacc32ff091f882a99e111474dd713"}, "2": {"node_id": "48c7d5a8-1914-42df-a04c-aee934aa908f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f0452709b5ef283b45105ce2c150b16f744b4ddff08af0e04639c7786316934"}}, "hash": "e7d48759013d96a8a6d1fb6743fe5a9016dd2134e1e2909b45516330bc5e87d6", "text": "And so are the resources needed to address the challenges of climate change.

One way of reducing this risk is perhaps to (initially) focus the country\u2019s climate change response to adaptation measures, particularly to vulnerable groups in society, rather than mitigation measures. This implies that the country\u2019s response to climate change has to be anchored on the societal goals of winning the war on poverty and achieving sustained economic growth and development. Operationally, this will involve bringing in climate change adaptation strategies within the development agenda for poverty reduction and sustained economic growth. Adaptation measures will then be seen in terms of their efficiency (cost\u2010effectiveness) in contributing to these goals. There is a need to answer questions like, how is climate change exacerbating the poverty situation in the Philippines due to previous policy failures to address poverty and food insecurity? Given the fiscal bind, what policy interventions can be put in place to make the country more agile in confronting the challenges of climate change, while ensuring that such interventions do not crowd out resources intended for meeting poverty reduction and food security goals? Such information is needed to assess the potentials for coping with more drastic climate change and the prudent investments necessary to make the adaptation strategies a success. Recognizing that there is no one\u2010size\u2010fits\u2010all solution, it is imperative that the development stakeholders \u2013 the government, the private sector, and the science community \u2013 need to work together to: (i) identify, develop, and support appropriate, location\u2010specific adaptation practices and technologies, including those currently used by farmers, fisher folk, and other stakeholders, and focus efforts and resources on refining such practices for more scaled up applications; (ii) formulate policies and instruments that would enable a more effective public\u2010private sector partnership in managing risks resulting from climate variability; (iii) owing to the archipelagic nature of the Philippines, give commensurate attention to climate change adaptation measures relating to the marine environment 50 and resources; (iv) expand and deepen public awareness of factual climate change issues and solutions; and (v) develop decision tools and simulation models that would provide quantitative assessments of the effects, consequences, and sustainability of policy and investment options on climate change adaptation. Effects on climate change and its variability on agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods of Sri Lanka: Issues and barriers By B.V.R. Punyawardena, Research Officer (Climatology), Natural Resource Management Center, Department of Agriculture, Sri Lanka; A.Mallawatantri, Assistant Resident Representative, UNDP Sri Lanka In spite of the recent technological advances on plant breeding, irrigation, plant protection and fertilization, climate and its variability is a critical factor in the agricultural productivity of the Island Nation of Sri Lanka in South Asia. Historically the farming systems and agronomic practices in different agro\u2010ecological regions of the country have evolved in harmony with the climatic regime of respective regions. However, it has been evident in recent years that the heritage of farming experiences and accumulated weather lore of centuries are no longer the main driver in the process of agricultural planning, primarily due to climate change. Climate regime of the island has changed to an extent that no longer the correct amount of rainfall nor the times of rain help conditions for an optimal growing season, as in the past. Meanwhile the ambient temperature also shows a rising trend with a web of negative impacts and new challenges on the agricultural sector. Sri Lankan economy and quality of life of rural poor is highly dependent on quality and quantity of agricultural outputs. Furthermore the Country is susceptible to droughts, floods, landslides and cyclones with poor as the most affected. Hence, unless addressed in a holistic manner the change and variability of climate has a great potential to inflict a severe strain on rural livelihoods primarily due to reduction of quality and quantity of crop yields and reduced quality of life due to increased natural disasters. Major issues of change and variability in climate with respect to agriculture & livelihood in Sri Lanka can be summarized as: Reduction of crops yield due to increased variability of rainfall resulting a) Soil moisture stress on rain fed upland crops; b) Inadequate irrigation water at crucial times; c) Flood damages to crops grown in flood plains; d) Excess soil moisture for upland crops at certain times; d) Increased post\u2010harvest losses due to abnormal rains; e) Increased soil erosion and sedimentation of downstream reservoirs; and f) Increased pest and disease infestations. Reduction of crop yields due to increasing ambient temperature resulting a) Reduced food reserves in crops due to reduced photosynthesis and increased respiration rates; b) Desiccation of pollens; c) Spikelet sterility in grain crops, especially in rice;", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a007352-2583-4624-bf28-87c1aef57348": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a007352-2583-4624-bf28-87c1aef57348", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report on Climate Change: Asia Stakeholders Consultation Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "73c23344492424a9e4ce52f84493bc2d31dd1360514270d1f7b93a297738910a"}, "3": {"node_id": "297bcb38-6f32-4b1e-af12-aae1c186ff23", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9f573fb370bd1937ac8a806614362934f905665e56e412c35241585e0e6f8860"}}, "hash": "1fab373699fa946eb450ec122245503d89a128b5d89d8ce230780d1172cdc156", "text": "d) Reduced bulking of tuber crops especially in potatoes; e) Increased soil moisture stress due to high evapotranspiration; f) Reduced availability of irrigation water due to rapid drying up of irrigation tanks; and g) Increased pest damages.

Climate change impacts and barriers to adaptation in Viet Nam By Koos Neefjes, Policy Advisor Climate Change, UNDP Viet Nam Viet Nam is \u2018particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change\u2019, as per the UNFCCC. Sea level rise, enhanced saline water intrusion, drought, river floods, enhanced typhoons and storm surges, heavy rainfall and heat waves are pressures that particularly affect the most vulnerable women, children and the elderly, ethnic minorities, migrants and poorer urban dwellers. The deltas and coastal lowlands are affected, as well as the highlands, including both rural and urban areas; agriculture, transport, industry, education and health care are affected, and other sectors too. But Viet Nam is not as vulnerable as other countries, because it has adaptive capacities of all sorts. The primary challenge for the country is to improve those further, which will require domestic efforts and international capital, knowledge and technology transfers, so that climate change adaptation actions can in fact become development opportunities. Climate modelling data produce average changes over a range of scenarios, but are not conclusive on how weather extremes are becoming more extreme. Weather extremes are causing disasters and also slow\u2010onset or gradually accumulating stresses on lives and livelihoods. There will be more heat waves, floods, droughts, and storm surges; but how much worse, when and where? The overall objective of climate change adaptation should be to strengthen the resilience of men, women, children, communities, regions and sectors, and enhance the ability of authorities and businesses to deliver services in the face of climate change stresses. Some of the most pressing challenges, needs and barriers include the following: 1. Financial needs are enormous, including domestic and international finance, public and private, e.g., infrastructure, capacity\u2010building, research and awareness raising. 52 2. Financing mechanisms to receive international finance, generate domestic investment capital, and channel it to sectors and localities, researchers and businesses, etc., must be developed, which requires major capacity\u2010building efforts. 3. Capacities for climate proofed spatial planning (across existing administrative boundaries) should increase drastically, of e.g. river basins, coastal areas, and urban corridors, to ensure that climate change adaptation is considered thoroughly, especially to avoid future costs. 4. Adaptation infrastructure investments must be made, especially \u2018no\u2010regret\u2019 investments that are beneficial independent of the seriousness of climate change, in climate proofing of existing and new infrastructure and special structures are also needed. 5. Major investment in agriculture R&D, extension, and infrastructure are needed to protect livelihoods, increase productivity, and maintain national food security and export earnings. 6. Forest conservation and expansion are becoming possible with the promises of additional finance from REDD and thus the potential to increase the resilience of livelihoods and protection of communities (upland forests and plantations, coastal mangrove belts). 7. Migration and resettlement in support of livelihood resilience must be enabled to maintain and improve resilience of people and services in both sending and receiving communities. This requires study of migration advantages, policy adjustments and investments. 8.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "297bcb38-6f32-4b1e-af12-aae1c186ff23": {"__data__": {"id_": "297bcb38-6f32-4b1e-af12-aae1c186ff23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report on Climate Change: Asia Stakeholders Consultation Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "73c23344492424a9e4ce52f84493bc2d31dd1360514270d1f7b93a297738910a"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a007352-2583-4624-bf28-87c1aef57348", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fab373699fa946eb450ec122245503d89a128b5d89d8ce230780d1172cdc156"}}, "hash": "9f573fb370bd1937ac8a806614362934f905665e56e412c35241585e0e6f8860", "text": "This requires study of migration advantages, policy adjustments and investments. 8.

THE ASIA\u00adPACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORTS The Asia\u2010Pacific Regional Human Development Report (RHDR) on Climate Change will be the fourth in a regular series, led by the Human Development Report Unit, housed at the UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo.2 The first RHDR in this series was the 2006 Report titled Trade on Human Terms: Transforming Trade for Human Development in Asia and the Pacific which was followed by the one on corruption, Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives: Accelerating Human Development for Asia and the Pacific and the newly launched Power, Voice and Rights: A Turning Point for Gender Equality in Asia and the Pacific. HDRs are policy\u2010advocacy tools to explore critical development issues from a human development perspective. There is a fundamental difference between a technical analysis of an issue versus an exploration from a human development lens, which is an important element of the value added of 2 For greater details on the process of the Asia Pacific Human Development Report series, please see the attached HDRU note on the subject 54 an HDR.3 HDRs aim to provide policy options by bringing people to the centre of development concerns for poverty reduction, countering inequalities, promoting internationally accepted development goals and, ultimately, promoting human development. 2. CLIMATE CHANGE: BEYOND LIVING DANGEROUSLY The Asia\u2010Pacific region has changed immeasurably in the space of a generation. During the mid to late 1970s average per capita incomes were low, literacy rates were low, and average life expectancy was little over 50 years. Over the past quarter of a century consistent high growth rates have helped to roll back poverty in many countries, significantly expand the middle class, improve social mobility, and cultivate the aspirations of hundreds of millions for a better life. This \u2018better life\u2019 for most means greater opportunities for education of their children, but equally for greater access to the spoils of the global economy. In short, the expanding Asia\u2010Pacific middle class aspires to consume more, and their leaders would like them to do just that. With failing export markets today, Asian economies are taking steps to encourage greater domestic consumption. For example, in China, rural residents are being provided with incentives to spend more, such as subsidies for buying cars, computers, mobile phones and kitchen appliances. The main driver of this initiative may be the financial crisis itself \u2013 the need to shift the balance of growth from exports to domestic spending. But the underlying premise is that sustained and increasing consumption is the only way to maintain the viability of the current social contract, based on a promise of future prosperity. Yet there is increasing realization among leaders across Asia and the Pacific that the very substantial welfare gains that have been made possible thus far are based on a growth model that is fundamentally unsustainable. This realization is nothing new. The environmental movement has its roots in the energy crisis of the late 1970s and the subsequent limits to growth debate, culminating in the Brundtland Commission report \u2013 Our Common Future (1987). More than a decade ago, UNDP coined the term \u2018sustainable human development\u2019 and began to re\u2010orient its programmes accordingly \u2010 with the strong support of its Executive Board. 3 For details, see APRI 2005. \u201cFrom Development to Human Development: Tool for Examining Themes from a Human Development Perspective.\u201d 55 However it was not until the 2005 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change that the issue of global climate change has truly graduated into the mainstream. With this review came the realization that a new development paradigm must now be forged \u2013 on the basis of human ingenuity, new sources of financing and investment, as well as unprecedented levels of international cooperation. But despite all the evidence of global climate change and the call for a de\u2010 coupling of growth from environmental degradation, there is still very little clarity or agreement on how this new paradigm should be constructed \u2013 in simple terms \u2018what is the alternative?\u2019 East Asia will face the brunt of climate change impacts.

The most visible impact is the Asian Brown Cloud which causes major impact on health and induces chronic weather conditions, such as the China northern drought and southern flooding. East Asian nations are increasingly focusing on multilateral finance for technology transfer and development as a cornerstone to any agreement. In a region that has significant opportunities in space and resources, how do governments develop a modern vision that encompasses sustainable mobility and deep change in consumption patterns and lifestyles of (aspiring) middle class society? The 2010 APHDR on Climate Change seeks to bring a unique perspective to this debate by providing new and innovative Asia\u2010Pacific thinking on some of the key ingredients of what a more sustainable pathway might be. By looking at a number of distinct groups of people across the region already being affected by climate change, but who also have high aspirations and are \u2018on the move\u2019 socio\u2010economically, the APHDR will seek to identify policy levers that can be used to begin to encourage a broad scale shift in mindset \u2013 towards a new development paradigm for Asia\u2010Pacific. 56 3. OBJECTIVES OF THE CONSULTATIONS The East Asia consultation will take place in Bangkok, Thailand on April 26th\u201027th and will primarily focus on a cross section of governments and intergovernmental organizations, civil society, academia and think tanks, and media institutions based in the respective sub\u2010region. Given the resource and time constraints involved in physical consultations, current and additional stakeholders are encouraged to continue to provide inputs through the Asia\u2010Pacific Human Development Network (AP\u2010HD net :http://www2.undprcc.lk/ext/HDRU/index.php). The AP\u2010HD net will be hosting an extensive online discussion on the sub\u2010themes and issues which the Report will speak to, as the research develops. The East Asia stakeholder consultations aim to: o Introduce East Asian stakeholders to the Asia\u2010Pacific HDR history, concept, process and the proposed approach for the theme of 'climate change' for this Report, namely the identification and focus on vulnerable groups and communities. o Discuss an 'East Asian perspective' for understanding climate change, its myths and realities, causes and consequences, and opportunities. o Take stock of stakeholder perceptions and priorities in identifying and sharpening sub\u2010 themes that are cognizant of the concerns in East Asia. o Discuss ways in which climate change is presently being examined and measured and consider alternative indicators as proxy measures that focus more sharply on human development. o Extrapolate national and regional policy implications from vulnerability analysis, paying attention to climate change mitigation and adaptation linkages. o Share an overall view of climate change state of play, key issues and evolving debates and challenges in East Asia, taking into account post Copenhagen outcome and implications. o Provide a platform for stakeholders to share experiences and good practices, highlight priorities and solutions that affect people's lives. o Support capacity development by working with stakeholders to apply the human development lens to climate change issues and solutions. o Tap into East Asian thinking in addressing possible politically controversial aspects of the work. o Promote buy\u2010in for the APHDR and thus strengthen its policy advocacy potential. 57 4. EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THE CONSULTATION \u2022 Identify East Asian perspectives and priorities on climate change and human development and how the East Asian experience can be best reflected in the Report \u2022 Advance the ongoing discussions for the Report taking into account the following suggested outline which has been developed following recent brainstorming sessions: 1. A vision of human development through a low carbon climate\u00adresilient (LCCR) society 2. Mapping and measuring human development from a climate change perspective in East Asia 3. People at the centre: vulnerabilities and opportunities in East Asia 4. Making the LCCR society a reality: going beyond the adaptation\u00admitigation dichotomy \u2022 Sharpen the indicative directions for the APHDR on Climate Change. 58 Annex B CONCEPT NOTE ASIA\u00adPACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ON CLIMATE CHANGE SOUTH ASIA STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS Kathmandu, Nepal, 29th\u201030th April, 2010 1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a34f416e-f6dc-4e85-bc79-5c48b348dcbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "a34f416e-f6dc-4e85-bc79-5c48b348dcbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report on Climate Change: Asia Stakeholders Consultation Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e9a7f16bd491d89ed0f39617c8f47c86b4a324c93532b4531ab6deea1acee476"}, "2": {"node_id": "de0eb014-5bcc-422b-871e-450b7b0ac86c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "065d709d5e1a6ed260cfeefceb345260119aa1d4d57914da0038e8d23f5a1684"}}, "hash": "14c817487a7cf4ea1be6f30273189f8b6f055de9db261061718eb42e373fa30e", "text": "THE ASIA\u00adPACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORTS The Asia\u2010Pacific Regional Human Development Report (APHDR) on Climate Change will be the fourth in a regular series, led by the Human Development Report Unit, housed at the UNDP Asia\u2010 Pacific Regional Centre, Colombo Office.4 The first RHDR in this series was the 2006 Report titled Trade on Human Terms: Transforming Trade for Human Development in Asia and the Pacific which was followed by the one on corruption, Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives: Accelerating Human Development for Asia and the Pacific and the newly launched Power, Voice and Rights: A Turning Point for Gender Equality in Asia and the Pacific.

Various types of adaptation exist, e.g. anticipatory and reactive, private and public, and autonomous and planned. Examples are raising river or coastal dikes, the substitution of more temperature\u2010shock resistant plants for sensitive ones, etc. \ufffd Adaptive capacity: The whole of capabilities, resources and institutions of a country or region to implement effective adaptation measures \ufffd Adaptation fund: Finances adaption projects and programmes in developing countries that are Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. The Fund is financed with a 2% share of credits (CERs) from Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project activities and can receive funds from other sources \ufffd Adverse effects/impacts: Adverse effects or impacts, refers to the potential negative effects of human\u2010induced climate change as well as the impacts resulting from implementation of response measures. Such effects or impacts include, e.g. sea level rise, changes in precipitation, storms or other weather patterns, and reduced demand for fossil fuels or other energy intensive products. Impacts of climate change can be positive as well as negative \ufffd Anthropogenic emissions: Emissions of greenhouse gases, greenhouse gas precursors, and aerosols associated with human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, land\u2010use changes, livestock, fertilization etc. \ufffd Bali Action Plan: A plan drawn up at the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali, in December 2007, forming part of the Bali roadmap. The action plan established a working group to define a long\u2010term global goal for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and a \"shared vision for long\u2010term co\u2010operative action\" in the areas of mitigation, adaptation, finance and technology \ufffd Carbon footprint: The amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organization in a given period of time, or the amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product \ufffd Carbon sequestration: The storage of carbon or carbon dioxide in the forests, soils, ocean, or underground in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, coal seams and saline aquifers. Examples 87 include: the separation and storage of CO2 from flue gases or the processing of fossil fuels to produce H2; and the direct removal of CO2 from the atmosphere through land\u2010use change, afforestation, reforestation, ocean fertilization, and agricultural practices to enhance soil carbon \ufffd CDM (Clean Development Mechanism): Defined in Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol, CDM projects undertaken in developing countries are intended to meet two objectives: (1) to address the sustainable development needs of the host country; and (2) to generate emissions credits that can be used to satisfy commitments of Annex 1 Parties and thus increase flexibility in where government Parties meet their reduction commitments. Projects that limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions can earn the investor (governmentor industry) credits if approved by the CDM Executive Board. A share of the proceeds from the project activities (US $0.10 per CER for first 15,000 tonnes CO2eq; US$0.20 per CER there after) is used to cover administration costs, and 2 percent of the credits are assessed to create an adaptation fund to assist developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects from climate change to take action to adapt \ufffd Climate change: Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings, or to persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. Note that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, defines climate change as: \u2018a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods\u2019.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1aee1c48-acb9-42e4-8f2e-fe2a0480efae": {"__data__": {"id_": "1aee1c48-acb9-42e4-8f2e-fe2a0480efae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report on Climate Change: Asia Stakeholders Consultation Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b7f1937221f29201fee22fb3ef2f563569125693b299b95b6d7c366d2fc7b784"}, "2": {"node_id": "dc242a68-6204-4867-9f7b-38134323e8a4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-asia-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f53f9697a4d51861d0f2f932b191e28ecbed809968a90752183c593873f4135"}}, "hash": "fb36d73cfbcef9fccfa7857f179ba44bedc687a0ce018b742e2dc3dcd0a10e82", "text": "The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric composition, and climate variability attributable to natural causes.

Suggested alternate definition: The observed increase in global average surface temperature, whether attributable to natural or human\u2010induced causes \ufffd GHG (Greenhouse gases): Greenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of thermal infrared radiation emitted by the Earth\u2019s surface, the atmosphere itself, and by clouds. This property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapour (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and ozone (O3) are the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Moreover, there are a number of entirely human\u2010made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as the halocarbons and other chlorine and bromine containing substances, dealt with under the Montreal Protocol. Beside CO2, N2O and CH4, the Kyoto Protocol deals with the greenhouse gases sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) \ufffd IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change): Panel established in 1988 by governments under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization and the UN Environment Programme. It prepares assessments,reports and guidelines on: the science of climate change and its potential environmental, economic and social impacts; technological developments; possible national and international responses to climate change; and cross\u2010 cutting issues. It is currently organized into 3 Working Groups which address: I) Science; II) Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability; and III) Mitigation. There is also a Task Force to develop methodologies for GHG inventories \ufffd Kyoto Protocol: The Protocol, drafted during the Berlin Mandate process, that requires countries listed in its Annex B (developed nations) to meet differentiated reduction targets for their emissions of a \u2018basket\u2019 of greenhouse gases (see \u2018Kyoto Basket\u2019 (*)) relative to 1990 levels by 2008\u201312. It was adopted by all Parties to the UNFCCC in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997 and entered into force on 16 February 2005. *Under the Kyoto Protocol, Parties have 89 committed to control emissions of a \u2018basket\u2019 of six GHGs. This \u2018basket\u2019 includes carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, HFCs, PFCs and SF6. The arrangement is meant to give the flexibility which would enable a Party to increase emissions of any gas in the \u2018basket\u2019 provided commensurate reductions were made in another gas in the \u2018basket\u2019 \ufffd Mitigation: Technological change and substitution that reduce resource inputs and emissions per unit of output. Although several social, economic and technological policies would produce an emission reduction, with respect to Climate Change, mitigation means implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance sinks \ufffd NAPA (National Adaptation Plan of Action): In 2001, COP\u20107 established the NAPAs programme to provide a process for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to identify and prioritize their adaptation needs \ufffd Per capita emissions: The total amount of greenhouse gas emitted by a country per unit of population \ufffd Pre\u00adindustrial levels of carbon dioxide The levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere prior to the start of the Industrial Revolution.

CC is a national security issue (especially in atoll nations), elevating CC risks to a higher level. \uf0a7 Migration (forced) being not a one day occurrence as a result of a dramatic event, that is, issue of food security and salt-water intrusion may make it far more likely that instead of thousands of climate refugees arriving on any country\u201fs door at one time, it is a continuous trickle, which may already have started. Lack of international recognition of status of climate refugees. \uf0a7 Conflict: Increased migration has the tendency to increase pressure on land\u201fs carrying capacity due to overconcentration of humans and human activities on a given land area. Hence, the outbreak of conflict and disputes over land rights and resources. \uf0a7 Politics/Language: Replace Small Island Developing States (SIDS) with Big Ocean States (BOS). \uf0a7 Lifestyle: The distributional impact of CC goes beyond countries borders and is really about unsustainable lifestyles in both developing and developed countries. Although vulnerable areas in poorer countries will suffer the bulk of climate disasters in the absence of safety nets and multiple vulnerabilities. \uf0a7 Consumption: Address issues of sustainable consumption, not increased consumption owing to the lack of domestic demand and capacity limitations. Unlike Asia where a higher consumption level is possible although it is important that Asian countries do not move away from sustainability. 9 Approach \uf0a7 To strengthen and advocate for HD, use the human rights language to frame arguments. \uf0a7 Ensure people at the center \u2013 this should not be a resources/environmental report. \uf0a7 The proposed approach using \u201evulnerabilities\u201f and \u201eopportunities\u201f is strongly validated. \uf0a7 Dramatize the effects of CC to \u201cget the message out\u201d.

It was also necessary to explain the 2-way relationship between HD and CC and the birth process of CC as a RHDR theme and that the Report will address CC beyond geographical or environmental phenomenon. Notwithstanding the need to balance political sensitivity and credibility, it was reiterated that focusing the APHDR on CC will require adopting a constructive and balanced approach throughout the process of selecting strategic areas that are transformative; presenting clear policy content; and contributing to something new/different. It was heard that the following major decisions have been reached: i) focus to be on vulnerable groups to inform policy recommendations; ii) sharpen focus to avoid spreading too thin leading to dilution; iii) continue to be solution oriented; and iv) provide opportunities for country level programming The presentation concluded by urging all to explore and contribute to what could be key messages that link up issues with human development, help issues to \u2018pop-out\u2019 and identify solutions. 16 II. Gender and Climate Change issues and UNDP\u2019s responses (By Winnie Byanyima, Director, UNDP Gender Team) The early part of this presentation on Gender and CC highlighted the following: i) CC differentiated impact on the poor, and women and girls; ii) the fundamental role of women as managers of natural resources; iii) women\u2019s right to equal representation; and the iv) potential to improve efficiency in CC Policies and Programmes through gender mainstreaming. The purpose of revealing some shocking statistics from previous studies relating to disaster impact on gender was to make the convincing case that climate risks and vulnerabilities and division of gender roles in society are strongly linked. Evidently, the number of deaths involving women in disasters was found to be strongly correlated to the protection of women\u2019s rights. Since empowerment of women is a major determinant of their survival, this underscores the urgency to prioritize efforts to support adaptation and risk reduction strategies/initiatives in that direction. The presentation also considered specific cases from the Pacific which demonstrated that women\u2019s involvement in increased public outreach in local communities and capabilities in networking have proven valuable in post-disaster reconstruction and in preparedness and pre-disaster mitigation planning. Moreover, in the Pacific where gender roles and knowledge are somewhat defined and segregated, women\u2019s observations and involvement could add significant value to environment programmes. Equally, divisions of labour between men and women that denote different experiences and understanding can offer a good entry point for gender-sensitive programming. The shortcomings and failures of some of the earlier high-profile global conventions to put women or gender on the forefront of CC agenda were noted. Even so, only a few National Strategies and Plans have addressed gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment considerations. The presentation concluded by mentioning the ongoing work of the UNDP Gender Team to lead actions on gender and CC, in partnership with other UN agencies and international civil society organizations, including the IUCN, Women\u2019s Environment and Development Organization (WEDO), UN Environment Programme (UNEP), and other institutions through the Global Gender and Climate Alliance (GGCA). III. Environment and Climate Change (By Bernard O\u2019Callaghan, Programme Coordinator, International Union for Nature Conservation, Pacific) The presentation focused discussions on the consequences of CC on the environment, in particular, wetland ecosystems and resulting livelihood implications. The vulnerability of Pacific countries from climate disasters was stressed. 17 CC impact on coral reefs and mangroves will threaten the existence of communities who depend on them for provision of fish and fuel, to name a few. It is anticipated that globally 60 per cent of coral reefs will be lost by 2030, of which over 40 per cent are in the Pacific. Fifty per cent of mangroves are estimated to be lost and already the Pacific has been adversely affected. Albeit a low percentage contribution to global carbon emissions, Pacific Islanders are the most vulnerable to climate disasters. Nevertheless, some countries such as Tonga and Tuvalu, are already taking steps to mitigate CC effects, for instance, through energy policies to tap into renewable sources. Apparently, Tonga has set out to achieve 50 per cent of renewable electricity production in the next 3 years; Tuvalu 100 per cent by 2020. Renewable energy in these places could benefit local development, education, livelihoods, gender issues and income. The presentation concluded with a reminder that addressing CC challenges necessitate a change of mindset in society and government. It is imperative to adopt new values, ethics and integrity to achieve sustainable development goals in the three dimensions of economic, social and environmental. IV.

Moreover, there is a gap in the many cross-cutting themes - including gender, migration, health, to name a few \u2013 and how to address vulnerable groups. . Other obvious \u2018niches\u2019 for the APHDR include looking at mitigation and adaptation together, and a focus on opportunities as well as vulnerabilities. The Pacific was discussed at length in terms of knowledge gaps and possible niche areas that the APHDR could explore. In the discussion that followed, the following topics (previously identified by UNDP in the Pacific) were agreed upon as possible niche areas where there is potential to say something new/different: \uf097 Interface between Climate Change, Human Rights, Disasters, and the Potential for Conflict \uf097 Nexus between Global Financial and Economic Crisis and Climate Change \uf097 Particular Vulnerabilities of Atoll Countries \uf097 Displacement of Populations and even Countries \uf097 Climate Change and Food Security \uf097 Aid Effectiveness, Coordination & Management \uf097 Identification of and Investment in the most Effective Climate Change Adaptation Measures 18 The situation of \u201cvulnerable groups (VGs)\u201d in the Asia-Pacific was viewed in terms of their socio- economic condition; natural resource dependency; geographical context; and climate hazards. To each of these dimensions, indicators and ranking identified VGs inherent characteristics and predicament. Important to note that in the early stages of identifying groups that had already been studied, only 3 out of 28 were groups from the Pacific \u2013 need for appropriate representation of the pacific given particular vulnerabilities was emphasized in the discussions that followed. The presentation concluded by putting forward the following three questions for open discussions: \uf0a7 What are the priority issues for the Pacific? \uf0a7 What recommendation will help address climate change while promoting human development? \uf0a7 Are there any experiences or good practice examples from the Pacific that you\u2019d like to share? V. Climate Change, Risk Minimization and Human Development (By Padma Lal, Chief Technical Adviser, International Union for Nature Conservation, Pacific) The presentation gave a snapshot of the manifold threats of CC from both the socio-economic and sectoral perspective. A two-way relationship was drawn between climate disasters and HD and HD influence on CC to provide an insight into the potential capacity of human resilience and response to CC. Key findings of a study on the recent 2009 Fiji floods shed light on the role of HD in dealing with climate impact as the confluence between addressing elements of poverty, economic development and social conditions and CC risk minimization. This Fiji case study confirmed that HD condition is inversely correlated to climate vulnerabilities. The term \u201cvulnerability\u201d was conceptualized \u2013 at individual household and national level - as having the following three characteristics: Sensitivity to hazards; ability to respond; and ability to cope. Conclusively, sensitivity to climate hazards was defined in terms of coping ability and reactive capacity to CC. These depended heavily upon income, access to basic amenities (water, adequate sanitation) and education at an individual household level. Further, one\u2019s propensity to save was seen to be a function of a prospect of rebounding from climate disasters. At a national level, the strong determinants of sensitivity to CC are a country\u2019s economic base, fiscal position and tax revenue base. The presentation posed the question as to the approach the CCA should adopt, that is, sectoral or multi- pronged which addresses facets of vulnerability linked to sensitivity to climate hazards; and choices to be made in the short- and long-term as to whether to address symptoms (sectoral) or underlying sensitivities (HH income, economy, fiscal). 19 Lunch Hour Question and Answer (Q&A) The stakeholder consultation was preceded by a lunch hour screening of the \u201cPeople First\u201d introductory video plus a Q&A session.

THE ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORTS The Asia-Pacific Regional Human Development Report (RHDR) on Climate Change will be the fourth in a regular series, led by the Human Development Report Unit, housed at the UNDP Regional Centre for Asia-Pacific, Colombo Office.1 The first RHDR in this series was the 2006 Report titled Trade on Human Terms: Transforming Trade for Human Development in Asia and the Pacific which was followed by the one on corruption, Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives: Accelerating Human Development for Asia and the Pacific and the latest RHDR on \u201egender\u201f to be launched at the end of 2009. HDRs are policy-advocacy tools to explore critical development issues from a human development perspective. There is a fundamental difference between a technical analysis of an issue versus an exploration from a human development lens, which is an important element of the value added of an HDR.2 HDRs aim to provide policy options by bringing people to the centre of development concerns for poverty reduction, countering inequalities, promoting internationally accepted development goals and, ultimately, promoting human development. 1 For greater details on the process of the Asia Pacific Human Development Report series, please see the attached HDRU note on the subject 2 For details, see APRI 2005. \u201cFrom Development to Human Development: Tool for Examining Themes from a Human Development Perspective.\u201d 25 2. CLIMATE CHANGE: BEYOND LIVING DANGEROUSLY The Asia-Pacific region has changed immeasurably in the space of a generation. During the mid to late 1970s average per capita incomes were low, literacy rates were low, and average life expectancy was little over 50 years. Over the past quarter of a century consistent high growth rates have helped to roll back poverty in many countries, significantly expand the middle class, improve social mobility, and cultivate the aspirations of hundreds of millions for a better life. This \u201ebetter life\u201f for most means greater opportunities for education of their children, but equally for greater access to the spoils of the global economy. In short, the expanding Asia-Pacific middle class aspires to consume more, and their leaders would like them to do just that. With failing export markets today, Asian economies are taking steps to encourage greater domestic consumption. For example, in China, rural residents are being provided with incentives to spend more, such as subsidies for buying cars, computers, mobile phones and kitchen appliances. The main driver of this initiative may be the financial crisis itself \u2013 the need to shift the balance of growth from exports to domestic spending. But the underlying premise is that sustained and increasing consumption is the only way to maintain the viability of the current social contract, based on a promise of future prosperity. Yet there is increasing realization among leaders across Asia and the Pacific that the very substantial welfare gains that have been made possible thus far are based on a growth model that is fundamentally unsustainable. This realization is nothing new. The environmental movement has its roots in the energy crisis of the late 1970s and the subsequent limits to growth debate, culminating in the Brundtland Commission report \u2013 Our Common Future (1987). More than a decade ago, UNDP coined the term \u201esustainable human development\u201f and began to re-orient its programmes accordingly - with the strong support of its Executive Board.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fe9572e-9986-4dcd-94db-fa2e7d84bd01": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fe9572e-9986-4dcd-94db-fa2e7d84bd01", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report on Climate Change: Pacific Stakeholders Consultation Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ce7c8b8d836337910ecbc34cb3eae751503f86aaebea47643311c45c7963355"}, "2": {"node_id": "f078ca4a-87de-4192-874f-923ac69a123d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-climate-change-pacific-stakeholders-consultation-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5829bac5901fd49c3e6bda144fd6fddce53e5d31a1f980c4b3ca5cc8f15c429a"}}, "hash": "8c47238ca17fe147fb5c1267d02a72911f8865e13178cdfc441d232a5c86129d", "text": "However it was not until the 2005 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change that the issue of global climate change has truly graduated into the mainstream.

But despite all the evidence of global climate change and the call for a de-coupling of growth from environmental degradation, there is still very little clarity or agreement on how this new paradigm should be constructed \u2013 in simple terms \u201ewhat is the alternative?\u201f 26 Pacific small island developing states are on the front line of climate change with clear distinctions from many Asian countries.3 In particular, rising sea levels and the increased frequency and severity of tropical storms, floods and droughts point to a highly probable social, economic and ecological crisis. Pacific countries are also highly vulnerable to climate change through insecurity of fishery and agricultural food stock, disasters, displacement of people, and threats to eco-systems. The 2010 APHDR on Climate Change seeks to bring a unique perspective to this debate by providing new and innovative Asia-Pacific thinking on some of the key ingredients of what a more sustainable pathway might be. By looking at a number of distinct groups of people across the region already being affected by climate change, but who also have high aspirations and are \u201eon the move\u201f socio- economically, the APHDR will seek to identify policy levers that can be used to begin to encourage a broad scale shift in mindset \u2013 towards a new development paradigm for Asia- Pacific. 3. OBJECTIVES OF THE CONSULTATIONS The Pacific consultations will take place in Suva, Fiji on October 16th and Majuro, Republic of Marshall Islands on October 22nd. The Suva consultation will primarily focus on regional and sub-regional civil society, academia and media institutions based in Suva. The Majuro consultation will primarily consult with Pacific governments and intergovernmental organizations in attendance for the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) Climate Change Roundtable meeting. Given the resource and time constraints involved in physical consultations, current and additional stakeholders from all Pacific Island Countries will be encouraged to continue to provide inputs through the Asia-Pacific Human Development Network (AP-HDNet): http://www2.undprcc.lk/ext/HDRU/index.php). The AP- HDNet (Asia-Pacific Human Development Network) will be hosting an extensive online discussion on the sub-themes and issues which the Report will speak to, as the research develops. The Pacific stakeholder consultations aim to: \uf0b7 Introduce stakeholders to the Asia-Pacific HDRs and the proposed approach for the theme of \u201eclimate change\u201f for this Report, namely the focus on vulnerable groups and 3 For more in-depth information on Pacific Climate Change issues, kindly refer to the UNDP Pacific Centre note \u201cOverview of Preliminary Inputs from UNDP Offices and Development Partners in the Pacific for the APHDR on Climate Change.\u201d 27 communities while extrapolating national and regional policy implications from their analysis \uf0b7 Share an overall view of climate change trends and issues in the Pacific and across its different subregions / countries, with particular attention to vulnerable groups and communities \uf0b7 Discuss a \u201ePacific perspective\u201f for understanding climate change, its causes and consequences, along with methods to examine and measure climate change from a human development perspective \uf0b7 Take account of stakeholder priorities in identify and sharpening sub themes that are cognizant of the concerns in the Pacific \uf0b7 Provide a platform for stakeholders to share experiences, highlight priorities and solutions that affect people\u201fs lives \uf0b7 Support capacity development by working with stakeholders to apply the human development lens to climate change issues and solutions \uf0b7 Tap into Pacific thinking in addressing possible politically controversial aspects of the work (e.g. carbon emission limits, intellectual property rights for technology, relocation options, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries or REDD, etc.) \uf0b7 Discuss ways in which climate change is presently bring measured and to discuss alternative proxy measures that focus more sharply on the lives or ordinary people \uf0b7 Promote buy-in for the RHDR and thus strengthen its policy advocacy potential 4.

The objectives of the stakeholder consultations were two- fold: to be informed by views, experiences and priorities of countries in the region, while strengthening cross-country networks, and to obtain buy-in for the RHDR from stakeholders. 56 participants from different type of organizations participated for the consultation. Figure 1 shows the participation of different organization in the consultation. 43 Figure 1: Type of organizations (percent) participated for the consultation Academia, 5.4% UN, 30.4% INGO/NGO/CSO, 14.3% Government , 32.1% Media , 3.6% In order to assess whether the participants were satisfied in the consultation and in order to get their suggestions to improve the consultations for future, HDRU circulated a simple questionnaire to all the participants in the consultation. The feedback obtained from these participants are summarized below. Pacific Stakeholder Consultation \uf0b7 27 participants have submitted the feedback form back.

Area Network XML Extensible Markup Language The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development vi Breaking Barriers vii A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World Foreword Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is now firmly established as an alternative to commercial, proprietary software in many areas of software utilization. The fundamental freedom of being able to use, distribute, modify and redistribute the modifications made to a software released as FOSS, as well as the availability of FOSS without licensing fees and with source code, has been responsible for its widespread acceptance and adoption. The FOSS community-driven model of software development and maintenance has been recognized even by established proprietary software companies as having its own merit and advantages. The benefits offered by FOSS have been particularly useful for poor developing countries around the world. In particular, the ability to obtain FOSS without licensing fees has proven to be very beneficial to the users in these regions as this makes information and communications technology (ICT) more affordable to them. The localization of software applications is also facilitated on a FOSS platform and this will further help towards bridging the digital divide. Over the last few years, as FOSS has matured and become more widely accepted, many projects or initiatives have been carried out that attempt to make use of FOSS to help bring about economic development and empower the people in developing countries or regions. Some of these projects are highlighted in this compilation of FOSS case studies. These case studies can be an inspiration to the organizations and people involved in helping poor communities embrace ICT as they demonstrate that FOSS can play an important part in empowering a community to bring it into the information and Internet age. At the end of this book, the reader will find a DVD containing a 40-minute version of a documentary on FOSS, entitled The Codebreakers. This was aired as a BBC World TV documentary in May 2006 and it contains footage of a number of the projects described in this book. This compilation of FOSS case studies is a joint initiative of UNDP Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme (UNDP-APDIP), the International Open Source Network, the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). We hope that you find these case studies useful and beneficial in your day-to-day work. Shahid Akhtar Laurent Elder Abdul Waheed Khan Programme Coordinator Team Leader Assistant Director-General for UNDP-APDIP PAN Asia Communication and Information IDRC UNESCO The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development viii Breaking Barriers ix A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World Preface This compilation of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) case studies is a selection of the submissions received as a result of an invitation by the UNDP Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme (UNDP-APDIP) and its International Open Source Network (IOSN) to capture, document and promote FOSS initiatives from around the world. These initiatives were asked to submit case studies of their projects for consideration as \u201csuccess stories\u201d and 14 have been selected for inclusion in this book. Each case study highlighted here provides a summary of the project; background of the organization; project\u2019s objectives; FOSS applications developed and/or deployed, and their impact; lessons learned; current status of the project; and benefits and challenges in using FOSS; as well as contact information and references. FOSS has a key role to play in building information and communications technology capacity and bridging the digital divide, especially in poor communities. This has been amply borne out by most of the case studies featured here. The availability of free-of-charge FOSS applications and the ability to localize it by any interested party are important reasons for FOSS being generally preferred in these environments, even though FOSS desktop applications are relatively less mature than their proprietary equivalents. However, this is rapidly changing and as more and more high- quality FOSS applications become available for mainstream desktop usage, the situation will improve further. With the publication of this compilation, it is hoped that there will be greater awareness of the ability of FOSS to empower and help poorer and less developed communities, especially in developing countries. The experiences gained from these projects should also be useful for new FOSS initiatives in this area.

The availability of FOSS without licence fees and its inherent characteristic of being open to modification and adaptation make it an attractive proposition to poorer communities. As a result, many projects that make use of FOSS to empower and help the people have been initiated all over the world especially in poor and developing regions. This book contains a compilation of the case studies of several of these projects that have been considered as successful. The main focus of most of the projects chosen is not on the actual development of a particular FOSS application per se but in using FOSS applications (these may be new, enhanced or existing ones), as a means to fulfil the primary objectives of the project.

This is a clear indication that FOSS is being taken up worldwide, particularly in the developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. The projects cover a wide range of domains ranging from specialized applications to web portals and services for e-government to full-fledged projects on the development of FOSS packages. They are initiated mainly by local organizations and, in some cases, funding is provided by international aid and development agencies. What is Free and Open Source Software? FOSS refers to software that is distributed under a license that is recognized either as free softwarei by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) or Open Source Software (OSS)ii by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). OSS has its roots in free software. Since the early days of the computer, software has been freely exchanged along with source code by researchers and academics. These users also freely modify the source code and pass along the modified software for others to use. This model of sharing and developing the software inspired the free software movement. FSF defines free softwareiii as software distributed under a license that possesses four fundamental characteristics \u2013 freedom to run the software, freedom to study and adapt the software, freedom to redistribute the software, and freedom to improve it and release the improvements for others to use. It is important to note that the term free software refers to the freedom associated with it and not the price. However, as the source code has to be freely available for use and redistribution, free software usually can be obtained at no or very little cost. The technologies that gave rise to the Internet were created largely by the free software movement. Even with this success, business and corporate users did not trust free software as they had become accustomed to paying for commercial, proprietary software. In addition to this, as the FSF viewed proprietary software as restricting the rights of users and took on an uncompromising stand towards it, many corporations regarded FSF as anti-business and this strengthened their scepticism regarding free software. To overcome these issues and to maintain a more pragmatic and friendly approach towards business users, several free software advocates got together and came up with an alternative definition and name - OSS. The Open Source definition is similar to free software in many respects and it also embraces the four fundamental freedoms. Many of the major Open Source licenses are accepted as free software licenses as well by FSF.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af42b191-f41b-4c10-b220-7a758be55925": {"__data__": {"id_": "af42b191-f41b-4c10-b220-7a758be55925", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Breaking Barriers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4108279c5e7cf3945044adadeb57e5667b9d74139085544157f5fa217f59dfc3"}, "3": {"node_id": "bbcea7dc-706e-4f3f-ad7e-6873532cbd70", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff97426e1afe68bb3e6fcd17b7744e312abbde990bc0eaadca893ea74f1285cf"}}, "hash": "e4a56bb11e6d3dab367e1274492fc72d9267eb55a04e2289a928b1d983c72370", "text": "While there are philosophical differences between the two movements, in everyday usage, the two terms are usually used interchangeably by many people. i.

Free Software Foundation, \u201cThe Free Software Definition\u201d http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html 5 Breaking Barriers A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World Reasons for Using FOSS Affordable and High Quality All projects discussed in this publication state that one of the main reasons for choosing FOSS over proprietary software is that there is no need to pay any licensing fees for FOSS. This is hardly surprising as these projects are all from the non-profit sector and are based in poor countries or regions. This factor becomes critical for projects like eGov Balkan, Extremadura, and Paran\u00e1 in which very many desktop personal computers (PCs) have to be deployed. However, this does not mean that the quality and functionality of the software developed and/or used have been compromised. In all cases, since these projects are generally successful, it is not unreasonable to assume that the FOSS used or developed is satisfactory in terms of quality and functionality. In specific cases, the FOSS application certainly is on par or even exceeds the quality and functionality of the equivalent commercial proprietary application. Examples of these are Action Applications (ActionApps \u2013 the content management system (CMS) used in Colnodo), KEWL.NextGen e-learning platform (used in AVOIR), the Sahana Disaster Management System and Tikiwiki GeoCMS. In addition to these FOSS-specialized applications, most projects also make use of well-known and proven mainstream FOSS such as Apache, GNOME and KDE desktop systems, GNU/Linux, the Mozilla suite of Internet applications, MySQL, OpenOffice.org, PHP and Perl. Free as in Freedom FOSS guarantees four fundamental freedoms: to run, study, redistribute and improve the software. All projects reviewed here cite one or more of these four freedoms as the main or an important reason for choosing to use FOSS. The ability to use and freely copy any software used is important to communities that are poor and can ill-afford, in most cases, to spend scarce financial resources on a seemingly luxury item like software. The freedom to access source code and study it is important for capacity building and helps to improve the ICT skills of the local people. The possibility of being able to improve on a piece of software freely and redistribute the improved version enables developing communities to learn and improve on the work done by others. This contributes significantly towards capacity building in the local population, helping them to understand and deploy new technologies successfully. The Sahana software is a good example of how important the freedom associated with FOSS is to the project. To be effective and practically useful, it is imperative that a disaster management software can be freely used and distributed without any condition. Additionally, it should be customizable easily by the local people to reflect the local environment under which it is operating. The freedom in FOSS facilitates localization of FOSS to cultures and languages that are not well known. The majority of people in developing economies do not understand English while most proprietary software is available in English only. To be able to tackle the digital divide, it is vital to be able to translate and localize software to meet the cultural and linguistic needs of the target community. FOSS facilitates this process as long as there are some people willing to take up the task. They have the freedom to do this without going through the sometimes time-consuming The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 6 task of obtaining permission from the owners of the software. As much of this localization is voluntary work, interested parties can proceed with the localization without being concerned with business issues such as the commercial potential of the intended market in relation to the size of the investment. This ability to localize is critical to projects like Extremadura, OSCAR, Sahana and Translate.org.za and, indeed, all projects concerned with getting non-English speaking communities to use computers.

Using FOSS may also stimulate the growth of a local software development industry as software professionals are needed to create, customize and enhance the source code. This will bring along business and education opportunities and contribute towards the economic development of the region. The AVOIR project attempts to do this for the continent of Africa through a collaborative effort among several African higher education institutions. In this project an improved version of an existing FOSS application has been built with participation by developers from African universities and other organizations. FOSS Software Development Model Most FOSS embraces a community-style software development model which is based on collaborative development of the software amongst interested parties, usually over the Internet. While there is usually a core group of developers who oversee and steer the software development effort, anyone who has an interest and the necessary skills can contribute towards the software. This opportunity, along with the source code availability and freedoms guaranteed by FOSS licenses, encourages the sharing of FOSS and associated technologies amongst less developed and/or poor communities, and lowers the entry barrier for participation in ICT development. Scope of Projects by Type While all projects reviewed here aim to empower the target group or community through FOSS or FOSS-based solutions to help them perform their work better and/or improve their economic status or living conditions, they can be classified into the following categories based on their primary objectives. 7 Breaking Barriers A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World ICT Awareness and Bridging the Digital Divide All projects, directly or indirectly, use FOSS to bring about ICT awareness and education to their target audiences and help bridge the digital divide. Many, such as AgriBazaar, BlankOn Linux, Colnodo, eGov Balkan, Extremadura, Meraka, OSCAR, Tikiwiki GeoCMS and Translate.org.za, involve economically-disadvantaged communities where illegal copying of software is rampant. It makes sense to encourage these communities to use FOSS instead of proprietary software as it is more affordable and will benefit the local economy since local entrepreneurs can support the FOSS applications being used. Additionally, the fundamental philosophy of FOSS \u2013 of sharing the software freely \u2013 fits in well with the community spirit of the rural users, and its usage will reduce the illegal distribution of commercial proprietary software in these regions. Most users addressed by these projects are not English-literate and therefore, it is easier for them to operate computers if the software supports their own language or dialect and uses elements from their culture in the user interface. The localization of proprietary software in these places is rare as users are totally dependent on software-owning companies that often do not see enough financial returns to justify investment in localization efforts. FOSS is better placed when it comes to the localization of software. It is a natural choice in projects where the ability to easily localize and/or make modifications is required such as AgriBazaar, BlankOn Linux, Extremadura, OSCAR and Translate.org.za. FOSS Advocacy and Capacity Building All the projects featured here engage the target communities in one way or another in the advocacy of FOSS and in building ICT skills and capacity. However, projects such as AVOIR, BlankOn Linux, Extremadura and Meraka explicitly cite FOSS advocacy and/or capacity building as their stated objective. AVOIR is an initiative that is concerned with the creation of a FOSS-based sustainable software ecosystem. With this, it hopes to be able to build ICT capacity and develop business opportunities for economic development in Africa. The BlankOn Linux project has built a distribution of GNU/Linux with support for the Indonesian national language, Bahasa Indonesia, so as to enable the people of Indonesia, most of whom are not English-literate, to be exposed to FOSS and GNU/Linux. It advocates using FOSS in Indonesia to build ICT capacity and help bridge the digital divide there. The Extremadura project is carrying out a series of programmes to introduce ICT to the people of the Extremadura region of Spain and inculcate ICT usage in educational, social and economical activities, using FOSS as the vehicle of deployment. The Meraka project is directly involved with ongoing initiatives to promote FOSS in South Africa. FOSS is seen as a public resource that can be harnessed to contribute to economic development and improve the quality of life of the people.

There is a trend to address this and projects such as Colnodo, eGov Balkan and JuriBurkina attempt to bring about better government-citizen interaction and communication. Colnodo is involved in the \u201cInternet for Accountability\u201d initiative in Colombia by developing and supporting information systems that will allow municipalities to publish information for their communities online. This will enhance transparency in each municipality and introduce accountability practices into the management of municipal offices. The e-government initiatives in the Balkan states have resulted in the initiation of various e-government services for better and easier access to the authorities in local municipalities. Consequently, there will be greater transparency and encouragement for people to increase their participation in local affairs, thereby strengthening the democratic process in the region. By making legal information freely available to law practitioners in Burkina Faso, JuriBurkina is expected to have a wide range of positive effects such as strengthening democracy and the rule of law, helping to consolidate the national legal system, helping local people develop skills and expertise in FOSS development and fostering economic development by helping to establish a consistent legal system. JuriBurkina will improve the efficiency of the Burkina Faso legal system by making legal research much faster and more effective, and by giving law students easy access to critical legal resources. Assisting Specific Communities FOSS is widely recognized now as a very useful, enabling vehicle for less privileged economies and communities as it allows governments and activists to deploy solutions that are both affordable and appropriate for the target groups. The Paran\u00e1 project, apart from enabling public school teachers in the state of Paran\u00e1, Brazil, to collaborate and develop course content, also aims to contribute towards increasing the Portuguese content on the Internet. The OSCAR project targets the farming community of the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) by deploying the application software for weed identification and control, in rice and wheat crop systems, on computing devices running GNU/Linux. This will make the equipment affordable and practical in the targeted region. Another project that targets rural farmers is AgriBazaar from Malaysia, which helps farmers to conduct daily trading of their agricultural produce. Colnodo is a non-profit Internet Service Provider (ISP) that mainly services non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other non-profit organizations. It targets organizations that make strategic use of the Internet for development, empowering local communities and promoting the peace process. 9 Breaking Barriers A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World The JuriBurkina website makes the jurisprudence and legislation of Burkina Faso freely available over the Internet and, thus, is of value to the legal community both in Burkina Faso as well outside the country. This deployment represents the initial effort in the creation of a regional legal information network. JuriBurkina was developed using FOSS technologies that can be re-used in other West African countries to create similar online legal repositories at a low cost, leading ultimately to free online access to legal information throughout the region. Solving Specific Problems There are projects that attempt to use FOSS to solve specific problems. One of the most well- publicized FOSS applications that has been developed recently is the Sahana Disaster Management System. This project was started in 2004, in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami disaster, to help track families and coordinate work among relief organizations. FOSS offers key benefits in situations and environments related to a disaster, as it can be readily distributed, localized and customized according to the requirements of the region or community using it; and poor countries can also afford to use it. There is also the added advantage that FOSS does not require a lengthy procurement or purchasing process which makes it easier for government and civil society organizations to respond technically within a very short time frame. Sahana has been successfully deployed in several other countries besides its country of origin, Sri Lanka. The Gal\u00e1pagos project makes use of FOSS development tools to create five software applications to assist in the management of the environment of the Gal\u00e1pagos Archipelago. These applications, running on FOSS platforms connected over a wide area network (WAN) linking the main islands of the Archipelago, have increased the ability of the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park to collect data and manage information with regard to the activities of fisheries and tourism, manage land resources, and provide support for planning tasks and surveillance within the Archipelago. As part of the effort to address vulnerability reduction in the Pacific Island Countries, an integrated planning and management system is utilized.

As there was no suitable software available at the time the project started, a new application, Tikiwiki GeoCMS, was developed by utilizing two existing FOSS applications. The freedom to modify and redistribute the modified software granted by the FOSS licenses allowed the developers in this project to easily build on the two established software to create a new GeoCMS application. This will be very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve with proprietary software. The AgriBazaar web portal catering to the rural farmers in Malaysia acts as the gateway that connects the agriculture producers and buyers to a Supply Chain Management (SCM) system back-end application via the web browser. The SCM system, developed with FOSS tools, contains several modules to address specific problems peculiar to the local agriculture industry, which deals with perishable products. The OSCAR project has come up with a prototype FOSS application as the primary outcome. This application, with a weed identification system at its core, contains information on 50 of the most common weed species for the rice and wheat crop systems of the IGP.

Key Objectives of Projects by Type 11 Breaking Barriers A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World Some Common FOSS Applications used in the Projects GNU/Linux The GNU/Linux operating system consists of the Linux kerneliv itself and the rest of the system software and tools/utilities which, working together, make up the operating system. Most of the system software is from the GNU Project.v This operating system is commonly referred to as Linux. The GNU/Linux operating system is commonly distributed bundled together with other application software for use by end users and this is known as a Linux distribution or distro. Different Linux distros may have different applications bundled with them but they all have the same Linux kernel and core GNU utilities. Popular Linux distros include Debian, Red Hat, SuSe and Ubuntu. GNOME and KDEvi The two most popular FOSS desktop environments are GNOME and KDE. These are software that present a graphical desktop environment and interface to the user. Using the facilities offered by the desktop environment, the user can interact with the system and run applications. OpenOffice.orgvii OpenOffice.org is an office application suite consisting of a word processor, spreadsheet, presentation software, graphics editor and a database program. It is compatible with the popular Microsoft Office suite, being able to read and write Microsoft Office data file formats.

Initially in the AVOIR project, an existing e-learning platform application that was built using proprietary tools to run only on a proprietary operating system was converted to run on a FOSS platform. This new version of the software, called KEWL.NextGen, has been successfully deployed in several regions in Africa. The OSCAR project has developed a prototype application software for weed identification and control of the rice and wheat crop systems of the IGP. This software was developed to run on both desktop computers and Simputers.1 For the Sahana project, a disaster management system was originally developed to coordinate disaster relief work after the 2004 Asian tsunami disaster in Sri Lanka. This system has since been enhanced to be more flexible and adaptable so that it can be used for other types of disaster management as well. 1 The Simputer is a low cost portable alternative to PCs running on GNU/Linux. http://www.simputer.org MySQLx MySQL is a full-fledged relational database system and is widely used as the back-end database in web-based applications and services.

It is one of the first of its kind in the world and allows a country or region to easily publish its geographical data for access and sharing over the Internet. Enhancements to Mainstream FOSS Localized distributions of the GNU/Linux operating system - BlankOn Linux and gnuLinEx - have been created as a result of the BlankOn and Extremadura projects, respectively. The Translate.org.za project has localized several common desktop FOSS packages including OpenOffice.org, Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Thunderbird, KDE and GNOME into the official languages of South Africa. In addition it has developed several software translation tools to aid in the translation and localization of FOSS. Portals and Web Applications AgriBazaar is a web portal for agricultural trading with an SCM system back-end application. The project also involves the supply of front-end software and hardware infrastructure to enable farmers to access AgriBazaar to trade their agriculture produce and access market information, including the latest prices in different markets. Colnodo offers a wide range of Internet services such as messaging services, discussion forums, online databases, web hosting, audio/video broadcast and search engines to over 500 organizations (mainly NGOs) in Colombia. The FOSS CMS and collaborative web publishing tool, ActionApps, is used to enable the organizations served by Colnodo to easily manage the content of their websites as well as to exchange information with other sites without requiring internal technical expertise. The eGov Balkan initiative involves the development and deployment of e-government web portal services and applications to provide effective interactive communications between local governments and citizens in the south-eastern part of Europe (the Balkans). The JuriBurkina website is the first online legal information centre in West Africa. Specialized FOSS process automation tools for the portal\u2019s publishing operations are also in use. The Paran\u00e1 web portal enables the public school teachers in the state of Paran\u00e1, Brazil, to collaborate and develop course contents in various subject areas, as well as other teaching resources. Major Challenges One challenge that almost all of the projects faced is the resistance to change amongst people who had already been exposed to ICT and computers through proprietary software, e.g. ICT professionals, technical support staff, office workers, etc. The deployment of FOSS may require some amount of retraining to make users productive since it may not work in the same manner as proprietary software. The workers\u2019 unwillingness to substitute proprietary applications with FOSS could jeopardize the success of the project. Therefore, this change needs to be managed The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 14 properly. In addition, there are financial and time costs associated with the training/ retraining process which have to be taken into consideration.

A familiarization period may be required before the developers can become productive and efficient. The culture of FOSS relies heavily on community collaboration and involvement and, to be successful, a project that involves FOSS should at least identify, build this community and get the members to work together. The Tikiwiki GeoCMS project experienced difficulties in building the local FOSS community while the Paran\u00e1 project had to train its community of teachers in skills required for collaboration. For projects in the less developed regions, challenges in the physical deployment of ICT infrastructure, such as the availability of adequate Internet access, may have to be overcome and applications designed appropriately to reduce or avoid dependence on an advanced ICT infrastructure. Sustainability remains a huge challenge for some projects as they either rely on sponsorships, grants or donations, or are required to be self-sustaining after initial funding ends. For AgriBazaar and OSCAR, while the pilot deployments have been successful, sustainability is an issue as they try to scale up into the production phase. The BlankOn Linux project depends almost entirely on volunteer efforts and faces serious concerns in terms of the availability of resources to continue maintaining the BlankOn GNU/Linux distribution. Even the often-cited Sahana project constantly needs to ensure that it receives adequate funding to be able to continue supporting the core development team. Lessons Learned The success of the projects covered in this book shows that FOSS can be a viable alternative to proprietary software. In many cases reviewed here, e.g. Colnodo, eGov Balkan, Extremadura, Gal\u00e1pagos, Paran\u00e1, Sahana and Tikiwiki GeoCMS, project implementation would not have been viable had proprietary software been used because of cost implications. In addition to cost benefits, FOSS can provide opportunities for developing countries to contribute towards technology development rather than just remain mere users of technology produced by others. The four fundamental freedoms inherent in FOSS make it an ideal choice to bridge the digital divide and promote digital literacy to all people, irrespective of their geographical, economic or cultural situations. 15 Breaking Barriers A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World The Translate.org.za project has indicated that localization has become a social requirement and can no longer be considered an optional feature. With increased competition from good localized FOSS applications, proprietary vendors will seriously consider the localization of their software in order not to lose market share to FOSS. Many projects deal with communities that are not technology savvy, which slows down the adoption of new technology. Changes take time and non-technical/technology issues such as social and cultural problems may impede the adoption of the projects. It should be remembered that users are usually reluctant to try out and use new things and/or features if their benefits are not obvious or realized immediately. It is important to partner with a good local organization for projects that are not developed by local people. To provide sustainability, local institutions and businesses that are actively committed to the project are needed to collaborate with technology providers. It should be remembered that volunteerism can only get a project so far; to ensure that the project can go to completion, it has to be properly funded and the people working on it paid realistically. Similarly, donor funding can take projects only so far. For projects to turn into proper, ongoing programmes and services, their initial design must take sustainability into account as a key design factor. Projects that involve a rural agrarian population have to consider the prevalent basic issues in agricultural practices and infrastructural constraints. Acceptance by the target group and methods to integrate participation from local communities are essential for any ICT intervention at the grass-roots level to be successful. For the success of government-based initiatives and projects like e-governments, it is important that adequate policy and legislation be developed as lack of political support can slow down the processes and adoption rate. Conclusion FOSS has been used successfully to implement the projects featured in this book. All these projects are located in countries or regions that are economically disadvantaged and the very low or no cost of FOSS has been cited as the main reason for choosing FOSS. Many projects also cite the ability to make modifications freely in FOSS as a key reason for their choice. That FOSS can be used and distributed without paying license fees makes its use ideal for meeting the goal of bridging the digital divide, an objective of almost all projects. Related to this is the comprehensive support for localization available in many of the mainstream FOSS desktop packages and this facilitates their", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2d005c6-c2f3-4ee5-b2d9-3f80fdaac06d": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2d005c6-c2f3-4ee5-b2d9-3f80fdaac06d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Breaking Barriers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "281c8792d3ef8b23a2f9efb56a0896c063e59c62db314d38d018321967171840"}}, "hash": "281c8792d3ef8b23a2f9efb56a0896c063e59c62db314d38d018321967171840", "text": "use in cultures that are not English-literate. Empowerment of the people and capacity building are also two other objectives that are widely listed. Again, FOSS is seen as a key enabler for these objectives to be met. For projects that involve government initiatives to provide services and improve its interactions with citizens, FOSS is a natural choice as it is readily available for all citizens and it does not discriminate against anyone. The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 16 The case studies involve projects carried out in Africa, the Asia-Pacific, Europe and Latin America and this bears testimony to the global reach of FOSS. The success of these projects demonstrates that FOSS is able to provide an affordable alternative to poor communities without compromising quality and functionality.

The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 18 A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 19 Breaking Barriers Creating Educational and Business Opportunities AVOIR, South Africa Summary The African Virtual Open Initiatives and Resources (AVOIR) project, initiated by the University of the Western Cape (UWC), is a collaborative effort among several African higher education institutions. It attempts to create educational and business opportunities that contribute towards the development of Africa through FOSS development activities. It has taken an existing e-learning platform application, Knowledge Environment for Web- based Learning (KEWL) that was developed at UWC, and rebuilt it to run on a FOSS platform. The new version of the software, KEWL.NextGen, is based entirely on FOSS. It has an innovative modular architecture that is implemented using a model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern and offers great flexibility to adapt the framework for any purpose. It also has unique features such as the support of offline authoring of content, active mirroring, and instructional design capabilities. The FOSS collaborative development model utilized by the AVOIR project allows many institutions, organizations and individuals all over Africa to volunteer or contribute to the project. With the choice of using FOSS and its related technologies, the core AVOIR team has been able to benefit from FOSS and offer FOSS- related services to the local government, education and business sectors. All this has contributed towards capacity building and, as the project management is based at UWC, the project has resulted in a broad knowledge of FOSS being developed there as well. This has enabled UWC to successfully implement an enterprise architecture strategy in which FOSS technologies and solutions are preferred. The first phase of the KEWL.NextGen e-learning platform development has been largely completed successfully. As a result, alliances have been established between AVOIR and initiatives for other projects utilizing FOSS. Some desired shorter-term outcomes of the AVOIR project, such as the use of higher educational institutions to drive the production of innovative software and to provide advice, accessibility and enhanced local support for FOSS have been realized with the KEWL.NextGen project. However, it is still too early to determine whether the desired long- term outcome, in which FOSS is to contribute significantly towards sustainable growth and development within Africa, can be realized. Background of Organization The AVOIR project is a collaboration by several African higher education institutions to build a group of core FOSS developers in Africa who are able, through software development activities, to create educational and business opportunities that contribute to development on the continent. AVOIR is not primarily a software development project; it is a project about human development, capacity building and creating opportunities for people through the formation of transnational alliances both within and outside Africa. Core developers from African universities and other organizations participate in most software development activities, particularly the first software project from AVOIR, KEWL.NextGen. After the first working code had been released, other institutions and individuals have been encouraged to volunteer their contributions to the project in true FOSS community fashion. The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 20 The AVOIR project is governed by a board consisting of volunteers within partner institutions. Each formal partner institution receives a salary for one developer funded by AVOIR and there is a partially-funded project manager and funded researcher based at UWC. Participating institutions are encouraged to seek their own funding for extended participation, this being the only mechanism currently available to bring new partners into AVOIR. The project was initiated by UWC, and at present UWC employs 13 full-time developers, graphic artists, usability testers and a project manager.

AVOIR\u2019s partner network consists of 15 developers and development teams scattered throughout Africa, all of whom are actively involved in developing and contributing to the initiatives that AVOIR is involved in. Objectives of Project The main goal of the AVOIR project is to ascertain whether concepts of knowledge ecology can be used to build a sustainable and expanding system of free software creation that contributes to economic development in Africa. The knowledge ecology can be viewed as having three core components: people, processes and technology. These are seen against the background of the higher education and broader socio-political landscape in much the same way that energy, nutrients and trophic relationships interplay with the broader physical environment in natural ecosystems. Some of the desired outcomes of AVOIR are: G Higher education institutions in Africa to drive the production of new and innovative software for use in the higher education, education, business and government sectors; G The availability of better advice, accessibility and enhanced local support for FOSS in education, business and government; G An increase in the number of graduates trained in the application of FOSS principles and enhanced employment opportunities for graduates of higher education institutions; and G Enhanced relationships between higher education and business built around the development and support of FOSS. Apart from these medium-term outcomes, the long-term outcome aims at contributing towards sustainable growth and development within Africa. The target audience of AVOIR includes public higher education institutions and software developers in Africa, working in collaboration with one another and with software developers in other parts of the world. Side benefits of the tools being developed will also accrue to other educational institutions, including schools, private education and training organizations, and businesses. The African higher education institutions involved in the project are: UWC, University of Jos, Catholic University of Mozambique, University of Dar es Salaam, University of Nairobi, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Universite Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar, Makerere University, Uganda Martyrs University, National University of Rwanda, University of Ghana, and the University of Eduardo Mondlane. In addition, Nelson Mandela Metropole University, University of Namibia, Sokoine University (Tanzania), Polytechnic in Blantyre (Malawi) and Monash University (Johannesburg campus) have found their own means to participate. Outside of Africa, Washington State University, Colgate University and Kabul University are involved in various ways. A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 21 Breaking Barriers FOSS Application Description The first FOSS application that is being developed under AVOIR is KEWL.NextGen. This is a part of the original KEWL learning management system that was developed to run on the proprietary Microsoft Windows platform. KEWL.NextGen is based on a PHP2 framework called KINKY (a recursive acronym for KINKY Is Not KEWL Yet). KINKY is implemented using an MVC design pattern, with a front controller web implementation, and has a fully modular architecture. Where possible, it uses PHP PEAR3 heavily, including the database abstraction. Apart from a web platform, the application also has offline authoring and active dynamic mirroring (ADM) capabilities to allow improved wide-area collaboration activities. Choice of FOSS AVOIR is aimed at capacity building and the creation of opportunities for the people of Africa through ICT. The idea is to build a sustainable software ecosystem that contributes to economic development in Africa. FOSS is used as the enabler for this to take place. As a first project, an existing application \u2013 KEWL \u2013 is implemented in the FOSS scripting language, PHP, and this is used as the basis for building an improved next-generation FOSS learning management system \u2013 KEWL.NextGen. A FOSS collaborative development model allows many institutions, organizations as well as individuals to volunteer or contribute to the project. Using FOSS and the FOSS development model and environment, AVOIR is able to bring together cutting edge educational research and state-of-the-art computer science to produce an advanced application development framework and a learning management system based on it. With this project, the core AVOIR team has been able to offer services on e-learning as well as the development and use of FOSS to the government, education and business sectors.

The view part of the MVC architecture is implemented using templates. Currently, only PHP templates are used, although a template engine can easily be incorporated into the architecture if it becomes necessary. By using this architecture, a modular system is implemented, making it easy to add new modules on an ongoing basis without needing to alter any code other than that of the module being implemented. In addition, most of the key terminology used to describe functionality is abstracted. This has enabled the developers to use the framework to build applications as diverse as group collaborations, CMSs, portal applications, clinical tracking, hospital pharmacy management, labour relations management and others by enabling specialized and unspecialized modules to be mixed in ways that would not be possible without abstraction. 2 PHP is a widely-used general purpose computer language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded as part of the hypertext markup language (HTML) present in web pages. http://www.php.net 3 The PHP Extension and Application Repository (PEAR) \u2013 a framework and distribution system for reusable PHP components. http://pear.php.net The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 22 KEWL.NextGen makes use of the following FOSS software: Apache web server, MySQL database, PHP with the PEAR Library and a number of PHP extensions. While the AVOIR project recommends implementing KEWL.NextGen on the GNU/Linux operating system, it is also possible to use it on Microsoft Windows (2000, XP, 2003) and Sun Solaris platforms. A guide for planning implementation is available. For the lowest and least costly implementation, the guidelines provide for implementation using a single entry-level server capable of supporting a few hundred simultaneous users. In such a case, the database and web server are on the same machine. With a dual processor server, and a large amount of RAM,4 such a system can support a few thousand users, but has no redundancy. At the other end of the scale, KEWL.NextGen and other KINKY-based applications can scale up to support even millions of users through load balancing, clustering and other techniques. KEWL.NextGen and all KINKY applications can implement an innovative technique known as ADM. ADM allows a set of KEWL.NextGen servers to actively mirror all data and file system objects among one another within a realistic time frame according to the limitations of available bandwidth. Servers among which such objects are mirrored are participants in an ADM virtual cluster and are known to one another. If the state of data or file system objects change on any server in the system, the changes are propagated to all other servers in the ADM virtual cluster. This means that learning content, interactive discussions, uploaded assignments, etc., are accessible across servers in the ADM virtual cluster. This should happen even in bandwidth-constrained environments to the extent possible. Advanced data compression techniques will play a role in facilitating this process. Deployment KEWL.NextGen has been deployed in each of the partner institution, and many of them have established or are establishing e-learning support teams to support academics wishing to use the system. In partnership with the NetTel@Africa5 project, the system is being used to deliver e-learning for the Master\u2019s Degree programme on ICT Policy and Regulation that is offered collaboratively by 21 universities. Outside Africa, the system is also in use at Kabul University in Afghanistan. Various other implementations are in early stages of development. Deployments of KEWL.NextGen in projects centred at UWC include: \u25cf Alumni Portal (keeping track of Alumni and their activities); \u25cf Brawaamsisswam Community Outreach (mentoring system for high school children); \u25cf Electronic Theses and Dissertations; \u25cf kPostgraduate (post-graduate mentoring system); \u25cf Student Enrolment Management System; \u25cf Clinical tracking of nurses; \u25cf HIV/AIDS training for teachers; \u25cf kGroups group-based collaboration; \u25cf Thetha Community Bulletin Board; and \u25cf UWC Portal.

KEWL.NextGen has been fully institutionalized at UWC. This included the creation of an e-learning strategy and an e-learning support unit with appropriate support procedures and training. The staff at UWC has begun to use KEWL.NextGen and the older version of KEWL will be phased out soon. UWC is currently implementing a Free Content and Free Open Courseware strategy, which will require all courses to have a representation on KEWL.NextGen, and that content be made available with a preference for a Creative Commons6 Attribution- ShareAlike license. However, it must be noted that while import of all MIT Open Courseware7 into KEWL.NextGen is now possible, actual deployment is hindered by its restrictive license. Other, less restrictive alternatives to MIT OpenCourseware, for example the Rice University Connections project, are being explored. The impact on partner institutions is only just beginning to be explored, but for many, KEWL.NextGen and other KINKY applications have already become part of their institutional strategy. For some, business opportunities are being created from the software. Lessons Learned Some key lessons that have evolved are worth reporting: \u25cf Nodes should grow through their own processes (for example, by creating opportunities for student projects); \u25cf Nodes should be able to replicate (for example, by providing training and support to institutions wishing to establish new nodes); \u25cf Agility must win over politics; \u25cf The project must be inclusive not exclusive; and \u25cf The ecosystem as a whole should work towards sustainability beyond research funding. Current Status of Project The first phase of the KEWL.NextGen e-learning platform development has been completed and the software is currently in version 1.3. Apart from this, the following applications have been released as part of the AVOIR project: \u25cf kGroups \u2013 a system for online, group-based collaboration; \u25cf kForums \u2013 a system to run the community board at UWC; and \u25cf kPortal \u2013 a system to run the UWC main portal.

Several other applications are also in the release stream for 2006, including version 2 of the KINKY framework with full support for services implementation. Two developer workshops have been conducted, and developers in each partner institution are now fully trained in all aspects of the methodology of the project. Several conference presentations have been made and peer-reviewed conference papers have been published. Alliances have been established between AVOIR and a number of other projects and initiatives, including the NetTel@Africa programme, Kabul University and the Afghan E-Quality Alliance, Philippines E-Quality Alliance, New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD), and the Department of Science and Technology in South Africa. Benefits and Challenges A major problem in African and other developing countries is one of access to expensive licensed propriety software. AVOIR encourages the use of FOSS and, under it, projects like the KINKY framework and KEWL.NextGen, make the software and content freely available and accessible to anyone with access to a computer. Having access to the source code and given the modular nature and database abstraction, the framework and its applications move beyond a learning management system and can be applied to other areas such as business and government. The modularity of KEWL.NextGen and its underlying KINKY architecture makes it flexible and relatively easy to incorporate new features and functionalities. The general benefits that the AVOIR KEWL.NextGen project has brought to its participants are capacity building and expertise in FOSS development work. Being based at UWC, the project has resulted in a broad knowledge of FOSS being developed at UWC. This has enabled the institution to embark on an enterprise architecture strategy that stipulates that any new technology at UWC must be implemented using FOSS unless it can be proven that it cannot be implemented that way.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40ed695d-1561-4331-95d9-7eb949fb844e": {"__data__": {"id_": "40ed695d-1561-4331-95d9-7eb949fb844e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Breaking Barriers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2246598c9b4e3204fa623802c835db75479d05b3a51b82a272a4b287240eb31f"}, "2": {"node_id": "06fd047f-c1cf-4fab-8a3f-3c80186a79fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d1e15a57d6530ae40270a9d8e0556642d46e0c683033d345fd7ad156ffec7cf8"}}, "hash": "da3643e40f5bb0d4545c3eb4ca66d55e2eb65f8afa9a11e5e21773ef8c22089f", "text": "This strategy has resulted in savings for the institution where FOSS solutions are used over proprietary ones, and more importantly, it has allowed the institution to integrate systems to a level not possible with proprietary software and within its budget.

It is too early in the project to have made much progress in this matter, particularly in those institutions that are still new to the collaborative development of FOSS. However, at UWC, several options for sustainability are being explored and these can serve as models for other AVOIR partners. In addition, the business world is exploring how to create business opportunities for the work done at UWC and is beginning to establish partnerships with UWC in a number of countries in Africa. Conclusion The AVOIR project has successfully completed the first phase of the KEWL.NextGen e-learning platform by migrating an earlier implementation of KEWL to FOSS. As a result of this success, alliances have been established between AVOIR and initiatives for other projects utilizing FOSS. All of this will go towards helping achieve the objective of the AVOIR project: using the knowledge ecology, comprising people, processes and technology, to build a sustainable and expanding system of FOSS creation that contributes to economic development in Africa.

This project involves the support, collaboration and partnership of the Burkina Faso Bar Association, the General Secretariat of the Government of Burkina Faso and the ICT company ZCP Informatique. JuriBurkina is the first Internet- based legal information centre in West Africa. A FOSS operating system, a web server and database software are deployed for the infrastructure set-up. Specialized FOSS process automation tools for JuriBurkina\u2019s day-to-day publishing operations are provided by LexUM; these include LexEDO, a legal publishing platform; Polyglotte, an automated document converter; and NOME, an anonymization tool for court decisions. FOSS was chosen for development and deployment as costs had to be kept affordable and source code availability was needed to ensure that local ICT experts could take over and fully maintain and support the system once it became operational. The deployment of JuriBurkina gives the local people easy and ready access to legal documents as well as the technology and tools for legal publishing. This will, in turn, promote greater transparency of the local judicial system and lead to better governance in the public institutions of Burkina Faso. JuriBurkina has been fully operational since 2004 and is managed, operated and supported by the local Bar Association. This deployment represents the initial effort in the creation of a regional legal information network comprising Burkina Faso and two other countries, Niger and Senegal. Background of Organization LexUM is the University of Montr\u00e9al\u2019s justice system technologies laboratory. The team consists of over 20 legal and computer science professionals who are assisted by as many university students.

The main outcome of this project is the availability of a free and open Internet website housing the jurisprudence and legislation of the country. The primary groups in Burkina Faso targeted by this project are the legal profession, the judiciary, local authorities, academics and the public. Other groups like businesses and organizations abroad interested in understanding the legal system of Burkina Faso will also find JuriBurkina useful. Support and assistance from the government, the judiciary, the legal profession and the private sector of Burkina Faso have made JuriBurkina possible. Key partners involved in this project are LexUM, the Burkina Faso Bar Association, the General Secretariat of the Government of Burkina Faso and the local ICT company ZCP Informatique. FOSS Application Description FOSS is deployed for the infrastructure as well as for publishing activities. The software used for the infrastructure include Red Hat Linux Enterprise Server for the server operating environment, and Apache web server and PostgreSQL for the database. Specialized process automation tools for JuriBurkina\u2019s day-to-day publishing operations to increase their efficiency were provided by LexUM. These include: \u25cf LexEDO \u2013 a web legal publishing platform designed to create and support websites for the dissemination of legal documents; \u25cf Polyglotte \u2013 a client-server document conversion system based around common word processors, meant to be used by people who have large distributed document repositories and need to be able to convert those documents to HTML8 and PDF;9 and \u25cf NOME \u2013 a software application that assists editors in the anonymization process of court decisions, which consists of removing personal data from documents in order to protect privacy. Choice of FOSS Burkina Faso does not have an advanced telecommunications and ICT infrastructure. 8 The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is an international open standard used to specify the structure and presentation of the content of a web page. 9 The Portable Document Format (PDF) file format is developed by Adobe Systems Inc. and is widely used for the display and exchange of documents containing text and images. The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 28 Therefore, a fairly lightweight software implementation was sought. Towards this end, a FOSS solution was found to be ideal as FOSS Internet and web solutions do not require extensive hardware and Internet resources. In addition, with FOSS, development and ongoing operations costs could be kept affordable. The availability of the source code for legal publishing and management tools from LexUM meant that the local ICT professionals could learn to operate and adapt the entire system. This allowed local experts to take over, fully maintain and support the system once it became operational. A FOSS solution also allows easy customization, better security, avoidance of lock-ins and ease of use. Development and Implementation LexUM provided the technology and software, as well as its expertise in legal publishing and guided local partners accordingly during the implementation. The JuriBurkina website makes use of LexEDO as its content management platform which allows for distant content management through secure web interfaces. With this, a decentralized team of editors may remotely add, remove or modify content according to their respective access rights. LexEDO combines centrally-hosted documents and decentralized processes. The platform also uses syndication mechanisms based on RDF10 technologies to synchronize relevant data and documents between the websites of distant partners. LexEDO supports internationalization for its database and interface. This is achieved by separating the computer code from displayed information, which allows for the rapid addition of any language version. On the website, documents are published in HTML and PDF file formats, and are accessible by alphabetical and chronological order. A search engine allowing for fast and efficient information retrieval is also provided.

There are basically two types of users who need access to the system, the editors in charge of the creation and operation of the online legal information resource and public users who need to access information. Editors access the system through a secure web interface and are entitled to full control over the resource configuration and content. Public users access the resulting legal information resource openly and freely on the web. JuriBurkina is deployed externally and independently of LexUM. It is fully supported by its recipients \u2013 local judicial institutions, the Burkina Faso Bar Association and ZCP Informatique. This deployment represents the initial effort in the creation of a multinational legal information resource grouping comprising Burkina Faso, Niger and Senegal. Similar systems are in the process to be deployed for these other countries. Impact Until recently, legal publishing was a field of activity dominated almost entirely by 10 The Resource Description Framework (RDF) integrates a variety of applications from library catalogues and worldwide directories to syndication and aggregation of news, software, and content to personal collections of music, photos, and events using the eXtended Markup Language (XML) as an interchange syntax. A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 29 Breaking Barriers commercial concerns. In many economically- advanced countries, and increasingly more so in developing ones, legal texts are only available for a fee. Consequently, not all interested groups can have easy access to these legal documents. The technology and tools for legal publishing are also not readily available. The deployment of JuriBurkina changed all this. The local people have been trained to use and maintain legal publishing and management tools from LexUM and the local legal community now has access to free and open publications of jurisprudence and legislation. All this will, in turn, promote greater transparency of the local judicial system, leading to better governance in the public institutions of Burkina Faso. JuriBurkina is the first electronic legal information centre in West Africa and the project has, to a certain point, enhanced the visibility of the country at the international level. Lessons Learned It is important to team up with the best local partners in a project that involves deployment in a foreign environment. To provide sustainability, local institutions and businesses that are committed to the project need to actively collaborate with the technology providers. Current Status of Project The project has been fully operational since 2004 and is managed, operated and supported by the local Bar Association. Due to the success of this project, an international legal information network is being set up together with two other countries, Niger and Senegal. Benefits and Challenges The JuriBurkina project benefits the local legal community and people by making the jurisprudence and legislation of Burkina Faso freely available and accessible, thereby facilitating access to judicial decisions. This will help ensure greater transparency of the judicial system and promote better governance in the government and public institutions of Burkina Faso. The use of FOSS has benefited the project due to its low cost, availability, collaborative development environment, stability and the freedom to learn from, modify and distribute the software used. From the LexUM standpoint, the biggest challenge of JuriBurkina was to set up a self- sustaining legal publishing project outside of Canada, beyond the control of its technical team, and to transfer the required know-how and technology in a way that permits completely autonomous publication by the local recipients. This has been done successfully. The project also found that some local ICT professionals were better equipped and had been trained to use proprietary software. This challenge had to be overcome as FOSS is used extensively throughout the project. Conclusion The JuriBurkina project has allowed Burkina Faso to put its jurisprudence and legislation online and improve access to legal information for the benefit of the legal profession and the public at large by making information freely available on the Internet. The use of FOSS to develop and implement this website is important as the local people have benefited from the affordability and availability of source code made possible by FOSS.

Towards this end, it has embarked on a series of projects and activities to advocate FOSS, facilitate project work on various FOSS initiatives and help empower users and producers of FOSS with access to courseware and certification. Some projects and activities of OSC have attracted national and worldwide attention. The \u201cGo-Open Source\u201d campaign of OSC that has been successfully completed was spread over two years and it involved creating awareness about FOSS by making use of the electronic and Internet media. This campaign had several novel projects under it, notably the popular Go Open TV series, a world-first for FOSS, and the Geek Freedom League Project that signed up volunteers and provided them with materials to help them introduce FOSS to friends and colleagues. OSC is responsible for the development and maintenance of the government website that houses the documents and other resources pertaining to the South African Government\u2019s FOSS strategy and policy that has attracted considerable worldwide interest. Other important government-related FOSS activities carried out by the OSC include the setting up of a web-accessible registry of initiatives, projects and parties associated with FOSS \u2013 the Global Open Source Software Initiatives and Projects (GOSSIP) project \u2013 and the formulation of project plans and strategies to assist government agencies and bodies to migrate to FOSS. OSC is also assisting the Translate.org.za project, which is involved in the localization of several widely-used FOSS desktop packages in South African official languages. OSC is now an entity within the Meraka Institute (African Advanced Institute for Information and Communications Technology) with an expanded research and development programme. It also carries out activities to engage and forge links with other countries. The projects and activities of OSC have brought about an increase in awareness of FOSS and the benefits that it may bring to developing economies such as South Africa; impacting both the public and private sectors as well as the general public. Background of Organization The Meraka OSC was established by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the Department of Science and Technology (DST) of South Africa. It is part of the Meraka Institute and plays a key role in the implementation and realization of the FOSS strategy of South Africa. The vision of OSC is to promote the empowerment of the people through appropriate FOSS interventions. It sees its mission as playing an enabling role aimed at stimulating the adoption of FOSS on the African continent and beyond, and harnessing FOSS to empower the people of the South to contribute to economic development and improvement in the quality of life. With this mission, the Centre works together with other organizations to achieve these aims. Promoting Free and Open Source Software in Africa Meraka, South Africa The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 32 OSC has eight full-time employees and a number of interns, while the Meraka Institute has about 65 staff members.

To fulfil its mission, OSC works with various organizations both within South Africa and Africa as well as throughout the world. These include South African government bodies like the CSIR, local and national government agencies, and international NGOs like the Open Society Initiative and the Shuttleworth Foundation. It has also formed international partnerships with countries like Brazil, China, European Union, Finland, India, as well as organizations like the Free/Open Source Software Foundation for Africa (FOSSFA), the Wikimedia Foundation, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and various other United Nations agencies. FOSS Application Description The role of OSC is to promote FOSS. As such it does not promote a particular FOSS application but rather it makes use of various FOSS applications itself (the Meraka Institute and CSIR also use FOSS). Within the OSC office, stable and established desktop and web FOSS applications are used on a daily basis and the testing of newly developed ones is carried out as well. The FOSS desktop used includes various distributions of GNU/Linux such as Impi/Ubuntu, Suse and Mandrake. Office application suites used include OpenOffice.org and some KOffice. On the server side, applications built using GNU/Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl (the LAMP stack) are used. The projects and initiatives of OSC can be classified under three main categories: \u25cf OpenSpeak \u2013 concerned with advocacy and establishing a network of FOSS players in the public, private and civil society sectors; \u25cf OpenProject \u2013 concerned with enabling access to FOSS applications, and encouraging and providing the catalyst and environment to facilitate project work on various FOSS initiatives; and \u25cf OpenMentor \u2013 concerned with empowering users and producers of FOSS with knowledge addressing skills gaps, facilitating access to courseware and lowering barriers to certification. A listing of some of the projects carried out by the OSC is given under the Implementation and Deployment section of this case study. Choice of FOSS FOSS is used by OSC and the organizations that it serves as it is a body set up to encourage and promote the adoption and usage of FOSS in the country and Africa in general. FOSS is seen as a means to empower the people of developing A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 33 Breaking Barriers countries so that economic development and a better quality of life can be achieved. Implementation and Deployment Given the nature of OSC and the network it is serving, the systems deployed cannot be quantified. The efforts of OSC to promote and help other organizations use FOSS are ongoing. CSIR itself is in the process of migrating to FOSS. The South African government, many academic institutions, civil society, a number of industry players as well as other sectors of society are involved in a wide variety of FOSS initiatives. Sometimes as these systems are deployed, OSC becomes involved with them; an example is that of the Anti-Corruption Management Information System. There are various deployments of activities concerning FOSS under the initiatives/ projects of OSC. Some of them are: \u25cf The \u201cGo-Open Source\u201d campaign, a two- year project that had been successfully completed, was carried out in partnership with the Shuttleworth Foundation and industry partners to create awareness about FOSS by making use of the electronic media, including the production of a TV series (the Go Open TV series \u2013 a world first for FOSS); \u25cf The Geek Freedom League Project, started as part of the Go-Open Source campaign, attempts to encourage as many users as possible to introduce FOSS to friends and colleagues, an endeavour that will earn them the prestigious status of geeks! Upon signing up as a FOSS geek, the volunteer will receive the materials needed to convert people and computers and this campaign has attracted over 4,500 members; \u25cf The development and maintenance of the government website \u2013 http://www.oss.gov.za \u2013 which houses the South African\u2019s Government FOSS strategy document, as well as mailing lists and continuous online discussions on various aspects of FOSS; \u25cf GOSSIP is a web-accessible registry of initiatives, projects and parties associated with FOSS, extending the FOSSFA online database; \u25cf OSC led a consultation to identify how donors and others could support FOSS in Africa. This involved a number of workshops, including various countries using FOSS such as Brazil, China, Vietnam, etc., as well as donors and NGOs; \u25cf OSC is involved in formulating project plans and strategies to assist various government agencies and bodies migrate to FOSS. These include CSIR, the State Information Technology Agency, DST and the City of Johannesburg; \u25cf OSC is assisting the Translate.org.za project,11", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38d0c0ed-3dfb-43d3-8a4b-0e0ffb93acd7": {"__data__": {"id_": "38d0c0ed-3dfb-43d3-8a4b-0e0ffb93acd7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Breaking Barriers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57a600573a38b23320a0ed05e55bc801830aec31ed01452c60b8f051c008ad52"}}, "hash": "57a600573a38b23320a0ed05e55bc801830aec31ed01452c60b8f051c008ad52", "text": "which aims to translate FOSS into South African official languages; and \u25cf Educational and training activities to bring FOSS and free learning resources into the formal and informal education arena. Impact OSC is the main FOSS centre in South Africa. It is the primary vehicle that the government relies on to promote FOSS in the country, as well as to assist in its efforts to bring FOSS into mainstream usage in the government. The main impact of OSC\u2019s activities has been in bringing about awareness of the benefits and usefulness of FOSS and how it can be used to assist developing countries and communities acquire ICT facilities and skills. These activities have benefited the areas of content development, business 11 The Translate.org.za project is involved with the translation of several popular FOSS desktop packages into the 11 official languages of South Africa. http://www.translate.org.za The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 34 development, skills development, research, ICT policy and access. In particular, the use of FOSS in the country has seen instances where the quality of service has improved, as in the case of CSIR where it is now running its access card system for all staff on a FOSS platform. The Translate.org.za project\u2019s experience has been that, using FOSS, technical problems are being addressed faster as there is less dependence on local partners who are mostly associated with proprietary software package owners and are slower in solving the problems. Apart from the government sector, OSC projects have also affected other sectors like education and business, as well as groups like small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), NGOs and the home, as FOSS is promoted and introduced into these areas. The Go-Open TV show has been very popular and has proved successful in reaching out to the general public on the virtues of FOSS. Lessons Learned With the setting up of OSC, other organizations can seek its assistance should they need support with various FOSS initiatives. They can also benefit from the wide experience that OSC has in promoting FOSS and cultivating a FOSS environment in cooperation with various government bodies, NGOs and private companies. Current Status of Project On 17 May 2005, OSC became a semi- autonomous entity within the newly launched Meraka Institute. With FOSS becoming more prominent, more organizations are now involved with FOSS advocacy work and, in accordance with this, OSC has begun to shift its resources and energies from advocacy to research and development. The research activities of OSC have expanded as have engagements with other countries on FOSS issues. Benefits and Challenges The most obvious benefit from OSC\u2019s activities has been the increased awareness of FOSS and associated benefits for South Africa, in particular, and for African nations, in general. The activities and projects organized by OSC have impacted the public and private sectors as well as the general public. These include the assistance of the Centre in the efforts of various government agencies to migrate to FOSS; the engagement with various foreign nations and organizations on FOSS-related issues; the project to translate and localize major FOSS packages into the South African official languages; and educational and training activities on FOSS. OSC has also benefited policy makers in the government in that it has been involved in shaping the National FOSS Strategy and developing the FOSS aspect of the national research and development strategy. On the operations side, in addition to the usual benefits of FOSS in terms of flexibility, stability, skills and cost, the use of FOSS has seen an increase in social solidarity. FOSS has enabled OSC to freely collaborate with a wide variety of organizations across the world. The use of FOSS has promoted access while also helping to deal with a broader set of issues in the ICT sector concerned with promoting skills and bridging the digital divide, etc. The main disadvantage experienced in migrating to FOSS in CSIR has been in the adjustment that some staff members within the broader CSIR have had to make. This has resulted in temporarily slowing down productivity levels. A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 35 Breaking Barriers Other Information The secretariat of FOSSFA was handed over to OSC in early 2006. There are other initiatives around FOSS that started after the launch of OSC and have grown significantly. In some cases, they have become well-known FOSS initiatives; an example being the AVOIR project.12 Conclusion OSC of the Meraka Institute is a key organization in the implementation and realization of the South African Government\u2019s FOSS strategy.

It sees the localization of application software as a means to empower local people with ICT awareness and skills, thereby enriching their lives. FOSS applications that have been localized include OpenOffice.org, Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Thunderbird, KDE and GNOME. The project has created tools, documentation and methodologies for localization. These resources are themselves released as FOSS and made readily available to assist new localization efforts in other software and languages. The resulting localized software from the Translate.org.za project are incorporated as localized versions of the applications by their respective FOSS projects and are disseminated internationally for use, taking the reach and impact of this project beyond South Africa. The FOSS benefits of cost savings, quality tools and a development environment are all experienced by this project. This project is the first large multi-language localization project in the world. As a result of its success, proprietary software vendors in South Africa have begun to localize their products too in order not to lose their competitive advantage to FOSS. Localization has become a social requirement and this will benefit the people. It will also help enhance the image of the local languages thereby preserving and increasing their usage. The project is an ongoing one. More FOSS applications are being added to the list for localization into the official languages of South Africa. Background of Organization Translate.org.za is a project run by the Zuza Software Foundation (Zuza), an established non-profit South African organization. In the past Zuza had been mainly involved in the localization of FOSS but, recently, it had branched into other areas. Zuza has, to date, undertaken a number of key projects including Translate.org.za. The projects that Zuza had been involved with are connected with the language and culture elements of FOSS. Zuza has built skills in these areas and is focusing on creating FOSS solutions for languages and bringing FOSS thinking to certain language- and culture-specific areas of life. Objectives of Project Zuza was established to develop FOSS to empower and enrich the lives of the people. One important way to achieve this is to make FOSS available in local languages and, in line with this, the main objectives of Translate.org.za and related projects are to: \u25cf Provide software in local languages; \u25cf Encourage multilingualism; \u25cf Preserve languages; \u25cf Create free language resources; and \u25cf Create free tools that can help the above. Localizing Free and Open Source Software Translate.org.za, South Africa 13 The 11 official languages of South Africa are Afrikaans, English, Ndebele, Northern Sotho, Southern Sotho, Swati, Tsonga, Tswana, Venda, Xhosa and Zulu.

The criteria used for choosing the applications to localize are: \u25cf End-user focus, so as to benefit the end users the most; \u25cf Able to run on GNU/Linux and Microsoft Windows, so as to bring benefits to the majority of computer users who still use the Microsoft Windows platform; and \u25cf FOSS, so that the work done here can be reused for other language needs. The tools and methodology developed for the localization of these applications are themselves released as FOSS. Choice of FOSS FOSS applications are chosen for localization over proprietary ones as it usually takes a long time to get the necessary agreement (that is if the proprietary vendors agree at all) for the latter and non-disclosure agreements probably need to be signed. Further, the availability of a localized proprietary software will increase the value of the proprietary vendor\u2019s product but may not benefit the people as not everyone can access proprietary software. Thus, as this project makes use of public money and volunteer labour, it is deemed proper that it localizes FOSS applications so that everyone can have access to them. Development and Implementation The project has created resources such as a translation toolkit, documentation and a translation portal to assist translators and programmers. The Translate.org.za Toolkit is a toolkit to convert between different translation formats (such as gettext-based .po formats, OpenOffice.org formats and Mozilla formats). This makes it possible to stay in one format across all of the localization. By staying in one format, translators can make the best use of their tools and need not adapt to each project. Other tools are available in the Toolkit, for example, those to help process and validate localizations. The Toolkit has now been merged into the WordForge14 FOSS project. Documentation from the project has been gathered and consolidated so that other people 14 The WordForge project attempts to simplify the process of localization of software. http://www.wordforge.org The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 38 can have a single reference resource for localization. This is maintained in a project wiki.15 The documents are targeted at a level above project localization and thus address broader issues such as strategy and terminology development, etc. The Pootle portal (http://pootle.wordforge.org) has been created to help people manage their translation projects and teams, perform web- based translation and manage offline translation. The aim is to lower the entry barrier so that more people can become involved in software localization, especially minority language groups that might not have access to a broad skills base. All this software is written in Python16 and is therefore cross-platform since Python is available on FOSS as well as proprietary platforms. The software itself is released under a FOSS license. Deployment The products from localization are incorporated into their respective FOSS projects and disseminated from the individual project websites or bundled with FOSS operating system distributions, both commercial and non-commercial. All of SuSE, Red Hat and Ubuntu GNU/Linux distributions contain the localizations and a number of vendors include OpenOffice.org with the localizations on their computers. Impact The localization of an application is an important social issue and has significant impact on local users. It is important to make it possible for users to work on a computer, using their local language, without having to learn English. As a spin-off to this, the availability of software in the users\u2019 native languages is changing their perception of their own languages; they now see them as modern and worthy of using and preserving. The project has created a number of tools to make the localization of Mozilla and OpenOffice.org more compliant with the FOSS methodology as well as the documentation of the processes and these two steps have made it easier for many other teams in Africa and the world to localize software. The project has provided input and guidance to other localization teams through training events held at Africa Source17 I and II and Asia Source.18 Projects such as KiLinux, localizing GNU/Linux into Swahili, make use of the Translate.org.za Toolkit and received training and guidance from Translate.org.za. The Cambodian project, KhmerOS,19 also made use of the Toolkit and helped document tools. 15 A wiki is a type of collaborative software that allows users to add, remove and edit the contents of a website very quickly and easily, sometimes without the need for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a7fbe77-9a16-4627-a7ba-7bccc6176db9": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a7fbe77-9a16-4627-a7ba-7bccc6176db9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Breaking Barriers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "84d7ed1111a29c22cb03bab586df80dea6cdd14c32df209868481a809939c149"}, "3": {"node_id": "76676def-4e16-450e-ac04-8d3599ba7a16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "769c4d0b9e2211640005f91dcf2a79820db3e7f9779e93e5bfc5f351e50539b2"}}, "hash": "aa7a1c23dba279122379f971bffd08752bee9fd2a3df54a78c5c255209cd1193", "text": "registration.

It has compelled proprietary vendors to localize their software in order to retain a competitive advantage against FOSS. The project has thus achieved the objective of making the software industry see localization as a requirement and not just as an option. Lessons Learned The important lesson learned is that if efforts are made to localize FOSS applications in a local language, in addition to the availability of the localized FOSS, competing proprietary software vendors are likely to localize their software as well because they do not want to lose the market advantage to FOSS. The project also found that to encourage the use of FOSS, it has to be targeted at and packaged for the end users. FOSS itself is unique and different from proprietary software and this difference is often not exploited enough to advance FOSS usage. Current Status of Project The project is ongoing. OpenOffice.org 2.0 had been released in the 11 South African languages with Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird to follow suit. Benefits and Challenges The use of FOSS in the localization effort has provided tremendous savings for the project. The operating platforms, the localization and translation tools, as well as the target software themselves are FOSS. The general benefits that FOSS conveys to software and development environments in this project include flexibility and speed, control of outputs and access to helpful developers. The biggest challenge faced in this project is the employment and management of localizers who are often not very computer-literate. Other Information The Translate.org.za project site at Sourecforge20 provides more technical and documentation details of the project. The Sourceforge site is used to host the Translate.org.za Toolkit. Conclusion The Translate.org.za project has succeeded in localizing several important FOSS applications into the 11 South African official languages. FOSS platforms and tools themselves are utilized in the localization effort and this has resulted in cost savings and the ability to produce quality products quickly. Apart from localized applications, the project has also produced important localization and translation toolkits as well as documentation that will help other localization projects. The availability of localized FOSS software applications has prompted some proprietary software vendors to produce local versions of their software in order not to lose out.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76676def-4e16-450e-ac04-8d3599ba7a16": {"__data__": {"id_": "76676def-4e16-450e-ac04-8d3599ba7a16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Breaking Barriers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "84d7ed1111a29c22cb03bab586df80dea6cdd14c32df209868481a809939c149"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a7fbe77-9a16-4627-a7ba-7bccc6176db9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa7a1c23dba279122379f971bffd08752bee9fd2a3df54a78c5c255209cd1193"}}, "hash": "769c4d0b9e2211640005f91dcf2a79820db3e7f9779e93e5bfc5f351e50539b2", "text": "All these have contributed to multilingualism in South Africa and benefited the local people, making them more aware of the usefulness of their local 20 The project\u2019s site at Sourceforge can be found at http://translate.sf.net The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 40 Contact Information Project: Translate.org.za Organization: Zuza Software Foundation Contact Person: Dwayne Bailey Street Address: 63A Wenning St, Groenkloof, Pretoria, 0181 South Africa Postal Address: Box 28364, Sunnyside, 0132 South Africa E-mail: dwayne@translate.org.za Tel/Fax: +27 12 460 1095 Websites Translate.org.za website http://www.translate.org.za The Translate.org.za project site on Sourceforge http://translate.sf.net/wiki The Pootle web portal http://pootle.wordforge.org The WordForge project http://wordforge.org A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 41 Breaking Barriers Summary The AgriBazaar project is a joint effort between the Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic Systems (MIMOS) and the Agriculture Department of Malaysia to boost the Malaysian agriculture industry by enabling various stakeholders (e.g. farmers, fishermen, agri- based food manufacturers, retailers, distributors, exporters and importers) to conduct their daily agriculture production trading online.

It allows stakeholders to put up their products for sale as well as access market information and check on the latest prices. Through this project, the Government hopes to enhance the productivity of the local agriculture community and the competitiveness of the Malaysian agriculture industry while, simultaneously, introducing the use of ICT and the Internet to the target rural agricultural communities. FOSS development tools are used to develop the portal and the back-end application while the portal runs on a FOSS platform. The portal is accessed through the Internet using a web browser. For users who cannot access the portal, a FOSS-based thin-client computer system and/ or FOSS live-CDs are deployed at some suitable site for stakeholders to use. The AgriBazaar deployment attempts to provide a solution to specific economic problems of the target users as well as address the more general digital divide issue facing the target community. The use of FOSS allows software development and system maintenance to take place without incurring high costs. Local software developers were Connecting Farmers and Buyers AgriBazaar, Malaysia used to develop the application, which will add to the pool of local software expertise and knowledge. Using FOSS thin-client and/or FOSS live-CD solutions as the access mechanism makes deployment to other rural areas that may lack the necessary ICT resources easier. Challenges to the deployment of the system in rural areas include the availability of adequate Internet-access infrastructure, effective community adaptation to new technology, sustainability of the project and the willingness of the target community to take ownership of it. A pilot trial had been conducted in one of the districts in the country and the results and feedback have been positive and encouraging. The project has since moved beyond this pilot stage and it is now being implemented in stages at various agriculture department offices nationwide. Background of Organization MIMOS, an agency under the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of the Government of Malaysia, plays an important role in the development of Malaysia by acting as a technology promoter, partner or provider for innovation in and through ICT. It mainly acts in the technology thrust areas of pervasive computing, cyberspace security and microelectronics. One of MIMOS\u2019 main development strategies is to extend smart partnership with universities, industries, research institutes and the Government. Currently MIMOS employs about 400 employees. The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 42 Objectives of Project The AgriBazaar project is a joint effort between MIMOS and the Agriculture Department of Malaysia to boost the Malaysian agriculture industry by enabling farmers, breeders, fishermen, producers, agri-based food manufacturers, retailers, distributors, exporters and importers to conduct their daily agriculture production trading online. This project is intended to provide an opportunity for local agriculture producers to extend the market reach of their agricultural produce. Through the use of ICT and the Internet, the project aims to: \u25cf Bridge the digital divide between the rural and urban communities since most of the rural community is engaged in the agriculture industry; \u25cf Enhance the productivity of the local agriculture community through better planning and management of their activities and businesses, thereby leading to better quality products and increased food exports; and \u25cf Enhance the competitiveness of the Malaysian agriculture industry. The target groups of this project include the small and medium farmers, breeders, fishermen and manufacturers of agriculture-based products and services located in rural areas. Also targeted are the SMEs involved in agriculture- based industries such as producing snacks, delicacies, bakery and herbal products. MIMOS has three key partners for AgriBazaar: the Department of Agriculture from the Ministry of Agriculture which provides the domain expertise, the financial institution required for the payment for business-to-business transactions, and the retailers and producers who are the users of the AgriBazaar system. FOSS Application Description AgriBazaar consists of a web portal as the front- end interface to the users and a SCM system as the back-end application. It allows target stakeholders to sell their daily production online as well as access market information and the latest prices of their produce. The users of the system make use of thin-client computers (essentially PCs without hard drives) located at some suitable location to access the portal. The web-based applications available from the portal as well as the thin-client system for users were all developed using FOSS. FOSS software used for the development of AgriBazaar are: \u25cf GNU/Linux operating system; \u25cf Apache web server; \u25cf Apache-Tomcat servlet container; \u25cf STRUTS Java application development framework;", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e41e7a39-be47-4ca0-a88f-bd5e82999bdf": {"__data__": {"id_": "e41e7a39-be47-4ca0-a88f-bd5e82999bdf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Breaking Barriers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8995c073e54db3cb7bd79063dc262fdf3d984660a7fd5e4b2b795ca2a7f394a3"}}, "hash": "8995c073e54db3cb7bd79063dc262fdf3d984660a7fd5e4b2b795ca2a7f394a3", "text": "\u25cf CVS version control system; \u25cf MySQL and PostGreSQL database systems; and \u25cf GNU/Linux thin-client system and GNU/ Linux live-CD for deployment to users. Choice of FOSS FOSS development and deployment platforms were chosen for the project because a cost- effective solution with a high degree of security and low maintenance was needed for the application. The use of FOSS will also encourage local capacity building in ICT technology and software development. Proprietary software solutions were not used as MIMOS intended AgriBazaar to be a showcase of how FOSS can be utilized for large-scale applications and, at the same time, introduce farmers to the use of computers thereby helping to bridge the digital divide. For sustainability it is important that the project can be economically owned by the target community eventually and there should be little A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 43 Breaking Barriers risk of vendor dependence and lock-in. FOSS offers a cost-effective way to achieve these objectives. Development and Implementation The web portal acts as the gateway that connects all players to the back-end SCM application via the web browser. The SCM system is developed internally by MIMOS to manage the production up to the point of selling and marketing the product. This system is based on the problems peculiar to the local agriculture industry. The industry deals with products that have short lifecycles and the SCM contains seven modules to address these issues: \u25cf eBuySell \u2013 posting new offers, sending requests for quotations, negotiation on quotation and ordering online; \u25cf eLogistic \u2013 scheduling and managing transport booking and listing of transport provider in the country; \u25cf eStock \u2013 managing product, warehouse, and inventory; \u25cf eMake \u2013 managing production and raw material; \u25cf eSupport \u2013 managing company\u2019s FAQs and assisting customer support; \u25cf ePlan \u2013 forecasting and estimationmodel; and \u25cf ePayment \u2013 making payment via online business-to-business transaction. A key design consideration is that the solution developed should conform and comply with applicable standards and mechanisms for collaboration and distribution of ICT solutions/applications. The solution should not be tied to any proprietary vendor or technology and be accessible via any mode or channel of delivery. Open standards are adhered to as strictly as possible in the development of the solution. Deployment The district of Batu Pahat in the state of Johor was chosen for the pilot run of the project. The district agriculture office here is the place where local farmers, the cottage industry and the agricultural community go to seek advice and guidance related to agriculture activities. It is thus an appropriate site to engage target users in the use of the AgriBazaar portal. A GNU/Linux thin-client system was set up beside this district agriculture office in the same building. A thin-client system enables easier and more efficient system administration and management, contributing to a lower total cost of ownership. The system set-up there consisted of one server and 10 diskless clients connected to it via a local area network (LAN); this LAN was connected to the Internet via a router and an asynchronous digital subscriber line link. The centre was also equipped with GNU/Linux live-CDs (localized MIMOS/GNU live- CD based on Knoppix live-CD) to enable diskless clients to run as stand-alone stations to access AgriBazaar, should the server encounter any problems that could not be resolved quickly enough. The web-based application can be easily accessed by users from any computer connected to the Internet. The use of thin- client technology facilitates the access from a centre managed by a local authority or government agency without the need to install or upgrade to new and expensive computer systems. The existing infrastructure can be leveraged to access and use AgriBazaar and this is very useful, especially for rural communities where such a model will make it easier for them to adopt the use of AgriBazaar. For the SCM system, a total of four modules have been deployed for the community to use \u2013 ePlan, eBuySell, eStock, and eLogistic. The remaining three modules \u2013 eSupport, eMake, and ePayment \u2013 are still under development and will be released in 2006. The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 44 Impact The project is focused on bridging the digital divide and enhancing productivity and competitiveness in the agriculture sector of Malaysia. Some expected outcomes from this project are: increased ICT literacy and income, and improved livelihoods for the people in the agriculture and rural sectors. It is also hoped that a pool of local talent with the ability to develop local software applications for social benefits will emerge.

Through it, both producers and buyers have direct and better access to the market and each other, and the middleman is eliminated. This will result in a more open and competitive market with the seller being able to sell directly to the buyer and the latter obtaining a better value for the items purchased. AgriBazaar can be accessible anywhere and any time. It is more flexible for producers or buyers to transact business without time constraints, thereby increasing their productivity since buying and selling can be done whenever they are free with less disturbances to their daily jobs or activities. By being a web-based application, AgriBazaar is globally accessible and buyers from other countries have used AgriBazaar as a platform to do business with local producers. In addition to the latest prices of agricultural products, AgriBazaar also provides up-to-date information on market analysis and estimation data on fruit production. Through this information, producers or buyers are able to stay better informed and be more competitive. In the deployment of AgriBazaar, a very important impact is the bridging of the digital divide. Most farmers or people who are involved in the agriculture industry have low ICT literacy. Through this project, these people are given training regularly so that they know how to access and make use of the AgriBazaar portal; thereby making them ICT-literate. The use of FOSS and the thin-client approach make it easier to deploy the system even to places where there is low ownership of computers. This will enable the project to reach a wider section of target communities. Lessons Learned Several important lessons were learned in the pilot run of the project. As the fear among some suppliers and providers that their products may not be up to quality resulted in considerable apprehension in using the system, some means of measuring or ensuring quality of their products is needed. The community\u2019s adoption of new technology is slow. Changes take time and the rural divide issue is not the only issue at hand. Even personnel within the organizations involved needed to be inculcated with the ICT culture. Users are reluctant to try out and use new things and/or features if their benefits are not seen or obtained immediately. The usage and availability of appropriate Internet access technologies have to be considered beforehand. As the Internet is required to use AgriBazaar, technologies available in remote areas for Internet access (e.g. broadband versus dial-up) are key factors in the effective use of the application. The project must be scalable and sustainable in the future for it to have a longer-term impact. The use of FOSS helps this especially in the deployment and maintenance of the project. Current Status of Project The project has moved beyond its pilot stage testing and it is now being implemented in stages at various agriculture department offices A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 45 Breaking Barriers nationwide. As part of the implementation plan, MIMOS is distributing PCs, in stages, in these agriculture offices to those who need the access as an incentive to encourage more people to use AgriBazaar. In the first stage, 13 PCs have been distributed to selected offices recommended by the Department of Agriculture. The second stage of software development has now been completed and new versions of the software released. AgriBazaar is in the stage of transferring the first level support to the Department of Agriculture for operational matters. Currently, the statistics for AgriBazaar are as follows: \u25cf Number of registered members \u2013 11,500; \u25cf Number of offers for purchases of goods \u2013 770; and \u25cf Value amount of offers \u2013 more than MYR 15 million (US$ 4 million). Although, the portal targets local users involved in agriculture activities, users from other countries are registered on AgriBazaar and making offers through the portal. These account for 3 percent of the registered members and they come from countries such as Australia, Canada, China, Egypt, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Spain, United Kingdom and all the ASEAN countries. Benefits and Challenges The general benefits gained from using FOSS are experienced in this project. These include the relatively low-cost, reliability and security of the software. More importantly, by using FOSS, the developers were able to grasp and learn advanced concepts of software development and to deliver prototypes quickly. FOSS provided the tools needed to do the job and the references given by the resources available from the FOSS community made it possible to develop a complex system like the applications for AgriBazaar.

Among the challenges experienced in using FOSS are that a learning period is required before the developers can become productive and efficient as many are not exposed to the FOSS development environment. The biggest challenge to the project itself is the issue of sustainability. The application needs to be sustainable in order for it to create the impact and benefits envisaged. Clear ownership of AgriBazaar is also required so that its potential can be further explored and expanded. A dedicated team comprising technical, support groups and domain experts must be focused in providing not only the best solution and technology but also addressing industry needs. Currently, this is a challenge as AgriBazaar is still at the demonstration stage and is fully funded by the government. The people in the community must also be willing to take ownership of the project and its programmes and activities, and be convinced that they are for the betterment of their own livelihood. Other Information Much useful feedback has been received asking for the enhancement of the portal from the portal members themselves. The statistics and comments give a good indication that the application is being used actively by members. The media and press have also given good reviews and comments saying that AgriBazaar benefits the agriculture community. The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 46 Conclusion The AgriBazaar project has shown how FOSS can be leveraged as an enabling tool to build ICT solutions that can benefit targeted sectors of a community, in this case, the agriculture and rural communities in Malaysia. FOSS has been utilized successfully to develop and run the system. The project has contributed towards directly improving the economic status of rural agriculture producers by providing a platform for them to have better access to buyers and eliminating the middleman. Through the usage of the system, users have become ICT-literate thereby addressing the digital divide between the rural and urban population. The use of thin- client technology to provide access to the AgriBazaar portal is very useful for rural communities where computer resources are lacking and such a model will make it easier for rural areas to adopt the usage of AgriBazaar. While initial feedback to the pilot phase of the project has been positive and encouraging, key issues of sustainability and ownership remain as the project attempts to move from the pilot phase into nationwide roll-out.

This Linux distro is based on Fedora Linux and is targeted at first-time users. The main objective of creating BlankOn Linux is to expose the people of Indonesia, most of whom are not English- literate, to FOSS and GNU/Linux. It is hoped that with a version of GNU/Linux that is available in the Indonesian language, more people will turn to FOSS as an alternative to using illegal unlicensed proprietary software (a practice that is currently rampant). BlankOn Linux is simpler to install than many of the normal Linux distros and comes ready with many packages for computer education, office and multimedia applications, Internet access and file sharing. A BlankOn software development kit (SDK) is being prepared and this should make it easier for other developers to build other specialized Linux distros based on BlankOn Linux. Project deployment was unique in that it took only a short time to develop BlankOn Linux and the team spent a relatively small amount of money to achieve this. The availability of BlankOn Linux will have a positive impact on the digital divide in Indonesia as more people can now have access to software in their local language to use the Internet and other ICT facilities.

Building an Indonesian GNU/Linux BlankOn Linux, Indonesia One major lesson learned from the project is that without enough money for full-time developers, the use of developers who held full- time jobs elsewhere meant that they had to sacrifice their free time and holidays in order to develop BlankOn Linux. As such, human resources in the development effort can be stretched thin at times. In spite of this, the BlankOn Linux project is being maintained and the team is preparing to come out with the next release soon. However, the long-term sustainability of the project has yet to be tested and only time will tell whether the project can garner sufficient resources to successfully maintain and develop BlankOn Linux. Background of Organization Yayasan Penggerak Linux Indonesia is an organization dedicated to the promotion of FOSS, especially GNU/Linux, so as to enable it to be widely accepted for mainstream usage as well as for software development in Indonesia. Its main activities are holding awareness events across the country, developing and contributing to FOSS projects, establishing contacts with other FOSS-related organizations and collecting data on FOSS growth in the country. The Foundation runs the Indonesian Linux Certification programme and works on projects including the BlankOn Linux distribution and the OpenSyariah project for banking. Objectives of Project The main objective of this project is to come up with a local Indonesian GNU/Linux distribution. It is desirable to have an The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 48 Indonesian distribution of Linux so that the language used for the desktop environment and some applications can be in the Indonesian language (Bahasa Indonesia); this will enable the mainly non-English-literate users in the country to be exposed to ICT and to use computers more effectively. In the long term, the BlankOn Linux project aims to be the standard GNU/Linux distribution for desktop computers in Indonesia. The primary target group for BlankOn Linux are new computer users, especially those in Internet kiosks, schools, and the government. A second target group is the Linux distro developers so that they can develop new distros based on BlankOn Linux. The BlankOn development is sponsored by UNESCO, one of the UN agencies promoting FOSS for education; Indoglobal web hosting; InfoLINUX magazine; Linuxindo Training and Consultant; Nurul Fikri Training Centre; and some ISPs. FOSS Application Description BlankOn Linux is an Indonesian distribution of GNU/Linux based on the Fedora Linux21 distribution. It consists of the Linux operating system kernel, office application software suite, Internet access software (e.g. web browser, e-mail, chat, etc.), file sharing and multimedia applications. The desktop environment and applications have been localized so that Bahasa Indonesia is used and they have an Indonesian look and feel. Choice of FOSS The majority of Indonesian computer users require software for a number of common tasks such as office applications, accessing the Internet and multimedia. However, to be affordable the software has to have a low cost and preferably no licensing fees at all. FOSS, and GNU/Linux in particular, meet all these requirements as they are free for use and can be freely copied, modified and distributed. They can also be easily localized to meet local needs and language. GNU/Linux is also relatively immune to common computer viruses, worms and spyware. Development and Implementation BlankOn Linux was developed from Fedora Core 3. There are three key steps to follow in order to produce BlankOn Linux from Fedora Core: \u25cf Translation and localization; \u25cf Repackaging and installer building; and \u25cf Testing and quality assurance. The localization and packaging of BlankOn Linux took about three months. New versions for BlankOn are being planned for release once or twice a year, following the release schedule of Fedora Core. Deployment A few hundred systems have been deployed with BlankOn Linux, for example, at Internet kiosks. InfoLINUX magazine has bundled BlankOn Linux CDs with its printed issues for mass distribution. Impact This project will contribute towards providing local people with affordable legal software that they can use on their PCs. BlankOn Linux is simple and quick to install and it comes only on one CD. Unlike many Linux distros available, its multimedia applications have been packaged so that they support most proprietary multimedia formats. Its Indonesian theme and menu should make local users feel comfortable with it. As such, 21 The Fedora Linux project. http://fedora.redhat.com A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 49 Breaking Barriers it is ideal for first-time users especially those who want desktops with local language support and look-and-feel.

The Indonesian Government is attempting to bridge the digital divide and, at the same time, encourage the use of legally licensed software. This is a problem with proprietary software as its license does not allow it to be freely copied for distribution and hence the costs involved can be prohibitive. The availability of BlankOn Linux can have a positive impact on this issue as it is a licensed software and its licence allows users the freedom to copy, modify and distribute it. The soon to be available BlankOn SDK will facilitate the packaging of new Linux distros based on it. Lessons Learned The main lesson learned from the project is that as most software developers in Indonesia have full-time jobs, only a handful are willing or able to sacrifice their time after work and their holidays to work on the project. While financial assistance for the project is received from UNESCO and some Indonesian FOSS companies, it is not enough to pay a few developers to work full-time on the project. Current Status of Project Currently, the project is developing a special distro (BlankOn SDK) targeted at helping developers create new distributions for specific environments based on BlankOn Linux. BlankOn SDK version 1.1 has been released with a manual in Bahasa Indonesia. Parallel to this effort, the development of the next release BlankOn Linux 2.0, based on the Fedora Core 5 distribution has also commenced. Benefits and Challenges The main benefit of the project is the availability of a localized Linux distribution that is easy to install and use and comes with ready applications for the office, the Internet and multimedia. The availability of a desktop environment in the local language can go a long way in attracting new users. This and the fact that BlankOn Linux is FOSS and hence can be freely copied and distributed will help more Indonesians gain access to ICT facilities as they become readily available and affordable. The main disadvantage of using BlankOn Linux is that some effort has to be made to interoperate with the dominant desktop environment of Microsoft Windows as well as possibly other proprietary application software. Moreover, some less popular hardware and peripheral devices may not be supported by it. The project sees its main challenge as the effort to migrate the eight million computers in Indonesia, the majority of which are using illegal software, to FOSS and BlankOn Linux, in particular. Another possible challenge to the sustainability of the project is the availability of resources to maintain the BlankOn distribution. Apart from coming out with the initial distribution, updates to cater for patches and bug fixes have to be maintained and this can be a burden on the human resources, given that the developers in the project are working on a part- time, mainly voluntary, basis. Conclusion The BlankOn Linux project has given rise to an Indonesian distribution of GNU/Linux targeted at first-time users. In spite of constraints on human and financial resources, the team was able to build this Linux distribution in a relatively short time. Deployment has taken place in Internet kiosks. As BlankOn Linux is localized and uses the Bahasa Indonesia, it should result in exposing more local people to ICT and the The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 50 Internet, thereby helping to bridge the digital divide. It will also have an impact in helping to reduce the number of unlicensed proprietary software in use as more people turn to it as an alternative. The project is ongoing with the release of BlankOn Linux 2.0 in the pipeline and the BlankOn SDK that will make it easier to build customized distros.

FOSS is chosen as it is important to make the software freely available to the farmers and to encourage contributions to OSCAR from various groups and organizations in the IGP. These groups help enhance the system by cataloguing the weed species in their region and their respective control measures. It is also important to be able to perform customizations to suit local languages and cultural practices as the content of the application, particularly the control measures of weeds, may vary with the practices in different regions. OSCAR is unique in that it is the first of its kind within the domain of ICT applications for agriculture. By being available as FOSS, it promotes the aggregation of information from academic/research institutions as well as from traditional knowledge systems. The project has tested the application with various target groups in the four countries of the IGP \u2013 Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan \u2013with encouraging results. A key lesson learned from the project is that any implementation of Identifying and Controlling Weeds OSCAR, India ICT applications for a rural agrarian population has to take into account the prevalent basic issues in agricultural practices and infrastructural constraints. It is essential that methods to integrate participation from local communities are considered. The current project is concerned with delivering and testing the prototype OSCAR application. While this has been largely successful, the ability to move from this to the actual working environment at the field level remains uncertain, as is the ability to continue to consolidate and sustain the enthusiasm and efforts of different agencies in different countries to participate, contribute, build and enhance on the existing set-up. The actual deployment of OSCAR will probably not be done on Simputers as several issues with implementing and using it on a Simputer were experienced during the course of the development of OSCAR and its subsequent trial runs. To overcome this and to enable it to reach a wider audience, OSCAR has been successfully converted into a web-based application. Background of Organization IFP, a multidisciplinary research centre located in Pondicherry, India, carries out research and training activities in South and South-East Asia in the fields of Indology, Social Sciences and Ecology. IFP is highly regarded for its work in the study of Sanskrit and Tamil languages, literature and grammatical traditions (in collaboration with the Ecole Fran\u00e7aise d\u2019 Extr\u00eame Orient) as well as for its vegetation mapping of South Indian Forests and bioclimates in South-East Asia. The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 52 The Laboratory of Geomatics and Applied Informatics in the Institute specializes in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and in ICT. It is responsible for all the ICT infrastructural needs of IFP as well as the development of databases and multimedia products for the departments at the Institute. The Laboratory is also in charge of original applications development, aimed at improving access to new technologies. Objectives of Project The OSCAR project aims to address the issue of declining agricultural productivity in South Asia by producing a tool for decision-making in weed identification and control. The specific objective of the project is to demonstrate a prototype of this tool implemented in software and running on desktop computers and low- cost computing devices. This decision-making tool targets farmers of the IGP at the village level and it will be available in different local languages so as to address the cultural diversity of the project area. An existing software for species identification - Identification Assiste pour Ordinnateur - is ported to a FOSS platform and deployed on low-cost computing devices running GNU/ Linux, that can be shared among farmers of a local community. A model database for identification and control of a set of the most important weeds of the IGP is developed for integration with the species identification software. The usage, appropriateness and acceptance of the tool at the farmer community level are also assessed. The primary target groups are farmers and village communities of selected villages from the four countries of the IGP \u2013 Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. The indirect target group is the farming community of the region in general. The ultimate end users of OSCAR will be the farmers, village communities and also all the actors involved in the support of agricultural activities, such as development workers, NGOs, training and extension officers of semi-government and government agencies, and students of botany and agronomy at colleges and universities. For this project, IFP is working with three partners from Asia and Europe: \u25cf The Centre de Coop\u00e9ration Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le D\u00e9veloppement of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8d7c279-24e3-414f-8afb-944fa70ab141": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8d7c279-24e3-414f-8afb-944fa70ab141", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Breaking Barriers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "48cc1e01ae5d82c2926020d140064a57a384b6a1bf13fb59f653dd4eb4927241"}}, "hash": "48cc1e01ae5d82c2926020d140064a57a384b6a1bf13fb59f653dd4eb4927241", "text": "France specializing in development- oriented agricultural research for hot regions; \u25cf The Rice and Wheat Consortium of Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan has weed science experts and a strong background in agriculture in the IGP; and \u25cf The Centre of Innovation Studies, Wageningen University from the Netherlands, is concerned with the way communication can be strategically brought in to reinforce development, pro-social behaviour, organizational efficiency and collective decision-making. Its interests cover the broad and interconnected areas of agriculture, food and health, environment and nature, in western as well as in non- western countries. FOSS Application Description The prototype application, OSCAR, is the primary outcome of the project. With a weed identification system at its core, it has information on 50 of the most common weed species for the rice and wheat crop systems of the IGP. OSCAR helps the farmer to properly identify a weed species and provides information on the botanical aspects and appropriate control measures. A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 53 Breaking Barriers Choice of FOSS FOSS is chosen as it allows easy customization of the software and data formats used are known and open. These considerations are important so as to encourage contributions to OSCAR from agronomists, researchers, student community and concerned development organizations in the IGP. These organizations can help to enhance the system by cataloguing the weed species in their region and their respective control measures. If the application were based on proprietary formats and software then the whole purpose of OSCAR would be defeated since the agencies currently involved will be required to implement any future enhancements and customization. Also, it will not be practical to have a common application for the whole region considering the cultural diversity of the target region that covers four countries \u2013 with different languages and cultural practices. Although efforts are being made to port OSCAR into respective local languages, the content of the application, particularly the control measures of weeds vary with context. By using FOSS, the community can customize the application to suit its own local needs. For example, the number of weed species for lowland rice crop systems in Bangladesh can be increased in the database compared to the numbers of weeds for wheat, so that the application contains more tangible and relevant information. Development and Implementation OSCAR is designed to work on GNU/Linux platforms. The Gtk graphics library package is used for developing the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the application while the libgda library (a library for writing database programs) is used for database access. MySQL is utilized as the database back-end with the gda-mysql package being deployed to interface between libgda and MySQL. OSCAR is developed for both desktop computers and Simputers. The core component in the OSCAR application is the species identification kit (identikit). The identikit contains a model plant species with different user selectable characters such as root, habit, leaves and flowers. Each character has a number of character states which are, in turn, selected by the user. Based on the user\u2019s selection, the identikit displays the most appropriate match compared to the species available on the database. The base code is written in the C programming language, and characters and character states are stored in the database. The database is independent of the base code so as to facilitate future enhancements to the database. Deployment The application is targeted at farmers, extension workers and students of the IGP. The project focuses mainly on making it available on FOSS. The application has been widely tested with farmers, extension workers, students and researchers, and has received enthusiastic responses. It is made freely available on the website and interested parties are encouraged to download and use the application. Any agency such as a government or NGO involved in rural development can make use of the application. The project has tested the application with the various target groups in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. It was found that the local communities were very open and ready to adopt and own the application. From researchers and teaching community at the universities and research institutions to development workers at the grass-roots level, everyone was readily convinced of the advantages of the FOSS model and was eager to actively contribute in one way or another. The deployment of OSCAR is unique in that it is the first of its kind within the domain of ICT applications for agriculture. The nature of The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 54 the application addresses a pressing need of the target groups, namely, to identify the weed species correctly", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c0c37a9-3c8e-4fa0-b8c7-1978fd8abfdd": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c0c37a9-3c8e-4fa0-b8c7-1978fd8abfdd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Breaking Barriers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6be2fba44d7e7c637f2fa55a6c0e599aeae9847fea42acb59dfcff6aa2d27bd"}}, "hash": "b6be2fba44d7e7c637f2fa55a6c0e599aeae9847fea42acb59dfcff6aa2d27bd", "text": "and control them effectively. By virtue of OSCAR being released as a FOSS application, participating parties can freely contribute towards building up its knowledge base. The aggregation of information is provided not only from academic/research institutions but also from traditional knowledge systems, for example, cultural practices in weed control like hand weeding. Impact Enthusiastic responses to OSCAR have been received from the research community, in particular, in all the target countries. The fact that researchers can customize the application to fit their own environment has invoked much interest in OSCAR. OSCAR will encourage and result in the participation of local bodies and organizations including panchayats (councils at the village level), cooperatives, farmers\u2019 associations and women\u2019s self-help groups, etc., to build their capacities with resources accessible within their village. This will also enable these micro- organizations to manage their resources at the village level with the combined knowledge base at local and institutional levels. This effect can contribute enormously towards improving the decision-making capacity of the farmers, not only on issues related to farming, but also on other issues related to development as a spill- over effect. Another impact is the enablement of partner organizations to garner expertise on various issues including different local needs, the approach and appropriateness of ICT aids in farming, technical presentation of the application, and the integration of technical information in local farming practices and traditional knowledge systems. These factors contribute to the design of better management techniques for the future. Lessons Learned The project has contributed much to the understanding of how to design and implement an ICT application for agriculture. One key lesson learned during the implementation of the project was that any ICT application targeted towards a rural agrarian population has to take into consideration the prevalent basic issues in agricultural practices and infrastructural constraints. Acceptance by the target group and methods to integrate participation from local communities is essential for any ICT intervention at the grass-roots level to be successful. Merely dishing out information without considering social issues and differences at the village level and existing channels for information will only make the initiative redundant. Current Status of Project The project has completed its final stage and final releases of OSCAR for GNU/Linux and the Simputer. A set of recommendations for ICT initiatives for agriculture has also been published. During the course of the development of OSCAR and subsequent trial runs, the project found several issues with implementing and using OSCAR on a Simputer. These include the lack of a standard development platform, limited availability of storage space, high local pricing (prices are comparable with a desktop PC) and poor hardware support locally. Given all these restrictions, it is unlikely that further development and deployment of OSCAR on the Simputer will take place. Instead it has been decided to port OSCAR to a web-based FOSS application as this will make it more visible and enable it to reach a much wider population and area. This has been done successfully. Benefits and Challenges OSCAR provides farmers in the IGP with the information and ability to identify and control weeds in their paddy and wheat fields. Prior to A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 55 Breaking Barriers this, it was very difficult for non-botanists to identify weeds properly and correctly. The OSCAR application, based on a GUI, using drawings instead of technical jargon, is simple and easy to use. The use of FOSS tools and applications to develop and build OSCAR as well as a FOSS database to store the data provides an open and adept environment to develop and standardize applications such as OSCAR. The scientific products of academic and research institutions can be deployed on FOSS thereby encouraging wider participation and dissemination. Positive and spirited responses experienced during the testing of OSCAR show that there is a real need for such applications and FOSS is the only way such initiatives can be sustained and replicated for a wider region. If OSCAR is not a FOSS application it may have been yet another centrally-managed decision-support system that would cease to exist once the project ends.

However, in spite of encouraging signs and activities witnessed on participation in the OSCAR project, the biggest challenge still remains the ability to consolidate and sustain the enthusiasm and efforts of the different agencies in different countries to participate, contribute, build and enhance on the existing setup of the project.

Conclusion The OSCAR prototype of an application software for weed identification and control of the rice and wheat crop systems of the IGP has been successfully developed as FOSS and tested in various target groups in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. The use of FOSS to develop and implement OSCAR makes it possible to encourage contributions to it from agronomists, researchers, the student community and concerned development organizations in the region. With the deployment of OSCAR, farmers in the IGP will be able to better identify and control weeds in their paddy and wheat fields. An indirect impact of the project is the encouragement of local bodies and organizations to help themselves by building their capacities with resources from within their village leading to better resource management and contributing towards the decision-making capacity of the farmers on farming and other issues related to development.

In Sri Lanka, one of the countries hardest hit by the tsunami, ICT volunteers put together the Sahana Disaster Management System to help track families and coordinate work among relief organizations during and after the tsunami disaster. Subsequently, Sahana has been deployed to manage the earthquake disaster in Northern Pakistan (2005), the Guinsaugon landslide in the Philippines (2006) and the earthquake in Yogjakarta, Indonesia (2006). Sahana is developed on a FOSS platform using the LAMP software stack and is made available as FOSS itself. A major advantage of having a FOSS disaster management system is that it can be readily distributed, localized and customized according to the requirements of the region or community using it and poor countries can also afford to use it. Sahana consists of a series of integrated web-based disaster management applications aimed at facilitating the management of missing people and disaster victims; managing and administering various organizations; managing camps; and managing requests and assistance in the proper distribution of resources. A new and improved version of Sahana, Sahana Phase II, is now being rolled out. This version is more flexible and powerful and can cater to more general types of disasters. Sahana is being developed and maintained by a dedicated team of six full-time developers with assistance from the worldwide FOSS community. A key challenge for the Lanka Managing Disasters Sahana, Sri Lanka Software Foundation (LSF), the non-profit organization that oversees the project, is to ensure that it receives adequate sponsorships to be able to support the core development team. The success of Sahana and its availability as FOSS opens up the possibility of international aid agencies and relief organizations as well as national governments to have a single cohesive disaster management system. This will make disaster management and the associated relief effort much more efficient. It will also allow regions that frequently experience natural disasters to better prepare themselves to deal with the disasters as and when they arise. The Sahana Project has inspired the concept of \u201chumanitarian-FOSS\u201d. This is a term coined to denote the application of FOSS to alleviate human suffering. Such a concept can be used to bring together many volunteers around the world to build and contribute to worthy FOSS projects that can benefit mankind. Background of Organization LSF is a non-profit foundation in Sri Lanka that encourages Sri Lankan software developers to participate in global FOSS projects. It sees FOSS as playing an important role in the development of the country by providing an opportunity for the local ICT industry to participate in the global ICT market. It believes that FOSS can reduce the cost of ownership of large-scale software deployments and play an important role in e-government solutions. To realize its mission, LSF nurtures the local FOSS software development environment to attract developers from local companies to participate in LSF FOSS projects. It does this by providing A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 57 Breaking Barriers the necessary physical, technical and financial resources to support FOSS developers as well as play a key role in the promotion and coordination of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2118a8a-51aa-47ba-bae9-63c7a6dd8409": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2118a8a-51aa-47ba-bae9-63c7a6dd8409", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Breaking Barriers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6700ac305f66b0b00c097e87c12ede2ceb7b37cbff4afa6c4567c8f40aa76dbd"}}, "hash": "6700ac305f66b0b00c097e87c12ede2ceb7b37cbff4afa6c4567c8f40aa76dbd", "text": "FOSS activities and projects in the country. It also promotes FOSS actively to the local universities so as to influence and attract the undergraduate students to FOSS. LSF is run solely on the support that it receives from its sponsors, which include commercial companies, international aid agencies, universities and individuals. This assistance may be in the form of financial assistance, equipment and infrastructural aids, services and human resources. The software developers in LSF consist of people seconded from various companies, contract staff, and industrial placement students. Objectives of Project Sahana is a disaster management system. It was created in the aftermath of the 26 December 2004 tsunami disaster that hit 12 countries in Asia bordering the Indian Ocean. Among the countries most severely affected by this disaster was Sri Lanka where nearly one million people were impacted. While help and relief poured in from all over the world, a disaster management system was needed to coordinate them and to maximize the impact on the affected people. As there was no software of this nature readily available, volunteers predominantly from the Sri Lankan ICT industry quickly put together the Sahana Disaster Management System over two or three weeks and it was officially used to track families and relief organizations during and after the tsunami crisis in Sri Lanka. The primary objectives of Sahana are to facilitate the management of missing people and disaster victims; manage and administer various organizations; manage camps; and manage requests and assistance in the proper distribution of resources. The system consists of a set of integrated web-based disaster management applications. The main applications and problems they address are: \u25cf Helping to reduce trauma by effectively finding missing persons; \u25cf Coordinating and balancing the distribution of relief organizations in the affected areas and connecting relief groups allowing them to operate as one; \u25cf Registering and tracking all incoming requests for support and relief up to fulfilment and helping donors connect to relief requirements; and \u25cf Tracking the location and numbers of victims in the various camps and temporary shelters set up all around the affected area. FOSS Application Description Sahana is a suite of web-based applications that provides management solutions and addresses different problems with regard to the information required for managing coordination problems in the aftermath of a disaster. It provides the four main solutions listed below. \u25cf Sahana Missing Person Registry \u2013 an online bulletin board of missing and found people. Information on the person seeking them is also captured, which adds to the chances of people finding each other; \u25cf Sahana Organization Registry \u2013 keeps track of all the relief organizations and civil society groups working in the disaster region. It captures not only the places where they are active, but also captures information on the range of services they are providing in each area; \u25cf Sahana Camps Registry \u2013 keeps track of the location of all the camps in the region and provides some basic data on the facilities they may have and the number of people in them. It also provides a GIS view to plot the location of the camps in the affected area; and The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 58 \u25cf Sahana Request Management System \u2013 a central online repository where all relief organizations, relief works, government agents and camps can effectively match requests of aid and supplies to pledges of support. It effectively looks like an online aid trading system tracking request to fulfilment. Choice of FOSS Very few countries and organizations (rich and poor alike) can afford to invest a lot of resources in disaster management when there is no disaster present because there are always higher priorities that need the funding. There are also few proprietary software applications for disaster management as practically and ethically it will be difficult to impose strict licensing terms during humanitarian disasters and times of crisis. A system built with FOSS and made available as FOSS can overcome these issues. FOSS development tools can be obtained free of charge and the FOSS software development model encourages worldwide volunteer and community involvement. With FOSS there need not be any delays in getting permission for a license as anyone has the freedom to download the software and use it. Also such systems should be developed and shared globally as the problems and needs they address are difficult for a country to deal with when a disaster strikes. The FOSS development and community mechanisms have a proven track record to build, distribute and maintain such global systems.

This is important as during such trying circumstances, tensions and problems can arise among the parties involved. As no two disasters are alike, often localizations and customizations are needed for the software before it can be applied effectively to a disaster. With FOSS, the code is available for anyone to quickly pick up and make the necessary customizations without restriction. Thus, it can be seen from the discussion above, a disaster management system developed and implemented as FOSS is very appropriate. It is possible to develop such systems at a much reduced cost compared to pure commercial development models. A small team is needed to drive such a project to ensure the quality of the product and this team can then be assisted by the global FOSS community to develop a good quality disaster management system. This is the working arrangement for the Sahana Project with a core team of six people assisted by a global community of over 60 participants and contributors. The FOSS community spirit, philosophy and mechanisms have been the key ingredients in the successful growth of such a vibrant community for Sahana. Development and Implementation The original Sahana system (now known as Sahana Phase 1) was put together immediately after the Asian tsunami disaster struck, amidst the chaos, by volunteers in Sri Lanka. Sahana Phase I was built as a collection of interconnected, yet independently usable, subsystems that interact with each other via a set of shared databases. The well-known FOSS LAMP solution stack was used as the platform to run these applications. The operating system used was Debian GNU/Linux, Apache was the web server, MySQL was the database, and the PHP or Java language was used to write the applications. Sahana Phase I components were built in a chaotic situation and were very much a hack for the requirement at hand. Following this initial development, the Sahana Project entered Phase II in August 2005. Sahana Phase II is also developed using the LAMP stack but it has a more structured development team and process. The Phase II model has a core team A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 59 Breaking Barriers ensuring the quality and stability of the Sahana releases surrounded by a developer community. This model is very similar to the development model for the Mozilla Firefox project. The core team of six people is sponsored by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency and overseen by LSF in Sri Lanka. Currently, the majority of development happens in Sri Lanka whilst a global community of over 60 persons contributes in various areas. The community includes emergency management experts, humanitarian consultants, academic and FOSS developers, all currently working together towards the success of the Sahana system. Formal support at the organization level currently comes from the IBM Crisis Team and LSF. Sahana will run on most popular operating platforms including GNU/Linux, xBSD, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows. Deployment At the time of writing, Sahana had been deployed to assist in the management of several disasters: \u25cf Sri Lanka tsunami disaster in 2004; \u25cf Pakistan earthquake disaster in 2005; \u25cf Philippines Guinsaugon landslide in 2006; and \u25cf Indonesian Yogjakarta earthquake in 2006. For the Sri Lanka tsunami disaster in 2004, Sahana was adopted by the Sri Lankan government as part of its official portal for the Centre of National Operations (CNO), the main government body in Sri Lanka coordinating the relief effort. An implementation of Sahana was deployed by CNO to help coordinate all the data being captured and at the end of its tenure it had captured data on over 32,000 families and most NGOs operating in the tsunami-affected region of Sri Lanka. For this deployment, the main Sahana components that were utilized were the Organization Registry and the Missing People Registry. The deployment model included distributed data entry of \u201cGramasevaka\u201d data and police data, and authorized volunteers were given access to upload the data into the system, coordinated by the universities. As the hardware resource requirements were low it was initially deployed on a standard desktop computer, but it was subsequently migrated to its own dedicated server. It was tested and found that it could also be deployed on a resource-limited equipment like a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) such as the iPAQ with OPIE (a GNU/Linux distribution supporting iPAQs) within 64 Mb of RAM. After the North Pakistan earthquake in 2005, the LSF Sahana team was invited to Pakistan by the IBM Crisis Team and IBM Pakistan.

Since Sahana Phase II was not ready yet, Phase I was deployed in Pakistan. To ease the deployment, a live CD was created based on the Taprobane distribution of GNU/Linux. In Pakistan, Sahana filled the gap of making the data from the government\u2019s people database accessible to the other organizations involved in the relief effort. This was needed as although the Pakistani National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) has built and maintained a comprehensive database on the people of Pakistan, access to this system is not web-based and it is under tight security control. LSF, IBM Pakistan and the IBM Crisis Team worked with NADRA to train their personnel on customizing Sahana for use. After that NADRA took ownership of integrating and deploying Sahana in Pakistan. Sahana was customized for use in the Guinsaugon landslide in the Philippines in March 2006. It was used to facilitate effective coordination and information-sharing among the National Disaster Coordinating Council member agencies, private sector and civil society groups involved in disaster response, relief and rehabilitation. The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 60 Sahana was deployed to assist with the management of the relief work following the earthquake in Yogjakarta, Indonesia in May 2006. The system was operated by the Indonesian Whitewater Association and the Indonesian Rescue Source, two organizations that undertook relief support work after the eathquake. Technical support was provided by the UrRemote22 group and the deployment was sponsored by the Communications Technologies Board of the Australian Computer Society. Impact In any disaster situation, getting the right information out to the correct parties is critical to alleviating human suffering and saving lives. Furthermore, for a national or international disaster, the scale of the operation will mean that in order to be able to account for each and every individual equally from their medical needs to reunification with family, to their relief supplies, a proper disaster management system like Sahana has to be put in place to help manage the data and information. The impact that Sahana has on the people in the regions and communities that suffered the disasters probably cannot be quantified with words in a document such as this. Through the disaster and relief management made possible by the Sahana system, relief effort was made more efficient and because of this, more lives were saved and the victims were able to have access to vital resources more quickly. The success of Sahana and its availability as FOSS means that for the first time it is possible to have a single cohesive disaster management system that international aid agencies and relief organizations as well as national governments can use. If this can be realized, it will make disaster management and the associated relief effort so much more efficient and beneficial for both givers and receivers alike. The Sahana Project has inspired the concept of \u201chumanitarian-FOSS\u201d which is effectively the application of FOSS to alleviate human suffering. This concept does not just apply to disaster management, but it extends to humanitarian ICT or any other ICT activity or product that concerns the improvement of human welfare. One major impact of this is that if such a concept is positioned and promoted properly there can be many volunteers flocking to build and contribute to such projects globally, as the FOSS community is well known for its strong beliefs and actions for the benefit of the community at large. Lessons Learned Based on the experiences in deploying Sahana in several disasters in Asia, the Sahana team has learned some valuable lessons. First and foremost, it is vitally important to get the system accepted and approved by authorized relief coordinators. This is to enable everyone to operate as one, using one dataset. There is no better way to do this than have the relief coordinators (usually from the government) authorize the deployment of a disaster management solution. The disaster management system should be built on open systems so that all relief groups can work together and the data contained within should be accessible to the parties involved. Sometimes problems can arise in which the government entity responsible for deploying the software is reluctant to share it with NGOs. Any disaster management portal that prevents access to NGOs or civil society or government is 22 The UrRemote initiative is based in the Electrical Engineering Department of Udayana Universiity, Bali in Indonesia, It attempts to provide opportunities for students to engage in research and development and gain experience by working remotely with overseas (mainly Australian) organizations. http://urremote.com/index.php?title=UrRemote.com:About", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4823b0e5-9f95-47e7-bfe8-0cd1c5dee463": {"__data__": {"id_": "4823b0e5-9f95-47e7-bfe8-0cd1c5dee463", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Breaking Barriers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9c7083fb2f833e2eb5b65fba8a891e94785dee2af9585efe7516cce1c9de7cd"}}, "hash": "d9c7083fb2f833e2eb5b65fba8a891e94785dee2af9585efe7516cce1c9de7cd", "text": "A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 61 Breaking Barriers a partial solution and will result in yet another parallel silo of data. The parallel silos of data tend to cause more confusion as no proper data consolidation can take place. The organization of dedicated teams to provide localization, customization and helpdesk services should be done immediately. Disaster environments have requirements and deadlines that are needed as soon as possible. Every disaster yields different requirements and no matter how well the system is built, there will always be urgent requirements on localization, customization and helpdesk application support. Thus, when deploying Sahana it is better to have a dedicated professional team to support it. It is also worthwhile setting up a helpdesk/call centre to help users become accustomed to the application and enter data on their behalf (especially in nations with low ICT literacy). The system has to be flexible enough to cater to the evolving granularity of data. This is because during the initial stages of the relief effort, there may not be enough time to be sifting through all the relief supplies coming in and working out the exact quantities of each package or box when people are starving and dying. However, later as operations are streamlined and things settle down, a smaller granularity to the data tracked can be introduced to improve the efficiency and transparency of aid distribution. The applications need to be built to be able to handle this sparseness of data at the initial stages. Current Status of Project As noted earlier, the Sahana system is being re- engineered and written to follow a more structured development process and team. Sahana Phase II still adheres to the LAMP platform but it is more generic in being able to handle any disaster scenario from a tsunami to an earthquake to a pandemic. The entire system is internationalized to allow easy localization to a particular country. Applications in Phase II conform to a base application framework making it easier to write a new disaster management component. It also caters to the integration of third party modules/sub- applications into it. Other features include better security features to protect privacy of data, the support of more operating systems and databases, adhering to existing emergency management and humanitarian data exchange standards and the support of pervasive technologies such as text messaging using mobile phones. Benefits and Challenges Many nations affected by natural disasters such as tsunamis, earthquakes and floods are often poor and so can ill-afford to spend money and resources to develop or purchase disaster management systems. This means that a system like Sahana, which can be obtained free-of- charge and be freely customized to suit local needs and circumstances, has tremendous benefits to these countries. The use of FOSS enables the local people to take over the system for further development and deployment based on their needs. The Sahana system has successfully helped the people in several national disasters. The project has brought good publicity to the Sri Lanka ICT community and its FOSS community in particular. With this positive image of FOSS, it is hoped that more organizations in the country, both commercial and academic, as well as the government can promote and support more FOSS projects both at the local and international levels. To ensure that a country is prepared to handle a disaster situation, it has to be in a state of preparedness and Sahana can help it achieve this. Towards this end, the Sahana team is working closely with NGOs, civil society groups and government bodies to pre-deploy Sahana The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 62 installations globally in order to improve adoption and disaster preparedness when the next large-scale disaster strikes. While the benefits from Sahana are obvious, it nevertheless faces challenges in its continual development and progress. It is essential that LSF receives adequate sponsorships and cooperation to be able to support the core Sahana development team. Without a dedicated team, it will be difficult to ensure the continuous development of the system. Other Information Sahana has gained a tremendous amount of recognition for the project and for the concepts it promotes. The project and the people associated with it have received numerous awards. The IBM Crisis Team proactively promotes the use of Sahana for disaster management. Conclusion The Sahana Disaster Management System from LSF has shown how ICT can play an important role in times of disasters to manage and coordinate the relief and humanitarian efforts.

ICT development and related capacity building are very important to the project. A key component of the project is GeoCMS24 which facilitates the collection and sharing of geographical data among the stakeholders in the project. The creation of this GeoCMS is a key innovative outcome of the project. As there was no suitable software available for a GeoCMS at the time the project started, a new GeoCMS application was developed from two existing FOSS applications, MapServer and Tikiwiki. The GeoCMS system has made it possible for the Pacific Island Countries to publish their geographical data for access and sharing over the Internet and open to contributions from all over the world. All this helps in the development and vulnerability reduction of these nations as important information can now be made available more easily as and when needed. The mapping and GeoCMS parts of the project have benefited from FOSS as they were built by enhancing and modifying existing FOSS applications. The use of FOSS makes it affordable and practical to build and deploy the GeoCMS application in every participating country. This in itself leads to local capacity building in ICT and the local recipients are able to learn and understand the technology. The development of local content is facilitated as people contribute towards the information in the maps which are made available to all. The GeoCMS software application is currently still being enhanced and new features are being added. The main project is at its midpoint stage currently, with deployment actively taking place in the participating countries. Background of Organization SOPAC is an inter-governmental, regional organization providing services to promote sustainable development in the Pacific Island Countries that it serves. In particular, it provides assistance, through its Secretariat based in Suva, Fiji, to its member countries in three key programme areas: Ocean and Islands, Community Lifelines and Community Risk. To effectively provide these support services, SOPAC maintains an information technology unit, provides publication and library services, and offers technical and field services for specific project work.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed28b6d7-1964-472a-86fd-f670261ba434": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed28b6d7-1964-472a-86fd-f670261ba434", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Breaking Barriers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03036cc2cdffbefb690ad8a534070bd53b139fbc15540ac2ac2dea29f960452a"}, "2": {"node_id": "f5ec4f48-e9b8-4c48-a5cb-3215e0e6817a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "685d6480e53fc1a0fbbe477d96b2d9853323ad314c62dbc54f6e57e7ea9a0df4"}}, "hash": "e1a03d1d4fee5088ae1397f6e7ee476b83a614133b9159d99711f97d174b14cc", "text": "Member countries of SOPAC include Australia, Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Guam, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.

Objectives of Project The project seeks to reduce vulnerabilities and provide better decision-making in 14 of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP)25 through the development of an integrated planning and management system. The participating countries in this EU-funded project are the Pacific Island Countries of Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. The project concentrates on three key focal areas in the island system: \u25cf Hazard mitigation and risk assessment; \u25cf Aggregates for construction; and \u25cf Water resources supply and sanitation. The project addresses problems such as: unavailability of accurate and timely data; weak human resource base; limited resources (financial and infrastructural); and lack of appropriate management plans, and policies and regulatory frameworks to deal with these three focal areas. It is implemented using the Island System Management (ISM) approach, in which issues of environmental management, and social and economic development are tackled for a \u2018whole island\u2019 or by sub-systems within an island. ISM facilitates the integration of ecosystems, and economic and social issues with an enabling institutional framework. The main constraint to the successful application of ISM is the access to information. As such, ICT development and related capacity building are very important to the project and a fourth project activity and deliverable is in the ICT area. This activity cuts across the three focal sectors. Ongoing ICT activities include: \u25cf Training in GIS and Remote Sensing and its applications for planning; \u25cf Setting up of ICT networks, including a GeoCMS, in each of the 14 participating countries, to enable sharing of information/ resources and promote awareness; and \u25cf Providing spatial data and information for sound planning. The project has five key objectives and outcomes: \u25cf Sustainable development of coastal zones, in particular through identifying alternative sources of aggregates; \u25cf Improved planning practices installed for safe and adequate water supplies and sanitation systems; \u25cf Implementation of comprehensive hazard and risk management tools within the framework of an Integrated Holistic Approach for Sustainable Development \u2013 ISM; \u25cf ISM infrastructure established and in use in each country; and \u25cf Strengthened capacity of the Pacific ACP States. The main beneficiaries of the project are the governments and decision makers of the 14 Pacific ACP States. These include planners; land, water and marine management agencies; communities and villages of case study and The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 66 26 A wiki is a type of collaborative software that allows users to add, remove and edit the contents of a website very quickly and easily, sometimes without the need for registration.

FOSS Application Description To achieve the goal of vulnerability reduction and better decision-making, it was determined that a GeoCMS was needed to organize new and existing geographical information. There was no suitable software available at the time the project started and so a new FOSS application was developed by utilizing two existing FOSS applications \u2013 MapServer and Tikiwiki. MapServer is a development environment for building spatially-enabled Internet applications.

The user can zoom on a map, select which geographic layer to see and query any geographical object. The operating platform used is the Mandriva distribution of GNU/Linux. This distribution was selected as it is very easy to include the built application into the Mandriva distribution packages that will be maintained and included in the distribution. As a result, the Tikiwiki GeoCMS package is now fully integrated as part of Mandriva Linux, thereby helping to ensure the sustainability of the project. The project needs to gain a worldwide support base and not a Pacific Islands-only support base. Choice of FOSS Current commercial applications that provide mapping applications over the web are expensive, costing possibly several tens of thousands of US dollars. The cost of deploying such an application in every Pacific Island Country would have been prohibitive. Furthermore, it is important that the mapping service is located in the user-country itself to ensure capacity building and development of local content. While it is possible to put all of the maps on a single server located overseas, it would have brought little to the development of local expertise. At the time when the project started, there were no applications available that mixed the power of wikis with maps as this is a rather new concept. Development and Implementation FOSS provided all the tools needed to develop the GeoCMS application. Using MapServer to incorporate a \u201cMaps\u201d feature in Tikiwiki was something new that was developed in this project. The design considerations for the developed GeoCMS include ease of use, easy entry of metadata and other information via A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 67 Breaking Barriers wiki, and easy sharing and representation of geographical data. The Tikiwiki GeoCMS application system runs on Mandriva GNU/Linux. The MapServer and Tikiwiki software are needed for the application. Tikiwiki, in turn, requires the Apache web server, PHP scripting language and MySQL database server. Access to the GeoCMS is from a web browser. Deployment The developed GeoCMS application facilitates the collection and sharing of geographical data. This information is needed for decision-making and must be available to a wide range and class of stakeholders, governments, organizations, companies, and the general public. Currently there are eight systems deployed, with seven fully online. On completion of the project there will be a total of 15 systems deployed (including the GeoCMS in SOPAC) in 14 Pacific Island Countries. Impact The Tikiwiki GeoCMS application is a core component of the ISM system. By using the information sharing features of the GeoCMS, geographical data collected and created can be shared more easily amongst all the stakeholders. Only developed countries have published their geographical data over the web and made it available to the public. In many ways the Pacific Island Countries are more advanced in this domain than some developed countries. All this data helps the development of each nation by making crucial information available easily for access and sharing from all over the world. In the case of disasters, it helps to have information on the country before sending experts. It also helps people to gain knowledge of their local geography and develop curricula for schools. Some of the information from the GeoCMS is being used by universities in the Pacific Island Countries as an aid for lectures. Lessons Learned Several important lessons were learned from this project. To locate developers, the focus should be on the international FOSS community as there are not many local developers and the local FOSS community is not strong. In fact, it was found that it is very difficult to build a local FOSS community. Also, open systems instead of closed systems or \u201cblack boxes\u201d should be provided so that recipients of the system can learn and understand what is being provided and they should be given systems that they can financially support. Current Status of Project The Tikiwiki GeoCMS software application is an active FOSS project with enhancements and new features being added constantly. The main SOPAC/EU project is at its midpoint stage in the deployment of the GeoCMS in the participating countries. Benefits and Challenges The project benefited substantially from the use of FOSS in the development and deployment. In particular, the GeoCMS application benefited from the main MapServer and Tikiwiki projects. Other Information Interns from eight countries have been trained to take charge of maintaining and developing data sets on the GeoCMS, as well as train others in their respective countries.

In addition, the new \u201cMaps\u201d feature of Tikiwiki that was developed in this project will add to the usefulness of the original Tikiwiki and MapServer software. The ability of the developers in this project to easily build on the two established software to create the new GeoCMS application clearly shows the importance of having access to source code as well as the \u201cfreedom to modify and extend\u201d aspect of FOSS, as such development would have been very difficult if not impossible to achieve with proprietary software. The usage of FOSS in the development and deployment of the system has also resulted in ICT capacity building for the nations involved.

It is hoped that with better and easier access to the authorities in the local municipalities, there will be more transparency and the people will be encouraged to participate more in local affairs, thereby strengthening the democratic process in the region. FOSS is chosen as the vehicle to implement the project as the local municipalities in the region can ill-afford to pay for commercial proprietary software. Also with FOSS, an environment can be created whereby local resources are utilized to develop and support the applications benefiting the local economy. Popular FOSS software such as GNU/Linux operating system, OpenOffice.org, Mozilla Firefox and GIMP that have been localized are used for the users\u2019 desktops while the e-government web portal makes use of customized web applications running under the LAMP environment. The initiative may be considered as a pilot project to lay down the groundwork for further and wider implementation of FOSS at other levels, both in public administration (including the central and regional administrations) and in businesses. The project is also unique in the sense that it uses the public-private partnership model to benefit the local economies and preserve/ create local skills and capacities as it will provide business and employment opportunities in the participating municipalities. The direct impact of the project will be better partnerships and cooperation between local administrations and the local private sector, and better interaction between local administrations with their citizens. Indirect benefits will be better ICT and Internet awareness among the local people as well as the forging of FOSS skills and capacity building for skilled workers. The biggest challenge in the project was that many of the municipal employees had little or no computer literacy and thus, had to be trained starting with the very basic elements of operating a computer and using an application.

Through this project, awareness of the benefits of FOSS will also be highlighted. The primary target group comprises the authorities in the municipalities of south- eastern Europe, in particular, the Balkans region, that have limited budgets to purchase commercial software. A second target group is the citizens of the region who will be able to communicate more effectively and economically with the municipal authorities through the use of these e-government services and applications. The key partners of ISOC Bulgaria in the project are: \u25cf The Government of the Republic of Bulgaria (as represented by the local authorities in the Municipalities of Kardjali, Vratza, Mezdra, Peshtera, Belovo, Dryanovo, Kostenetz); \u25cf \u2018Interspace\u2019 Media and Art Centre, the main consultant on the FOSS Project; \u25cf UNDP Bulgaria, which provided overall support during the implementation of the project, including management issues; \u25cf UNDP New York, which funded the project under the \u201cCapacity development through knowledge sharing and development: Free/ open source software for developing countries\u201d initiative; and \u25cf United Nations Office for Project Services, an implementing partner. Other partners include UNDP in Macedonia and Kosovo, the Bulgarian Linux community and the Internet Societies in the participating European countries. These organizations provided support for various activities under the project. FOSS Application Description The primary FOSS applications used in the project are divided in two major groups: \u25cf Existing available FOSS applications; and \u25cf New applications for the e-government portal. The main applications in the first group are: GNU/Linux operating system, OpenOffice.org suite of office applications, Mozilla Firefox web browser and the GIMP graphics software. The GNU/Linux system used is a Bulgarian distribution (based on the Debian distribution), named Interspace Linux Distribution (ISLD). The ISLD system is a localized system that has been successfully used in another project in which it was installed and supported in more than 60 Bulgarian NGOs. It is designed especially for end users who are migrating from other operating systems (Microsoft Windows mainly) and who need to be able to quickly start working effectively with a new system. The GNOME desktop of this distribution has been fully localized for the Bulgarian language and almost fully localized for the Albanian, Macedonian and Turkish languages. It is thus very suitable for use in the region where the project is implemented. The second group of applications come under the e-government web portal services and applications. These are developed to provide interactive communication between the government and citizens. The web services applications are developed to operate on the LAMP stack of GNU/Linux operating system, Apache web server, MySQL database and the PHP scripting language. A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 71 Breaking Barriers Choice of FOSS In the Balkans region, the e-government solutions developed by the central administration are not applicable in most of the cases at the municipal level. In addition, the municipalities in the Balkans region do not have the funds to buy the latest computer hardware or pay for commercial proprietary software, hence FOSS is a natural choice for the project as it can be deployed on older computers and is available without licensing fees. The use of FOSS provides an opportunity to demonstrate that local e-government initiatives can be more efficient and cost-effective if FOSS is used instead of proprietary software. Furthermore, the FOSS environment encourages the training and usage of local experts to support the project, thereby contributing towards enhancing the skills of the people. For the commonly used desktop applications, FOSS is chosen as localized versions for the various states in the region exist. Another advantage of using FOSS is that it is very easy to have several localized versions of the desktop co- existing in the same installation. And last, but not least, the Balkan countries have a high incidence of unlicensed software usage, and using FOSS will help reduce this problem. Development and Implementation All applications, both existing and newly developed, had to be localized. This is a requirement as most of the countries participating in the project require localized products for use in their public administrations. The design of the e-government portal and applications follows the general guiding principle that they are meant to be deployed in many types of different municipalities and so they should be open and flexible enough for easy customization to suit the needs of an individual municipality.

The web services applications were developed using PHP and made available on the Internet by Apache web servers running on GNU/Linux operating systems. Data were stored in MySQL databases. The ISLD Linux distribution implemented for the users contains only the necessary packages for simple usage; in particular there were no multimedia and games packages installed as these were considered irrelevant to the needs of the municipality. This also resulted in less demanding hardware requirements making it possible to use older computers. This ISLD distribution is suitable for the needs of the project as it has already been tested for use in over 60 NGOs, including ISOC Bulgaria. Local experts are available to support it and package repositories are available as well. Specific hardware was not bought or installed during the project because the main goal was to use already existing infrastructure and build over it to demonstrate the advantages and flexibility of FOSS solutions. Deployment The deployment at most participating municipalities followed the main steps below: \u25cf Linux was installed for desktop usage as dual boot on users\u2019 computers that needed The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 72 to work in a Microsoft Windows environment. The set-up for these Linux computers was such that they were able to connect to a Microsoft Windows network on the LAN; \u25cf OpenOffice.org was installed on every workstation. Mozilla Firefox was installed on every workstation with connection to the LAN and/or Internet. GIMP was installed on every workstation that had the minimum hardware requirements; and \u25cf The web services portal was installed on a web server that either belonged to the municipality or to ISOC Bulgaria. In order to ensure the usage of the Linux-based PCs, special training was provided to users in which the benefits of using FOSS and Linux were highlighted. The project was deployed in nine municipalities from the Balkans region \u2013 Kardjali, Vratza, Mezdra, Peshtera, Belovo, Dryanovo and Kostenetz (in Bulgaria); Gevgelija (in Macedonia); and Klina (in Kosovo). OpenOffice.org and Mozilla Firefox were installed on 200 workstations and these represented between 50 to 100 percent of the workstations in each of the municipality that took part in the project. Linux was installed on 45 client workstations, representing between 16 to 25 percent of the workstations in each municipality (depending on its size). The web services portal was installed in four municipalities \u2013 Kardjali, Vratza, Mezdra and Peshtera. The portal for Kardjali was hosted on the ISOC Bulgaria server while the rest used their own municipal servers. Impact The project offers fully functional e-government services that can be implemented at a low cost because they are developed using FOSS. Before this project there were no freely available e-government applications that could be replicated at little or no cost in other administrations. The web services portal allows easy and cheap distribution in all municipalities that are interested in using it. In addition, it is easily customizable, both in terms of web interface and functionality, and is multilingual. The project provides a platform for cooperation between the local administrations and business sectors (in particular the local ICT businesses) as well as NGOs. This is because these organizations and companies are called upon to support the FOSS software used by providing services such as migration and training, as well as to customize the applications or develop new ones. This results in enhanced local cooperation at the business level, as well as raised level of local information technology skills. Another important impact is increased transparency in the work of the municipal authorities as the availability of the e-government services facilitates people- government interaction. This should result in less corruption at the municipal level. Although the project involved only nine municipalities, over 20 municipalities expressed interest in taking part but the project budget did not allow for their inclusion. This indicates that if it were possible to extend the project and more funds were available, the impact will be much greater. Lessons Learned Several important lessons were learned from this project. They are summarized and discussed below. \u25cf For the success of FOSS initiatives and projects, it is important that adequate policy and legislation be developed for them, as without political support the processes will be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04762a5b-fbc4-4cb1-b0d0-27d212ff1848": {"__data__": {"id_": "04762a5b-fbc4-4cb1-b0d0-27d212ff1848", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Breaking Barriers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "490867521770d9502c7df3969291b4a963ea5e31b673b3c61ec27206531cf34c"}}, "hash": "490867521770d9502c7df3969291b4a963ea5e31b673b3c61ec27206531cf34c", "text": "hindered and adoption rate decreased; A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 73 Breaking Barriers \u25cf The low level of computer literacy among the older municipal employees can be a serious problem, due to the lack of understanding of the benefits from the migration. It has been recommended that meetings are held with this group of people at the initial stage followed by relevant training. After that, if it is possible, they should undergo testing and certification; \u25cf In general, after the training, certification should be carried out. People will be much more motivated to use software for which they have an official certificate; \u25cf Public awareness is very important for the implementation of the project. Media coverage of the activities and the work done is also important; \u25cf Collaborative work with the local and international FOSS-supporting organizations should be carried out; \u25cf The development and implementation of the FOSS project should not be limited strictly to the initially planned outputs. If there is an opportunity to widen the impact of the project, or there are important functionalities that can be embedded in the developed tools and applications, this should be supported without hesitation; and \u25cf A mechanism for fund raising should be developed for the project. Current Status of Project The project is in its last phase and work is ongoing in the neighbouring countries on promoting the project. The initiative has also been extended to the Municipality of Bahchelievler in Istanbul, Turkey, upon request by the municipality authorities there. Statistics on the usage of the web services portal in Kardjali and Vratza showed a much higher interest from the citizens in comparison to other similar websites running in other municipalities in Bulgaria. This is a sign that the e-government project has been successful among the targeted citizens. Another important task that had been accomplished is the development of additional e-government services that support digital signatures for the portal of the Kardjali Municipality. Benefits and Challenges The usage of FOSS addresses a key problem faced by the municipalities from the south-east European region regarding ICT \u2013 that is the lack of funds to buy hardware and legal software. On the one hand, the municipalities are obliged to use licensed and localized software but, on the other hand, they have no suitable hardware to use it on. FOSS helps to deal with these problems in a very elegant and efficient manner. First, it deals with the localization problem because large teams and communities exist in the region to translate the end-user software, and to keep the latest versions available under the country\u2019s official language. FOSS also allows the end users and the administrations to possess legal products that can run on slower hardware configurations. The e-government solutions currently available are mainly designed for the central administration only and are not applicable at the local level. These solutions require the end users to install specific proprietary software in order to use the governmental services, and to have the latest versions of proprietary software in order to send documents to the government electronically. The implementation of the e-government services using FOSS overcomes this problem. The administrations can use up-to- date software at almost no cost. Support can be obtained in a more cost-effective manner from the FOSS community or from local organizations/ companies, and local people can be trained to perform the support. The municipalities can also customize the software they are using, keeping them current and without having to upgrade their hardware. As end users require only a web The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 74 browser to access the e-government services, they can easily do this from their FOSS desktop without having to install any special software. All this will enable a significant improvement in the manner of communication between local authorities and the citizens, which will result in better quality of services and confidence in the authorities. The biggest challenge in the project was that many of the municipal employees had little or no computer literacy and so they had to be trained not only on how to work with a new operating system or program but also to be trained in the basics. Surprisingly, there was resistance initially from the employees to working in a localized interface. It turned out that when they were working in the non-localized environment previously, as they did not understand the language, they learned the computer operations by heart while working with a specific software. With the new localized interface, since the software used was not the same, the majority did not know", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bdc9165f-de90-47df-b745-6dd647874a50": {"__data__": {"id_": "bdc9165f-de90-47df-b745-6dd647874a50", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Breaking Barriers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "120dbcdfcba020d0137e14b2be2b3372a60c324a1075851fbc38b912b5dba328"}, "3": {"node_id": "dc3cbbee-4b3e-4a02-8577-7119fb875a85", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c42f541bb102ef4a90c0c7a3075e03e4a86ef1bb5baccc183202cf8938771ce4"}}, "hash": "bd41e4e9e6ba9035a155c5649c4b0090305fb1a30274c75e9e7de2d9f711b622", "text": "how to work with the programs, although they were able to understand the meaning of the commands and options. Other Information As a result of the positive experience from this project, ISOC Bulgaria is continuing its work to popularize the usage of FOSS, especially in public administration. It is actively involved in initiatives that make use of FOSS to implement ICT and Internet solutions for interaction among the local authorities, SMEs and the people. Conclusion e-Government services for several of the municipalities in south-eastern Europe have been successfully implemented using FOSS tools and applications. The use of FOSS has resulted in a fully functional e-government web portal that can be implemented at a low cost and can be freely replicated in other municipalities. This will enable better interaction and communication between the authorities in the municipalities and the people. The availability of localized versions of FOSS allows end users and the administrations, which have a constrained budget, to possess legal products that can run on slower hardware configurations. The project has also provided a platform for cooperation between local administrations and business sectors, as the latter can be utilized to support FOSS in various ways. This will contribute towards the capacity building process for skilled ICT workers in the region. From all these considerations it can be seen that the project has benefited the local communities politically, socially and economically.

To meet this ambitious objective, it has embarked on a series of programmes in Extremadura to introduce ICT to the people, as well as to inculcate ICT usage in educational, social and economic activities. These programmes include the Education Technology Network that provides one computer for every two pupils in the schools; the Digital Literacy Plan, which is an initiative to train the adult population in ICT; and Vivernet, the business incubator, that promotes ICT to SMEs. In addition, it has also placed computers and increased their use in the regional ministries. FOSS is chosen as the vehicle and enabler for all this to take place for economic, social, political and technical reasons. As the Extremadura government expects to place many computers in schools, government offices and public places, it would be prohibitively expensive if it has to pay software licensing fees. In addition, in order to make the computer useful, friendly and familiar to the local people, it has to be able to customize the operating environment to the needs of the various targeted communities and to reflect local culture and language. The freedom to adopt, adapt and modify the software to suit its needs is paramount to the government\u2019s initiative. The Regional Government has created its own GNU/Linux distribution called gnuLinEx (or Linex), to serve as the main ICT platform and operating environment. This is a localized Spanish- language Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution. There are specific versions of gnuLinEx adapted to specific needs and environment, e.g. gnuLinEx Edu for education, Linex Empresa for business and JuegaLinEx for games. The project has resulted in large numbers of computers being installed in schools and public sector organizations with an equally large number of users being exposed to ICT and gnuLinEx in particular. Apart from its sheer size, the Education Technology Network is unique in that, for the first time, a government body has initiated the development and deployment of software adapted to the needs of education and identified beforehand the needs of the education community.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc3cbbee-4b3e-4a02-8577-7119fb875a85": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc3cbbee-4b3e-4a02-8577-7119fb875a85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Breaking Barriers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "120dbcdfcba020d0137e14b2be2b3372a60c324a1075851fbc38b912b5dba328"}, "2": {"node_id": "bdc9165f-de90-47df-b745-6dd647874a50", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bd41e4e9e6ba9035a155c5649c4b0090305fb1a30274c75e9e7de2d9f711b622"}}, "hash": "c42f541bb102ef4a90c0c7a3075e03e4a86ef1bb5baccc183202cf8938771ce4", "text": "This is done with a clear objective to provide technological literacy within the framework of a technological network.

Inculcating ICT Usage in Educational, Social and Economic Activities Extremadura, Spain The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 76 Background of Organization Extremadura is an autonomous community29 of Spain. It is situated in the south-west of the country, bordering Portugal to the west and located in the centre of the triangle formed by Madrid, Seville and Lisbon. The size of the region is some 8.3 percent of the whole of Spain and 2.6 percent of the Spanish population lives here. The economy of Extremadura has progressed steadily over the last few years and making use of the EU Communitary Cohesion Funds, the Regional Government of Extremadura has initiated several education, social and business projects involving ICT technologies. The Government of Extremadura is a firm proponent of FOSS and it hopes to bring the people of the region into the information age using FOSS. Objectives of Project In 1998, the Government of Extremadura announced that it was committed to transforming Extremadura into an information society and promised connectivity and digital literacy to every citizen. It launched the Global Project for the Development of the Information Society that was aimed at promoting the usage of ICT among citizens, which would result in an improvement of the quality of life. In order to realize the objectives of this project, the government needed to use software over which it had complete control and FOSS was chosen. The government supported the creation of a version of the GNU/Linux operating system, called gnuLinEx that was not only adapted to the local language (other Spanish Linux versions already existed) but also to the local culture. With such extensive localization, it is hoped that the local people without any previous computer experience can learn and use gnuLinEx quickly. There are two primary objectives in creating gnuLinEx: \u25cf To contribute towards the development of the Education Technology Network with a target of providing one computer for every two students in all the schools in the region; and \u25cf To disseminate FOSS in Extremadura through various other programmes and the administration itself. In summary, the main objective of the Extremadura project is to utilize FOSS and, in particular, gnuLinEx, as an enabling vehicle to bring the people of the region into the information age. The primary target group of the project is the population of Extremadura. Several public and private organizations and NGOs are working together on ICT programmes and initiatives in order to realize the ambitions of the Extremadura project. Some of these are: \u25cf The Regional Government of Extremadura, through the Regional Ministry of Education and the support of the Regional Minister of Infrastructures and Technological Development, is responsible for the Education Technology Network; \u25cf The Foundation for the Development of Science and Technology in Extremadura, has a central role in the economic, structural and innovation strategy development of Extremadura. It has several programmes running under it; 29 The 1978 Spanish constitution divided Spain into autonomous communities, or comunidades aut\u00f3nomas. These autonomous communities have wide legislative and executive autonomy, with their own parliaments and regional governments. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_communities_of_Spain A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 77 Breaking Barriers \u25cf The Centre of New Initiatives is involved in the support of the Education Technology Network as well as the development of the Linex Centre; \u25cf Vivernet (Business Centres for New Technologies) is involved in promoting FOSS and gnuLinEx to SMEs in Extremadura; and \u25cf The Digital Literacy Plan in Extremadura is an initiative of the Regional Government of Extremadura and the Regional Association of Popular Universities. Together with town councils and other entities, this programme is promoting New Knowledge Centres for the training of the adult population in ICT. FOSS Application Description gnuLinEx is based on the Debian distribution of GNU/Linux. When it was first created, gnuLinEx was based on Debian distribution 2.2. The latest gnuLinEx that has been released, gnuLinEx2006, is based on Debian 3.1. The basic gnuLinEx includes the GNOME desktop environment, the OpenOffice.org office application suite, Mozilla and X-Chat Internet applications as well as multimedia players like XMMS, Xine, etc. The distribution packaged for educational use, gnuLinEx Edu, makes use of the basic gnuLinEx and adds several specific FOSS education applications onto it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04c502dd-9272-480f-9608-800c9c9de290": {"__data__": {"id_": "04c502dd-9272-480f-9608-800c9c9de290", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Breaking Barriers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1255b6f2b17088080cd8af0da4e0219dcc45a45bd41c2e043a882f744a8114c9"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2561d5a-3e98-4964-bbad-7b81982a6056", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18a64f6e2730d1520f27ea4afbb022406a4a2291f297ccc762ef6a6f606346c4"}}, "hash": "615db9f983f16a0f490943d90a8242faf3e0c2225616f4cd870f8071c7dba2d2", "text": "This education distribution makes use of the Squeak30 platform for developing and running education software.

This distribution is widely used in the business sector of Extremadura and it contains FOSS business software catered to SMEs and large corporations. Choice of FOSS One of the main reasons FOSS was chosen was because of the long-term cost savings it can provide. The Education Technology Network alone involves providing a minimum of 70,000 desktops in the initial stage and software licensing costs will be prohibitive. The ability to freely adopt, adapt and modify the various packages in the GNU/Linux distribution to suit a particular environment is also very important. The chosen software platform has to be fully customizable and scalable, and adaptable to local culture and language. The technical merits of GNU/Linux in being able to provide a secure and network- ready development and application platform are also important considerations. With the use of FOSS, the local software industry will benefit too, as it will be needed to support and enhance gnuLinEx and support the users. Debian GNU/Linux was chosen as the distribution to base gnuLinEx on as it is a community-driven distribution; the Regional Government of Extremadura, being a public body, wanted to be independent of any commercial vendor. Development and Implementation The basic gnuLinEx is targeted at equipping an end user, with little computer knowledge, with office software and communications tools (e-mail and web browsers). It is simple to install and configure and this Spanish language version of GNU/Linux has been 30 Squeak is a FOSS implementation of Smalltalk with powerful multimedia facilities. It has been used in a wide range of software projects, ranging from educational platforms to commercial web applications. http://www.squeak.org/About/ The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 78 modified so that the user can be familiar culturally when using it. Consequently, icons and names of programmes refer to the regional culture. There are specific versions of gnuLinEx adapted to specific needs and environment, e.g. gnuLinEx Edu for education, Linex Empresa for business and JuegaLinEx for games. FOSS applications, including gnuLinEx, have been adopted on a large scale by the entire public sector. Over 10,000 desktops in public administration use it, as well as over 80,000 desktops in schools. An average implementation in a secondary school will involve an average of 500 computers for the students, plus at least another 100 computers for the staff and teachers; in addition there will be at least one central server and many other hardware peripherals such as printers, digital cameras and scanners. Deployment The deployment in schools targeted one computer for every two pupils, and these computers are all connected together to the Education Technology Network resulting in a network of more than 80,000 computers, all running gnuLinEx. During the year 2002-2003, gnuLinEx was installed and used by 16 new secondary schools. This was expanded in 2003- 2004 to all the schools in the region. A server capable of managing more than 500 computers as well as supporting remote management is installed in every state secondary school. The size of this project has made it possible for the region to sign an agreement of collaboration with the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The scientists there intend to use the huge computing capacity available from the 80,000 computers of the Education Technology Network that lie idle at night for scientific computing work. Apart from the schools, the different regional ministries, such as the Regional Ministry of Culture, the Regional Ministry of Education and the Regional Ministry on Infrastructure and Technological Development, are also using FOSS, with more than 70,000 computers installed with gnuLinEx and FOSS applications. Other public institutions and/or organizations that have FOSS solutions deployed include the Health and Care System of Extremadura (the JARA project), the public libraries of Extremadura and the technical inspection of vehicles (ITVs) . Impact The Extremadura project centres around the creation of a localized, customized distribution of GNU/Linux, and its deployment as the main component in the Regional Government\u2019s ICT programmes and initiatives. The Regional Government makes extensive use of FOSS in its efforts to introduce computer literacy to its citizens and transform the region into an information society. The Education Technology Network shows how a government body can initiate the development and deployment of software adapted to the needs of the local end users and identify beforehand the needs of the educational community with a clear objective: to provide technological literacy within the framework of a technological network. This top- down strategy identified a tool, gnuLinEx, to implement the educational objective of providing one PC for two students in all the schools.

The introduction of PCs in the schools resulted in more than 80,000 computers being installed with gnuLinEx, with 183,000 pupils and 16,000 teachers using the software. The Digital Literacy Plan of Extremadura, a strategic and pioneering initiative to promote ICT to the society, has reached more than 820,000 users in A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 79 Breaking Barriers Extremadura. Over 70,000 desktops in public administration use gnuLinEx. In addition, the setting up of a public Internet access point and a public library in every village will make it possible for every person in Extremadura to participate in the information society through FOSS and gnuLinEx. The success of this project has attracted the interest of many other regions and organizations in Spain, as well as other countries in Latin America. The Extremadura experience has been shared with other European regions, aiming to promote the use of FOSS in public administrations. This experience is also being shared with some Asian countries. Lessons Learned The main lesson learned from this project is that FOSS can be a key enabler to bridge the digital divide and promote digital literacy to all the people, irrespective of their geographical, economic or cultural situation. This will enable all citizens to have access to and participate in the information society. To encourage this, a government needs to formulate policies that address the following: \u25cf Freedom of choice of software for the user as well as for the government; \u25cf Greater competition in the market place; \u25cf Ensuring the technological independence of the government; \u25cf Easier access by citizens, business and the government to technology and avoiding economic barriers; \u25cf Promotion and development of the local software industry so that it is capable of competing in areas traditionally dominated by foreign businesses; \u25cf Equipping local professionals with skills to compete in fields of software traditionally dominated by foreigners; \u25cf Preservation of information through the adoption of open standards; and \u25cf Usage and respect of local culture, practices and regional languages. From the Extremadura experience, it is found that to develop an ICT model based on FOSS that is sustainable, universal and fair, some key policy issues that should be considered are: \u25cf Accessibility for all; \u25cf Technological literacy for all; \u25cf Support to be given to entrepreneurs and businesses; \u25cf Initiation of the technological processes in educational sector; and \u25cf Continuous evaluation and adaptation of processes. Current Status of Project The Extremadura project is still in progress. It is exploring new areas to adopt FOSS solutions in the regional administration and collaborating with new partners and sharing the acquired knowledge with them. It is important, at this point, to create links and contacts among partners in order to foster innovation by sharing. This is one of the reasons for the founding of the Iberoamerican Network for Free Knowledge. On the software development side, gnuLinEx is continually being maintained and developed. gnuLinEx2006 was released on June 2006 and it has proven to be very popular. The usage of the business distribution, LinexEmpresa, among the SMEs of Extremadura continues to increase and it is now also gaining popularity with business users in Spain and Latin America. A new gnuLinEx distribution, targeted at NGOs and civil society, is being developed and will be made available in the near future. The status of some of the programmes is as follows: \u25cf The Education Technology Network is being implemented; The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 80 \u25cf New systems for the Health and Care Network of Extremadura (JARA project) are in the final stages; \u25cf Migration of the ITV systems is being finalized; and \u25cf New possibilities for e-government are being evaluated. Benefits and Challenges The political advantages in using FOSS are many and these have been addressed in the Lessons Learned section. The main benefits of deploying FOSS are that it provides an economical and affordable means to implement the ICT programmes of Extremadura and that it allows for the creation of a localized operating environment. In addition, the general benefits of quality, security, reliability and good support by the FOSS community are also important. The benefits of using FOSS in terms of direct savings and cost cutting in the mid to long term are unquestionable.

The biggest challenge to this project is that the Regional Government is the first administration in Europe to adopt the use of FOSS. As a pioneer in this area, it has to blaze its own trail and does not have the experience of other governments to fall back on or to learn from. Other disadvantages experienced include the cost of training and the reluctance of some users and organizations to use FOSS as they fear interoperability problems with proprietary software in use. In order to overcome the problem of interoperability, the Regional Government of Extremadura approved an agreement in July 2006 stating that electronic information generated must obligatorily use standard formats (OASIS Open Document Format and Portable Document Format). Overall, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages/inconveniences. Other Information There is a lot of global attention given to this project in spite of the fact that it started out as Awards and Recognition Received by Extremadura Several of the projects and/or people associated with Extremadura have received awards and recognition internationally. Below are some examples: The \u201cInnovative Actions in Europe\u2019s Regions and Cities\u201d prize in the category \u201cInformation Society\u201d was awarded by the European Commission to the gnuLinEx and the Information Society project in Extremadura in 2004. The \u201cMiguel Hern\u00e1ndez\u201d Award in 2004 was given to the Digital Literacy Plan of Extremadura by the Ministry for Education and Science of Spain, as recognition of the efforts to promote education accessibility to elderly people using ICT technologies. The \u201cRamon Lull National Prize on Informatics\u201d was awarded in 2005 to the Extremadura project for its efforts in the use and promotion of Free Software. A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 81 Breaking Barriers a regional project adopted to face the challenges of Extremadura. However, the situation in Extremadura has many similarities with other regions in Spain, Europe, the USA and the rest of the world. The project is recognized worldwide as a FOSS success story and has received numerous awards. Conclusion The Regional Government of Extremadura has demonstrated how FOSS can be utilized as the main vehicle to bring about ICT literacy and awareness to the people. The economic, social, political and technical benefits of FOSS are borne out clearly by the Extremadura experience, in particular, the customized and localized gnuLinEx and its deployment in over 80,000 computers for the education network. In spite of the initial reluctance and problems of some of the users and organizations and the fact that the government is a pioneer by being the first administration in Europe to adopt the use of FOSS, the project has progressed well. The success of the project has resulted in large numbers of people in Extremadura being exposed to ICT and FOSS and the region is well on its way towards the information society. For centuries, Extremadura has been the most underdeveloped region in Spain and it is overcoming its situation with the innovative use of ICT and FOSS. This model of Extremadura is transferable to other developing regions because of the similarities in the socio- economic framework.

Colnodo has been in operation for 13 years and it is able to generate its own income from the services it provides. This is unique as its customers are mainly organizations that are not well-off and it is a non-profit setup that does not depend on funding from donors. FOSS has been a key contributory factor to the success of Colnodo, as FOSS applications are able to provide all the important services required by Colnodo\u2019s customers and they are available without licensing fees. Background of Organization The Colombian Non-Governmental Organizations\u2019 Association for Communication via Electronic Mail (Asociaci\u00f3n Colombiana de Organizaciones No Gubernamentales para la Comunicaci\u00f3n V\u00eda Correo Electr\u00f3nico) or Colnodo was founded in 1993 by seven non- profit civil society organizations and is one of the first ISPs in Colombia. Colnodo provides a wide range of Internet services, including e-mail, discussion forums, online databases, web hosting, audio and video broadcast, and search engines to over 500 organizations in Colombia. It also facilitates the effective use of Internet technologies by these organizations to enable their projects to have a bigger impact on their target audience. Colnodo is the only non-profit ISP in Colombia. It has a full-time staff of about 15 members and several volunteers and contractors working in different projects. Its mission is to empower and support groups and individuals working for peace, human rights, development and protection of the environment, through the strategic use of the Internet. Colnodo is a member of the Association for Progressive Empowering Local Communities Colnodo, Colombia A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 83 Breaking Barriers Communications (APC) 31 and the Colombian National Confederation of NGOs. Objectives of Project Colnodo\u2019s main objective is to facilitate the communication and exchange of information and experiences among Colombian NGOs at the local, national and international levels. It supports the initiatives of grass-roots NGOs by providing ICT and Internet facilities and services to the people. Projects that have been carried out by Colnodo include Internet access to local communities, training in the strategic uses of the Internet for peace and conflict resolution, online education services, support for women networking online and the promotion of local services and content. Another major objective of the organization is the empowerment of local communities using the ActionApps CMS. This software is available as FOSS and with it Colnodo has been able to support many organizations in the effective publication of online information. The services offered by Colnodo are targeted at organizations that initiate projects that make strategic use of the Internet for development and allow people to have equal access to information. Some of the sites developed by Colnodo using ActionApps include: \u25cf Youth Information Network (http://www.rij.org.co); \u25cf Education for Peace Network (http://www.educacionparalapaz.org.co); \u25cf Good Practices to Solve Conflict (http:www.saliendodelcallejon.pnud.org.co); and \u25cf Sustainable Development Network (http://www.rds.org.co). During the development of Colnodo, several key partners such as the Sustainable Development Network, ISOC and APC were involved in building up the Colnodo network. Currently, in carrying out its mission, it is involved with various partners in ongoing projects. These partners include: Transparency for Colombia; Colombian Connectivity Agenda; the Development Gateway Foundation; and the Presidential Programme Youth Colombia. FOSS Application Description Most of the projects that Colnodo is involved with make use of ActionApps. This is a collaborative web publishing tool especially suited for NGOs and non-profit organizations. It is created by APC. ActionApps are publishing tools that plug into websites. In addition to publishing information, ActionApps allows the organization to create what it calls \u201cContent Pools\u201d to share articles with partner websites.

Choice of FOSS Most organizations served by Colnodo are NGOs and non-profit organizations that cannot afford to pay high prices for using proprietary software for the CMS and database. FOSS is used since it has been found to be able to meet all the requirements of Colnodo\u2019s clients and partners. Also, it will be very difficult to implement projects that are intended to be distributed freely and widely, e.g. Internet for Accountability and the Municipal Basic Information System. Development and Implementation Originally Colnodo used GNU/Linux as a platform to replace its old Bulletin Board Systems so that many more users can be supported. Subsequently, with the advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web, Colnodo started to provide web hosting and other Internet services to organizations so that they do not have to invest in too many resources to have a presence on the Internet. Colnodo also started to provide very specialized services such as online GIS, online broadcast of radio programmes and the creation of efficient and reliable search engines. The implementation of ActionApps enables Colnodo to offer its customers an affordable and easy means to manage their site content and to exchange information with other sites. Colnodo has developed complex information systems such as the Internet for Accountability System that allows municipalities to publish information to their communities online. To implement this project Colnodo developed a FOSS-based system to administer efficiently the set-up of the 460 sites that are under the system. The sites also provide tools that allow citizens to request for information and track their request online such as Really Simple Syndication (RSS)32 feeds and e-mail alerts. These tools provide information access to anyone irrespective of their physical limitations or the platforms they are using. In the Basic Municipality Environmental Information System, Colnodo developed an efficient system that correlates environmental information that is stored in the MySQL database with a GIS system and this information can be accessed by using mobile phones with Internet connectivity. Deployment Initially, Colnodo used very cheap IBM compatible machines for the servers, but in the last six or seven years, HP and Dell servers with hard disks arrays have been deployed so as to guarantee a reliable 24-hour operation. All of the servers run GNU/Linux while 70 percent of the desktops do so. Currently, Colnodo runs more than 150 sites. Most of them use ActionApps and FOSS tools to support the communities that access them and use their services. Most of the systems are accessed through the Internet. Communities are assisted to gain access through the telecentres and through local partners such as public schools and governmental A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 85 Breaking Barriers programmes. However, this is still a problem as less than 10 percent of Colombians have access to the Internet. In some cases, access to information is provided through the use of CDs. Colnodo is a self-sustaining, non-profit organization that is in existence for 13 years. It is only though the extensive use of FOSS that it is able to keep running its projects depending exclusively on its own income from the services it provides. Impact Colnodo serves more than 500 Colombian NGOs and non-profit organizations in projects that work for the betterment of humanity and the environment, and promote world peace. Its success will have a huge impact on the development and well-being of people everywhere and on the people of Colombia in particular. With the extensive use of FOSS, the tools and technology created can be more easily distributed and replicated to other developing countries. In particular, some of the projects served by Colnodo, like the Internet for Accountability, can have an enormous impact upon successful deployment as it allows the community to have access to the information that affects their lives. The extensive use of the ActionApps enables NGOs to share their news and information readily. A conducive environment for information exchange and discussion is made available and these organizations should be able to coordinate their activities better and cooperate on important social issues. Lessons Learned The success of Colnodo shows that FOSS", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ccd27db-9785-40b8-9f01-bf05360e98e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ccd27db-9785-40b8-9f01-bf05360e98e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Breaking Barriers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee31266db7ecf6518d9957b847630204cc55fcc0d51c694be661a125e6e9de85"}}, "hash": "ee31266db7ecf6518d9957b847630204cc55fcc0d51c694be661a125e6e9de85", "text": "applications can be used in developing countries. The lesson learned is that FOSS can make many of the projects in developing countries feasible as implementing them using proprietary software will be prohibitively expensive. FOSS can provide a chance for developing countries to make a difference and to allow them to participate globally in producing technology rather than just remain mere consumers of technology. Current Status of Project Colnodo is an ongoing endeavour. It is still providing Internet services to its customers and working with various parties on specific Internet social development projects, some of which have been mentioned in this book. Other activities in the future include the setting up of wireless networks in rural areas that will help connect isolated communities and the integration of Internet tools with mobile phones, e.g. text message alerts that can be sent from networks to prevent catastrophes. Benefits and Challenges FOSS has benefited Colnodo tremendously in that it depends on FOSS for the numerous services and benefits that it provides to the organizations working with it. These include the economic hosting and easy management of their websites and the provision of Internet services that are usually very expensive such as GIS systems, online multimedia services and efficient search engines for large databases. The ActionApps CMS solves many problems faced by the organizations that want to publish and exchange information in a cheap and easy fashion. With ActionApps, organizations have the power to publish and exchange information in a very efficient and easy way, allowing them to spend less time and resources in maintaining their sites. Using ActionApps, Colnodo can be competitive when compared with commercial ICT companies that charge high fees for the setting up and maintenance of websites. Colnodo found many advantages of using FOSS at the server level and did not experience any The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 86 real disadvantages. At the desktop level it experienced some compatibility issues with proprietary platforms, e.g. the compatibility between Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org. Also, for some desktop Linux distributions, there were difficulties in the support of certain hardware where there are no drivers available. A key challenge is the integration of mobile phones and Internet services. In Colombia there are many more mobile phone users than Internet users and so if it is possible to integrate these two services in an efficient way, many more people can be served. This situation is generally true in most developing countries. Other Information Listed below are some of the current important projects by various organizations working with Colnodo. \u25cf Internet for Accountability \u2013Transparency for Colombia (Transparencia por Colombia) and Colnodo recently donated their new software \u201cInternet for Accountability\u201d to the local municipalities. More than 400 municipalities will receive the software along with Internet access on the signing of a transparency and anti-corruption agreement. With this, the mayor\u2019s office in each municipality is encouraged to have its own website. This should promote transparency in the municipality and introduce accountability practices into the management of the municipal office. \u25cf Basic Municipality Environmental Information System \u2013 Colnodo developed, in coordination with the Ministry of Environment, Housing and Territorial Development and six governmental environmental organizations, a tool that allows these organizations and municipalities to publish their technical environmental data so that the information can be presented through a GIS. \u25cf Youth Network for Peace and Sharing \u2013 This project seeks to strengthen the values of vulnerable youths in the urban areas of Bogota through the use of ICT. Conclusion Colnodo has had great success providing ICT and Internet services and facilities to other non- profit organizations in Colombia so as to help them have a bigger impact with their activities. FOSS applications are used by Colnodo to provide its services. One of these, the ActionApps, is well suited for the NGOs served by Colnodo and with this they can publish and exchange information in an affordable and easy way. Colnodo has also developed complex information systems such as the Internet for Accountability System and the Basic Municipality Environmental Information System, as part of its mission to empower the people with information through the strategic use of ICT and the Internet. Colnodo is a self-sustaining organization that has been operating for 13 years without any funding from donors. This is probably not achievable without the use of FOSS as it is through FOSS that it is able to generate enough revenue from its services to support itself. Awards and Recognition Received by Colnodo Colnodo won a research award in 2000 from the Latin American Social Sciences Foundation (FLACSO) with a project entitled,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac6db8c1-fc52-42ae-9a34-cc78d04ccc44": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac6db8c1-fc52-42ae-9a34-cc78d04ccc44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.und
