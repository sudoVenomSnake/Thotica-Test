indicators, which are to be carried out over 20 years in the short term (three years), medium term (eight years) and long term (20 years). In Antioquia, multi-stakeholder dialogues were a key component of the ROAM process. Their outputs provided policy makers with options for strengthening territorial management. These options are informed by policy, legal and financial analyses, and many seek to build on initiatives already initiated by CORNARE.13 The ROAM process in Colombia also included a study of financial incentives for restoration as well as the identification and prioritisation of restoration opportunities in eastern Antioquia. Following the process, Grupo Argos S.A (a Colombian conglomerate with large investments in the cement and energy industries) and Celsia (Grupo Argos S.A\u2019s energy company, which owns hydro, thermal and wind power generation plants in Antioquia) financed pilot restoration projects in the six prioritised areas identified from the ROAM process. This form of FLR financing highlights both the potential for ROAM outputs to inform longer-term FLR initiatives and the importance of such initiatives being implemented through continued rights-holder and stakeholder engagement and monitoring, with accountability for social and environmental impacts. 4.2 Indonesia14 The ROAM process in Gorontalo, Sulawesi, Indonesia was initiated to assess mangrove FLR opportunities in a landscape where 5,304 hectares (out of an original 8,847 hectares) of mangrove forests had been converted to aquaculture ponds over the past two decades (see Table 4). The Tanjung Panjang Landscape includes a National Nature Reserve (TPNR) and a District-level Conservation Forest Management Unit (FMU-C), both of which had been illegally deforested for aquaculture use. The ROAM process included three phases: (1) planning and preparation; (2) data collection and analysis; and (3) results to recommendations. Phase 1 involved an inception workshop with 19 participants from 13 institutions, as well as an independent stakeholder analysis performed by the research team. Phase 2 involved field data collection, including stakeholder interviews, economic costs and benefits analysis and biophysical research to inform restoration opportunities mapping. The restoration opportunity mapping took place during a second workshop, attended by 42 participants representing 20 stakeholder groups from local government agencies, NGOs, the local fish farming community of Tanjung Panjang and academia.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fef5ca61-bce2-4bdd-a048-828b3cd289bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "fef5ca61-bce2-4bdd-a048-828b3cd289bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the integration of governance in forest landscape restoration opportunities assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca7b7dc2e81e159f0cab4b3c7ffd613ef9f35ad26216eaf15e8e2e2db7a63bee"}, "2": {"node_id": "f0ebb04d-daf3-40d1-bef8-1c9306e6a6ce", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c6aa9c4564b735c62668028f7f6edeb52bdad1e3a9cb81a20467d2722e7bc80"}}, "hash": "1ca967518abcb365e809f9ae2ea73f9e9b995b0c072a14e32840556565cb98ae", "text": "The participants were given information about the collected data, which they then used to collectively construct an historical timeline of mangrove restoration-related policy and governance in the landscape.

Phase 3 involved a validation workshop with 24 representatives from 14 institutions. During this workshop, the three restoration scenarios were adopted as phases of restoration. This phased approach was later ratified by the Provincial Planning Agency (BAPPEDA). Although the ROAM process resulted in consensus, clear concerns and barriers emerged during the process. The concerns became more evident once private sector funding was offered for the full restoration scenario, but was rejected by stakeholders for fear of inciting conflict or resulting in leakage.16 Stakeholders are currently interested in implementing phases 1 and 2, which would restore 2.5% and 15.9% of the deforested landscape, respectively. 4.3 Malawi17 In 2016, Malawi made a 4.5 million hectare national restoration commitment to the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100)18 and the Bonn Challenge (two million hectares by 2020 and 2.5 million hectares by 2030). Prior to their commitments, a pilot ROAM process was conducted in the Liwonde Forest Reserve by the Department of Forestry, USAID and WRI. Malawi then conducted a ROAM process in 2016 at both the national and local levels with support from IUCN, WRI and USAID. A multi-sector Task Force was organised to guide the process (see Table 5). 15 More recently, Presidential Instruction No. 120 (2020) defined supportive processes to enable realisation of this 2045 commitment, including a feasibility assessment, livelihoods support and improved governance to ensure conservation of restored mangroves. 16 Leakage in this context refers to the unanticipated increase in deforestation elsewhere. 17 Case background draws on ROAM report (Ministry of Natural Resources, Energy and Mining (MNREM) Malawi, 2017) and key informant interviews. 18 For more information, see https://afr100.org/. 14 Table 5.

The government aims to expand opportunities for investment in FLR over the long-term by creating enabling conditions for social enterprises, donors and investors. It also aims to meet its related international development and environmental commitments. These include commitments under AFR100, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs), e.g. the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) Land Degradation Neutrality Target, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Aichi Targets. In 2014, the Government of Rwanda, in partnership with IUCN and WRI, carried out a national forest restoration assessment using ROAM (see Table 6), in part to define how it would meet its commitment under the Bonn Challenge. The assessment identified forest restoration potential from expanding agroforestry (1,110,476 hectares), changing management in woodlots (255,930 hectares) and timber plantations (17,849 hectares), and restoring natural forests (13,933 hectares) and protected forests (128,191 hectares). The assessment report also noted a need for capacity building in the forestry sector, which had yet to fully recover from loss of knowledge and human resources due to the 1994 genocide (Ministry of Natural Resources\u2013Rwanda, 2014). The assessment showed that, for it to succeed, the strong FLR commitment from the government must be supported by an equally strong, coordinated effort by civil society, development partners and donors. The Rwanda ROAM process and its outputs have had a strong impact on FLR. For example, since 2015, they have directly informed IUCN FLR projects in the Eastern provinces (Clear Horizon Consulting, 2016) and influenced the execution of the GEF-funded Landscape Approach to Forest Restoration and Conservation (LAFREC) project, which commenced in January 2015 in the Gishwati-Mukura corridor and surrounding forest landscapes.24 22 BMU is Germany\u2019s Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety. 23 DFID was the UK\u2019s Department for International Development.

The aim is not to evaluate or compare these cases, each of which is a rich story in its own right. Rather, this section draws broad lessons from across the cases to inform the recommendations in Section 6. It also briefly introduces NRGF principles and criteria and their relevance for FLR and ROAM (see also Annex 1).25 Principle 1: Inclusive decision-making Relevance of principle In the NRGF, inclusive decision-making means that \u201cdecision-making regarding natural resource policies and practices is based on the full and effective participation of all relevant actors, with particular attention to the voice and inclusion of rights-holders and groups at risk of marginalization\u201d (Springer et", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6339fdff-5873-4a3c-a5fa-c933c59a9a2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "6339fdff-5873-4a3c-a5fa-c933c59a9a2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the integration of governance in forest landscape restoration opportunities assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a48fe18e30bbd2ffacb4388303624696c6c22e30e93612077c372ca9be2ef48"}, "3": {"node_id": "06aabece-117c-432f-a182-597e3d0cf40e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90c87a8e846f7ef6f5a2959932d8cce7fb700a7f33722058f8755fc101dc056d"}}, "hash": "0a6cda140d740fdca96fc01ffa68565f1a25955780acc54e69463f398b223153", "text": "al., 2021, p. v). The criteria for realising this principle include having legal and policy frameworks that mandate inclusion, as well as having socially and culturally appropriate processes that enable full and effective participation in practice. Inclusive decision-making requires, inter alia, rights holder and stakeholder capacity, access to information and appropriate support, as well as recognition and respect for the right to FPIC (Springer et al., 2021). Sustainable forest management practices and guidance acknowledge that inclusion is important for both ethical and practical (e.g. implementation facilitation) reasons (Ananda, 2007). Inclusive decision-making in FLR helps ensure legitimacy of interventions (van Oosten et al., 2019). When decisions to plant trees are made for political reasons and/or in a top-down manner, implementation may be hampered by a lack of funding, engagement or other obstacles (e.g. Wiegant et al., 2020). Participation in environmental decision- making is also a procedural right in itself and a key aspect of exercising other human rights. Inclusion means more than a \u2018seat at the table\u2019. It concerns who has (and who does not have) power and voice, and why. Where restoration is implemented at large scales, as with FLR, more rights-holders and stakeholders are involved, adding to the complexity of ensuring inclusive decision-making. Within FLR, it is therefore critically important to consider inequitable power relations in multi-stakeholder processes (Hjortso et al., 2005), such as in mangrove restoration (Thompson, 2018). Key findings Convening stakeholders and policy makers to identify restoration opportunities is central to ROAM processes. The cases show an overarching orientation towards inclusive stakeholder engagement. They also highlight challenges in enabling full and effective participation in practice. Convenors: ROAM processes are typically convened by governments and/or large national institutions (often in collaboration with international actors such as IUCN). It is less clear whether/how communities in the targeted landscapes are part of initial discussions. This is an area for further exploration. 25 While this section is structured as a principle-by-principle analysis, the principles are also inter-related and mutually reinforcing; some key interlinkages are noted. 17 Gender inclusiveness: Gender inclusiveness in ROAM processes varies. Gender mainstreaming in the Malawi assessment enabled considerable attention to gender roles and labour issues, particularly for women. The Malawi ROAM report suggests ways to improve women\u2019s inclusion and empowerment (MNREM Malawi, 2017). In Indonesia, the assessment (focused on negotiating between government and fish farmers) tried to encourage women\u2019s participation, but did not conduct a gender analysis, sensitisation or action-planning.26 Who is included? Who decides? Convenors typically decide which groups to invite based on stakeholder analysis and mapping. This analysis should be inclusive, well-informed and unbiased. In Indonesia, an independent organisation conducted additional stakeholder mapping to help ensure decisions were not made by any specific convenor. Rights-holders and stakeholders may also decline or limit their engagement. This choice should be respected, although it can also pose challenges and should prompt convenors to ask whether the process can be improved. For example, opportunity mapping in Indonesia could not resolve issues around fish farmers\u2019 livelihood requirements, in part because their direct participation was limited by their organisation\u2019s choice to send only two representatives, with positions prepared in advance. Furthermore, the Indonesian ministry responsible for natural resource law enforcement would not attend ROAM workshops, which eroded trust in the process and weakened the ability of people to hold the ministry accountable through the process.27 Representation: Inclusion in ROAM processes often involves representative rather than direct participation, e.g. having representatives from multiple communities in landscape-level processes (as in Colombia) or nested representation in national level processes (as in Rwanda). Ensuring trusted, self-determined representation is crucial \u2013 and often challenging.28 In Colombia, the assessment involved the junta de acci\u00f3n comunal, a community-level committee representing rural organisations.

This should include information about the process and its potential benefits, risks and limitations.29 Trust: Trust (and trustworthiness) are important factors in inclusion and other governance principles. For example, in Colombia, communities were understandably wary of another planning process and tool from the outside. The university played an important role in facilitating discussions, responding to communities\u2019 concerns about the ROAM process and highlighting potential benefits. Trust between these partners had grown over time, allowing the university to work closely with communities, including to share information. Questions from communities included whether restoring land would result in it being taken from them. Power dynamics and their impact on inclusion and voice: Power relationships influence who participates and how they participate. Not taking power dynamics into account in participatory processes can have unintended outcomes such as recognising some actors while inadvertently excluding others (Walters et al., 2019). Even in ostensibly inclusive processes, those with more power can easily have more influence on the 26 Notably, these assessments were planned before publication of the ROAM Gender Guidelines. Further, more recent ROAM training includes content on gender inclusion and responsiveness. 27 See Box 1 for more information about willingness of different groups to participate in this ROAM process. 28 This also relates closely to issues of appropriate institutional choice across scales, discussed under Principle 4. 29 Inclusion also requires that community members and other rights-holders and stakeholders know their rights (see Principle 10) and have space to effectively share their own learning and knowledge (see Principle 3). 18 process and its outcomes. For example, in Colombia, decisions about who to include in the ROAM process were largely made by one government institution, whose choices likely reflected historical and political factors. Murcia et al. (2016), in reviewing restoration projects in Colombia, found that the vast majority were designed and implemented by government agencies with little to no local stakeholder participation. In Indonesia, the assessment brought together numerous government, NGO and academic stakeholders. However, while community rights-holders and stakeholders were represented, direct community participation was limited (some communities chose not to participate due in part to lack of interest in the process and, as noted above, fish farmers opted to send only two representatives) and power dynamics limited community members\u2019 voice in the multi- stakeholder process. The main land users (fish farmers) settled in the protected areas in the last two decades and have no formal rights or decision-making power over the lands in question (see Box 1). Such limits to participation were later addressed through household interviews and qualitative content analysis (Brown, 2021) conducted to amplify the fish farmers\u2019 concerns that were not raised during multi-stakeholder meetings due to these power dynamics. Resources: The assessment in Malawi involved a district-level participatory process, including \u2018stocktaking\u2019 meetings with stakeholders in their localities, district level technical groups and mobilised communities. This was enabled by the availability of substantial funds. In contrast, in Colombia, while the ROAM process convenors\u2019 intention was to reach many local communities, in practice relatively few were represented, due in part to insufficient funds to support engagement. Beyond funding, meaningful participation requires appropriate skills (e.g. to facilitate effective and equitable multi-stakeholder processes), time (with some groups needing substantially more, including to meet in advance if they wish), and other resources. Inclusion beyond ROAM: ROAM processes often establish or strengthen multi-stakeholder platforms for FLR. For example, in Rwanda, partners established an inter-ministerial platform that interviewees felt enhanced FLR participation and coordination. One interviewee noted that there are now youth movements for FLR across the country and that extension workers proactively reach out to women to participate in FLR activities. Interviewees also indicated that the ROAM process strengthened inclusive decision-making regarding natural resource governance more generally by focusing on village residents\u2019 participation. These multi-stakeholder ROAM/FLR platforms provide the potential for sustained participation in FLR beyond the assessment period. There are also important considerations about the governance of these platforms, such as whether they build on existing institutions (versus creating new ones) and are accountable and inclusive, including of Indigenous peoples and local communities. In summary, participation is clearly central to ROAM processes. However, ensuring full and effective participation across levels is challenging. It requires commitment, power-sharing, facilitation skills, time and financial resources, and a deep understanding of the context, among others.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79e8e5b9-ef56-40b8-8454-630d26d32107": {"__data__": {"id_": "79e8e5b9-ef56-40b8-8454-630d26d32107", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the integration of governance in forest landscape restoration opportunities assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e2a5bed4ee9a2f878ed04102b2544312efff849dc11e46ddd8b133cd2a4c9ad"}, "2": {"node_id": "d74383fb-eb3f-4161-82ad-11298f5d1c80", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8582cc8333b54436ef61882b4bfbd585e1198c7762fa45d02d9aae80bc0bf862"}}, "hash": "1d31c9e85ff8e48e9662910fd10ccf32658f38e97d6854ebb3fbbb713b8664d3", "text": "More sharing of experiences and guidance on enabling full and effective participation in ROAM processes would be beneficial.

NRGF criteria concern, among others, the existence of laws/policies/rules, processes and capacities to recognise, respect and enforce land and resource rights (Springer et al., 2021, p. 7). As summarised by Larsen and Springer (2016, p. 5): \u201cTenure rights with regard to natural resources refer to the social relations and institutions governing access to and use of land and resources (von Benda-Beckmann, von Benda-Beckmann, and Wiber 2006). Tenure rights determine who is allowed to use which resources, in what way, for how long and under what conditions, as well as who is entitled to transfer rights to others and how (Larson 2012). Tenure rights are often described as a \u201cbundle of rights\u201d comprised of rights to access, use, manage, exclude others from, and alienate land and resources (Schlager and Ostrom 1992). Different rights in the bundle may be shared or divided in a number of ways and among stakeholders, along with the obligations and responsibilities associated with rights.\u201d Appropriately recognising and supporting Indigenous peoples\u2019 and local communities\u2019 collective rights to lands, territories, water and natural resources is crucial for equitable and effective biodiversity conservation, including in light of their contributions to global environmental sustainability (see Dawson et al., 2021; ICCA Consortium, 2021). In FLR, tenure is important with respect to land and territories, forests, trees and goods and services from the trees (Mansourian & Sgard, 2019). Secure and fair tenure rights are important to equitable and sustainable restoration (McLain et al., 2021; Nagendra, 2007), while insecure tenure and the inability to resolve tenure issues are barriers to effective and equitable FLR (Lovelock & Brown, 2020). Persistent challenges include insecure or unclear rights to trees and forests, insecure and/or inequitable rights for women, lack of statutory requirements for landholders to restore land, and conflicts over forest ecosystem services amongst communities, commercial concessions and governments (McLain et al., 2021). Key findings ROAM processes grapple with tenure in varying ways. Tenure security can be considered as a \u2018bottle neck\u2019 or \u2018success factor\u2019. However, tenure rights and systems are rarely addressed in depth. Scope of rights considered: Where tenure rights are addressed in ROAM processes, the focus is often (though not exclusively) on statutory land rights. For example, in Rwanda, the majority of people have title deeds because national policy requires all land to be registered. In line with this, both the ROAM process and the broader Rwanda FLR taskforce focus on respecting titled land rights. In Colombia, land tenure maps were used to help identify those with statutory land rights. These are important considerations. Recognising and respecting tenure rights also often goes beyond respecting land title deed. It involves recognising and appropriately supporting communal and individual statutory and customary rights over access, use and ownership of land and territories, water, trees and other natural resources. Respecting tenure rights requires understanding how tenure systems function in both law and practice (which may differ). Unrecognised or contested tenure: ROAM processes are often implemented in landscapes where tenure rights are unclear, unrecognised, contested, shifting or otherwise insecure. It is important in ROAM processes to understand the tenure systems in the landscape, including any concerns and grievances. For example, engaging only those who currently hold secure, statutory tenure may lead to inequitable results, e.g. by excluding people(s) whose rights are not appropriately recognised in that statutory system. At the same time, FLR initiatives must ensure respect for human rights, even where tenure is not secure. In Indonesia, analysis of the ROAM process highlights the challenge and importance of meaningfully including and addressing the 20 human rights and well-being of land-users who do not have recognised tenure rights, and are therefore vulnerable to bearing the costs of, but being excluded from the benefits of, restoration (see Box 1). In Colombia, resolving tenure questions was difficult in part because of historical challenges in the landscape, including widespread displacement and resettlement during the 50-year armed conflict.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91e795ca-03ff-4c6d-a804-f61cafdc2d20": {"__data__": {"id_": "91e795ca-03ff-4c6d-a804-f61cafdc2d20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the integration of governance in forest landscape restoration opportunities assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4bd0bd0da209a500521daac0c7a96ccc320628022d3d4238437d20a421a1dda"}, "2": {"node_id": "95db8efc-5c9e-4ba0-83dc-e7cde1d40e64", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c9310c855e4fe01a0d88aa6cbff423468d839d2781578521ebdf319ee4a3fc7"}}, "hash": "e80bc313f8763a32d357203a7d735a86eae202067490350e32301c4ade886bb0", "text": "A key question \u2013 and a hope of many stakeholders \u2013 was whether restoration could play a role in integrating people who had been displaced or who laid down their arms.

While tenure rights were not directly addressed in the Malawi assessment, they were touched on in the Diagnostic (e.g. as a barrier to restoration) and through work on community forests. The work on community forests aims to reduce pressure on nearby protected areas and bring resource use in community forests closer to users, especially women. While not specifically raised in the cases analysed here, many regions where FLR might be implemented are facing widespread land grabbing and mass migration. Tenure rights are dynamic and complex, but it is crucial that they are understood within ROAM processes and reflected in the restoration priorities identified. Enabling discussions on tenure: Even where the ROAM process cannot resolve tenure issues, understanding the challenges and (in appropriate ways) making them visible during the process can have additional benefits, such as opening or advancing dialogues among rights-holders and stakeholders. In Indonesia, while ROAM had little direct influence on tenure laws/policies, government authorities involved in the process considered increasing community access to some areas for sustainable use. In Rwanda, interviewees felt that the process strengthened recognition and respect for tenure rights, including in the FLR projects it informed. In summary, case analysis shows that ROAM processes frequently contend with tenure (and other inter- connected procedural and substantive rights), whether by default or design. More in-depth and systematic guidance and training on taking account of tenure, including to clearly identify customary and statutory rights and related concerns in the landscape, could enhance the ROAM process. This can, in turn, contribute to the effectiveness, equity and sustainability of the FLR initiatives identified and prioritised through the process. Box 1. Inclusion and voice in the context of contested tenure: reflections from the ROAM process in Tanjung Panjang by Benjamin Brown, PhD, Research Associate at Charles Darwin University Research Institute for Environment and Livelihoods and Co-Founder of Blue Forests (Yayasan Hutan Biru) The ROAM process in Indonesia demonstrates the importance and challenge of enabling full and effective participation of all rights-holders and stakeholders in the landscape, including those who lack formal or recognised tenure rights. Two communities lived in or used the Tanjung Panjang landscape on a subsistence basis prior to large- scale conversion of mangroves, which began in 2000. Terrestrial farmers from the Gorontaloan community lived in the area behind the mangrove forests, utilising the mangrove area only minimally, as the resources in the upper watershed and terrestrial area behind the coast and were rich and more easily accessible. Capture fishers from Bugis, Bajau, Siau and Gorontaloan suku (ethnic groups) living to the East or West of the Tanjung Panjang peninsula frequently fished the rich waters offshore from the mangroves, occasionally entering the forest for subsistence gathering of crab and molluscs. These traditional uses have continued but at a reduced level, as the mangrove forest has been degraded. It is important to remember that no community tenure (access, use) rights are recognised within the mangrove forests of the Strict Nature Reserve, which comprises half of the peninsula) and was gazetted in 1995. 21 Box 1 (continued) From 2000 to present day, 5,304 hectares of the original 8,847 hectares of mangrove forest across the entire District of Pohuwato were converted to brackish water aquaculture ponds. Most of the fish farmers working these ponds relocated from South Sulawesi, many settling and establishing fish farms in areas where they did not have formal land rights. Currently, up to 8,000 fish farmers and their families live in the area, integrated to some extent with the Gorontalo farming community. The median income of a fish farming household is US$ 14,074 per year (compared to US$ 2,880 average annual income for the province), posing a significant opportunity cost to mangrove restoration. During the stakeholder analysis to identify participants for the ROAM process, members of these three communities were interviewed to determine their degree of interest in the process and in mangrove FLR (MFLR).

Throughout the ROAM process, 42 participants representing 20 institutions attended three workshops: (1) introductory; (2) restoration opportunity mapping; and (3) validation. By the end of the workshop series, participant consensus was reached on a three-phase approach to MFLR totalling 113 hectares, 842 hectares and 2493 hectares of restoration respectively for each phase. This three-phase approach was adopted in Province of Gorontalo Spatial (RTRW) and Development Plans (RPJM) in 2018. Later in 2018, substantial private finance was offered to implement the three-phases of MFLR. However, at that stage, stakeholders rejected the financing offer over concerns of potential conflict and/or leakage (i.e. policy or practice change in one place that causes unanticipated increase in deforestation in other places) if MFLR were implemented. Noting that power inequities in the multi-stakeholder forums may have inhibited fish farmers and other stakeholders from sharing their true concerns, 22 interviews were carried out with fish farmer households and extension workers, and qualitative content analysis (Erlingsson & Brysiewicz, 2017) was performed to uncover latent themes that did not emerge during ROAM workshops. Based on the themes uncovered during these interviews, as well as discussions in the ROAM meetings, five socio-economic concerns with MFLR were identified: (1) issues around the legality of providing compensation to those considered to be \u201cillegal\u201d land users; (2) the expressed desire of fish farmers to continue farming for five to 20 years; (3) lack of fish farmer access to future benefits from MFLR; (4) lack of viable commensurate livelihood alternatives in the landscape, due to lack of land ownership/tenure by current land users (fish farmers); and (5) concerns about conflict being exacerbated if MFLR were to proceed. In addition to these major themes, 16 social, economic and political barriers were identified that inhibited or restricted MFLR. In summary, this case highlights the challenge and importance of ensuring that the ROAM process meaningfully includes and addresses the human rights and well-being of land-users who do not have recognised tenure rights, and are therefore vulnerable to bearing the costs of, but being excluded from, the benefits of restoration. These are not \u2018outlier\u2019 cases; they are common in deforested and degraded landscapes, and as such warrant attention in ROAM guidance and processes. 22 Principle 3: Recognition of and respect for diverse cultures, knowledge and institutions Relevance of principle Recognition of and respect for diverse cultures, knowledge and institutions calls for \u201cnatural resource governance\u2026 grounded in sound and diverse forms of knowledge and respect for diverse cultures, values and practices\u201d. It speaks to the importance of governance arrangements that respect cultural rights and enable people to contribute their diverse knowledge, innovation and capacity to sustaining nature, including through their own institutions and systems30 (Springer et al., 2021). Despite the importance of culture, Wehi and Lord (2017) find that it is rare to incorporate cultural practices in restoration. Indigenous and local knowledge systems remain underrepresented and, therefore, not properly integrated into restoration plans (Lake et al., 2018; Hernandez & Vogt, 2020). Appropriately recognising and including Indigenous and local knowledge and practice can enhance restoration effectiveness and scope, while upholding rights, as seen in Tanzania, Hawaii and South Korea (Walters et al., 2019; Lee & Krasny, 2015; Chang et al. 2020; Kurashima et al., 2020). It is also in keeping with the growing recognition and inclusion of diverse cultures and knowledge systems in international policy processes around ecosystem services, such as in the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) conceptual framework (see D\u00edaz-Reviriego et al., 2019).31 Key findings Rapid cultural assessment tool: The IUCN team in Eastern and Southern Africa developed a rapid cultural assessment tool consisting of 10 questions aimed at understanding and supporting the use of traditional and cultural knowledge in FLR (see Box 2). Interviews indicated that the stakeholders in the ROAM processes in Malawi found that using the tool enabled integration of cultural knowledge. This is reflected in the ROAM report from the assessment in Malawi, which repeatedly mentions the themes of traditional knowledge, graveyard forests32 and the role of Traditional Authorities33 in restoration, and further notes a lack of involvement of Traditional Authorities as an indirect driver of degradation (MNREM Malawi, 2017).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b12b7cbc-d7d5-4810-a99b-ea43a1eeccc0": {"__data__": {"id_": "b12b7cbc-d7d5-4810-a99b-ea43a1eeccc0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the integration of governance in forest landscape restoration opportunities assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff9aa1a2068a14151e80438a5de3d0b0a7e06cd49f4ce89791258164a80d84e5"}, "2": {"node_id": "4ee3a1aa-ec85-4c8a-8263-1d221cbe8432", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e506242981cb4b4b2a17cd2a8c4ad136cc22ae229b2a83ef6be6f04137c47a0b"}}, "hash": "947edc36114e2354f7f60267a72e5de96b059bf58195964a7cabea295fe7c0bc", "text": "The questions in the cultural assessment tool have since been integrated into ROAM training materials and the Environmental Leadership and Training Initiative (ELTI) online course developed by IUCN,34 and have been used in other ROAM processes.

For example, in Malawi, there was a focus on farmer-managed natural regeneration, a peer-to-peer technology transfer amongst farmers fostering natural regeneration of trees on their farms. ROAM processes may also include collective mapping and discussions about preferred local strategies, e.g. 30 The role of appropriate recognition and inclusion of local institutions and governance systems in ROAM processes, including those of Indigenous peoples and local communities, is discussed in relation to devolution (see NRGF Principle 4, next section). 31 As summarised by Diaz et al. (2018, p. 270), \u201cOne of the more recent key elements of the IPBES conceptual framework [\u2026] is the notion of nature's contributions to people (NCP), which builds on the ecosystem service concept popularized by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) [\u2026] NCP as defined and put into practice in IPBES differs from earlier work in several important ways. First, the NCP approach recognizes the central and pervasive role that culture plays in defining all links between people and nature. Second, use of NCP elevates, emphasizes, and operationalizes the role of Indigenous and local knowledge in understanding nature's contribution to people.\u201d 32 These community-conserved forests contain community graveyards. They are often small forests which have high cultural and biodiversity value. 33 In Malawi, customary leaders (Traditional Authorities) are formally recognised and hold a number of governing roles, including over customary land and resolution of related disputes. 34 For more information, see https://elti.yale.edu/about-elti. 23 for growing food. For instance, in Rwanda, the process included steps to help ensure that local people participated in choosing the native tree species they wanted on their land. One interviewee noted that Indigenous knowledge was important in this ROAM process, particularly in relation to sacred groves. Challenges and considerations: Case analyses also highlighted challenges and considerations for meaningfully and respectfully incorporating diverse knowledge and ways of knowing in ROAM processes, including: \u2212 Respecting knowledge-holders: Recognising and respecting diverse knowledge, including Indigenous and local knowledge, needs to be grounded in recognition and respect for diverse knowledge-holders. This includes respecting rights to FPIC. The ROAM process may be best approached as one of equitable knowledge co-generation and sharing (Austin et al., 2018). \u2212 Respecting different visions: Respecting diverse knowledge and cultural systems also means respecting diverse visions and perspectives regarding FLR, including where they do not align with those of ROAM process convenors. \u2212 Inclusiveness: Governance principles are inter-related. This principle (recognition and respect for diverse cultures, knowledge and institutions) is closely related to inclusive decision-making. People who are not meaningfully engaged in the process cannot effectively share their knowledge. This principle also relates to learning, as recognition of other knowledge systems can stimulate exchange. \u2212 Power dynamics: During an assessment process, power dynamics can impact whose knowledge is recognised and respected. For example, in Malawi, despite the direct and innovative way that cultural knowledge was accounted for in the assessment, the recognition of traditional knowledge was a political issue. As one interviewee noted, \u201cthere's always a tussle between the TAs [Traditional Authorities] and the nation-state authorities\u201d. In summary, this principle is central to ROAM, and FLR more broadly. Innovative approaches in ROAM processes in Malawi and Mozambique, including use of the survey tool (Box 2), could be adopted in other contexts. Likewise, knowledge co-generation and sharing approaches in more recent ROAM processes could be expanded. ROAM guidance and practice can also be strengthened through further integration of collaborative research approaches (including by and with local people) and guidance that supports more systematic recognition of diverse cultures and forms of knowledge, including Indigenous and local knowledge, with FPIC.

The FLR questions were derived and tested so that culture might be better taken into account in restoration programmes. The tool \u201810 culture questions for FLR\u2019 can be used as part of ROAM guidance and practices and included as one of the success or barrier factors in the Restoration Diagnostic (Hanson et al., 2015). The questions can be applied at the national, sub-national (e.g. district) or landscape level. Key informants who possess cultural knowledge are important interviewees, especially as cultural dimensions are often hidden or undisclosed within a landscape. Some knowledge is the domain of local communities or Indigenous peoples and will require free, prior, informed consent (FPIC) for its collection, use, storage and dissemination. The questions were applied in Malawi as key informant interviews (taking 14\u201360 mins to administer) and in the margins of workshops or during groupwork sessions. As culture is often ethnically distinct, different ethnic groups were interviewed. One particularly useful strategy was to apply the tool with traditional leaders who are custodians of culture and often play important roles in land governance in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Malawi, for example, the Traditional Authorities play an important and government- recognised role within communities and over land and natural resources. In Mozambique, the r\u00e9gulo (chief) plays a similar role. Interviews with TAs and r\u00e9gulos flagged the importance of involving traditional leadership, and, as a result, this involvement was strengthened during the FLR processes. The interviews also highlighted the presence of landscape features such as sacred groves \u2013 which are often nodes of local biodiversity and where local norms about landscape governance are often embedded and can affect whole landscapes \u2013 and the presence of species with specific cultural values. Overall, and depending on the context, cultural knowledge can be either a supporting factor or a barrier to restoration, and there may be different elements in a single culture that can work in different directions with regard to FLR. Successful restoration efforts may require the development of new, culturally sensitive knowledge about restoration, and this tool helps as a starting point. The \u201810 culture questions for FLR\u2019 are: 1. To what extent does culture influence FLR in the area? 2. What are the main themes or domains where culture influences FLR? a) Land, land tenure, governance and rights b) Specific landscapes, features in the landscape, specific sites (e.g. sacred natural sites) c) Specific plant and animal species (e.g. food, taboos and beliefs, medicines, construction) d) Arts and crafts e) Institutions and cultural leadership f) Spirituality and religion 25 Box 2 (continued) 3. Are there cultures that could be described as forest cultures? (Societies whose culture tends to protect or restore forests.) What is their status in the area? 4. Is culture an opportunity or barrier to FLR in the area? Or both? How? 5. How does culture influence other key social elements, gender, youth, ethnicity, politics, arts and economics with regard to restoration? 6. Does the overarching group culture of the area predominantly lead to restoration or degradation? 7. Are there \u2018centres of excellence\u2019 or specific cultural events that can be consulted for a deeper understanding of cultural dimensions of forests, landscapes and FLR? 8.

Devolved governance can be exercised by various institutions, such as district organisations, village committees, corporations,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "703ce132-ed10-4a77-ae70-64527530d74e": {"__data__": {"id_": "703ce132-ed10-4a77-ae70-64527530d74e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the integration of governance in forest landscape restoration opportunities assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37ab4faa9783e4948c8bef4251b3c426d19a31decb0015fc57cffc73b82bc23b"}, "3": {"node_id": "c301dd86-195b-4f3a-8e50-8d5d0b8bae9a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "216907cd71f87782db4374bb8aaf7759530251cbf9fb63e922b3ff7206a145bf"}}, "hash": "5440d1cb20c157eb0bdbcb6991cb7fee87a61dec445f4f4dcace39a3786bdb8e", "text": "traditional authorities, individuals and local organisations (Shackleton et al., 2002). The NRGF focuses in part on recognition and support for Indigenous peoples\u2019 and local communities\u2019 roles, rights and governance systems. In many countries, decentralised natural resource governance is the main approach to devolution and is inscribed in law (Ribot & Larson, 2005), e.g. Malawi\u2019s 1998 National Decentralisation Policy. Other countries may require public consultation about natural resource rules. Even when supported by policy, decentralisation may not be implemented or effective in practice, due to limited resources or a lack of governmental will (Ribot et al., 2006). Further, decentralisation policies and practices may or may not recognise customary institutions. Devolution is important for FLR, particularly where it recognises and supports local actors as leaders and change agents in restoration, including Indigenous peoples and local communities. Devolution is not typically addressed in the wider restoration literature, but can be seen as fundamental to supporting collective action in restoration (Akello et al., 2017). Key findings ROAM process scale: Aligning the ROAM process with the social and ecological scales of the FLR initiatives that will follow is both critical and challenging. ROAM processes can be done at a single scale such as national or sub-national or at multiple scales such as a series of local/sub-national assessments followed by a national 26 assessment. The process scale often affects how devolution is considered. For example, a national-level process may not consider devolution to local authorities to the same extent as a sub-national process. However, restoration is implemented in specific sites. Strategies identified at national (or even landscape) scales may not be relevant for or respectful of local actors if they are not included in the process. Therefore, ROAM processes at any scale should centre local issues and actors, including Indigenous peoples and local communities (see Box 3). At the same time, local and landscape-level initiatives often require decisions or actions at multiple levels. For example, in Indonesia the assessment primarily concerned the landscape level, but key decisions had to be taken at the provincial level. Therefore, decision makers from the provincial level were included. Given this, devolution in ROAM processes is likely to be less about finding the \u2018right\u2019 scale and more about designing a process through which rights-holders, stakeholders and other decision makers can meaningfully connect across scales, with empowered inclusion of local actors in all cases. Devolution in ROAM is thus closely linked with coordination (see Principle 6). Institutional recognition and relationships: ROAM processes are implemented in partnership with various institutions. Recognising and working with appropriate institutions is crucial for the process to be fittingly devolved, as well as inclusive (see Principle 1), well-coordinated (see Principle 6) and accountable (see Principle 8). In Rwanda, interviewees reported that the ROAM process strengthened forest governance devolution by recognising the policy, finance and coordination roles of the central government, as well as the leadership across Rwanda\u2019s five provinces, 30 districts, 416 sectors, 2,148 cells and 14,837 villages. They acknowledged that FLR initiatives must have both strong \u2018bottom-up\u2019 and \u2018top- down\u2019 support and consent to be successful. The institutional relationships and pathways in ROAM processes often reflect national decentralisation law and policy. In Malawi, the process involved district level consultation and local government collaboration to align with the National Decentralisation Policy. As one interviewee noted, \"in Malawi, districts are implementers\". The district level has the administrative budgets and ability to locally implement national projects. Meanwhile, in Indonesia, the process involved stakeholders from across national, provincial, district and village-levels, but the institutional home was a provincial-level multi-stakeholder working group (and outcomes were captured in the Provincial Spatial Planning Policy), consistent with national decentralisation law.35 Prioritising devolved FLR: ROAM processes sometimes take account of whether and how decentralised restoration is enabled, e.g. in law and policy analysis. ROAM can also be an opportunity to further support devolution, e.g. by appropriately recognising and supporting Indigenous- and community-led restoration initiatives. In summary, the principle of devolution is important to both how the ROAM process is designed and what governance issues it considers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c301dd86-195b-4f3a-8e50-8d5d0b8bae9a": {"__data__": {"id_": "c301dd86-195b-4f3a-8e50-8d5d0b8bae9a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the integration of governance in forest landscape restoration opportunities assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37ab4faa9783e4948c8bef4251b3c426d19a31decb0015fc57cffc73b82bc23b"}, "2": {"node_id": "703ce132-ed10-4a77-ae70-64527530d74e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5440d1cb20c157eb0bdbcb6991cb7fee87a61dec445f4f4dcace39a3786bdb8e"}}, "hash": "216907cd71f87782db4374bb8aaf7759530251cbf9fb63e922b3ff7206a145bf", "text": "Appropriate devolution can enable meaningful participation; recognise and support locally-governed restoration (including Indigenous- and community-led approaches); and allow restoration budgets to be attributed to local levels for implementation.36 35 Governance had previously devolved from the national level in Indonesia to the district level as part of a 2002 Regional Autonomy Law, but was re-positioned at the provincial level due to capacity and corruption issues at the district level. 36 Devolution is closely linked to the principles on inclusive decision-making, recognition of diverse knowledge, culture and institutions, coordination and accountability, among others. 27 Box 3.

The costs of not recognising the primary position of local people is that FLR programmes and projects may not be just, and will not stand the test of time, as they will not have the local leadership and \u2018ownership\u2019 that is critical for enduring success. ROAM processes can contribute to recognising and encouraging local leadership and ownership of FLR initiatives. When governments signed on to the Bonn Challenge to restore 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested landscapes around the world by 2020, and 350 million hectares by 2030, some, like the Malawi government, did so by listening to the needs of local communities. Before the government launched its National Forest Landscape Restoration Assessment (NFLRA) process in February 2016, it carried out a ROAM pilot assessment from October 2015 to February 2016 in Liwonde Forest Reserve, in the Machinga District. This included consultations with district officials and local people, including women and traditional leaders. The Malawi government initiated this bottom-up process before pledging 4.5 million hectares to the Bonn Challenge in September 2016 at the IUCN World Conservation Congress. The Government of Malawi maintains that its FLR process aims to achieve a higher quality of life for rural people alongside achieving national and global development targets. Malawi\u2019s consultations represent a good practice, achieved with support from the ROAM process. It ensures that FLR is bottom-up, avoiding situations where Indigenous peoples and local communities are implicitly coerced to support top-down decisions made by national governments without prior consultations. The Malawi case illustrates that FLR can and should follow a more inclusive path, which diverges from past histories of other natural resource interventions that have been pursued to the detriment of local people and without respect for their environmental and social rights. Indigenous peoples and local communities are often among the last actors and authorities to be informed, consulted and empowered in national and sub-national decision-making about natural resources. Token gestures like inviting representatives of local communities to regional, national and global dialogues, sometimes without ensuring that these representatives are freely chosen by local people, can be commonplace. The Malawi ROAM process implemented a different strategy by centring local institutions and actors. The local level should not be viewed as \u2018beneath\u2019 national and global actors in a vertical hierarchy; rather, national and global levels are constituted of local groups and serve local rights-holders and stakeholders. The local level is primary, and ROAM processes and FLR efforts and financing should fully invest in working with and at the local level. Principle 5: Strategic vision, direction and learning Relevance of principle Strategic vision, direction and learning calls for \u201cnatural resource governance [\u2026] guided by an overall vision of desired environmental and social outcomes, and allow[ing] for adaptation in response to learning and changing conditions.\u201d Vision and direction should be developed through \u201cinclusive processes that account for diverse values and forms of knowledge of rights-holders and stakeholders,\u201d considering present circumstances and future challenges. It requires, among others, \u201congoing monitoring, reflection and learning that enables responsiveness to changing conditions and needs\u201d (Springer et al., 2021). 28 For FLR, an adaptable vision informed by ongoing learning is important because restoration is a long-term process that needs to be integrated across diverse and dynamic landscapes. The landscape scale adds complexity in reaching a common vision for FLR because of its intrinsic diversity and plurality (van Oosten et al., 2019). Lesson learning is important for relatively new processes like FLR, but is missing in most interventions (Mansourian & Vallauri, 2020). Key findings Objectives for ROAM process: The degree to which ROAM processes have clear, shared objectives varies.

The process for reaching an FLR vision varies, including in how it includes rights- holders and key stakeholders. In Indonesia, participants listed their long-term objectives for FLR. These included a protected landscape, tranquillity, community well-being, sustainable livelihoods, alternative livelihoods for fish farmers, increased value of aquaculture products, intensification of aquaculture, improved technology, mangrove-based eco-tourism, and education and awareness. Key challenges and considerations around defining an FLR vision and direction include: \u2212 Diverse vision and strategies \u2013 ROAM processes often highlight different perspectives and priorities among rights-holder and stakeholder groups across the landscape. Some actors may already have a clear vision for whether and how they wish to support restoration, while others may wish to refine or create new visions and strategies and some may choose not to participate. In all cases, visions and strategies for restoration may or may not align with one another, or with those of ROAM convenors. Equity regarding whose visions and priorities related to FLR are prioritised through the ROAM process is therefore crucial, including ensuring that those of Indigenous peoples and local communities are recognised and respected. ROAM can seek a broadly shared but locally differentiated vision for FLR \u2013 e.g. a commitment to the Bonn Challenge implemented through diverse strategies, including Indigenous- and community-defined and led restoration and with respect for rights including to self-determination and FPIC. \u2212 Negotiated vision and strategies \u2013 Strategies may also be negotiated among participants. In Indonesia, the three distinct FLR visions (scenarios) initially developed through the ROAM process were eventually merged into a three-phased approach that would enable full restoration over 10-20 years. This three-phased approach was a compromise to enable sign-on by government bodies that would not agree to any strategy that they felt conflicted with formal government mandates, including a mandate to achieve full restoration. \u2212 Short-term and site-specific strategies integrated in a long-term landscape vision \u2013 Short- term and site-specific strategies can be part of the pathway to a long-term, landscape vision for equitable FLR. For example, small woodlots might ensure community fuelwood supply as other areas are designated for forest restoration or agroforestry systems. Embedding ROAM processes in existing visions and strategies: ROAM processes and FLR plans are often embedded in existing, related government visions, strategies or plans. For example, in Rwanda, FLR is aligned with the national forest policy and national transformation policy, and the ROAM process was seen as providing a roadmap to deliver these larger-scale visions. In Colombia, the ROAM process was embedded in the national restoration plan and seen as a way of delivering on the national restoration plan in eastern Antioquia. In Indonesia, participants noted how MFLR in Tanjung Panjang could contribute to national and 29 global policy and strategic commitments, such as Nationally Determined Contributions, National Blue Carbon Strategy, the national mangrove restoration policy, the 13th and 14th SDGs and the CBD Aichi Targets. Multi-directional learning grounded in historical and current context: The FLR vision and strategies resulting from the ROAM process are informed by numerous analyses. In this sense, learning is at the centre of the process. Which questions are asked (and unasked) in these analyses, and whose knowledge is (and is not) reflected in the answers, are therefore crucial considerations. The analyses informing the ROAM process should be inclusive and credible. Learning should be multi-directional, multi-scalar and inclusive (see Principle 3). The process should also reflect a deep understanding of the historical and current context, e.g. in analysing \u2018drivers of degradation\u2019 (see Box 4). Looking beyond the ROAM process: ROAM and FLR have different timelines. FLR visions and strategies developed during ROAM processes have to live beyond the assessment to be meaningful. Related challenges and considerations include: \u2212 Long-term learning and adaptation \u2013 The ROAM process can impact governance and, through that, long-term FLR implementation. For example, ROAM can improve the cross-sectoral collaboration needed for FLR implementation (as was seen in Rwanda).

In summary, this principle is important to ROAM, as the process seeks to reach a broad, shared vision for FLR. Particularly where the ROAM process and outputs can align with existing plans, strategies and visions, it can add significant value. Lack of a shared vision may impede future implementation of effective and equitable FLR.37 At the same time, ROAM processes often highlight the diversity of visions, priorities and strategies for restoration across the landscape. It is crucial that the process respects this diversity and ensures equity in terms of whose restoration visions and priorities are prioritised through the process. Learning and adaptation are also critical to the longer-term restoration efforts that ROAM processes aim to support. 37 Implementation may also be impacted by many other factors, such as lack of funding and/or clear champions. 30 Box 4. Placing drivers of degradation in context by Gretchen Walters, Assistant Professor, University of Lausanne, Institute of Geography and Sustainability ROAM assessments often list or analyse drivers of degradation. However, interpreting degradation and its drivers can be complicated, and sometimes driven by \u201creceived wisdom\u201d which adopts a degradation narrative,38 often incorrect and/or lacking analysis (Leach & Mearns, 1996). According to Leach and Mearns, for example, it is common to assume that swidden (sometimes referred to as \u201cslash and burn\u201d) agriculture causes deforestation, when this is not always the case. They note that is important to consider drivers of deforestation and degradation in context and to ensure they are not unfairly placed at the feet of marginalised people. Land degradation is a common theme associated with Malawi. In the Malawi ROAM report, indirect drivers of deforestation, as identified by stakeholders and rights-holders, include poor agricultural practices and the harvest of fuelwood. However, according to social scientists, there is another story behind Malawi\u2019s degradation, as described in the next paragraphs. Understanding these drivers will ultimately help target restoration initiatives appropriately. Drivers of degradation can vary spatially and by usage. For example, fuelwood consumption, a major concern in Malawi, comprises different uses, from using deadwood to collecting wood for commercial fish smoking. While some uses have little impact, others may be larger (Abbot & Homewood, 1999). For instance, fuelwood impacts can be highly localised and diverse, especially when destined for charcoal making, a key concern (Zulu, 2010). Zulu calls for \u201ca nuanced understanding of principle causes of deforestation, of wood fuel supply patterns and chains, wood fuel markets and trade, and patterns of energy use\u201d, demonstrating the variation in fuelwood demand throughout Malawi. The origins of degradation may not be straightforward and have long histories that should be taken in consideration. For example, in Malawi, degradation might be attributed to colonial era policies, which reduced local people\u2019s capacities to govern and manage their natural resources (Kwashirai, n.d.; McCracken, 1987). Degradation in the form of erosion emerged from large-scale colonial estates, which went unmanaged for many years (Mulwafu, 2002). These examples demonstrate that degradation is neither the result of one specific social group nor solely the result of present-day practice. Peter Walker\u2019s (2004) work on historical influences on restoration in Malawi is useful and is summarised in this paragraph. He found that degradation may be caused by land dispossession and resistance to tree planting. Large areas of land were taken from local farmers in the colonial era to create European estates, which occupied as much as 45% of the cultivable land and thus created land shortages for local farmers. The practice of creating estates continued under the Banda regime in the 1980s. A colonial concern was fuel wood supply, and although colonial foresters acknowledged that deforestation was driven by European tobacco estates, blame was placed on local farmers. Colonial efforts to address deforestation focused on planting exotic species, and colonial programmes to encourage villagers to plant exotic trees created an \u201capathy toward afforestation\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8aec1cd5-eb9d-44ea-94ae-009de67ddc19": {"__data__": {"id_": "8aec1cd5-eb9d-44ea-94ae-009de67ddc19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the integration of governance in forest landscape restoration opportunities assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64d95f1e4057d86466f20814016a5d44e8292bf52f7bf784a95fd2a7b76777c4"}, "2": {"node_id": "080c2fd4-dbc4-4eb7-b008-de80f137e306", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bd6f16b9dafb0d068557e0d4ec903e5665ebb5002435b63112266fc36151c07c"}}, "hash": "6ab43e408d0bc8a106780cd3f8d489d903797185d8b66756cf0472913b30fffc", "text": "Resistance to these tree planting programmes continued from the 1910s into the 1990s.

This includes horizontal coordination among actors working at the same governance level (e.g. within a district or village) as well as vertical coordination among actors working at different levels (e.g. from village to district to national government). It also pertains to coherence and alignment within and across natural resource and related sectors \u2013 e.g. in the laws and policies governing land tenure, forestry and agriculture in a restoration landscape (Springer et al., 2021). Given its multi-scalar, landscape orientation, this kind of coordination and coherence can be important for the success of ROAM processes and the FLR initiatives they prioritise. Key findings Leadership for ROAM processes: The choice of institutional leads in a ROAM process helps determine its governance and ultimate impact. In Colombia, for instance, a lead organisation helped to ensure broad acceptance of the process by rights-holders and stakeholders, make linkages with other relevant processes and actors, and provide long-term follow-up. In Malawi, the Forestry Department, as institutional lead, coordinated across devolved structures and helped ensure long-term sustainability and government follow- up. This resulted in a national programme and district level implementation plans with allocated funding. Multi-stakeholder coordination for ROAM processes: The ROAM process typically requires multi- stakeholder coordination. This can also enable longer-term coordination for FLR. For example, in Rwanda, a \u2018cross sectoral taskforce for FLR\u2019 was established. Interviewees indicated that this task force is widely seen as a major success, with neighbouring countries seeking to replicate it. In Malawi, a multi-sector task force guided and supported the national assessment process. This coordination translated into concrete collaboration around FLR, with the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Energy and local government coming together to reflect on implementing the FLR strategy. In Indonesia, the selection of the (pre-existing) Gorontalo Mangrove Management Working Group (KKMD) as the institutional home for the process helped ensure multi- sectoral, multi-stakeholder involvement. More recent ROAM processes have involved identifying or establishing a governance structure and team to implement the assessment following training. These governance structures are critical to participation throughout the ROAM process, and training teams encourage convenors to be inclusive in forming them. Areas for further exploration include how ROAM governance structures build on and align with existing institutions and connect local, landscape and national decision-makers. Cross-scale collaboration: ROAM processes often build on existing policies and institutions to enable cross-scale collaboration. For example, in Indonesia, national and district level forest governance arrangements required cross-scale collaboration between agencies. In Colombia, the ROAM process brought an international dimension to an existing restoration policy and increased the policy\u2019s visibility. At the same time, practice illustrates a number of related challenges. For example, operating jointly at larger (landscape) scales often requires a shift in mindset. This is particularly true as each convening group wants to emphasise its own independent actions. Coordination across diverse rights-holders and stakeholders in the landscape, operating with different timeframes, is also a challenge when bridging ROAM outcomes with implementation. For example, in Rwanda, one interviewee noted that, \u201cthe plethora of actors involved in FLR (\u2026) would imply a need for strong coordination efforts; the large amount of funds being generated for FLR also speak to the need for equitable benefit sharing\u201d. In all cases, cross-scale collaboration should support, rather than diminish, the role of local actors who will govern, implement and be impacted by FLR (see Box 3 and Principle 4). 32 Overlapping and unclear roles: ROAM processes may lead to \u201cover-coordination\u201d. For example, one interviewee felt that, in Colombia, too many people were seeking to lead, with limited resources and staff to deliver change on the ground. There are also challenges in understanding and respecting the roles of each rights-holder and stakeholder group, especially when there are many involved.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97ee7d14-cbb4-48ec-a023-1a0be8b792e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "97ee7d14-cbb4-48ec-a023-1a0be8b792e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the integration of governance in forest landscape restoration opportunities assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f22b7f770ef30dd7d1026cc0d9348e97fb04b6c1893a3c3db4716f0c3665efd2"}, "2": {"node_id": "42943fc8-abd7-41ae-a1ae-3e765a761247", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ecadec19bae3f184696c6b1da420f488017b2463b7e6ead22a339fc85bb39da9"}}, "hash": "353d0d62a1e5bba18e6939c9debee8139b89bc428403ff82cff834adb3740b01", "text": "For example, in Malawi, when the Restoration Diagnostic was carried out, it emerged that roles and responsibilities were not clearly understood, and it was unclear who held ultimate authority.

For example, in Malawi, the process included a review of policies, laws and regulations affecting restoration and concluded that there was need for harmonisation. In Colombia, the process contributed to the national restoration plan. To be complete, such analyses should consider alignment across the range of statutory and customary laws and policies related to restoration, including overlapping and conflicting provisions. These may include local, sub-national or national instruments across multiple sectors. In summary, this principle is highly relevant to ROAM and FLR, which call for coordinated approaches. ROAM guidance recognises the need to include key rights-holders and stakeholders, including women, both in the development of a coherent process and in the convening of a coordination group. Yet practice shows that achieving coordination and coherence across diverse groups and scales is challenging. Time is needed to enable reconciliation of different interests and priorities, even within the core team. ROAM processes can also help to identify ways to improve coherence among restoration related laws, policies and plans, including to better enable equitable and effective FLR. Principle 7: Sustainable and equitably shared resources Relevance of principle The principle of sustainable and equitably shared resources calls for \u201cactors responsible for natural resources [to] have the means necessary to carry out sustainable management and governance activities, including from the equitable sharing of benefits generated from natural resources\u201d (Springer et al., 2021, p. 24). Those who are governing and managing resources should have sufficient revenues and/or support from sustainable livelihoods and a fair share in diverse benefits. Losses borne by local rights-holders and vulnerable people resulting from conservation should be avoided or, where avoidance is not possible, minimised and fairly compensated. Benefits should be sustained over time, including for future generations. This principle addresses equitable benefit and cost sharing in its own right, and highlights that such equity is an important factor in whether people are able to meet environmental responsibilities (Springer et al., 2021). Restoration results in more than economic and environmental benefits; it extends to well-being and livelihoods (Erbaugh & Oldekop, 2018). Despite this, restoration literature often uses a financial perspective to focus on restoration costs and benefits (e.g. L\u00f6fqvist & Ghazoul, 2019). Key findings The cases illustrate a strong overall focus on FLR costs and benefits in ROAM processes, as well as some associated challenges. For example: 33 Distribution, including for those without secure tenure rights: ROAM processes typically include cost-benefit analysis of proposed restoration scenarios or initiatives. To understand whether these initiatives are likely to be equitable, the analysis needs to consider distribution, such as whose costs? who benefits? over what time? The analyses done in ROAM processes typically consider direct benefits for land-owners as well as indirect benefits for both people in the landscape more generally (e.g. clean water, and climate adaption, etc.). However, ROAM guidance does not substantively address questions of cost - benefit analysis where land users lack secure rights. These challenging cases do arise in practice. In Indonesia, for example, benefit sharing was considered in light of various groups\u2019 needs. Most fish farmers had migrated to and settled in the area without legal rights to the land or fish ponds (see Box 1). Given this, many fish farmers would not directly benefit from MFLR, and would face high opportunity costs. This, along with lack of commensurate livelihood alternatives for current land users within or around the landscape, posed a significant barrier to equitable and effective MFLR. Spatial and temporal scales of restoration: FLR is a long-term process. Some benefits will only accrue after many years, e.g. the 35 years it may take for a return on investing in mahogany trees (Colomer et al., 2018). Other FLR initiatives can generate shorter-term benefits, such as water retention, erosion control and increased soil fertility. Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR), for example, can yield relatively quick benefits in soil and wood material provision. These timeframes should be taken into account when discussing options with rights-holders and stakeholders. To understand if FLR initiatives will be equitable and cost effective, costs and benefits need to be considered in relationship to one another, both spatially and over time. Integrating these factors can be challenging. For example, national-level assessments can lead to decisions that are a poor fit at other administrative levels, as noted for Malawi.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7fb8797-88ec-47da-8ed8-d9ea9e6616bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7fb8797-88ec-47da-8ed8-d9ea9e6616bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the integration of governance in forest landscape restoration opportunities assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "63e358767a07971312cf74601a5c0c57a4fde0610ead22d497db3f6ca5e27979"}, "2": {"node_id": "ade7b027-b38f-43f3-897a-6ff49ed094d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e35a907189483917fa35dfc5b079ec68e6cad2dd02fb33d0e98916755bd1ce81"}}, "hash": "801e07c01c2a49e47cca8b93cdb51f447762ef9597c89540a25c665d5f935586", "text": "Benefits and costs also vary over time.

Conversely, in the scenario with the smallest proposed restoration area, the cost of restoration outweighed benefits even in the longer-term, particularly given the high opportunity cost to fish farmers. Considering diverse benefits and costs and well-being more broadly: The costs and benefits of restoration extend well beyond economic and financial aspects. While more recent ROAM processes have considered a fairly wide set of benefits, the considered costs still tend to be limited to economic factors. Considering a fuller set of social, cultural and economic benefits and costs, as well as the broader concept of well-being, could enrich the ROAM process. Robust trade-off analysis could also help rights-holders and stakeholders consider the intersections of social, economic and environmental outcomes of FLR.

However, many people do not benefit from the natural resources due to degradation. One interviewee suggested reframing the issue from \u201csharing the consequences of degradation\u201d to \u201csharing the benefits of restoration\u201d. This reframing could support communities in claiming rights, e.g. by raising this issue to governments to seek funding for restoration initiatives to increase food security. Communities as partners: According to one interviewee for Malawi, the approach to ROAM and finance was at times oriented around companies looking for labour for activities, such as tree-planting, rather than establishing a fair partnership with communities for investing in locally-controlled forests (see Elson, 2012). Agreeing on restoration costs and benefits: Funding and other limitations may result in insufficient time to resolve disagreements between rights-holders and key stakeholders on benefit and cost sharing, including opportunity costs. In summary, key aspects of this principle are reflected in the cost-benefit analysis in the ROAM framework. However, there are several factors that could be strengthened, including ensuring that the geographical and temporal scale of analysis matches the scale of implementation; considering a full set of social, cultural and economic costs and benefits, including their distribution; and integrating broader conceptualisation of human well-being. Principle 8: Accountability Relevance of principle Accountability calls for the \u201cactors responsible for or affecting natural resource governance [to be answerable] for their actions and the environmental and social impacts they produce\u201d (Springer et al., 2021, p. 25). It is enabled when those actors (and their institutions) are transparent and have clearly-defined roles, capacities and processes/mechanisms through which to meet their obligations. It involves being answerable for the impact of governance and management on rights-holders and vulnerable people and environments, as well as being able to address corruption (the use of public power for private gain) (Springer et al., 2021). Accountability can be seen as an instrument for just outcomes in the relationships among different agents, such as governments and citizens (Caddy et al., 2007). Accountable actors may be elected representatives, project managers (e.g. for the ROAM process), customary leaders or government agents or representatives. In processes involving powerful actors, accountability can be hindered by lack of political will, weak capacity for collective action, lack of resources and weak regulations (Nuesiri, 2016). FLR implementation requires accountability, i.e. answerability, especially given the timeframes and direct and indirect costs involved, including opportunity costs (Murcia et al., 2016). Importantly, accountability relates to being responsible for both actions (e.g. whether those with responsibility act fairly) and inactions (e.g. whether those with responsibility fail to meet their commitments and/or be transparent). Key findings Accountability relationships during the ROAM process: It is both important and challenging to ensure that the roles and responsibilities of actors in the ROAM process are clear, including how convenors will be accountable to the rights-holders and stakeholders involved.

Accountability for the potential impacts of FLR can also be enhanced through ensuring an inclusive ROAM process. If the process is not inclusive, important restoration considerations may be excluded. For example, according to one interviewee working at the regional level in Kenya, where rangelands cover 75% of the country, a ROAM assessment did not include rangelands restoration as a key intervention until it was noted by a senior staff member of a participating NGO well into the process. At the same time, ROAM processes should avoid becoming forums for assigning blame for degradation. For example, in Indonesia, ROAM meetings were facilitated with an eye towards minimising scapegoating, especially of the fish farmers who established fish farms inside the protected area and the forest managers who previously \"allowed\" this landscape conversion. In this case, there were also efforts by fish farmers and an allied NGO to seek accountability for recent injustices, as well as stated intent from a government official to hold fisher farmers accountable for contributing to restoration39 (see also Boxes 1 and 4 and Principle 10). Accountability for FLR implementation: As FLR implementation and monitoring are outside the scope of the process, ROAM outputs generally do not define accountability mechanisms for these steps. This enables flexibility40 and might also avoid creating pressure to impose initiatives on rights-holders or stakeholders who were not directly involved. Further, funding and convening ROAM processes with the expectation that they must result in FLR could incentivise downplaying barriers to or risks of FLR. At the same time, concluding the ROAM process without clarity about whether (and by whom, when, etc.) the identified priorities will be carried forward can be frustrating for participants. In Colombia, for example, community members were disappointed when ROAM finished without any clear follow-up in the short-term, due in part to lack of funding. (In Malawi, funding from the GEF supported FLR implementation.) Assessment without responsive action is not a challenge unique to ROAM (e.g. Campese & Sulle, 2019). Nonetheless, it is a challenge worth addressing, including out of respect for the rights-holders and stakeholders who contribute their time, knowledge and vision. As noted in the Diagnostic, part of empowered decision-making is accountability for the decisions made. 39 Fish farmers and a local NGO filed a petition to the Ministry of Human Rights during the assessment period related to the GAKUM agency dismantling five fish farmers\u2019 houses the year prior in an enforcement operation. At the same time, the head of the Forest Management Unit said that the fish farmers should contribute in some way to restoration (reparations), and that he would pursue that mechanism in his jurisdiction. 40 For example, in Malawi, the assessment was convened by the Forest Department, but two of the five recommended initiatives were then implemented by the Ministry of Gender.

The ROAM process can help stakeholders identify better siltation capture solutions upstream, allowing for a more stable electric power source.

For example, the Malawi ROAM report notes areas where restoration could be enhanced by addressing accountability, e.g. in participatory forest management (MNREM Malawi, 2017). These steps could also include a focus on accountability for social impacts. At the national and international levels, the Bonn Challenge, while not a ROAM framework component, helps create accountability for FLR and could be linked to ROAM outputs. In particular, the Barometer42 promotes follow through on commitments (Dave et al., 2019). However, the Barometer includes only one social indicator \u2013 the creation of green jobs.43 In summary, while FLR implementation and monitoring are largely outside the scope, ROAM processes can point the way towards accountable restoration \u2013 e.g. by building in safeguards and being clear about who is (or could be) accountable to whom, including accountability to Indigenous peoples and local communities.

The forest sector is considered a high priority economic development sector in Rwanda (Ministry of Natural Resources Rwanda, 2014). Rwanda\u2019s Vision 2020 includes a target to increase forest cover to 30% of land area by 2020. A 2019 Rwanda Forest Cover Mapping exercise supported by IUCN shows progress towards meeting this target (Republic of Rwanda, 2019). Rwanda\u2019s FLR programme is impacting economic development, including expanding investment opportunities. The first steps Rwanda took to operationalise its FLR vision included the 2014 national forest restoration assessment using ROAM, in partnership with IUCN and WRI. Impacts of this ROAM process include: \u2212 Substantially influencing Rwandan FLR policy; \u2212 Providing a technical roadmap to move from the FLR vision to guided activities on the ground; \u2212 Enabling investment in FLR projects, such as the Forest Landscape Restoration in the Mayaga Region project, funded by the GEF for US$ 33 million; \u2212 Creating the \u2018Cross Sectoral Taskforce for FLR,\u2019 which strengthens coordination of FLR activities in Rwanda; and \u2212 Being the first African country to pilot the Bonn Challenge Barometer of Progress, which positioned Rwanda as a model for FLR in the region. \u2212 In short, the ROAM process provided practical inputs to execute Rwanda\u2019s FLR vision and made the country a leader in FLR on the African continent. This success has also raised the challenge of accountability between actors (top-down and bottom-up) and among actors (horizontal peer accountability) in FLR implementation. There is also an urgent need for independent verification of achievements (diagonal accountability). Strong accountability is crucial for sustainability, effectiveness and equity of FLR initiatives in Rwanda. 41 These pathways vary widely. For example, in Malawi the government wanted to use ROAM to address degradation, including the enhancement of public funding for restoration. In Colombia, the government saw ROAM as a contribution to ongoing peace crops initiatives. 42 The Restoration Barometer is a \u201cframework for identifying, assessing and tracking action on global restoration commitments\u201d. More information is available on: https://www.iucn.org/resources/conservation-tool/restoration-barometer. 43 It also includes the \u201cflexibility to designate by job duration, gender type, or job type (i.e. maintenance versus implementation)\u201d. 37 Principle 9: Fair and effective rule of law Relevance of principle Fair and effective rule of law means that \u201cnatural resource-related laws and their application are fair, effective and protect fundamental rights.\u201d This requires, among others, a clear system of natural resource-related laws and policies that are \u201cconsistent with human rights and take account of the situation of Indigenous peoples and local communities, women and vulnerable groups\u201d and that \u201cincorporate principles of environmental sustainability.\u201d It requires that laws and policies are equitably and humanely enforced, and that those responsible for implementation have the resources and capacities they need. (Springer et al., 2021) These are crucial considerations, as reforestation and restoration efforts have been associated with the miscarriage of justice in several instances (e.g. Zoomers, 2010; Rai et al., 2018). Case analysis and key findings When and how rule of law is considered: ROAM processes may consider rule of law in legal/policy analysis, theory of change analysis, and/or application of the Diagnostic, among others. These analyses often focus on how laws and policies facilitate or impede restoration. It is also important to consider the fairness of laws and their enforcement. Resolving concerns related to the content or enforcement of laws is likely outside the scope of a ROAM process. However, identifying concerns helps ensure that they are taken into account, e.g. in prioritising FLR initiatives and highlighting issues to be addressed during FLR implementation. For example, if there are unjust (or unjustly enforced) statutory tenure laws, FLR initiatives implemented through them may themselves be unjust. If there is a community forestry policy in place, but the processes for its implementation are unclear or inaccessible, FLR initiatives implemented through that policy may face those same barriers. For example, in the Malawi ROAM report, enforcement of some laws is highlighted as essential for reducing degradation (MNREM Malawi, 2017).44 The Rwanda assessment recognised a need to strengthen natural resource rule of law, though doing so has not yet been prioritised in FLR implementation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "adc401e7-477a-4c62-b323-d3442f3ad042": {"__data__": {"id_": "adc401e7-477a-4c62-b323-d3442f3ad042", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the integration of governance in forest landscape restoration opportunities assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f163c30f3982256b74b96a0f9320cb599c3620453ab94f97c9e393f4aaef2c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "579e6b56-2278-49a6-bc8c-6212eb797ff8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2190c35926917c32cdec6b323e75fc55f8f2761d13576efb1f4295ec5f4e81c"}}, "hash": "0788d55ca5bc2511df0c210f7a4ca0358be173548758012ff6d868facdfef29b", "text": "Taking such issues into account can help ensure that FLR initiatives identified through ROAM processes will be fair and effective.

This revealed an important but complex story about the role that rule of law had played in the landscape over the last two decades, and what that implied for the current restoration options. Broadly, the conversion of mangroves to \u2018illegal\u2019 fish farming ponds had been tacitly allowed over the last 20 years for a number of reasons, including that this conversion resulted in substantial financial benefits for local law enforcement officers and other government agencies, and that restoration was not a legal option until 2013. In that context, most stakeholders realised the risk of only fully enforcing the law 20 years after conversion, including that doing so would result in displacement and violent conflict. This situation cannot be fairly resolved through law enforcement alone. A more comprehensive solution is required to fairly resolve this complex set of problems. 44 The ROAM report notes that it will be important to: \u201cEstablish appropriate compliance mechanisms to strengthen enforcement of related laws and policies, in particular for forest clearing restrictions and for community forest management. Weak enforcement of forest laws \u2013 underpinned by high resource demand, limited financial and human resources, rent seeking behaviour and corruption risks \u2013 were identified as a main barrier to achieving FLR at scale\u201d. One interviewee noted that the Forest Act was old and that the revision was not yet complete (but was underway at that time). It will largely raise fines and penalties to reduce illegal activities and so support restoration. 38 In summary, ROAM takes account of the legal and policy landscape. Giving more focus to whether the content and enforcement of laws is fair and consistent with human rights could enhance the ability of ROAM processes to support effective and equitable FLR implementation. This could be addressed in ROAM guidance. Principle 10: Access to justice and conflict resolution Relevance of principle Access to justice and conflict resolution means that \u201cpeople are able to seek and obtain remedies for grievances and resolve conflicts regarding land and natural resources\u201d. This requires, among others, that impartial and effective \u201cformal or informal mechanisms are in place to resolve conflicts and grievances regarding land and natural resources\u201d, that these mechanisms are known by and accessible to rights-holders and stakeholders, and that people are aware of their rights (Springer et al., 2021, pp. 28\u201329). Access to justice and the ability to resolve natural resource conflicts are part of ensuring sustainable restoration processes (Herrick et al., 2019). Case analysis and key findings Effective and equitable FLR requires access to justice and pathways for conflict resolution. While conflict resolution is not a focus of ROAM guidance, it is often a (more or less explicit) part of the process. Restoration involves governance questions such as how and by whom decisions are made, who has rights and responsibilities to what and who benefits and bears related costs. Injustices, grievances and conflicts related to such questions often precede \u2013 and can impact and/or be impacted by \u2013 the ROAM process. ROAM as part of a conflict resolution process: Some ROAM processes, such as in Indonesia, include an explicit objective of resolving a conflict. This requires substantial preparation, trust, appropriate and skilled facilitation, and follow-up. In Indonesia, historical timeline creation and opportunities mapping helped rights holders and stakeholders identify (sometimes conflicting) narratives about the creation of the nature reserve, the conversion of mangroves to aquaculture, and the forcible evictions of fish farmers (Bahsoan et al., 2014; Brown, 2021). Most stakeholders felt that enforcement operations were \"heavy-handed\" and appreciated that ROAM was seeking to identify a resolution (Brown, 2021). Importantly, the opportunity mapping and validation workshops in Indonesia included a nationally certified forest conflict resolution facilitator. Grounding the process in the context: There may be ongoing or past conflicts that are beyond the scope of what ROAM can (or should) resolve, but that are (or should be) defining aspects of the ROAM process approach, as was the case in Colombia (see Box 6). Access to justice and conflict resolution in ROAM processes and FLR actions: Concerns related to access to justice and conflict resolution were not raised in all cases. In Rwanda, interviewees stated that the ROAM process helped establish village land use planning as part of FLR decision-making, and that this has given local people a voice in FLR and led to conflict avoidance at the local level. (One interviewee also pointed out that, because resolving local tenure disputes satisfactorily in Rwanda is still very difficult to do,45 lands under ownership disputes tend to be excluded from FLR activities.) Interviewees in Malawi suggested that ROAM and FLR are generally viewed as positive.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "832e07c5-51e4-4bd0-90f5-0e06a439bec6": {"__data__": {"id_": "832e07c5-51e4-4bd0-90f5-0e06a439bec6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the integration of governance in forest landscape restoration opportunities assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b8a3a267df34401672f01838e636e264e61a4a9d635ebbc408819caa3a2dec3a"}, "3": {"node_id": "0bd1d31c-0805-412d-a970-a13009087b9d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b388946ac4737f5e45f1631c2b0b8b3434562398a5ccadaeb8d077c2b0216c50"}}, "hash": "557acc6a637a458a7158f7802255569e5cd892906f17a4a08750e0f1fac19836", "text": "When there is an issue, such as when pine plantations in the north failed to hire from local communities, people can raise their concerns through the local chief to resolve the conflict. 45 For more information, see the LANDac\u2019s Food Security and Land Governance Factsheet on Rwanda available at: https://www.landgovernance.org/wp- content/uploads/2019/09/20160627-Factsheet-Rwanda.pdf. 39 However, grievances or conflicts may arise in relation to ROAM processes themselves and/or the FLR initiatives they identify. It is crucial that they be recognised and fairly resolved. Often conflicts can be addressed through existing (formal or informal) mechanisms at the appropriate level (village, district, etc.). Convenors should also ensure that there are fair, accessible and known grievance mechanisms for ROAM processes, including IUCN\u2019s grievance mechanism, when applicable. This is an area where more guidance and analysis are needed. In summary, this principle is important because FLR often involves challenging rights and governance issues. Equitable, sustainable restoration is unlikely in the context of ongoing conflict. ROAM processes have the potential to either help resolve and/or exacerbate resource-related conflicts and injustice in the landscape. More dialogue, guidance and training on enabling equitable conflict resolution and ensuring effective and fair mechanisms for grievance redress could strengthen ROAM. Box 6. Post-conflict landscapes and ROAM in Colombia by James McBreen, Senior Programme Officer, Forest Landscape Restoration, IUCN Experience with the ROAM process in Colombia highlights the importance of grounding assessments in their historical, social, and political context, and shows in particular the potential challenges and benefits of the process in a post-conflict setting. The department of eastern Antioquia, where the ROAM process was carried out, has one of the highest deforestation rates in Colombia, has been exacerbated by decades of internal armed conflict. Given that reality, and the new \u2018post-conflict\u2019 phase, there are inherent challenges in Colombia, which have implications for the environmental, cultural and socio-economic dynamics in the landscape. These include how landowners or users make decisions and challenges related to land tenure, and the arrival of displaced farmers and former guerrill3as who are reintegrating into society. There is uncertainty as to what patterns of land use can be expected in Colombia in the \u2018post-conflict\u2019 phase, and what the consequences for nature and livelihoods will be. In this context, the ROAM process in Colombia offered an opportunity and generated valuable experience for multiple stakeholders involved in landscape-scale planning, especially for restoration, to understand and practice the necessary integration of biophysical and ecological aspects with the social reality of the landscape. ROAM is characterised by its multi-stakeholder process, which should be built on dialogue and existing collaborative structures in the assessment area. In this post-conflict context, the ROAM process itself can be a valuable catalyst to foster relationships and dialogue between key stakeholders. The process offered FLR interventions to restore degraded landscapes through productive and sustainable activities, such as ecotourism and new livelihood opportunities for internally displaced people and ex-guerrillas affected by decades of conflict. In this sense, ROAM in eastern Antioquia contributed towards positioning restoration as a key activity to support the peace process, providing alternative livelihood options for returning populations to previously occupied conflict zones. There is a clear opportunity for participatory monitoring in the FLR design and implementation phases, by incorporating indicators of socio-economic well-being and promoting and enabling local participation in monitoring, data analysis and discussion of the results, including those that highlight the social, ecological, and economic benefits of FLR at the landscape scale. In the \u2018post-conflict\u2019 process, FLR can play a significant role in supporting durable peace in Colombia, considering restoration as a long-term process with sustainable results that start from the local level. It can enable a greater connection to earth through nature and restoring degraded landscapes, restore trust and confidence among the community, and engage youth in promoting local change and peacebuilding. 40 6 Recommendations This section includes recommendations to enhance the ways that ROAM guidance and practice address governance, drawing on the 10 NRGF principles. Recommendations reflect both strengths and challenges identified in the preceding analysis, including good practices that were found in case analyses and that could be more widely practiced and/or strongly reflected in guidance.

Related NRGF principles: All \u2212 Use the ROAM guidance and tools that already address governance and rights issues (see Table 2 and Box 2). \u2212 Draw on and develop additional guidance, tools and practices, including to address gaps (see Table 2) and further operationalise the recommendations below. This may include new ROAM-specific guidance as well as related resources (see Annex II) and approaches, protocols or guidance from rights-holders and stakeholders in a ROAM process. \u2212 Co-generate and share governance- and rights-related knowledge and experiences, including in ROAM training.46 \u2212 Engage partners with related skills and knowledge, including from Indigenous peoples\u2019 and local communities\u2019 organisations. 6.2 ROAM Phase 1: Preparation, consultation and planning Several recommendations that pertain to all ROAM phases are listed under Phase I because addressing them starts during planning. Recommendation 2: Convene inclusive and effective coordination for the ROAM process. Related NRGF principles: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8 Institutional partners convening and coordinating the ROAM process should be: \u2212 Representative of the diversity in the landscape, including Indigenous peoples and local communities. Partnerships with international organisations, including IUCN, may be helpful, but the process should not be driven by external actors. \u2212 Trusted by and accountable to rights-holders and key stakeholders. Engage facilitators experienced 46 Training could include skill-building in key governance areas, such as rights-mapping, facilitating multi-stakeholder groups that include diverse rights-holders and knowledge-holders, appropriately recognising and integrating diverse forms of knowledge, social/well-being analysis and conflict resolution. 41 in multi-stakeholder participatory processes and other requisite skills (e.g. conflict resolution). \u2212 Knowledgeable about the governance systems, rights and cultures in the landscape. \u2212 Well-coordinated amongst themselves (including across scales), with clear, agreed-upon roles and relationships. \u2212 Committed, with appropriate capacity. Longer-term impact may be enhanced by engaging diverse \u2018champions\u2019 with the political will, commitment and capacity to see FLR through. Recommendation 3: Fully integrate governance and rights in situational and legal and policy analysis and/or do a governance assessment. Related NRGF principles: All Carry out in-depth situational and legal and policy analyses that identify governance issues that may impact the equity, effectiveness and sustainability of FLR initiatives. If these analyses (and the FLR Readiness Diagnostic) are done early in the process, results can inform the initial restoration opportunities mapping. At a minimum, this information helps ensure that prioritised FLR initiatives will not cause harm. Beyond this, it can help identify areas where landscape governance can be improved. This may include appropriate recognition and support for Indigenous peoples\u2019 and local communities\u2019 rights (including self- determination and FPIC) and restoration / natural resource governance initiatives. Issues to consider include: \u2212 Governance arrangements - e.g. who governs (de jure and de facto) land, territories and resources across the landscape, and how? Is there appropriate recognition and devolution in policy? In practice? Why or why not? \u2212 Tenure47 and other human rights - e.g. what (and whose) are the customary and statutory rights to govern, own, access and use land, territories and natural resources in the landscape? What other procedural and substantive human rights may be impacted by FLR? Are local rights-holders aware of and freely able to act upon their rights? If not, what are the conflicts and barriers? \u2212 Laws, policies, rules and protocols that set the terms of, enable or impede equitable and effective FLR. Consider laws and policies from across levels and sectors, and from statutory and customary systems. With respect to statutory laws, consider fairness in their content and implementation across groups. Take into account local by-laws and community plans and protocols.48 \u2212 Cultural and knowledge systems - e.g. who are knowledge-holders in the context? How can diverse knowledge and practice for restoration, including Indigenous and local knowledge, be recognised, respected and included (with FPIC)? How can knowledge be fairly co-generated? 47 See McLain et al.

(See Box 4.) Beyond situation and legal analysis, consider convening a more complete landscape governance assessment to help ensure comprehensive understanding of governance issues. Recommendation 4: Carry out a robust rights-holder and stakeholder analysis. Related NRGF principles: 1, 4 ROAM processes typically involve a stakeholder analysis. A meaningful analysis can help ensure an inclusive, legitimate process \u2013 knowing not just who to reach out to, but how different rights-holders and stakeholders can best be engaged and appropriately supported throughout the process. Towards this end: \u2212 Ensure analysis using unbiased, inclusive methods and based in deep understanding of the social, cultural and historical context \u2013 including Indigenous peoples, local communities and other rights- holders, knowledge-holders and stakeholders. \u2212 Take account of rights and power relationships. This could involve, e.g. \u2018rights and responsibilities\u2019 analysis and power mapping (together with the \u2018interest and influence\u2019 mapping often used in ROAM processes). Include groups who may be (positively or negatively) impacted by restoration but face barriers to influencing decisions. Recommendation 5: Ensure an inclusive process with full and effective participation in all phases. Related NRGF principles: 1, 3, 5 Inclusive decision-making with full and effective participation is important at all ROAM phases. Among others: \u2212 Respect and appropriately work with existing institutions, including community-defined processes and protocols for discussion and decision-making. \u2212 Be transparent and proactively share information with rights-holders and stakeholders49 \u2212 Invite and enable, but do not force or coerce, participation. If rights-holders and key stakeholders are opting out, listen to why and address concerns where possible. \u2212 Ensure rights-holders and key stakeholders are empowered partners. Share power and be inclusive of and responsive to diverse views, knowledge and priorities. \u2212 Ensure self-determined representation where direct participation is not an option.50 \u2212 Use contextually-appropriate, participatory methods co-selected/developed with rights- holders and stakeholders (in workshops as well as in data collection and analysis occurring between them). \u2212 Fully budget for participation throughout the process. 49 This can include information about what ROAM is; who is convening the process and what they are proposing; how (and in what) people can participate; what the potential benefits, limitations and risks are; and how concerns can be raised and addressed. Rights holders also need clear information about their rights, if not already known. 50 Representation can occur in different ways, and through elected officials, customary authorities or others with (formal or informal) legitimate mandates. Working with a diversity of representatives can enhance representation (Nuesiri, 2018) 43 \u2212 Include gender sensitisation and collectively develop a gender action plan for the ROAM process. \u2212 Proactively and appropriately support full and effective participation,51 including of Indigenous peoples, local communities, people of different genders and ages (including women and youth), and vulnerable or marginalised groups. Recommendation 6: Align the participatory process to the geographical and institutional scale(s) of the assessment, with inclusion at each level. Related NRGF principles: 1, 3, 4, 5 ROAM\u2019s landscape and multi-scalar approach is a strength and a challenge. To help enable an inclusive, well- governed assessment across scales: \u2212 Ensure that the geographical scales for the assessment are clear, agreed upon and aligned with the process, including engaging the rights-holders and stakeholders who make, are impacted by and implement restoration decisions across those scales. \u2212 Enable dialogue and coordination between rights-holders and stakeholders across the landscape (and across scales, from national to local), while respecting different visions, priorities and/or timelines for FLR. In addition to any national level platforms, enable cross-scalar dialogue through which local people can freely share their views, hosted in areas and through processes defined by local actors.

Recommendation 9: Support fair and effective conflict recognition and resolution at the appropriate level. Related NRGF principles: 10 \u2212 As many ROAM processes involve conflict resolution (by design or default), plan for that possibility. \u2212 Work through statutory or customary mechanisms at the appropriate level (village, district, national, etc.). \u2212 Ensure rights-holders and stakeholders have information about and access to grievance mechanisms, including IUCN\u2019s. \u2212 Ensure sufficient resources (including time) and appropriate facilitation for ROAM processes involving conflict resolution. Recommendation 10: Develop ROAM objectives and FLR visions with rights-holders and key stakeholders at each level and with respect for diverse visions and strategies.

Many actors will already have visions and plans for land and resource governance and management, which may (or may not) include restoration. Some may wish to refine or create new visions. Some may choose not to participate. Given ROAM\u2019s scale and FLR\u2019s timeframe, there may be a broad vision (e.g. meeting commitments to the Bonn Challenge, SDGs, MEAs, etc.) with diverse visions and strategies at more local levels (e.g. sacred forest restoration or expanded agroforestry).

Data collection and analysis should be participatory and grounded in a rich understanding of the governance context, developed in Phase I. More specifically: 53 As described in the ROAM Handbook: \u201c\u2026 Beyond the limited number of criteria used to guide stratification\u2026 identify a broader set of assessment criteria that can be used to analyse FLR potential within each sub-area\u2026 selected on the basis that they can help assess the core issues of a ROAM application: The need for FLR; The type and potential of appropriate FLR interventions; The scope and availability of land for the different intervention types; The costs and benefits of potential FLR interventions; and The legal, institutional, policy and financial limitations/opportunities. The criteria selected will vary with the particular objectives of the assessment\u2026\" (IUCN & WRI, 2014, p. 42). 54 See, for example, Hernandez & Vogt (2020) on indicators that evaluate restoration from an Indigenous lens. 55 For example, excluding FLR where there are tenure disputes may help ensure the ROAM process and the initiatives it identifies do not exacerbate concerns. At the same time, consistently prioritising restoration in areas with \u201cideal\u201d enabling conditions (e.g. clear and secure tenure, interested financiers, etc.) may reinforce marginalisation. 46 Recommendation 13: Ensure rights-holders and key stakeholders are leaders and empowered partners in data collection and analysis. Related NRGF principles: 1, 3 Use contextually appropriate collaborative research and equitable knowledge co-generation methods (see Recommendations 5 and 8). Recommendation 14: Fully integrate governance and rights when developing opportunity maps and prioritising FLR initiatives. Related NRGF principles: All Where Phase II includes refining restoration opportunity maps and proposed initiatives from Phase I: \u2212 Enable full and effective participation (see recommendation 5). \u2212 Consider governance and rights implications (see recommendation 11). \u2212 Ensure prioritised strategies/initiatives reflect the rights, knowledge and visions of Indigenous peoples, local communities and other rights-holders and key stakeholders who will govern, implement and be impacted by FLR, with respect for rights, including to self-determination and FPIC.

Recommendation 17: Ensure inclusive, transparent validation. Related NRGF principles: All Use inclusive, transparent processes (see Recommendations 5\u201310) for validating ROAM results and recommendations, so that final outputs reflect the rights, knowledge and visions of rights-holders and key stakeholders, including Indigenous peoples and local communities, with FPIC. Recommendation 18: Ensure final ROAM outputs identify FLR initiatives that can uphold rights and are aligned with governance principles. Related NRGF principles: All If not already done (e.g. see Recommendations 11 and 15), use participatory methods to assess whether initiatives identified or prioritised in ROAM outputs will uphold human rights and governance principles. This can be informed by the analyses in Phase I and II and further discussion with rights-holders and stakeholders during validation. While detailed restoration implementation plans are typically beyond ROAM\u2019s scope, the assessment process requires substantial financial, time and knowledge investments in identifying opportunities. Initiatives identified through ROAM processes should uphold and, wherever possible, enhance effective and equitable FLR governance, including the rights and priorities of Indigenous peoples, local communities, people of different genders and ages (including women and youth), and vulnerable or marginalised people who would be impacted. If the FLR initiatives identified cannot be effectively, equitably and sustainably implemented in a given landscape (a question that will often be determined by governance factors), they should only be included as \u2018opportunities\u2019 if ROAM outputs also offer clear guidance on what issues need to be addressed to make them viable options. In Rwanda, ongoing landscape restoration efforts aim to prevent mudslides and flooding.

Related NRGF principles: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8 As part of ROAM outputs, adopt and roll-out an action plan to take forward FLR priorities: \u2212 Include diverse, innovative solutions, including approaches defined and led by Indigenous peoples and local communities, with FPIC. \u2212 Be clear about scale. \u2212 Build in ongoing social and environmental safeguards. \u2212 Include funding (or plans to secure it) for ongoing coordination and participation. Coordination to carry forward ROAM outputs may require continuing or establishing multi-stakeholder processes. These should: \u2212 Work with and build on existing institutions and platforms as much as possible. \u2212 Represent and be answerable to rights-holders and key stakeholders, including Indigenous peoples and local communities. Accountability can be strengthened through, for example, peer review and shared reporting, for FLR financing and action. \u2212 Be comprised of diverse groups with the mandates, capacities and political will to carry out equitable and effective FLR over the long term. Some attributes may be built over time, such as through advocacy, training and shared learning. \u2212 Include diverse FLR \u2018champions\u2019 who are widely trusted and viewed as legitimate. Detailed FLR planning and implementation should be done with the leadership and partnership of local actors, including those whose lands, territories, waters and resources may be impacted, and should respect, promote and help more fully realise human rights. Recommendation 20: Enable longer-term and participatory monitoring, learning and adaptation of FLR plans and strategies Related NRGF principles: 1, 3, 5 While FLR implementation is beyond ROAM\u2019s scope, ROAM outputs should include recommendations or plans for participatory FLR monitoring, learning and adaptation. These could include peer exchange among local actors and analysis, documentation and communication of lessons learned. Monitoring could be done in connection with the Restoration Barometer,56 with additional indicators. 56 More information is available here: https://www.iucn.org/resources/conservation-tool/restoration-barometer. 49 7 Conclusion The success of restoration efforts is in large part socially determined and governance is a crucial factor in the equity, effectiveness and sustainability of FLR initiatives.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "045b8458-2d22-4d37-bb80-c65ded5c34fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "045b8458-2d22-4d37-bb80-c65ded5c34fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the integration of governance in forest landscape restoration opportunities assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cafe9ab37f821c87a461b83115a56a6da48ad4fde3d6ab8f68571f4b7014b9d7"}, "2": {"node_id": "f8683ca6-ca5c-4a4b-bc0a-1f1516cb8e2b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "140e64d173a70bdf6be34ed2d0ee3ef3501dc50d65204adfcdef220557735256"}}, "hash": "368f10fd590a44aeef0fc99f1496e099ef3038c7fe41c57c2b73a9d57869c133", "text": "Mapping NRGF and FLR principles (Table 1) shows how applying the NRGF can reinforce and add value to FLR.

There are also challenges and gaps that can be addressed. More fully integrating governance principles can enhance the opportunity for ROAM guidance and processes to support effective and equitable FLR and improved landscape governance. This publication offers 20 recommendations towards that end. The recommendations reflect both strengths and challenges identified in the analysis, including good practice that can be better reflected in ROAM guidance. In summary, key issues addressed in the analysis and recommendations include: \u2212 Inclusion and power dynamics: ROAM processes, like FLR more broadly, often confront and seek to address complex and inequitable power relationships. Key questions include who convenes and is invited into the process; who funds it; whose assumptions, knowledge and visions are reflected in prioritised restoration actions; who decides; who follows-up and implements FLR, etc. The ROAM assessment should be designed and implemented as an inclusive, multi-stakeholder process, with Indigenous peoples and local communities and people of all genders and age groups engaged as empowered leaders and partners in restoration, ensuring respect for rights, including FPIC. While ROAM processes generally strive to achieve inclusion, there are also challenges when it comes to practice. More systematic guidance and sharing of experiences can help ensure inclusive ROAM processes. \u2212 Rights and equity: FLR has the potential to (positively or negatively) impact rights and equity. Restoration\u2019s impacts on well-being need to be understood, including equity in the nature, scope and distribution of material and non-material benefits (and losses). In keeping with this, the leadership and focus of ROAM processes should include those who govern and implement FLR and are most impacted by land use decisions, including Indigenous peoples, local communities and women. Likewise, ROAM process convenors and stakeholders need a clear understanding of the governance context and tenure arrangements and, where appropriate, support for just tenurial and conflict resolution. \u2212 Diverse knowledge, culture and visions for FLR: Rights-holders and stakeholders bring diverse and valuable knowledge to FLR, including Indigenous and local knowledge. They also have diverse visions for what restoration means and how it can be achieved on their lands and territories. ROAM processes can be an opportunity for knowledge co-generation and sharing and for recognising and supporting the FLR contributions of different actors, including Indigenous peoples and local communities and people of different genders and age groups, with FPIC. \u2212 Scale and timeframe: As a cross-sectoral and cross-scale process informing the planning and design of long-term FLR, ROAM processes must effectively enable participation across scales. This requires understanding where rights-holders, stakeholders and other knowledge-holders are situated and where policy decisions are made. ROAM must also account for the time differences between when FLR opportunities are identified, implemented, pose costs and generate benefits. 50 \u2212 Context and history: ROAM processes should be based in a deep understanding of how current and historical governance contexts inform current restoration opportunities and how restoration can inform and improve (or undermine) broader landscape governance. \u2212 Continued learning and action: ROAM processes and outputs should encourage ongoing monitoring and action learning, including about governance, and contribute to adaptation, accountability and sustainability in FLR. This publication provides a step towards more fully integrating governance considerations in ROAM processes and resulting FLR strategies and plans. It can inform ROAM guidance, training, practice and learning going forward, including further research about the importance of governance for FLR.

Devolution: Decisions are taken at the lowest possible level appropriate to the social and ecological systems being governed, with particular attention to empowering the roles and authority of Indigenous peoples and local communities in natural resource governance \u2212 Legal and policy frameworks devolve natural resource management to capable institutions closest to the natural resources concerned. \u2212 Legal and policy frameworks for devolved \u2013 including Indigenous and community-led \u2013 natural resource governance are widely implemented. \u2212 Local institutions (including customary institutions) have the capacities and support they need for effective and equitable natural resource governance. \u2212 Appropriate recognition is given to the roles and authority of Indigenous peoples and local communities in natural resource governance. 5. Strategic vision, direction and learning: Natural resource governance is guided by an overall vision of desired environmental and social outcomes, and allows for adaptation in response to learning and changing conditions \u2212 Relevant legal, policy and management frameworks establish strategic vision and direction for natural resource governance. \u2212 The strategic vision and direction are set through inclusive processes that take into account the diverse values and forms of knowledge of rights-holders and stakeholders. \u2212 The strategic vision and direction incorporate key principles of environmental sustainability, such as the precautionary principle against risks of environmental and social harm. \u2212 The strategic vision and direction effectively and equitably address present threats and anticipate future challenges. \u2212 Natural resource governance and management activities are consistent with the strategies articulated in the vision. \u2212 Governance institutions have processes in place for ongoing monitoring, reflection and learning, thereby enabling responsiveness to changing conditions and needs. 6. Coordination and coherence: Actors involved in or affecting natural resource governance coordinate around a coherent set of strategies and management practices \u2212 Legal and policy frameworks across sectors responsible for or affecting natural resource governance are aligned. \u2212 Coordination mechanisms are in place to enable horizontal collaboration and coherence among multiple actors and sectors operating in the same geographical space or thematic area. \u2212 Mechanisms are in place to enable vertical coordination across multiple levels of actors with roles in the governance of an ecosystem or resource. \u2212 Institutions collaborate and overlap functions in ways that increase resilience. 58 Principles Criteria 7. Sustainable and equitably shared resources: Actors responsible for natural resources have the means necessary to carry out sustainable management and governance activities, including from the equitable sharing of benefits generated from natural resources \u2212 People responsible for natural resource governance have access to revenues and/or livelihoods that enable them to carry out resource management activities. \u2212 Available revenues and other resources provide sufficient economic sustainability for the people and actions required to sustainably manage the natural resource. \u2212 Benefits arising from the use of natural resources are shared equitably. \u2212 The sharing of revenues and other benefits provides sufficient incentive for the sustainable management of natural resources. \u2212 Losses borne by Indigenous peoples, local communities and all vulnerable, marginalised and/or minority people due to conservation \u2013 including restrictions on resource use to ensure sustainability \u2013 are prevented or, where unavoidable, are compensated. \u2212 Natural resources are managed sustainably so that following generations have equitable access to the benefits those resources provide. 8. Accountability: Actors responsible for or affecting natural resource governance are accountable for their actions and the environmental and social impacts they produce \u2212 The institutions responsible for natural resource governance have clearly defined roles and responsibilities. \u2212 The actors responsible for or affecting natural resource governance operate transparently and share relevant information on their actions openly and accessibly. \u2212 Appropriate capacities and mechanisms are in place to hold authorities involved in natural resource governance responsible for their actions (and inactions). \u2212 Social and environmental safeguards are adopted and implemented that explicitly take into account the situation of vulnerable groups and environments. \u2212 The potential impacts of governance decisions on vulnerable people and environments are understood in advance and avoided or minimised to the fullest extent possible. \u2212 Accountability mechanisms effectively rein in corruption. 9.

This annex includes just a handful of examples. It is not exhaustive and not all resources will be relevant for all contexts. Rights-holders and stakeholders may also have their own guidance and approaches, or other resources they prefer. Recognising and respecting rights and diverse governance systems, knowledge and practice ROAM processes should enable FLR approaches that recognise and respect human rights and diverse governance systems, knowledge and practice, including of Indigenous peoples and local communities. This requires that the ROAM process itself embodies such recognition and respect. The ROAM processes in Malawi and Mozambique incorporated innovative measures to recognise and include cultural knowledge and practice in restoration, including through the 10-question survey (see Box 2). This tool can be diffused more broadly, including within and beyond ROAM training and guidance. Recent publications that can provide important examples and sources of guidance include: \u2212 Toward a Tenure-Responsive Approach to Forest Landscape Restoration: A Proposed Tenure Diagnostic for Assessing Restoration Opportunities (McLain et al., 2021) proposes a rights actualisation framework for strengthening tenure analyses in future restoration opportunities assessments. \u2212 The Territories of life: 2021 Report (ICCA Consortium, 2021) \u201chighlights the importance of recognising Indigenous peoples\u2019 and local communities\u2019 rights and governance systems for effective and equitable conservation\u201d. It includes, inter alia, recommendations, over 17 detailed case examples and a global spatial analysis of the estimated extent of territories and areas conserved by Indigenous peoples and local communities. \u2212 In Indigenizing Restoration: Indigenous Lands before Urban Parks, Hernandez and Vogt (2020) describe three indicators that \u201crestoration projects must incorporate\u201d to \u201cre-evaluate[ ] restoration from an Indigenous lens\u201d: eco-colonialism, kincentric ecology and environmental narratives. They apply these indicators in the context of a restoration project at Daybreak Star Indian Cultural Center located at Discovery Park in Seattle, Washington. \u2212 The IUCN guidelines for gathering of fishers\u2019 knowledge for policy development and applied use (Cowie et al., 2020) support recognition and inclusion of \u201cfishers\u2019 knowledge as an important data stream in resource management. The report includes details on the breadth of knowledge that can be gathered, how it can be gathered, and how this information can be applied to support sustainable fisheries policy and broader applications in society. It contains case studies from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and the Pacific\u201d. \u2212 In Hawai\u2018i in Focus: Navigating Pathways in Global Biocultural Leadership, Chang et al.

Developing and respecting visions for restoration As noted above, while offering a pathway to new or refined FLR visions and strategies, ROAM processes should recognise and respect the visions, priorities and plans that communities in the landscape may already have or wish to develop.57 Where there is FLR demand, ROAM can incorporate participatory methods for further refining or reaching both broadly shared and diverse visions for restoration. Some resources and methods that may be useful resources and methods are described below. Participatory (2D and 3D) mapping: Participatory mapping can help build shared understanding of the landscape as it exists and as participants envision its restoration. It can also facilitate exchange about what (and whose) rights and responsibilities exist across the landscape. Among many examples and resources are: \u2212 In Forest Landscape Restoration: Restoring What and for Whom?, Boedhihartono and Sayer (2012) describe different visualisation exercises used in FLR, noting that their \u201cpreferred approach to initiate the participatory exploration of landscape scenarios has been the use of simple drawing exercises.\u201d \u2212 Mapping for change: practice, technologies and communication (PLA issue no. 54) includes articles and examples of participatory mapping, including considerations for ethical practice (see Rambaldi et al., 2009). \u2212 This Participatory Methods portal page has information about and links to resources on participatory geographical reference systems (PGIS) for mapping. Timelines and seasonal calendars: Participatory historical timeline creation can help reach shared understanding of how the landscape and its use have changed. This method was used to identify (sometimes conflicting) narratives about the landscape in the ROAM assessment in Indonesia (Bahsoan et al., 2014; Brown, 2021). Seasonal calendars can help illustrate changes in the landscape throughout the year \u2013 e.g. what resources are available and how and by whom they are used and governed (see Borrini-Feyerabend with Buchan, 1997). Visioning exercises and guided imagery: Beyond Fences Vol. 2 (Borrini-Feyerabend with Buchan, 1997) summarises guided imagery, starting by \u201cencourage[ing] participants to think [of] \u2026a vision for the future \u2026\u201d. 57 For example, Indigenous peoples and local communities governing conserved territories and areas may have (or wish to implement) community-led processes for documenting, visioning and taking steps to strengthen their governance and management, which may (or may not) include restoration. See, e.g. the process described in Strengthening your territory of life: guidance from communities for communities (Borrini-Feyerabend et al., 2021). 62 Facilitated modelling: Innovative, facilitated modelling and \u2018games\u2019 can help rights-holders and stakeholders explore potential solutions for the types of complex problems that FLR presents.

Recognising and fairly resolving conflict in FLR ROAM could be enhanced with guidance on the types of conflicts and justice issues that might emerge around restoration and ways that they can be fairly acknowledged and addressed, including in relation to recognition of rights and diverse visions and priorities for FLR (see section above on developing and respecting visions for restoration). There are also resources that speak more specifically to conflict management within FLR decision-making, which may be useful in ROAM processes.

Further, recognising the wider loss and degradation of ecosystems, the United Nations has declared 2021\u20132030 the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. Landscapes are shaped by decision-making and power relationships across multiple sectors and scales. FLR involves and impacts many actors over long periods, including Indigenous peoples and local communities who own, govern, manage and/or rely on areas, territories and resources within those landscapes. FLR governance concerns, among other issues, how and by whom restoration decisions are made (including on whose land and incorporating whose knowledge, vision and practice) and how FLR can impact rights and well-being in the short- and long-term. Governance is therefore a crucial factor in the effectiveness, equity and sustainability of FLR. The Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) provides a framework for governments and other rights-holders and stakeholders to define and prioritise actions for FLR in national or sub-national contexts, using participatory analysis of multiple factors. This publication analyses strengths, opportunities and challenges in how ROAM guidance and practice address governance issues. It considers both how ROAM processes are designed and carried out, and how they take into account governance of the target landscapes. It then presents lessons learned and offers recommendations on governance aspects of the ROAM framework and process with the aim of strengthening the ability of ROAM to inform effective, equitable and sustainable FLR. This analysis focuses on ROAM as a widely used framework that informs longer-term FLR, rather than comprehensively considering FLR itself. It offers inputs for developing additional governance guidance for ROAM processes going forward. The primary analysis methods were: (1) review of the most relevant sources of ROAM guidance; (2) analysis of the ROAM process in four countries \u2013 Colombia, Indonesia, Malawi and Rwanda \u2013 based on interviews and document review; and (3) additional research, including a review of targeted literature. The analysis was undertaken using the Natural Resource Governance Framework (NRGF), an IUCN knowledge resource that aims to provide a robust, inclusive and credible approach to assessing and improving natural resource governance. The NRGF framework includes values, principles and criteria for equitable and effective governance. The analysis also takes into consideration the FLR principles agreed upon by the Global Partnership on FLR (GPFLR), which ROAM seeks to operationalise. These two sets of principles address different subjects and have distinct objectives. Nonetheless, mapping the alignment between them shows that governance is intrinsic to many FLR principles and, thus, the NRGF can reinforce those principles. At the same time, because it goes further in identifying specific elements of effective and equitable governance, the NRGF can deepen consideration of governance in ROAM and, subsequently, the FLR initiatives identified through the ROAM process. Overall, this publication highlights that ROAM, like FLR, is a social and political process that is impacted by, and in turn impacts, different dimensions of governance, including equity and rights. The assessment process will determine whose knowledge, practice, rights and restoration visions are (and are not) reflected in outcomes. Therefore, while ROAM is not a governance assessment framework per se, taking governance issues into account is critical. This means, in part, ensuring that ROAM processes and outcomes do not inadvertently exacerbate governance concerns, e.g. by prioritising FLR initiatives that may marginalise or Principles of forest and landscape restoration \u2212 Focus on landscapes \u2212 Engage stakeholders and support participatory governance \u2212 Restore multiple functions for multiple benefits \u2212 Maintain and enhance natural ecosystems within landscapes \u2212 Tailor to the local context using a variety of approaches \u2212 Manage adaptively for long-term resilience Source: Besseau et al.

There is an opportunity to build on ROAM guidance to reinforce how governance considerations are integrated. Key findings Key findings from the analysis of how governance considerations are addressed in ROAM guidance and processes include the following (listed in relation to the NRGF principles):1 Principle 1 - Inclusive decision-making: Decision-making regarding natural resource policies and practices is based on the full and effective participation of all relevant actors, with particular attention to the voice and inclusion of rights-holders and groups at risk of marginalisation. ROAM guidance and processes emphasise stakeholder participation, including through stakeholder analysis aimed at better understanding which rights-holders and stakeholders can most benefit from FLR and influence the decision-making process . Yet, enabling full and effective participation remains challenging in practice, including with respect to ensuring inclusiveness, equitable power relationships (e.g. in designing and implementing multi-level, multi- stakeholder processes), sufficient resources (including time) and capacity (e.g. in facilitation). Principle 2 - Recognition of and respect for tenure rights: Rights to lands, resources and waters are recognised and respected, with particular attention to the customary, collective rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities, and to women\u2019s tenure rights. Understanding and respecting tenure rights, including customary and collective rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities, is key to equitable and effective FLR. Consideration of tenure rights is not central to ROAM guidance. Yet, in practice, ROAM processes frequently confront tenure issues, and address them in variable ways. Tenure rights, such as those related to ownership, governance, access, use and/or management of land, territories, water, trees and other resources, could be undermined if not well understood and fairly addressed in FLR, including where rights are unclear or unrecognised. More guidance and sharing of experiences about how ROAM processes and FLR can recognise, respect and uphold tenure rights are needed. Principle 3 - Recognition of and respect for diverse cultures, knowledge and institutions: Natural resource governance is grounded in sound and diverse forms of knowledge and respect for diverse cultures, values and practices. Recognition of diverse knowledge, knowledge-holders and culture has been increasing in ROAM processes, including through a new survey tool on culture. ROAM practice has also improved in recent years in terms of enabling knowledge co-generation and sharing, such as through collaborative learning between rights-holders and stakeholders. There are also aspects that could be strengthened, for example, through further guidance and more systematic practice on equitable knowledge co-generation and collaborative research, as well as the appropriate recognition and inclusion of diverse restoration knowledge, including cultural, Indigenous and local knowledge. 1 NRGF principles and associated graphics from Springer et al. (2021). vii Principle 4 - Devolution: Decisions are taken at the lowest possible level appropriate to the social and ecological systems being governed, with particular attention to empowering the roles and authority of Indigenous peoples and local communities in natural resource governance. Devolution is important to the ROAM process, for example, when ensuring that assessment scales enable decision-making about restoration at the most local level appropriate, with recognition of local (statutory and customary) governance systems, and the full and effective participation of rights-holders and stakeholders. It is also important to consider the opportunities and barriers for decentralised restoration in the landscape. For example, ROAM outputs can recognise and support Indigenous- and community-led restoration, in ways that respect self-determination and FPIC. Devolution is often considered in practice, particularly where national policy encourages or requires a decentralised restoration approach. However, addressing devolution more directly in guidance could ensure more consistent and comprehensive inclusion in ROAM processes. Principle 5 - Strategic vision, direction and learning: Natural resource governance is guided by an overall vision of desired environmental and social outcomes, and allows for adaptation in response to learning and changing conditions. Achieving FLR objectives requires clear vision, direction and learning. Developing a broadly shared, but often locally differentiated, vision for a future restored landscape is fundamental in ROAM and often one of its key outcomes. In practice, this is challenging to achieve. Rights-holders and stakeholders have different restoration visions and strategies across the landscape, which should be recognised and respected.

In terms of content, ROAM processes often (although to varying degrees) consider coordination and coherency in the institutional landscape for restoration. ROAM can provide a platform for improved coordination for FLR, with impacts within and beyond the assessment. For example, the creation of multi-stakeholder and cross- sectoral platforms have enhanced FLR coordination and coherence in some countries. Further guidance on the formation and governance of such platforms could help ensure that they are inclusive, including of Indigenous peoples and local communities, and enable equitable and effective FLR over time. Principle 7 - Sustainable and equitably shared resources: Actors responsible for natural resources have the means necessary to carry out sustainable management and governance activities, including from the equitable sharing of benefits generated from natural resources Restoration has economic, social/cultural and environmental costs and benefits. Benefit sharing and sustainability are often considered in-depth during ROAM processes, and the guidance suggests taking into account economic, environmental and social factors. However, while various material and non-material benefits are considered in ROAM processes, the costs of restoration are generally viewed more narrowly from an economic perspective. Analysing costs and benefits across geographical and temporal scales and considering distributional equity were also noted as challenges. ROAM guidance and processes could also integrate broader concepts of well-being, e.g. when considering impacts of proposed restoration actions. viii Principle 8 - Accountability: Actors responsible for or affecting natural resource governance are accountable for their actions and the environmental and social impacts they produce Transparency is important for accountability. ROAM guidance calls for transparency, and case analysis suggests that the process is often transparent to participants. There are also challenges. Process convenors\u2019 ability or willingness to coordinate and fulfil their roles varies. Further, when choosing restoration priorities, ROAM guidance does not provide a set of safeguards or a specific way to ensure that potential adverse social impacts are considered and addressed. There are several ways this could be, and sometimes is, done in practice (see Recommendations 11 and 18). Another challenge concerns answerability, or accountability, for longer-term restoration implementation and monitoring. Although long-term accountability is largely outside ROAM\u2019s scope, ROAM outputs can point the way to accountability, e.g. by providing information about who should be accountable to whom in FLR initiatives, including accountability to Indigenous peoples and local communities. Principle 9 - Fair and effective rule of law: Natural resource-related laws and their application are fair and effective and protect fundamental rights ROAM considers laws, policies and rules related to restoration as part of broader legal and policy analysis, e.g. as enabling factors. At the same time, there is little focus in ROAM guidance on considering the fairness of laws and their enforcement, including their consistency with fundamental rights. While resolving concerns related to the content or enforcement of law is likely to be outside the scope of a ROAM process, identifying such concerns can help ensure that they are taken into account, including in the prioritised FLR initiatives. Principle 10 - Access to justice and conflict resolution: People are able to seek and obtain remedies for grievances and resolve conflicts regarding land and natural resources While conflict resolution is not a focus of the guidance, ROAM processes often address related issues in practice. Some ROAM processes are intended, in part, to acknowledge and resolve conflicts so that rights-holder and stakeholder-defined FLR can move forward. ROAM assessments may also be carried out in landscapes where there are, or recently have been, conflicts that need to be taken into account in process design and facilitation. Conflict may also arise (or become more visible) during ROAM processes, such as around questions of who makes decisions, has rights and responsibilities, and benefits and bears costs related to restoration. Finally, access to justice and conflict resolution are key considerations for ROAM processes because they are important for effective and equitable FLR. More ROAM guidance and experience sharing in this area would be helpful. Recommendations Based on this analysis, the publication offers 20 recommendations to enhance the integration of governance considerations in ROAM guidance and practice. The recommendations summarised in the table below are aligned with the phases and key steps of ROAM processes. The recommendations reflect both the strengths and challenges identified in the analysis.

Fully integrate governance and rights in ROAM guidance and training. All ROAM Phase 1: Preparation, consultation and planning 2. Convene inclusive and effective coordination for the ROAM process. The convening and coordinating institutional partners should be trusted and accountable (including to rights-holders and key stakeholders), well-coordinated (including across scales), committed and supported by sufficient resources and capacities. They should reflect the landscape\u2019s diversity, including Indigenous peoples and local communities, and involve people with deep understanding of the context, including governance systems. Include FLR \u2018champions\u2019 at all levels to enable long-term, adaptive, devolved implementation. 1, 3, 4, 6, 8 3. Fully integrate governance and rights in situational and legal and policy analysis and/or do a governance assessment. Consider, inter alia: the full range of statutory and customary laws and policies, governance institutions and knowledge systems that guide (and can be impacted by) FLR; tenure and other substantive and procedural rights; land and resource- related injustices and conflicts; accountability arrangements and concerns; and the narratives and assumptions about who is responsible for deforestation and why. Take into account both the current and historical situation. All 4. Carry out a robust rights-holder and stakeholder analysis, including any Indigenous peoples, local communities and other local people who have connection to, own, govern, care for and/or rely on land, territories and natural resources in areas that may be impacted by FLR. Take account of differences in power, including across genders. 1, 4 5. Ensure an inclusive process with full and effective participation in all phases. This can be enabled by, among others: working with and through appropriate institutions at all levels; engaging rights-holders and key stakeholders as empowered partners; being transparent and responsive; fully budgeting for participation; and enabling full inclusion of Indigenous peoples, local communities, people of different genders and ages and potentially marginalised groups, through self-determined representation. 1, 3, 5 6. Align the process to the geographical and institutional scale(s), with inclusion at each level. Enabling meaningful participation across scales and sectors may require phased or tiered approaches, e.g. sub-national followed by national processes. Local actors who will lead, implement and be impacted by FLR should be partners in processes at all scales. 1, 3, 4, 5 7. Facilitate multi-stakeholder processes in ways that take account of, and positively impact, power dynamics, including to enable full and effective participation. All 8. Co-generate and respect diverse knowledge, including through multi-directional learning and contextually appropriate collaborative methods in all ROAM phases. Recognise, respect and include diverse ways of knowing, knowledge-holders and systems, including Indigenous and local knowledge, with FPIC. 3 9. Support fair, effective conflict recognition and resolution at the appropriate level. Work through statutory or customary mechanisms at the appropriate level and ensure rights-holders and stakeholders have information about and access to grievance mechanisms, including IUCN\u2019s. 10 10. Develop ROAM objectives and FLR visions with rights-holders and key stakeholders at each level, and with respect for a diversity of visions and strategies. Conveners should be transparent about their objectives and facilitate a process that is open and responsive to the visions and priorities of participants. Given ROAM\u2019s scale and FLR\u2019s timeframe, there may be a broad vision (e.g. a Bonn Challenge commitment) with diverse visions and strategies at more local levels (e.g. sacred forest restoration or expanded agroforestry).

Consider diverse (material and non- material) costs and benefits and their distribution \u2013 e.g. whose costs? whose benefits? where and over what periods of time? (see Recommendation 11) 2,3,7 16. Prioritise accountability to local actors in financing analysis. Consider how funds would be governed and which funding options best support rights-holders\u2019 and key stakeholders\u2019 priorities, including those of Indigenous peoples and local communities. Prioritise arrangements that ensure financiers\u2019 answerability to local actors. 3,4,7,8 ROAM Phase 3: Validation of results and recommendations 17. Ensure inclusive, transparent validation processes (consistent with Recommendations 5\u201310), such that outputs reflect the visions, priorities and knowledge of rights-holders and key stakeholders, including of Indigenous peoples and local communities, with FPIC. All 18. Ensure final ROAM outputs identify FLR initiatives that can uphold human rights and enable effective and equitable governance. If not done earlier (e.g. Recommendations 11 and 15) refine identified and prioritised initiatives as needed and provide guidance on governance issues that will need to be addressed for equitable, effective implementation. All 19. Adopt and roll-out an action plan for ROAM outputs through inclusive, coordinated processes. Include diverse and innovative solutions, including approaches defined and led by Indigenous peoples and local communities, with FPIC. Be clear about scale and build in ongoing safeguards and resources. 1,4,5, 6,8 20. Enable longer-term and participatory monitoring, learning and adaptation of FLR plans and strategies, including through devolved processes, and the application, where relevant, of the Restoration Barometer, with additional indicators related to governance. 1,3,5 xi Acknowledgements This publication was developed through a collaboration between the IUCN Commission on Environmental, Economic and Social Policy (CEESP), the Centre for Society and Governance \u2013 Human Rights in Conservation Team (known as the Global Programme on Governance and Rights (GPGR) at the time the publication was developed) and the IUCN Forest and Grassland Team (known as the Forest Conservation Programme (FCP) at the time the publication was developed).

FCP has been integrated into the IUCN Forest and Grassland Team. 1 1 Introduction Governance is a crucial factor in the equity, effectiveness and sustainability of forest landscape restoration (FLR). Governance concerns questions of, inter alia, how and by whom restoration decisions are made (including on whose land and incorporating whose knowledge and visions) and how FLR can impact rights and well-being in the short- and long-term. In 2014, to assist governments and other rights-holders and stakeholders with making FLR actionable, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), in collaboration with the World Resources Institute (WRI), produced the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) (IUCN & WRI, 2014). ROAM provides a framework for governments, rights-holders and stakeholders to define and prioritise FLR actions in a national or sub-national context, using participatory analysis of multiple factors. The ROAM framework, and the processes through which it is applied, address governance issues to varying degrees. The objective of this publication is to present lessons learned and offer recommendations on governance aspects of the ROAM framework and process and, by doing so, reinforce the ability of ROAM to inform effective, equitable and sustainable FLR. The analysis uses the IUCN Natural Resource Governance Framework (NRGF) (Springer et al., 2021) as its primary lens and also takes into account FLR principles agreed to by the Global Partnership on FLR (GPFLR) (see Besseau et al., 2018). It analyses strengths, opportunities and challenges in how ROAM addresses governance in its guidance and practice. It then offers recommendations for further integrating governance issues in ROAM, as inputs for developing more comprehensive guidance and practice going forward. 1.1 Importance of governance for FLR and ROAM With vast areas of the globe facing deforestation and forest degradation, FLR has become a priority involving numerous actors. To date, 61 countries, through 74 pledges, have collectively committed to restoring 210 million hectares of degraded and deforested land in response to the Bonn Challenge2 and associated regional platforms.3 Further, recognising the wider loss and degradation of ecosystems, the United Nations has declared 2021\u20132030 a Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. There is increasing evidence and awareness that governance is fundamental to effective and equitable conservation (e.g. Bennett et al., 2019; Borrini-Feyerabend et al., 2013; Springer et al., 2021), including restoration (Mansourian, 2016). This includes growing recognition of the extensive coverage and conservation contributions of territories and areas governed by Indigenous peoples and local communities (e.g. Dawson et al., 2021; ICCA Consortium, 2021; IPBES, 2019). An expanding body of research addresses forest governance (e.g. Agrawal et al., 2008; Barrow et al., 2016; McDermott et al., 2010; Nuesiri, 2018; Ribot, 2016) and landscape governance (e.g. Blomley & Walters, 2019; G\u00f6rg, 2007; van Oosten, 2013; van Oosten et al., 2014; Ros-Tonen et al., 2014). While there is far less research on FLR and governance, this work is also growing (e.g. Erbaugh et al., 2020; Guariguata & Brancalion, 2014; Mansourian, 2016; Mansourian, 2017; McLain et al., 2021). This is crucial because, while insights from forest and landscape governance are useful, FLR presents distinct governance issues. Landscapes are social and ecological systems, shaped by decision-making and power relationships across multiple sectors and spatial and temporal scales. FLR involves and impacts many actors, including local rights-holders and stakeholders across landscapes. As Erbaugh et al. (2020, p. 1) note: 2 The Bonn Challenge is a global goal to bring 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested landscapes into restoration by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030. 3 See, for example, the AFR100 (the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative) and the 20x20 Initiative for Latin America.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51413325-5de8-411d-95ae-77a72ffed58f": {"__data__": {"id_": "51413325-5de8-411d-95ae-77a72ffed58f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in the Republic of Cyprus: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d77ba4a0ff745007ca74c76cb15f32b64de84e8ea5a62641ba0edac2a233d58"}, "2": {"node_id": "da3659d3-8d36-4ec4-aea4-cbe077f0a412", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ffad8bdb03435af2c4f5063940badc85e0e76293e089fdc08fcfc79ac844ce4"}}, "hash": "30126d70bd48f9c6ac537e9abeb832d451097f9b8444ef6495d995fe50409ca1", "text": "2 While \u201c[f]orest restoration occupies centre stage in global conversations about carbon removal and biodiversity conservation\u2026 recent research rarely acknowledges social dimensions or environmental justice implications related to its implementation\u2026 Forest landscape restoration that prioritizes local communities by affording them rights to manage and restore forests provides a promising option to align global agendas for climate mitigation, conservation, environmental justice and sustainable development.\u201d The governance aspects of FLR intervention design and implementation are critical, including how and by whom decisions are made, and how costs and benefits are distributed (e.g. Adams et al., 2016; Reed et al., 2016; Walters et al., 2019).

The large areas over which FLR is planned (through processes such as ROAM) concern many rights-holders and stakeholders with different rights, interests and power relationships. For example, in Madagascar\u2019s Fandriana-Marolambo landscape, WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature) International, with the endorsement of the Government of Madagascar, raised funding from the French government in 2004 to implement a FLR programme in a landscape with 150,000 people from three different ethnic groups. These communities were initially wary of engaging in the project. As a result, significant adjustments had to be made to the project once it had started (Mansourian et al., 2016). While concerns were ultimately addressed, this example demonstrates, inter alia, the importance of ensuring that the vision and priorities of local peoples and communities are reflected in and drive initial FLR conceptualisation and planning. This publication focuses on ROAM rather than comprehensively considering FLR governance. ROAM aims to operationalise FLR principles and is a widely used methodology for identifying and prioritising FLR strategies and initiatives. Accordingly, a ROAM process contributes to the entire FLR process (including design, implementation and monitoring) and is a means to an end \u2013 not the end in itself. In different FLR phases, distinct aspects of governance may take on more importance (Mansourian, 2016). For ROAM, governance issues related to FLR planning and initiation tend to be most important/prominent. Furthermore, governance opportunities and challenges in the landscape will largely define how the ROAM process is carried out and what outcomes it generates. Key issues may relate, for instance, to tenure conflict (Lovelock & Brown, 2020; McLain et al., 2021) or lack of cross-sectoral coordination (Mansourian, 2017). Therefore, the rights-holders and stakeholders convening and participating in the ROAM process need to consider not only the state of governance in the landscapes in which restoration opportunities are being assessed, but also prioritise effective and equitable FLR strategies and approaches that can adapt to a changing governance context over time. ROAM guidance and processes address governance issues to varying extents and in evolving ways. A more systematic integration of natural resource governance principles can add value to ROAM.

With respect to both guidance and practice, the analysis considers, as much as possible, the process (e.g. how ROAM assessments are, or are meant to be, governed) and content (e.g. how governance issues in the target landscapes are, or are meant to be, considered during those processes). Audience: This publication aims to support ROAM practitioners, including conveners, coordinators, facilitators and other participants in the process. Some recommendations also pertain to ROAM guidance and training. It assumes that the reader is familiar with ROAM, including its phases and main steps. Methodology: Primary analysis methods used are: (1) review of the most relevant ROAM guidance; (2) analysis of four ROAM processes (from assessments in Colombia, Indonesia, Malawi and Rwanda) based on interviews and document review; and (3) additional research, including review of selected literature. The analysis also considers some recent changes in ROAM practice and training. It uses the NRGF as its primary lens and takes into account FLR principles. Case analysis: Cases were selected in collaboration with the IUCN Forest Conservation Programme5 and IUCN regional offices. Each case provides lessons for how governance has been \u2013 and could further be \u2013 integrated into ROAM processes. Collectively, the cases cover diverse regions, demonstrate a range of strengths and challenges, and include a variety of institutional partners. Each individual case had sufficient documentation available and associated points of contact willing to share reflections, included IUCN as a supporting partner and had completed all phases of ROAM.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a108bc16-8f76-416f-8725-3a4086c6fb39": {"__data__": {"id_": "a108bc16-8f76-416f-8725-3a4086c6fb39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in the Republic of Cyprus: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb7398b41e0a9e4cc509164e4e12be252c4548eadb0a83a20c4f7e0ec54d8908"}, "2": {"node_id": "e8b492a8-cf33-4ac2-86ac-17a9c38e8815", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c017a4d914bcf931850697e7fb2507506d8f6188817bc89b65c3d92fe3521187"}}, "hash": "839ea18fb465ec88b9e360027857530dec2feed035956631350b6ae28accfa53", "text": "Interviews were held with at least three key informants per case.

Therefore, while most practice-related findings and lessons are drawn from the four focal cases, the analysis also considers recent innovations in ROAM approaches, based on co- authors\u2019 experience and interviewee and reviewer inputs. Comprehensiveness: While this analysis aims to be fairly comprehensive, there is always more to learn. Interviews were largely limited to individuals from convening organisations. They do not include direct accounts from participating community members. This should be a priority for future analysis. Although interviewees were generally open, it was difficult to obtain information about certain issues, including aspects of accountability. This may be due in part to budget constraints that limited the time available for research and necessitated remote interviews. 4 Where data was available, the analysis also considers impacts, including how and to what extent ROAM has resulted in FLR coordination or implementation. 5 This refers to the name of the programme at the time that this publication was developed. FCP is now integrated into the IUCN Forest and Grassland Team. 4 2 Alignment between NRGF and FLR principles The analysis in this publication was undertaken using the NRGF, an IUCN knowledge resource created to provide a robust, inclusive and credible approach to assessing and improving natural resource governance. At its core is a normative framework of values, principles and criteria for equitable and effective natural resource governance (Springer et al., 2021; see also Annex 1). The NRGF aims to be applicable to diverse levels and natural resource governance contexts, including restoration. This analysis also takes account of the FLR principles agreed to by the Global Partnership on FLR (GPFLR) in 2018, which ROAM seeks to operationalise and advance.6 These principles unpack and describe the FLR process. Table 1 shows the alignment between these two sets of principles. Several points of caution are necessary in understanding this alignment mapping. Firstly, the two sets of principles reflect different objects: a normative framework for governance (NRGF) versus largely descriptive elements of a long-term forest landscape restoration process (FLR). Secondly, they address different subjects. NRGF principles focus on governance, while FLR principles focus on many dimensions of FLR (including governance). In particular, and in keeping with some of the most widely used definitions of FLR, the FLR principles reflect, among others, FLR\u2019s: (1) dual social-ecological dimensions; (2) scale (the landscape); and (3) long-term nature. Finally, the mapping only considers principles. The fuller meaning of NRGF principles is elaborated in criteria that consider, inter alia, the laws and policies, processes and practices that enable their realisation (see Annex 1). Despite these differences, governance is intrinsic to many FLR principles and thus, many of the NRGF principles can apply to and reinforce those of FLR. At the same time, the NRGF generally goes further in describing key elements of effective and equitable governance. Therefore, the NRGF can add value and deepen the approach to governance within ROAM, as part of longer-term FLR. Specifically, the mapping exercise (Table 1) highlights that: \u2212 Two principles, concerning participation and the recognition and inclusion of diverse knowledge and cultures, apply relatively strongly to both NRGF and FLR. \u2212 Three NRGF principles are moderately aligned with/reflected in FLR principles. \u2212 Three NRGF principles are weakly aligned with/reflected in FLR principles. \u2212 Two NRGF principles do not appear to be considered in the FLR principles, namely: accountability and fair and effective rule of law. \u2212 One FLR principle (maintain and enhance natural ecosystems within landscapes) does not map explicitly with any NRGF principle but reflects instead an underlying NRGF value. 6 The FLR principles have seen many iterations. The most widely agreed upon are those articulated by the GPFLR (see Besseau et al., 2018, Fig. 4, p. 18). ROAM initially worked with eight principles, which were broadly similar to those from GPFLR (see IUCN & WRI, 2014).

The governance related lessons from each case are then analysed in Section 5, in relation to NRGF principles. As described in Section 1.2 (Scope and methods), these cases were selected in collaboration with IUCN, based on the criteria that they each had sufficient information available, included IUCN as a partner, and had completed all ROAM phases, as well as collectively covering diverse regions and lessons. 4.1 Colombia11 Restoration has become a key activity for Colombia to achieve its national conservation priorities and international commitments. The ROAM process in eastern Antioquia identified options for increased connectivity between landscapes, ecosystems and habitats, and provided insight into the potential for FLR in post-conflict Colombia (see Table 3). The process positioned FLR as a key activity to address the 2016 peace agreement, including through enabling alternative livelihood options for the 600,000 displaced people returning to previously occupied conflict zones.

Eastern Antioquia has been strongly impacted by the country\u2019s 50-year conflict, where many people were kidnapped or killed or have fled to escape the conflict. The Antioquia region as a whole includes 20% of those who were displaced (over one million people) (Buitrago & Valencia, 2013). The high p\u00e1ramo (high-elevation ecosystem) still contains anti-personnel mines and many \u2018no-go zones\u2019. The 2016 peace accord impacts land use because it includes the creation of a fund to provide three million 11 Case background draws on ROAM report (Isaacs-Cubides et al., 2017) and key informant interviews. 12 For more information, please see: https://banco2.com/. 12 hectares of land to the most impacted rural communities. These lands are expected to come from the update, demarcation and strengthening of forest reserves, and communities are expected to develop plans to protect the environment and manage it sustainably (Bustos & Jaramillo, 2016). At the national level, Colombia\u2019s 2013\u20132023 National Restoration Plan (MADS, 2013) promotes restoration of degraded ecosystems while recognising traditional uses that do not degrade ecosystems. The plan has three priorities: (1) ecological restoration; (2) rehabilitation; and (3) reclamation. Each priority includes corresponding actions, objectives and indicators, which are to be carried out over 20 years in the short term (three years), medium term (eight years) and long term (20 years). In Antioquia, multi-stakeholder dialogues were a key component of the ROAM process. Their outputs provided policy makers with options for strengthening territorial management. These options are informed by policy, legal and financial analyses, and many seek to build on initiatives already initiated by CORNARE.13 The ROAM process in Colombia also included a study of financial incentives for restoration as well as the identification and prioritisation of restoration opportunities in eastern Antioquia. Following the process, Grupo Argos S.A (a Colombian conglomerate with large investments in the cement and energy industries) and Celsia (Grupo Argos S.A\u2019s energy company, which owns hydro, thermal and wind power generation plants in Antioquia) financed pilot restoration projects in the six prioritised areas identified from the ROAM process. This form of FLR financing highlights both the potential for ROAM outputs to inform longer-term FLR initiatives and the importance of such initiatives being implemented through continued rights-holder and stakeholder engagement and monitoring, with accountability for social and environmental impacts. 4.2 Indonesia14 The ROAM process in Gorontalo, Sulawesi, Indonesia was initiated to assess mangrove FLR opportunities in a landscape where 5,304 hectares (out of an original 8,847 hectares) of mangrove forests had been converted to aquaculture ponds over the past two decades (see Table 4). The Tanjung Panjang Landscape includes a National Nature Reserve (TPNR) and a District-level Conservation Forest Management Unit (FMU-C), both of which had been illegally deforested for aquaculture use. The ROAM process included three phases: (1) planning and preparation; (2) data collection and analysis; and (3) results to recommendations. Phase 1 involved an inception workshop with 19 participants from 13 institutions, as well as an independent stakeholder analysis performed by the research team. Phase 2 involved field data collection, including stakeholder interviews, economic costs and benefits analysis and biophysical research to inform restoration opportunities mapping. The restoration opportunity mapping took place during a second workshop, attended by 42 participants representing 20 stakeholder groups from local government agencies, NGOs, the local fish farming community of Tanjung Panjang and academia.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30dd022f-3150-4989-abfd-8a6d06c6ec4a": {"__data__": {"id_": "30dd022f-3150-4989-abfd-8a6d06c6ec4a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in the Republic of Cyprus: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8764417516e82e4e4d4c473629edf614a24d13bcedc10fffea69d55c551f51a9"}, "2": {"node_id": "7eee03a9-ec48-48ca-bb7b-f26aa4d4498c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0da6aea08230be27888d2b465d0f4258058651f9eaa6423c37ac67589f213184"}}, "hash": "9320e21f95bc9d7d7a859cd75e9148d67ad8b2a7071f2a859757f7d66068a03e", "text": "The participants were given information about the collected data, which they then used to collectively construct an historical timeline of mangrove restoration-related policy and governance in the landscape.

Phase 3 involved a validation workshop with 24 representatives from 14 institutions. During this workshop, the three restoration scenarios were adopted as phases of restoration. This phased approach was later ratified by the Provincial Planning Agency (BAPPEDA). Although the ROAM process resulted in consensus, clear concerns and barriers emerged during the process. The concerns became more evident once private sector funding was offered for the full restoration scenario, but was rejected by stakeholders for fear of inciting conflict or resulting in leakage.16 Stakeholders are currently interested in implementing phases 1 and 2, which would restore 2.5% and 15.9% of the deforested landscape, respectively. 4.3 Malawi17 In 2016, Malawi made a 4.5 million hectare national restoration commitment to the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100)18 and the Bonn Challenge (two million hectares by 2020 and 2.5 million hectares by 2030). Prior to their commitments, a pilot ROAM process was conducted in the Liwonde Forest Reserve by the Department of Forestry, USAID and WRI. Malawi then conducted a ROAM process in 2016 at both the national and local levels with support from IUCN, WRI and USAID. A multi-sector Task Force was organised to guide the process (see Table 5). 15 More recently, Presidential Instruction No. 120 (2020) defined supportive processes to enable realisation of this 2045 commitment, including a feasibility assessment, livelihoods support and improved governance to ensure conservation of restored mangroves. 16 Leakage in this context refers to the unanticipated increase in deforestation elsewhere. 17 Case background draws on ROAM report (Ministry of Natural Resources, Energy and Mining (MNREM) Malawi, 2017) and key informant interviews. 18 For more information, see https://afr100.org/. 14 Table 5.

The country has adopted related policies and plans that prioritise the forest sector, such as: \u2212 The Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy, which elaborates a programme to increase forest cover to 30% of the country\u2019s land area; \u2212 Vision 2020, the national development plan; and \u2212 The national Green Growth and Climate Resilient Strategy, which aims to enable development of a climate-resilient and low-carbon economy by 2050. 19 BMZ is Germany\u2019s Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. 20 UKAid is the UK Department for International Development. 21 Case background draws on ROAM report (Ministry of Natural Resources\u2013Rwanda, 2014) and key informant interviews. 15 Table 6.

The government aims to expand opportunities for investment in FLR over the long-term by creating enabling conditions for social enterprises, donors and investors. It also aims to meet its related international development and environmental commitments. These include commitments under AFR100, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs), e.g. the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) Land Degradation Neutrality Target, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Aichi Targets. In 2014, the Government of Rwanda, in partnership with IUCN and WRI, carried out a national forest restoration assessment using ROAM (see Table 6), in part to define how it would meet its commitment under the Bonn Challenge. The assessment identified forest restoration potential from expanding agroforestry (1,110,476 hectares), changing management in woodlots (255,930 hectares) and timber plantations (17,849 hectares), and restoring natural forests (13,933 hectares) and protected forests (128,191 hectares). The assessment report also noted a need for capacity building in the forestry sector, which had yet to fully recover from loss of knowledge and human resources due to the 1994 genocide (Ministry of Natural Resources\u2013Rwanda, 2014). The assessment showed that, for it to succeed, the strong FLR commitment from the government must be supported by an equally strong, coordinated effort by civil society, development partners and donors. The Rwanda ROAM process and its outputs have had a strong impact on FLR. For example, since 2015, they have directly informed IUCN FLR projects in the Eastern provinces (Clear Horizon Consulting, 2016) and influenced the execution of the GEF-funded Landscape Approach to Forest Restoration and Conservation (LAFREC) project, which commenced in January 2015 in the Gishwati-Mukura corridor and surrounding forest landscapes.24 22 BMU is Germany\u2019s Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety. 23 DFID was the UK\u2019s Department for International Development.

The aim is not to evaluate or compare these cases, each of which is a rich story in its own right. Rather, this section draws broad lessons from across the cases to inform the recommendations in Section 6. It also briefly introduces NRGF principles and criteria and their relevance for FLR and ROAM (see also Annex 1).25 Principle 1: Inclusive decision-making Relevance of principle In the NRGF, inclusive decision-making means that \u201cdecision-making regarding natural resource policies and practices is based on the full and effective participation of all relevant actors, with particular attention to the voice and inclusion of rights-holders and groups at risk of marginalization\u201d (Springer et", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fcf154bc-9caf-4eee-81ab-7a6c0203873b": {"__data__": {"id_": "fcf154bc-9caf-4eee-81ab-7a6c0203873b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in the Republic of Cyprus: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "97736b5cdde16fcf05c3d9cc23466ae71a4f42d21b8e0036163c22a946317771"}, "3": {"node_id": "287cd8b7-f62f-4d6c-881d-5c75cb06d50d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3a95a87003b6d1747020a60545d8c248088a921d6e73e9458425f80deb3f9c0"}}, "hash": "93ccbe00aadb9e511ac46065608fe44421e526744d54617a3ea52fe9f2184ea5", "text": "al., 2021, p. v). The criteria for realising this principle include having legal and policy frameworks that mandate inclusion, as well as having socially and culturally appropriate processes that enable full and effective participation in practice. Inclusive decision-making requires, inter alia, rights holder and stakeholder capacity, access to information and appropriate support, as well as recognition and respect for the right to FPIC (Springer et al., 2021). Sustainable forest management practices and guidance acknowledge that inclusion is important for both ethical and practical (e.g. implementation facilitation) reasons (Ananda, 2007). Inclusive decision-making in FLR helps ensure legitimacy of interventions (van Oosten et al., 2019). When decisions to plant trees are made for political reasons and/or in a top-down manner, implementation may be hampered by a lack of funding, engagement or other obstacles (e.g. Wiegant et al., 2020). Participation in environmental decision- making is also a procedural right in itself and a key aspect of exercising other human rights. Inclusion means more than a \u2018seat at the table\u2019. It concerns who has (and who does not have) power and voice, and why. Where restoration is implemented at large scales, as with FLR, more rights-holders and stakeholders are involved, adding to the complexity of ensuring inclusive decision-making. Within FLR, it is therefore critically important to consider inequitable power relations in multi-stakeholder processes (Hjortso et al., 2005), such as in mangrove restoration (Thompson, 2018). Key findings Convening stakeholders and policy makers to identify restoration opportunities is central to ROAM processes. The cases show an overarching orientation towards inclusive stakeholder engagement. They also highlight challenges in enabling full and effective participation in practice. Convenors: ROAM processes are typically convened by governments and/or large national institutions (often in collaboration with international actors such as IUCN). It is less clear whether/how communities in the targeted landscapes are part of initial discussions. This is an area for further exploration. 25 While this section is structured as a principle-by-principle analysis, the principles are also inter-related and mutually reinforcing; some key interlinkages are noted. 17 Gender inclusiveness: Gender inclusiveness in ROAM processes varies. Gender mainstreaming in the Malawi assessment enabled considerable attention to gender roles and labour issues, particularly for women. The Malawi ROAM report suggests ways to improve women\u2019s inclusion and empowerment (MNREM Malawi, 2017). In Indonesia, the assessment (focused on negotiating between government and fish farmers) tried to encourage women\u2019s participation, but did not conduct a gender analysis, sensitisation or action-planning.26 Who is included? Who decides? Convenors typically decide which groups to invite based on stakeholder analysis and mapping. This analysis should be inclusive, well-informed and unbiased. In Indonesia, an independent organisation conducted additional stakeholder mapping to help ensure decisions were not made by any specific convenor. Rights-holders and stakeholders may also decline or limit their engagement. This choice should be respected, although it can also pose challenges and should prompt convenors to ask whether the process can be improved. For example, opportunity mapping in Indonesia could not resolve issues around fish farmers\u2019 livelihood requirements, in part because their direct participation was limited by their organisation\u2019s choice to send only two representatives, with positions prepared in advance. Furthermore, the Indonesian ministry responsible for natural resource law enforcement would not attend ROAM workshops, which eroded trust in the process and weakened the ability of people to hold the ministry accountable through the process.27 Representation: Inclusion in ROAM processes often involves representative rather than direct participation, e.g. having representatives from multiple communities in landscape-level processes (as in Colombia) or nested representation in national level processes (as in Rwanda). Ensuring trusted, self-determined representation is crucial \u2013 and often challenging.28 In Colombia, the assessment involved the junta de acci\u00f3n comunal, a community-level committee representing rural organisations. Juntas supported and coordinated with technicians during the assessment, including to ensure they were speaking to the right people. They have convening power at the community level and can help represent communities, including by relaying messages between the community and higher political levels. At the same time, some people felt that their representatives did not represent all community members\u2019 interests.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "287cd8b7-f62f-4d6c-881d-5c75cb06d50d": {"__data__": {"id_": "287cd8b7-f62f-4d6c-881d-5c75cb06d50d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in the Republic of Cyprus: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "97736b5cdde16fcf05c3d9cc23466ae71a4f42d21b8e0036163c22a946317771"}, "2": {"node_id": "fcf154bc-9caf-4eee-81ab-7a6c0203873b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "93ccbe00aadb9e511ac46065608fe44421e526744d54617a3ea52fe9f2184ea5"}}, "hash": "b3a95a87003b6d1747020a60545d8c248088a921d6e73e9458425f80deb3f9c0", "text": "Appropriate formats: Full and effective participation requires appropriate formats \u2013 including with respect to time, location, language, facilitation methods, etc. (see Recommendation 5).

This should include information about the process and its potential benefits, risks and limitations.29 Trust: Trust (and trustworthiness) are important factors in inclusion and other governance principles. For example, in Colombia, communities were understandably wary of another planning process and tool from the outside. The university played an important role in facilitating discussions, responding to communities\u2019 concerns about the ROAM process and highlighting potential benefits. Trust between these partners had grown over time, allowing the university to work closely with communities, including to share information. Questions from communities included whether restoring land would result in it being taken from them. Power dynamics and their impact on inclusion and voice: Power relationships influence who participates and how they participate. Not taking power dynamics into account in participatory processes can have unintended outcomes such as recognising some actors while inadvertently excluding others (Walters et al., 2019). Even in ostensibly inclusive processes, those with more power can easily have more influence on the 26 Notably, these assessments were planned before publication of the ROAM Gender Guidelines. Further, more recent ROAM training includes content on gender inclusion and responsiveness. 27 See Box 1 for more information about willingness of different groups to participate in this ROAM process. 28 This also relates closely to issues of appropriate institutional choice across scales, discussed under Principle 4. 29 Inclusion also requires that community members and other rights-holders and stakeholders know their rights (see Principle 10) and have space to effectively share their own learning and knowledge (see Principle 3). 18 process and its outcomes. For example, in Colombia, decisions about who to include in the ROAM process were largely made by one government institution, whose choices likely reflected historical and political factors. Murcia et al. (2016), in reviewing restoration projects in Colombia, found that the vast majority were designed and implemented by government agencies with little to no local stakeholder participation. In Indonesia, the assessment brought together numerous government, NGO and academic stakeholders. However, while community rights-holders and stakeholders were represented, direct community participation was limited (some communities chose not to participate due in part to lack of interest in the process and, as noted above, fish farmers opted to send only two representatives) and power dynamics limited community members\u2019 voice in the multi- stakeholder process. The main land users (fish farmers) settled in the protected areas in the last two decades and have no formal rights or decision-making power over the lands in question (see Box 1). Such limits to participation were later addressed through household interviews and qualitative content analysis (Brown, 2021) conducted to amplify the fish farmers\u2019 concerns that were not raised during multi-stakeholder meetings due to these power dynamics. Resources: The assessment in Malawi involved a district-level participatory process, including \u2018stocktaking\u2019 meetings with stakeholders in their localities, district level technical groups and mobilised communities. This was enabled by the availability of substantial funds. In contrast, in Colombia, while the ROAM process convenors\u2019 intention was to reach many local communities, in practice relatively few were represented, due in part to insufficient funds to support engagement. Beyond funding, meaningful participation requires appropriate skills (e.g. to facilitate effective and equitable multi-stakeholder processes), time (with some groups needing substantially more, including to meet in advance if they wish), and other resources. Inclusion beyond ROAM: ROAM processes often establish or strengthen multi-stakeholder platforms for FLR. For example, in Rwanda, partners established an inter-ministerial platform that interviewees felt enhanced FLR participation and coordination. One interviewee noted that there are now youth movements for FLR across the country and that extension workers proactively reach out to women to participate in FLR activities. Interviewees also indicated that the ROAM process strengthened inclusive decision-making regarding natural resource governance more generally by focusing on village residents\u2019 participation. These multi-stakeholder ROAM/FLR platforms provide the potential for sustained participation in FLR beyond the assessment period. There are also important considerations about the governance of these platforms, such as whether they build on existing institutions (versus creating new ones) and are accountable and inclusive, including of Indigenous peoples and local communities. In summary, participation is clearly central to ROAM processes. However, ensuring full and effective participation across levels is challenging. It requires commitment, power-sharing, facilitation skills, time and financial resources, and a deep understanding of the context, among others.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82e77725-79e0-4df6-8345-f8a7cf42631e": {"__data__": {"id_": "82e77725-79e0-4df6-8345-f8a7cf42631e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in the Republic of Cyprus: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e0fcfa2fdff7f3226832e8514975a0abc70ab4f5b609f83f49f21546e83fbde6"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd34e1e0-1c69-4932-8e2c-7402a3572401", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ceb5a2f79df523ca6a1d80feee31e21d19e66f54a54d57e63b61c7c5109c1e0"}}, "hash": "a7f7d7990584cd95e32ea831652a366947640bef7abaae5464f431d33b86802a", "text": "More sharing of experiences and guidance on enabling full and effective participation in ROAM processes would be beneficial.

NRGF criteria concern, among others, the existence of laws/policies/rules, processes and capacities to recognise, respect and enforce land and resource rights (Springer et al., 2021, p. 7). As summarised by Larsen and Springer (2016, p. 5): \u201cTenure rights with regard to natural resources refer to the social relations and institutions governing access to and use of land and resources (von Benda-Beckmann, von Benda-Beckmann, and Wiber 2006). Tenure rights determine who is allowed to use which resources, in what way, for how long and under what conditions, as well as who is entitled to transfer rights to others and how (Larson 2012). Tenure rights are often described as a \u201cbundle of rights\u201d comprised of rights to access, use, manage, exclude others from, and alienate land and resources (Schlager and Ostrom 1992). Different rights in the bundle may be shared or divided in a number of ways and among stakeholders, along with the obligations and responsibilities associated with rights.\u201d Appropriately recognising and supporting Indigenous peoples\u2019 and local communities\u2019 collective rights to lands, territories, water and natural resources is crucial for equitable and effective biodiversity conservation, including in light of their contributions to global environmental sustainability (see Dawson et al., 2021; ICCA Consortium, 2021). In FLR, tenure is important with respect to land and territories, forests, trees and goods and services from the trees (Mansourian & Sgard, 2019). Secure and fair tenure rights are important to equitable and sustainable restoration (McLain et al., 2021; Nagendra, 2007), while insecure tenure and the inability to resolve tenure issues are barriers to effective and equitable FLR (Lovelock & Brown, 2020). Persistent challenges include insecure or unclear rights to trees and forests, insecure and/or inequitable rights for women, lack of statutory requirements for landholders to restore land, and conflicts over forest ecosystem services amongst communities, commercial concessions and governments (McLain et al., 2021). Key findings ROAM processes grapple with tenure in varying ways. Tenure security can be considered as a \u2018bottle neck\u2019 or \u2018success factor\u2019. However, tenure rights and systems are rarely addressed in depth. Scope of rights considered: Where tenure rights are addressed in ROAM processes, the focus is often (though not exclusively) on statutory land rights. For example, in Rwanda, the majority of people have title deeds because national policy requires all land to be registered. In line with this, both the ROAM process and the broader Rwanda FLR taskforce focus on respecting titled land rights. In Colombia, land tenure maps were used to help identify those with statutory land rights. These are important considerations. Recognising and respecting tenure rights also often goes beyond respecting land title deed. It involves recognising and appropriately supporting communal and individual statutory and customary rights over access, use and ownership of land and territories, water, trees and other natural resources. Respecting tenure rights requires understanding how tenure systems function in both law and practice (which may differ). Unrecognised or contested tenure: ROAM processes are often implemented in landscapes where tenure rights are unclear, unrecognised, contested, shifting or otherwise insecure. It is important in ROAM processes to understand the tenure systems in the landscape, including any concerns and grievances. For example, engaging only those who currently hold secure, statutory tenure may lead to inequitable results, e.g. by excluding people(s) whose rights are not appropriately recognised in that statutory system. At the same time, FLR initiatives must ensure respect for human rights, even where tenure is not secure. In Indonesia, analysis of the ROAM process highlights the challenge and importance of meaningfully including and addressing the 20 human rights and well-being of land-users who do not have recognised tenure rights, and are therefore vulnerable to bearing the costs of, but being excluded from the benefits of, restoration (see Box 1).

While tenure rights were not directly addressed in the Malawi assessment, they were touched on in the Diagnostic (e.g. as a barrier to restoration) and through work on community forests. The work on community forests aims to reduce pressure on nearby protected areas and bring resource use in community forests closer to users, especially women. While not specifically raised in the cases analysed here, many regions where FLR might be implemented are facing widespread land grabbing and mass migration. Tenure rights are dynamic and complex, but it is crucial that they are understood within ROAM processes and reflected in the restoration priorities identified. Enabling discussions on tenure: Even where the ROAM process cannot resolve tenure issues, understanding the challenges and (in appropriate ways) making them visible during the process can have additional benefits, such as opening or advancing dialogues among rights-holders and stakeholders. In Indonesia, while ROAM had little direct influence on tenure laws/policies, government authorities involved in the process considered increasing community access to some areas for sustainable use. In Rwanda, interviewees felt that the process strengthened recognition and respect for tenure rights, including in the FLR projects it informed. In summary, case analysis shows that ROAM processes frequently contend with tenure (and other inter- connected procedural and substantive rights), whether by default or design. More in-depth and systematic guidance and training on taking account of tenure, including to clearly identify customary and statutory rights and related concerns in the landscape, could enhance the ROAM process. This can, in turn, contribute to the effectiveness, equity and sustainability of the FLR initiatives identified and prioritised through the process. Box 1. Inclusion and voice in the context of contested tenure: reflections from the ROAM process in Tanjung Panjang by Benjamin Brown, PhD, Research Associate at Charles Darwin University Research Institute for Environment and Livelihoods and Co-Founder of Blue Forests (Yayasan Hutan Biru) The ROAM process in Indonesia demonstrates the importance and challenge of enabling full and effective participation of all rights-holders and stakeholders in the landscape, including those who lack formal or recognised tenure rights. Two communities lived in or used the Tanjung Panjang landscape on a subsistence basis prior to large- scale conversion of mangroves, which began in 2000. Terrestrial farmers from the Gorontaloan community lived in the area behind the mangrove forests, utilising the mangrove area only minimally, as the resources in the upper watershed and terrestrial area behind the coast and were rich and more easily accessible. Capture fishers from Bugis, Bajau, Siau and Gorontaloan suku (ethnic groups) living to the East or West of the Tanjung Panjang peninsula frequently fished the rich waters offshore from the mangroves, occasionally entering the forest for subsistence gathering of crab and molluscs. These traditional uses have continued but at a reduced level, as the mangrove forest has been degraded. It is important to remember that no community tenure (access, use) rights are recognised within the mangrove forests of the Strict Nature Reserve, which comprises half of the peninsula) and was gazetted in 1995. 21 Box 1 (continued) From 2000 to present day, 5,304 hectares of the original 8,847 hectares of mangrove forest across the entire District of Pohuwato were converted to brackish water aquaculture ponds. Most of the fish farmers working these ponds relocated from South Sulawesi, many settling and establishing fish farms in areas where they did not have formal land rights. Currently, up to 8,000 fish farmers and their families live in the area, integrated to some extent with the Gorontalo farming community. The median income of a fish farming household is US$ 14,074 per year (compared to US$ 2,880 average annual income for the province), posing a significant opportunity cost to mangrove restoration. During the stakeholder analysis to identify participants for the ROAM process, members of these three communities were interviewed to determine their degree of interest in the process and in mangrove FLR (MFLR). The interviewed Gorontalo farmers showed little interest in ROAM or MFLR, as they felt their agrarian livelihoods were not impacted by mangrove loss, and they were glad for the economic contribution of the fish farmers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae17d384-48e8-4ec1-9bab-1c3b2f721233": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae17d384-48e8-4ec1-9bab-1c3b2f721233", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in the Republic of Cyprus: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b4290f940a047693a09291b13911f3ef0d76e05eb59695157c04385267a2575"}, "2": {"node_id": "b4045535-5bf2-4808-8d3a-ed2f7c4cebd0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b43aa58c0114d2089705acaf768e9e6e14720a09524eb3411fb1498667b55db"}}, "hash": "75e89aa94cbe704948fcbfc62b4858cc42ea726cd5bfdac79794b99e4cf7ee61", "text": "Capture fishers expressed interest in the results of MFLR to enhance offshore fisheries populations but were un-willing to participate in the ROAM process, stating that they did not wish to become involved in the politics of the situation, which they felt were between the fish farmers, park managers and authorities.

Throughout the ROAM process, 42 participants representing 20 institutions attended three workshops: (1) introductory; (2) restoration opportunity mapping; and (3) validation. By the end of the workshop series, participant consensus was reached on a three-phase approach to MFLR totalling 113 hectares, 842 hectares and 2493 hectares of restoration respectively for each phase. This three-phase approach was adopted in Province of Gorontalo Spatial (RTRW) and Development Plans (RPJM) in 2018. Later in 2018, substantial private finance was offered to implement the three-phases of MFLR. However, at that stage, stakeholders rejected the financing offer over concerns of potential conflict and/or leakage (i.e. policy or practice change in one place that causes unanticipated increase in deforestation in other places) if MFLR were implemented. Noting that power inequities in the multi-stakeholder forums may have inhibited fish farmers and other stakeholders from sharing their true concerns, 22 interviews were carried out with fish farmer households and extension workers, and qualitative content analysis (Erlingsson & Brysiewicz, 2017) was performed to uncover latent themes that did not emerge during ROAM workshops. Based on the themes uncovered during these interviews, as well as discussions in the ROAM meetings, five socio-economic concerns with MFLR were identified: (1) issues around the legality of providing compensation to those considered to be \u201cillegal\u201d land users; (2) the expressed desire of fish farmers to continue farming for five to 20 years; (3) lack of fish farmer access to future benefits from MFLR; (4) lack of viable commensurate livelihood alternatives in the landscape, due to lack of land ownership/tenure by current land users (fish farmers); and (5) concerns about conflict being exacerbated if MFLR were to proceed. In addition to these major themes, 16 social, economic and political barriers were identified that inhibited or restricted MFLR. In summary, this case highlights the challenge and importance of ensuring that the ROAM process meaningfully includes and addresses the human rights and well-being of land-users who do not have recognised tenure rights, and are therefore vulnerable to bearing the costs of, but being excluded from, the benefits of restoration. These are not \u2018outlier\u2019 cases; they are common in deforested and degraded landscapes, and as such warrant attention in ROAM guidance and processes. 22 Principle 3: Recognition of and respect for diverse cultures, knowledge and institutions Relevance of principle Recognition of and respect for diverse cultures, knowledge and institutions calls for \u201cnatural resource governance\u2026 grounded in sound and diverse forms of knowledge and respect for diverse cultures, values and practices\u201d. It speaks to the importance of governance arrangements that respect cultural rights and enable people to contribute their diverse knowledge, innovation and capacity to sustaining nature, including through their own institutions and systems30 (Springer et al., 2021). Despite the importance of culture, Wehi and Lord (2017) find that it is rare to incorporate cultural practices in restoration. Indigenous and local knowledge systems remain underrepresented and, therefore, not properly integrated into restoration plans (Lake et al., 2018; Hernandez & Vogt, 2020). Appropriately recognising and including Indigenous and local knowledge and practice can enhance restoration effectiveness and scope, while upholding rights, as seen in Tanzania, Hawaii and South Korea (Walters et al., 2019; Lee & Krasny, 2015; Chang et al. 2020; Kurashima et al., 2020). It is also in keeping with the growing recognition and inclusion of diverse cultures and knowledge systems in international policy processes around ecosystem services, such as in the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) conceptual framework (see D\u00edaz-Reviriego et al., 2019).31 Key findings Rapid cultural assessment tool: The IUCN team in Eastern and Southern Africa developed a rapid cultural assessment tool consisting of 10 questions aimed at understanding and supporting the use of traditional and cultural knowledge in FLR (see Box 2).

For example, in Malawi, there was a focus on farmer-managed natural regeneration, a peer-to-peer technology transfer amongst farmers fostering natural regeneration of trees on their farms. ROAM processes may also include collective mapping and discussions about preferred local strategies, e.g. 30 The role of appropriate recognition and inclusion of local institutions and governance systems in ROAM processes, including those of Indigenous peoples and local communities, is discussed in relation to devolution (see NRGF Principle 4, next section). 31 As summarised by Diaz et al. (2018, p. 270), \u201cOne of the more recent key elements of the IPBES conceptual framework [\u2026] is the notion of nature's contributions to people (NCP), which builds on the ecosystem service concept popularized by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) [\u2026] NCP as defined and put into practice in IPBES differs from earlier work in several important ways. First, the NCP approach recognizes the central and pervasive role that culture plays in defining all links between people and nature. Second, use of NCP elevates, emphasizes, and operationalizes the role of Indigenous and local knowledge in understanding nature's contribution to people.\u201d 32 These community-conserved forests contain community graveyards. They are often small forests which have high cultural and biodiversity value. 33 In Malawi, customary leaders (Traditional Authorities) are formally recognised and hold a number of governing roles, including over customary land and resolution of related disputes. 34 For more information, see https://elti.yale.edu/about-elti. 23 for growing food. For instance, in Rwanda, the process included steps to help ensure that local people participated in choosing the native tree species they wanted on their land. One interviewee noted that Indigenous knowledge was important in this ROAM process, particularly in relation to sacred groves. Challenges and considerations: Case analyses also highlighted challenges and considerations for meaningfully and respectfully incorporating diverse knowledge and ways of knowing in ROAM processes, including: \u2212 Respecting knowledge-holders: Recognising and respecting diverse knowledge, including Indigenous and local knowledge, needs to be grounded in recognition and respect for diverse knowledge-holders. This includes respecting rights to FPIC. The ROAM process may be best approached as one of equitable knowledge co-generation and sharing (Austin et al., 2018). \u2212 Respecting different visions: Respecting diverse knowledge and cultural systems also means respecting diverse visions and perspectives regarding FLR, including where they do not align with those of ROAM process convenors. \u2212 Inclusiveness: Governance principles are inter-related. This principle (recognition and respect for diverse cultures, knowledge and institutions) is closely related to inclusive decision-making. People who are not meaningfully engaged in the process cannot effectively share their knowledge. This principle also relates to learning, as recognition of other knowledge systems can stimulate exchange. \u2212 Power dynamics: During an assessment process, power dynamics can impact whose knowledge is recognised and respected. For example, in Malawi, despite the direct and innovative way that cultural knowledge was accounted for in the assessment, the recognition of traditional knowledge was a political issue. As one interviewee noted, \u201cthere's always a tussle between the TAs [Traditional Authorities] and the nation-state authorities\u201d. In summary, this principle is central to ROAM, and FLR more broadly. Innovative approaches in ROAM processes in Malawi and Mozambique, including use of the survey tool (Box 2), could be adopted in other contexts. Likewise, knowledge co-generation and sharing approaches in more recent ROAM processes could be expanded. ROAM guidance and practice can also be strengthened through further integration of collaborative research approaches (including by and with local people) and guidance that supports more systematic recognition of diverse cultures and forms of knowledge, including Indigenous and local knowledge, with FPIC.

The FLR questions were derived and tested so that culture might be better taken into account in restoration programmes. The tool \u201810 culture questions for FLR\u2019 can be used as part of ROAM guidance and practices and included as one of the success or barrier factors in the Restoration Diagnostic (Hanson et al., 2015). The questions can be applied at the national, sub-national (e.g. district) or landscape level. Key informants who possess cultural knowledge are important interviewees, especially as cultural dimensions are often hidden or undisclosed within a landscape. Some knowledge is the domain of local communities or Indigenous peoples and will require free, prior, informed consent (FPIC) for its collection, use, storage and dissemination. The questions were applied in Malawi as key informant interviews (taking 14\u201360 mins to administer) and in the margins of workshops or during groupwork sessions. As culture is often ethnically distinct, different ethnic groups were interviewed. One particularly useful strategy was to apply the tool with traditional leaders who are custodians of culture and often play important roles in land governance in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Malawi, for example, the Traditional Authorities play an important and government- recognised role within communities and over land and natural resources. In Mozambique, the r\u00e9gulo (chief) plays a similar role. Interviews with TAs and r\u00e9gulos flagged the importance of involving traditional leadership, and, as a result, this involvement was strengthened during the FLR processes. The interviews also highlighted the presence of landscape features such as sacred groves \u2013 which are often nodes of local biodiversity and where local norms about landscape governance are often embedded and can affect whole landscapes \u2013 and the presence of species with specific cultural values. Overall, and depending on the context, cultural knowledge can be either a supporting factor or a barrier to restoration, and there may be different elements in a single culture that can work in different directions with regard to FLR. Successful restoration efforts may require the development of new, culturally sensitive knowledge about restoration, and this tool helps as a starting point. The \u201810 culture questions for FLR\u2019 are: 1. To what extent does culture influence FLR in the area? 2. What are the main themes or domains where culture influences FLR? a) Land, land tenure, governance and rights b) Specific landscapes, features in the landscape, specific sites (e.g. sacred natural sites) c) Specific plant and animal species (e.g. food, taboos and beliefs, medicines, construction) d) Arts and crafts e) Institutions and cultural leadership f) Spirituality and religion 25 Box 2 (continued) 3.

The NRGF focuses in part on recognition and support for Indigenous peoples\u2019 and local communities\u2019 roles, rights and governance systems. In many countries, decentralised natural resource governance is the main approach to devolution and is inscribed in law (Ribot & Larson, 2005), e.g. Malawi\u2019s 1998 National Decentralisation Policy. Other countries may require public consultation about natural resource rules. Even when supported by policy, decentralisation may not be implemented or effective in practice, due to limited resources or a lack of governmental will (Ribot et al., 2006). Further, decentralisation policies and practices may or may not recognise customary institutions. Devolution is important for FLR, particularly where it recognises and supports local actors as leaders and change agents in restoration, including Indigenous peoples and local communities. Devolution is not typically addressed in the wider restoration literature, but can be seen as fundamental to supporting collective action in restoration (Akello et al., 2017). Key findings ROAM process scale: Aligning the ROAM process with the social and ecological scales of the FLR initiatives that will follow is both critical and challenging. ROAM processes can be done at a single scale such as national or sub-national or at multiple scales such as a series of local/sub-national assessments followed by a national 26 assessment. The process scale often affects how devolution is considered. For example, a national-level process may not consider devolution to local authorities to the same extent as a sub-national process. However, restoration is implemented in specific sites. Strategies identified at national (or even landscape) scales may not be relevant for or respectful of local actors if they are not included in the process. Therefore, ROAM processes at any scale should centre local issues and actors, including Indigenous peoples and local communities (see Box 3). At the same time, local and landscape-level initiatives often require decisions or actions at multiple levels. For example, in Indonesia the assessment primarily concerned the landscape level, but key decisions had to be taken at the provincial level. Therefore, decision makers from the provincial level were included. Given this, devolution in ROAM processes is likely to be less about finding the \u2018right\u2019 scale and more about designing a process through which rights-holders, stakeholders and other decision makers can meaningfully connect across scales, with empowered inclusion of local actors in all cases. Devolution in ROAM is thus closely linked with coordination (see Principle 6). Institutional recognition and relationships: ROAM processes are implemented in partnership with various institutions. Recognising and working with appropriate institutions is crucial for the process to be fittingly devolved, as well as inclusive (see Principle 1), well-coordinated (see Principle 6) and accountable (see Principle 8). In Rwanda, interviewees reported that the ROAM process strengthened forest governance devolution by recognising the policy, finance and coordination roles of the central government, as well as the leadership across Rwanda\u2019s five provinces, 30 districts, 416 sectors, 2,148 cells and 14,837 villages. They acknowledged that FLR initiatives must have both strong \u2018bottom-up\u2019 and \u2018top- down\u2019 support and consent to be successful. The institutional relationships and pathways in ROAM processes often reflect national decentralisation law and policy. In Malawi, the process involved district level consultation and local government collaboration to align with the National Decentralisation Policy. As one interviewee noted, \"in Malawi, districts are implementers\". The district level has the administrative budgets and ability to locally implement national projects. Meanwhile, in Indonesia, the process involved stakeholders from across national, provincial, district and village-levels, but the institutional home was a provincial-level multi-stakeholder working group (and outcomes were captured in the Provincial Spatial Planning Policy), consistent with national decentralisation law.35 Prioritising devolved FLR: ROAM processes sometimes take account of whether and how decentralised restoration is enabled, e.g. in law and policy analysis. ROAM can also be an opportunity to further support devolution, e.g. by appropriately recognising and supporting Indigenous- and community-led restoration initiatives. In summary, the principle of devolution is important to both how the ROAM process is designed and what governance issues it considers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a5d3ac2-24d9-4fc6-be73-6755be64b22c": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a5d3ac2-24d9-4fc6-be73-6755be64b22c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in the Republic of Cyprus: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "977c3c729cc24302bf4e5c9a6313d4353acebfb27989d04127213387d5f674d7"}, "2": {"node_id": "23ecbeb0-585b-4e5e-9e81-efc6ce48fbb5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f951a6cd1c7ccd13094c9ad75a3d2c3e4d3f08db9ebb18542651a417d71b942b"}}, "hash": "7e4fac3be43b525f9ed30be13b0dae530a615fda4ba648e550922a401d3abc5e", "text": "Appropriate devolution can enable meaningful participation; recognise and support locally-governed restoration (including Indigenous- and community-led approaches); and allow restoration budgets to be attributed to local levels for implementation.36 35 Governance had previously devolved from the national level in Indonesia to the district level as part of a 2002 Regional Autonomy Law, but was re-positioned at the provincial level due to capacity and corruption issues at the district level. 36 Devolution is closely linked to the principles on inclusive decision-making, recognition of diverse knowledge, culture and institutions, coordination and accountability, among others. 27 Box 3.

The costs of not recognising the primary position of local people is that FLR programmes and projects may not be just, and will not stand the test of time, as they will not have the local leadership and \u2018ownership\u2019 that is critical for enduring success. ROAM processes can contribute to recognising and encouraging local leadership and ownership of FLR initiatives. When governments signed on to the Bonn Challenge to restore 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested landscapes around the world by 2020, and 350 million hectares by 2030, some, like the Malawi government, did so by listening to the needs of local communities. Before the government launched its National Forest Landscape Restoration Assessment (NFLRA) process in February 2016, it carried out a ROAM pilot assessment from October 2015 to February 2016 in Liwonde Forest Reserve, in the Machinga District. This included consultations with district officials and local people, including women and traditional leaders. The Malawi government initiated this bottom-up process before pledging 4.5 million hectares to the Bonn Challenge in September 2016 at the IUCN World Conservation Congress. The Government of Malawi maintains that its FLR process aims to achieve a higher quality of life for rural people alongside achieving national and global development targets. Malawi\u2019s consultations represent a good practice, achieved with support from the ROAM process. It ensures that FLR is bottom-up, avoiding situations where Indigenous peoples and local communities are implicitly coerced to support top-down decisions made by national governments without prior consultations. The Malawi case illustrates that FLR can and should follow a more inclusive path, which diverges from past histories of other natural resource interventions that have been pursued to the detriment of local people and without respect for their environmental and social rights. Indigenous peoples and local communities are often among the last actors and authorities to be informed, consulted and empowered in national and sub-national decision-making about natural resources. Token gestures like inviting representatives of local communities to regional, national and global dialogues, sometimes without ensuring that these representatives are freely chosen by local people, can be commonplace. The Malawi ROAM process implemented a different strategy by centring local institutions and actors. The local level should not be viewed as \u2018beneath\u2019 national and global actors in a vertical hierarchy; rather, national and global levels are constituted of local groups and serve local rights-holders and stakeholders. The local level is primary, and ROAM processes and FLR efforts and financing should fully invest in working with and at the local level. Principle 5: Strategic vision, direction and learning Relevance of principle Strategic vision, direction and learning calls for \u201cnatural resource governance [\u2026] guided by an overall vision of desired environmental and social outcomes, and allow[ing] for adaptation in response to learning and changing conditions.\u201d Vision and direction should be developed through \u201cinclusive processes that account for diverse values and forms of knowledge of rights-holders and stakeholders,\u201d considering present circumstances and future challenges. It requires, among others, \u201congoing monitoring, reflection and learning that enables responsiveness to changing conditions and needs\u201d (Springer et al., 2021). 28 For FLR, an adaptable vision informed by ongoing learning is important because restoration is a long-term process that needs to be integrated across diverse and dynamic landscapes. The landscape scale adds complexity in reaching a common vision for FLR because of its intrinsic diversity and plurality (van Oosten et al., 2019). Lesson learning is important for relatively new processes like FLR, but is missing in most interventions (Mansourian & Vallauri, 2020).

Some actors may already have a clear vision for whether and how they wish to support restoration, while others may wish to refine or create new visions and strategies and some may choose not to participate. In all cases, visions and strategies for restoration may or may not align with one another, or with those of ROAM convenors. Equity regarding whose visions and priorities related to FLR are prioritised through the ROAM process is therefore crucial, including ensuring that those of Indigenous peoples and local communities are recognised and respected. ROAM can seek a broadly shared but locally differentiated vision for FLR \u2013 e.g. a commitment to the Bonn Challenge implemented through diverse strategies, including Indigenous- and community-defined and led restoration and with respect for rights including to self-determination and FPIC. \u2212 Negotiated vision and strategies \u2013 Strategies may also be negotiated among participants. In Indonesia, the three distinct FLR visions (scenarios) initially developed through the ROAM process were eventually merged into a three-phased approach that would enable full restoration over 10-20 years. This three-phased approach was a compromise to enable sign-on by government bodies that would not agree to any strategy that they felt conflicted with formal government mandates, including a mandate to achieve full restoration. \u2212 Short-term and site-specific strategies integrated in a long-term landscape vision \u2013 Short- term and site-specific strategies can be part of the pathway to a long-term, landscape vision for equitable FLR. For example, small woodlots might ensure community fuelwood supply as other areas are designated for forest restoration or agroforestry systems. Embedding ROAM processes in existing visions and strategies: ROAM processes and FLR plans are often embedded in existing, related government visions, strategies or plans. For example, in Rwanda, FLR is aligned with the national forest policy and national transformation policy, and the ROAM process was seen as providing a roadmap to deliver these larger-scale visions. In Colombia, the ROAM process was embedded in the national restoration plan and seen as a way of delivering on the national restoration plan in eastern Antioquia. In Indonesia, participants noted how MFLR in Tanjung Panjang could contribute to national and 29 global policy and strategic commitments, such as Nationally Determined Contributions, National Blue Carbon Strategy, the national mangrove restoration policy, the 13th and 14th SDGs and the CBD Aichi Targets. Multi-directional learning grounded in historical and current context: The FLR vision and strategies resulting from the ROAM process are informed by numerous analyses. In this sense, learning is at the centre of the process. Which questions are asked (and unasked) in these analyses, and whose knowledge is (and is not) reflected in the answers, are therefore crucial considerations. The analyses informing the ROAM process should be inclusive and credible. Learning should be multi-directional, multi-scalar and inclusive (see Principle 3). The process should also reflect a deep understanding of the historical and current context, e.g. in analysing \u2018drivers of degradation\u2019 (see Box 4). Looking beyond the ROAM process: ROAM and FLR have different timelines. FLR visions and strategies developed during ROAM processes have to live beyond the assessment to be meaningful. Related challenges and considerations include: \u2212 Long-term learning and adaptation \u2013 The ROAM process can impact governance and, through that, long-term FLR implementation. For example, ROAM can improve the cross-sectoral collaboration needed for FLR implementation (as was seen in Rwanda). However, many governance issues may remain stumbling blocks for effective and equitable FLR, and new issues will emerge over time.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f227d16-95d5-4ad8-abed-60fa2fc02039": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f227d16-95d5-4ad8-abed-60fa2fc02039", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in the Republic of Cyprus: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f906f2123c2312f4eca8c21da52ce34685d2d3210ab68aad409c9c48d59600cc"}, "2": {"node_id": "b8fe3a72-a2e1-4e74-950c-94f2315b3025", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0db6df85c1f857caed912f6514c28f0a848480b6eade8376a014f9bf0240497c"}}, "hash": "c0818faa1bbfdfa38ec9edec8bf69c2251ac7f1f60aff19d64965a1a4ae06390", "text": "Therefore, a long-term FLR vision developed through a point-in-time ROAM assessment will have to be adapted based on ongoing learning.

Some interviewees suggested that the three leads lacked a common vision, and that only CORNARE had long-term legitimacy in the region, which adversely impacted ROAM outcomes and follow-up. In summary, this principle is important to ROAM, as the process seeks to reach a broad, shared vision for FLR. Particularly where the ROAM process and outputs can align with existing plans, strategies and visions, it can add significant value. Lack of a shared vision may impede future implementation of effective and equitable FLR.37 At the same time, ROAM processes often highlight the diversity of visions, priorities and strategies for restoration across the landscape. It is crucial that the process respects this diversity and ensures equity in terms of whose restoration visions and priorities are prioritised through the process. Learning and adaptation are also critical to the longer-term restoration efforts that ROAM processes aim to support. 37 Implementation may also be impacted by many other factors, such as lack of funding and/or clear champions. 30 Box 4. Placing drivers of degradation in context by Gretchen Walters, Assistant Professor, University of Lausanne, Institute of Geography and Sustainability ROAM assessments often list or analyse drivers of degradation. However, interpreting degradation and its drivers can be complicated, and sometimes driven by \u201creceived wisdom\u201d which adopts a degradation narrative,38 often incorrect and/or lacking analysis (Leach & Mearns, 1996). According to Leach and Mearns, for example, it is common to assume that swidden (sometimes referred to as \u201cslash and burn\u201d) agriculture causes deforestation, when this is not always the case. They note that is important to consider drivers of deforestation and degradation in context and to ensure they are not unfairly placed at the feet of marginalised people. Land degradation is a common theme associated with Malawi. In the Malawi ROAM report, indirect drivers of deforestation, as identified by stakeholders and rights-holders, include poor agricultural practices and the harvest of fuelwood. However, according to social scientists, there is another story behind Malawi\u2019s degradation, as described in the next paragraphs. Understanding these drivers will ultimately help target restoration initiatives appropriately. Drivers of degradation can vary spatially and by usage. For example, fuelwood consumption, a major concern in Malawi, comprises different uses, from using deadwood to collecting wood for commercial fish smoking. While some uses have little impact, others may be larger (Abbot & Homewood, 1999). For instance, fuelwood impacts can be highly localised and diverse, especially when destined for charcoal making, a key concern (Zulu, 2010). Zulu calls for \u201ca nuanced understanding of principle causes of deforestation, of wood fuel supply patterns and chains, wood fuel markets and trade, and patterns of energy use\u201d, demonstrating the variation in fuelwood demand throughout Malawi. The origins of degradation may not be straightforward and have long histories that should be taken in consideration. For example, in Malawi, degradation might be attributed to colonial era policies, which reduced local people\u2019s capacities to govern and manage their natural resources (Kwashirai, n.d.; McCracken, 1987). Degradation in the form of erosion emerged from large-scale colonial estates, which went unmanaged for many years (Mulwafu, 2002). These examples demonstrate that degradation is neither the result of one specific social group nor solely the result of present-day practice. Peter Walker\u2019s (2004) work on historical influences on restoration in Malawi is useful and is summarised in this paragraph. He found that degradation may be caused by land dispossession and resistance to tree planting. Large areas of land were taken from local farmers in the colonial era to create European estates, which occupied as much as 45% of the cultivable land and thus created land shortages for local farmers. The practice of creating estates continued under the Banda regime in the 1980s. A colonial concern was fuel wood supply, and although colonial foresters acknowledged that deforestation was driven by European tobacco estates, blame was placed on local farmers. Colonial efforts to address deforestation focused on planting exotic species, and colonial programmes to encourage villagers to plant exotic trees created an \u201capathy toward afforestation\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9501e7e-4934-413b-89a3-3a10ef9e44f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9501e7e-4934-413b-89a3-3a10ef9e44f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in the Republic of Cyprus: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cee2a207ad18e5f8e207058ec6e198b1e62c0da3668ff1f128f3e89c1ffdf1e6"}, "2": {"node_id": "edf6ea2f-5ee7-4c63-8e46-c04aa935ee48", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca794a17b81752b86baaa983c9548a40ec84b55c52becf2ff47170163cb9ed5b"}}, "hash": "99938b2b254a0feacb29267da99a3bb44b6fe86e936d3b887603a84f8e4cdff3", "text": "Resistance to these tree planting programmes continued from the 1910s into the 1990s.

This includes horizontal coordination among actors working at the same governance level (e.g. within a district or village) as well as vertical coordination among actors working at different levels (e.g. from village to district to national government). It also pertains to coherence and alignment within and across natural resource and related sectors \u2013 e.g. in the laws and policies governing land tenure, forestry and agriculture in a restoration landscape (Springer et al., 2021). Given its multi-scalar, landscape orientation, this kind of coordination and coherence can be important for the success of ROAM processes and the FLR initiatives they prioritise. Key findings Leadership for ROAM processes: The choice of institutional leads in a ROAM process helps determine its governance and ultimate impact. In Colombia, for instance, a lead organisation helped to ensure broad acceptance of the process by rights-holders and stakeholders, make linkages with other relevant processes and actors, and provide long-term follow-up. In Malawi, the Forestry Department, as institutional lead, coordinated across devolved structures and helped ensure long-term sustainability and government follow- up. This resulted in a national programme and district level implementation plans with allocated funding. Multi-stakeholder coordination for ROAM processes: The ROAM process typically requires multi- stakeholder coordination. This can also enable longer-term coordination for FLR. For example, in Rwanda, a \u2018cross sectoral taskforce for FLR\u2019 was established. Interviewees indicated that this task force is widely seen as a major success, with neighbouring countries seeking to replicate it. In Malawi, a multi-sector task force guided and supported the national assessment process. This coordination translated into concrete collaboration around FLR, with the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Energy and local government coming together to reflect on implementing the FLR strategy. In Indonesia, the selection of the (pre-existing) Gorontalo Mangrove Management Working Group (KKMD) as the institutional home for the process helped ensure multi- sectoral, multi-stakeholder involvement. More recent ROAM processes have involved identifying or establishing a governance structure and team to implement the assessment following training. These governance structures are critical to participation throughout the ROAM process, and training teams encourage convenors to be inclusive in forming them. Areas for further exploration include how ROAM governance structures build on and align with existing institutions and connect local, landscape and national decision-makers. Cross-scale collaboration: ROAM processes often build on existing policies and institutions to enable cross-scale collaboration. For example, in Indonesia, national and district level forest governance arrangements required cross-scale collaboration between agencies. In Colombia, the ROAM process brought an international dimension to an existing restoration policy and increased the policy\u2019s visibility. At the same time, practice illustrates a number of related challenges. For example, operating jointly at larger (landscape) scales often requires a shift in mindset. This is particularly true as each convening group wants to emphasise its own independent actions. Coordination across diverse rights-holders and stakeholders in the landscape, operating with different timeframes, is also a challenge when bridging ROAM outcomes with implementation. For example, in Rwanda, one interviewee noted that, \u201cthe plethora of actors involved in FLR (\u2026) would imply a need for strong coordination efforts; the large amount of funds being generated for FLR also speak to the need for equitable benefit sharing\u201d. In all cases, cross-scale collaboration should support, rather than diminish, the role of local actors who will govern, implement and be impacted by FLR (see Box 3 and Principle 4). 32 Overlapping and unclear roles: ROAM processes may lead to \u201cover-coordination\u201d. For example, one interviewee felt that, in Colombia, too many people were seeking to lead, with limited resources and staff to deliver change on the ground. There are also challenges in understanding and respecting the roles of each rights-holder and stakeholder group, especially when there are many involved.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b01dc1e8-e91d-46a1-a054-abc6f107423e": {"__data__": {"id_": "b01dc1e8-e91d-46a1-a054-abc6f107423e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in the Republic of Cyprus: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e9e46b100a86c8a3a004c528fc6c08e439e251d039ffaa6a1ff3404c68bfdbc"}, "2": {"node_id": "4c6a728e-d619-4a2a-b2ef-569a9ec5e323", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29bebf481ceadb61ccb0148e89fbc859e1949a19a79185bf533f22860e2fe301"}}, "hash": "2301c14b9f7d4badd075f0956bcfa5aa88e31fa24932542a869a55c581fd6953", "text": "For example, in Malawi, when the Restoration Diagnostic was carried out, it emerged that roles and responsibilities were not clearly understood, and it was unclear who held ultimate authority.

For example, in Malawi, the process included a review of policies, laws and regulations affecting restoration and concluded that there was need for harmonisation. In Colombia, the process contributed to the national restoration plan. To be complete, such analyses should consider alignment across the range of statutory and customary laws and policies related to restoration, including overlapping and conflicting provisions. These may include local, sub-national or national instruments across multiple sectors. In summary, this principle is highly relevant to ROAM and FLR, which call for coordinated approaches. ROAM guidance recognises the need to include key rights-holders and stakeholders, including women, both in the development of a coherent process and in the convening of a coordination group. Yet practice shows that achieving coordination and coherence across diverse groups and scales is challenging. Time is needed to enable reconciliation of different interests and priorities, even within the core team. ROAM processes can also help to identify ways to improve coherence among restoration related laws, policies and plans, including to better enable equitable and effective FLR. Principle 7: Sustainable and equitably shared resources Relevance of principle The principle of sustainable and equitably shared resources calls for \u201cactors responsible for natural resources [to] have the means necessary to carry out sustainable management and governance activities, including from the equitable sharing of benefits generated from natural resources\u201d (Springer et al., 2021, p. 24). Those who are governing and managing resources should have sufficient revenues and/or support from sustainable livelihoods and a fair share in diverse benefits. Losses borne by local rights-holders and vulnerable people resulting from conservation should be avoided or, where avoidance is not possible, minimised and fairly compensated. Benefits should be sustained over time, including for future generations. This principle addresses equitable benefit and cost sharing in its own right, and highlights that such equity is an important factor in whether people are able to meet environmental responsibilities (Springer et al., 2021). Restoration results in more than economic and environmental benefits; it extends to well-being and livelihoods (Erbaugh & Oldekop, 2018). Despite this, restoration literature often uses a financial perspective to focus on restoration costs and benefits (e.g. L\u00f6fqvist & Ghazoul, 2019). Key findings The cases illustrate a strong overall focus on FLR costs and benefits in ROAM processes, as well as some associated challenges. For example: 33 Distribution, including for those without secure tenure rights: ROAM processes typically include cost-benefit analysis of proposed restoration scenarios or initiatives. To understand whether these initiatives are likely to be equitable, the analysis needs to consider distribution, such as whose costs? who benefits? over what time? The analyses done in ROAM processes typically consider direct benefits for land-owners as well as indirect benefits for both people in the landscape more generally (e.g. clean water, and climate adaption, etc.). However, ROAM guidance does not substantively address questions of cost - benefit analysis where land users lack secure rights. These challenging cases do arise in practice. In Indonesia, for example, benefit sharing was considered in light of various groups\u2019 needs. Most fish farmers had migrated to and settled in the area without legal rights to the land or fish ponds (see Box 1). Given this, many fish farmers would not directly benefit from MFLR, and would face high opportunity costs. This, along with lack of commensurate livelihood alternatives for current land users within or around the landscape, posed a significant barrier to equitable and effective MFLR. Spatial and temporal scales of restoration: FLR is a long-term process. Some benefits will only accrue after many years, e.g. the 35 years it may take for a return on investing in mahogany trees (Colomer et al., 2018). Other FLR initiatives can generate shorter-term benefits, such as water retention, erosion control and increased soil fertility. Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR), for example, can yield relatively quick benefits in soil and wood material provision.

Conversely, in the scenario with the smallest proposed restoration area, the cost of restoration outweighed benefits even in the longer-term, particularly given the high opportunity cost to fish farmers. Considering diverse benefits and costs and well-being more broadly: The costs and benefits of restoration extend well beyond economic and financial aspects. While more recent ROAM processes have considered a fairly wide set of benefits, the considered costs still tend to be limited to economic factors. Considering a fuller set of social, cultural and economic benefits and costs, as well as the broader concept of well-being, could enrich the ROAM process. Robust trade-off analysis could also help rights-holders and stakeholders consider the intersections of social, economic and environmental outcomes of FLR.

However, many people do not benefit from the natural resources due to degradation. One interviewee suggested reframing the issue from \u201csharing the consequences of degradation\u201d to \u201csharing the benefits of restoration\u201d. This reframing could support communities in claiming rights, e.g. by raising this issue to governments to seek funding for restoration initiatives to increase food security. Communities as partners: According to one interviewee for Malawi, the approach to ROAM and finance was at times oriented around companies looking for labour for activities, such as tree-planting, rather than establishing a fair partnership with communities for investing in locally-controlled forests (see Elson, 2012). Agreeing on restoration costs and benefits: Funding and other limitations may result in insufficient time to resolve disagreements between rights-holders and key stakeholders on benefit and cost sharing, including opportunity costs. In summary, key aspects of this principle are reflected in the cost-benefit analysis in the ROAM framework. However, there are several factors that could be strengthened, including ensuring that the geographical and temporal scale of analysis matches the scale of implementation; considering a full set of social, cultural and economic costs and benefits, including their distribution; and integrating broader conceptualisation of human well-being. Principle 8: Accountability Relevance of principle Accountability calls for the \u201cactors responsible for or affecting natural resource governance [to be answerable] for their actions and the environmental and social impacts they produce\u201d (Springer et al., 2021, p. 25). It is enabled when those actors (and their institutions) are transparent and have clearly-defined roles, capacities and processes/mechanisms through which to meet their obligations. It involves being answerable for the impact of governance and management on rights-holders and vulnerable people and environments, as well as being able to address corruption (the use of public power for private gain) (Springer et al., 2021). Accountability can be seen as an instrument for just outcomes in the relationships among different agents, such as governments and citizens (Caddy et al., 2007). Accountable actors may be elected representatives, project managers (e.g. for the ROAM process), customary leaders or government agents or representatives. In processes involving powerful actors, accountability can be hindered by lack of political will, weak capacity for collective action, lack of resources and weak regulations (Nuesiri, 2016). FLR implementation requires accountability, i.e. answerability, especially given the timeframes and direct and indirect costs involved, including opportunity costs (Murcia et al., 2016). Importantly, accountability relates to being responsible for both actions (e.g. whether those with responsibility act fairly) and inactions (e.g. whether those with responsibility fail to meet their commitments and/or be transparent). Key findings Accountability relationships during the ROAM process: It is both important and challenging to ensure that the roles and responsibilities of actors in the ROAM process are clear, including how convenors will be accountable to the rights-holders and stakeholders involved.

Accountability for the potential impacts of FLR can also be enhanced through ensuring an inclusive ROAM process. If the process is not inclusive, important restoration considerations may be excluded. For example, according to one interviewee working at the regional level in Kenya, where rangelands cover 75% of the country, a ROAM assessment did not include rangelands restoration as a key intervention until it was noted by a senior staff member of a participating NGO well into the process. At the same time, ROAM processes should avoid becoming forums for assigning blame for degradation. For example, in Indonesia, ROAM meetings were facilitated with an eye towards minimising scapegoating, especially of the fish farmers who established fish farms inside the protected area and the forest managers who previously \"allowed\" this landscape conversion. In this case, there were also efforts by fish farmers and an allied NGO to seek accountability for recent injustices, as well as stated intent from a government official to hold fisher farmers accountable for contributing to restoration39 (see also Boxes 1 and 4 and Principle 10). Accountability for FLR implementation: As FLR implementation and monitoring are outside the scope of the process, ROAM outputs generally do not define accountability mechanisms for these steps. This enables flexibility40 and might also avoid creating pressure to impose initiatives on rights-holders or stakeholders who were not directly involved. Further, funding and convening ROAM processes with the expectation that they must result in FLR could incentivise downplaying barriers to or risks of FLR. At the same time, concluding the ROAM process without clarity about whether (and by whom, when, etc.) the identified priorities will be carried forward can be frustrating for participants. In Colombia, for example, community members were disappointed when ROAM finished without any clear follow-up in the short-term, due in part to lack of funding. (In Malawi, funding from the GEF supported FLR implementation.) Assessment without responsive action is not a challenge unique to ROAM (e.g. Campese & Sulle, 2019). Nonetheless, it is a challenge worth addressing, including out of respect for the rights-holders and stakeholders who contribute their time, knowledge and vision. As noted in the Diagnostic, part of empowered decision-making is accountability for the decisions made. 39 Fish farmers and a local NGO filed a petition to the Ministry of Human Rights during the assessment period related to the GAKUM agency dismantling five fish farmers\u2019 houses the year prior in an enforcement operation. At the same time, the head of the Forest Management Unit said that the fish farmers should contribute in some way to restoration (reparations), and that he would pursue that mechanism in his jurisdiction. 40 For example, in Malawi, the assessment was convened by the Forest Department, but two of the five recommended initiatives were then implemented by the Ministry of Gender.

The ROAM process can help stakeholders identify better siltation capture solutions upstream, allowing for a more stable electric power source.

For example, the Malawi ROAM report notes areas where restoration could be enhanced by addressing accountability, e.g. in participatory forest management (MNREM Malawi, 2017). These steps could also include a focus on accountability for social impacts. At the national and international levels, the Bonn Challenge, while not a ROAM framework component, helps create accountability for FLR and could be linked to ROAM outputs. In particular, the Barometer42 promotes follow through on commitments (Dave et al., 2019). However, the Barometer includes only one social indicator \u2013 the creation of green jobs.43 In summary, while FLR implementation and monitoring are largely outside the scope, ROAM processes can point the way towards accountable restoration \u2013 e.g. by building in safeguards and being clear about who is (or could be) accountable to whom, including accountability to Indigenous peoples and local communities.

The forest sector is considered a high priority economic development sector in Rwanda (Ministry of Natural Resources Rwanda, 2014). Rwanda\u2019s Vision 2020 includes a target to increase forest cover to 30% of land area by 2020. A 2019 Rwanda Forest Cover Mapping exercise supported by IUCN shows progress towards meeting this target (Republic of Rwanda, 2019). Rwanda\u2019s FLR programme is impacting economic development, including expanding investment opportunities. The first steps Rwanda took to operationalise its FLR vision included the 2014 national forest restoration assessment using ROAM, in partnership with IUCN and WRI. Impacts of this ROAM process include: \u2212 Substantially influencing Rwandan FLR policy; \u2212 Providing a technical roadmap to move from the FLR vision to guided activities on the ground; \u2212 Enabling investment in FLR projects, such as the Forest Landscape Restoration in the Mayaga Region project, funded by the GEF for US$ 33 million; \u2212 Creating the \u2018Cross Sectoral Taskforce for FLR,\u2019 which strengthens coordination of FLR activities in Rwanda; and \u2212 Being the first African country to pilot the Bonn Challenge Barometer of Progress, which positioned Rwanda as a model for FLR in the region. \u2212 In short, the ROAM process provided practical inputs to execute Rwanda\u2019s FLR vision and made the country a leader in FLR on the African continent. This success has also raised the challenge of accountability between actors (top-down and bottom-up) and among actors (horizontal peer accountability) in FLR implementation. There is also an urgent need for independent verification of achievements (diagonal accountability). Strong accountability is crucial for sustainability, effectiveness and equity of FLR initiatives in Rwanda. 41 These pathways vary widely. For example, in Malawi the government wanted to use ROAM to address degradation, including the enhancement of public funding for restoration. In Colombia, the government saw ROAM as a contribution to ongoing peace crops initiatives. 42 The Restoration Barometer is a \u201cframework for identifying, assessing and tracking action on global restoration commitments\u201d. More information is available on: https://www.iucn.org/resources/conservation-tool/restoration-barometer. 43 It also includes the \u201cflexibility to designate by job duration, gender type, or job type (i.e. maintenance versus implementation)\u201d. 37 Principle 9: Fair and effective rule of law Relevance of principle Fair and effective rule of law means that \u201cnatural resource-related laws and their application are fair, effective and protect fundamental rights.\u201d This requires, among others, a clear system of natural resource-related laws and policies that are \u201cconsistent with human rights and take account of the situation of Indigenous peoples and local communities, women and vulnerable groups\u201d and that \u201cincorporate principles of environmental sustainability.\u201d It requires that laws and policies are equitably and humanely enforced, and that those responsible for implementation have the resources and capacities they need. (Springer et al., 2021) These are crucial considerations, as reforestation and restoration efforts have been associated with the miscarriage of justice in several instances (e.g. Zoomers, 2010; Rai et al., 2018). Case analysis and key findings When and how rule of law is considered: ROAM processes may consider rule of law in legal/policy analysis, theory of change analysis, and/or application of the Diagnostic, among others. These analyses often focus on how laws and policies facilitate or impede restoration. It is also important to consider the fairness of laws and their enforcement. Resolving concerns related to the content or enforcement of laws is likely outside the scope of a ROAM process. However, identifying concerns helps ensure that they are taken into account, e.g. in prioritising FLR initiatives and highlighting issues to be addressed during FLR implementation. For example, if there are unjust (or unjustly enforced) statutory tenure laws, FLR initiatives implemented through them may themselves be unjust. If there is a community forestry policy in place, but the processes for its implementation are unclear or inaccessible, FLR initiatives implemented through that policy may face those same barriers. For example, in the Malawi ROAM report, enforcement of some laws is highlighted as essential for reducing degradation (MNREM Malawi, 2017).44 The Rwanda assessment recognised a need to strengthen natural resource rule of law, though doing so has not yet been prioritised in FLR implementation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5aef2183-352d-405d-8610-61895856017f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5aef2183-352d-405d-8610-61895856017f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in the Republic of Cyprus: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a389f49a80b2680202d3bc8ae569edf4b7a0015d22bde8ad87a98c37bd2ca103"}, "2": {"node_id": "e119a877-c5aa-44f3-8246-8b77bf81b720", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea92a2dce504159937d13e560872d5e1f778dd55a9054730fe1752f4d9b6f61b"}}, "hash": "860aaecb6fd0429851fe76e880768e59d8bb0f60983992dd4c14a4a3999f4038", "text": "Taking such issues into account can help ensure that FLR initiatives identified through ROAM processes will be fair and effective.

In Indonesia, participants discussed the results of the policy, legal and institutional analysis during the formation of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2ea9781-41db-419f-87d3-eaf723e932ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2ea9781-41db-419f-87d3-eaf723e932ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in the Republic of Cyprus: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7efd4e1ebeffbbe9e3bf3ab640a06e3fe1672ee2c89be17ef1c783470c708ee7"}}, "hash": "7efd4e1ebeffbbe9e3bf3ab640a06e3fe1672ee2c89be17ef1c783470c708ee7", "text": "a historical timeline. This revealed an important but complex story about the role that rule of law had played in the landscape over the last two decades, and what that implied for the current restoration options. Broadly, the conversion of mangroves to \u2018illegal\u2019 fish farming ponds had been tacitly allowed over the last 20 years for a number of reasons, including that this conversion resulted in substantial financial benefits for local law enforcement officers and other government agencies, and that restoration was not a legal option until 2013. In that context, most stakeholders realised the risk of only fully enforcing the law 20 years after conversion, including that doing so would result in displacement and violent conflict. This situation cannot be fairly resolved through law enforcement alone. A more comprehensive solution is required to fairly resolve this complex set of problems. 44 The ROAM report notes that it will be important to: \u201cEstablish appropriate compliance mechanisms to strengthen enforcement of related laws and policies, in particular for forest clearing restrictions and for community forest management. Weak enforcement of forest laws \u2013 underpinned by high resource demand, limited financial and human resources, rent seeking behaviour and corruption risks \u2013 were identified as a main barrier to achieving FLR at scale\u201d. One interviewee noted that the Forest Act was old and that the revision was not yet complete (but was underway at that time). It will largely raise fines and penalties to reduce illegal activities and so support restoration. 38 In summary, ROAM takes account of the legal and policy landscape. Giving more focus to whether the content and enforcement of laws is fair and consistent with human rights could enhance the ability of ROAM processes to support effective and equitable FLR implementation. This could be addressed in ROAM guidance. Principle 10: Access to justice and conflict resolution Relevance of principle Access to justice and conflict resolution means that \u201cpeople are able to seek and obtain remedies for grievances and resolve conflicts regarding land and natural resources\u201d. This requires, among others, that impartial and effective \u201cformal or informal mechanisms are in place to resolve conflicts and grievances regarding land and natural resources\u201d, that these mechanisms are known by and accessible to rights-holders and stakeholders, and that people are aware of their rights (Springer et al., 2021, pp. 28\u201329). Access to justice and the ability to resolve natural resource conflicts are part of ensuring sustainable restoration processes (Herrick et al., 2019). Case analysis and key findings Effective and equitable FLR requires access to justice and pathways for conflict resolution. While conflict resolution is not a focus of ROAM guidance, it is often a (more or less explicit) part of the process. Restoration involves governance questions such as how and by whom decisions are made, who has rights and responsibilities to what and who benefits and bears related costs. Injustices, grievances and conflicts related to such questions often precede \u2013 and can impact and/or be impacted by \u2013 the ROAM process. ROAM as part of a conflict resolution process: Some ROAM processes, such as in Indonesia, include an explicit objective of resolving a conflict. This requires substantial preparation, trust, appropriate and skilled facilitation, and follow-up. In Indonesia, historical timeline creation and opportunities mapping helped rights holders and stakeholders identify (sometimes conflicting) narratives about the creation of the nature reserve, the conversion of mangroves to aquaculture, and the forcible evictions of fish farmers (Bahsoan et al., 2014; Brown, 2021). Most stakeholders felt that enforcement operations were \"heavy-handed\" and appreciated that ROAM was seeking to identify a resolution (Brown, 2021). Importantly, the opportunity mapping and validation workshops in Indonesia included a nationally certified forest conflict resolution facilitator. Grounding the process in the context: There may be ongoing or past conflicts that are beyond the scope of what ROAM can (or should) resolve, but that are (or should be) defining aspects of the ROAM process approach, as was the case in Colombia (see Box 6). Access to justice and conflict resolution in ROAM processes and FLR actions: Concerns related to access to justice and conflict resolution were not raised in all cases. In Rwanda, interviewees stated that the ROAM process helped establish village land use planning as part of FLR decision-making, and that this has given local people a voice in FLR and led to conflict avoidance at the local level. (One interviewee also pointed out that, because resolving local tenure disputes satisfactorily in Rwanda is still very difficult to do,45 lands under ownership disputes tend to be excluded from FLR activities.) Interviewees in Malawi suggested that ROAM and FLR are generally viewed as positive.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c424fda-c383-4f03-b618-17b94bba4e55": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c424fda-c383-4f03-b618-17b94bba4e55", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in the Republic of Cyprus: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef9104fb30a7e4ce6b204098685002fe03c7c06ab2756aab6274b7f3aa341fb7"}, "3": {"node_id": "c9a09ec4-de5e-427c-9cbc-d8406f40b5df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b782c1519ffab69353048845a3bd54645baacbb7043331951774e3f96a732f1f"}}, "hash": "6626cf0f1f71c78d30e859b53b300cf198871b458931c97657819710c2e6ee5c", "text": "When there is an issue, such as when pine plantations in the north failed to hire from local communities, people can raise their concerns through the local chief to resolve the conflict. 45 For more information, see the LANDac\u2019s Food Security and Land Governance Factsheet on Rwanda available at: https://www.landgovernance.org/wp- content/uploads/2019/09/20160627-Factsheet-Rwanda.pdf. 39 However, grievances or conflicts may arise in relation to ROAM processes themselves and/or the FLR initiatives they identify. It is crucial that they be recognised and fairly resolved. Often conflicts can be addressed through existing (formal or informal) mechanisms at the appropriate level (village, district, etc.). Convenors should also ensure that there are fair, accessible and known grievance mechanisms for ROAM processes, including IUCN\u2019s grievance mechanism, when applicable. This is an area where more guidance and analysis are needed. In summary, this principle is important because FLR often involves challenging rights and governance issues. Equitable, sustainable restoration is unlikely in the context of ongoing conflict. ROAM processes have the potential to either help resolve and/or exacerbate resource-related conflicts and injustice in the landscape. More dialogue, guidance and training on enabling equitable conflict resolution and ensuring effective and fair mechanisms for grievance redress could strengthen ROAM. Box 6. Post-conflict landscapes and ROAM in Colombia by James McBreen, Senior Programme Officer, Forest Landscape Restoration, IUCN Experience with the ROAM process in Colombia highlights the importance of grounding assessments in their historical, social, and political context, and shows in particular the potential challenges and benefits of the process in a post-conflict setting. The department of eastern Antioquia, where the ROAM process was carried out, has one of the highest deforestation rates in Colombia, has been exacerbated by decades of internal armed conflict. Given that reality, and the new \u2018post-conflict\u2019 phase, there are inherent challenges in Colombia, which have implications for the environmental, cultural and socio-economic dynamics in the landscape. These include how landowners or users make decisions and challenges related to land tenure, and the arrival of displaced farmers and former guerrill3as who are reintegrating into society. There is uncertainty as to what patterns of land use can be expected in Colombia in the \u2018post-conflict\u2019 phase, and what the consequences for nature and livelihoods will be. In this context, the ROAM process in Colombia offered an opportunity and generated valuable experience for multiple stakeholders involved in landscape-scale planning, especially for restoration, to understand and practice the necessary integration of biophysical and ecological aspects with the social reality of the landscape. ROAM is characterised by its multi-stakeholder process, which should be built on dialogue and existing collaborative structures in the assessment area. In this post-conflict context, the ROAM process itself can be a valuable catalyst to foster relationships and dialogue between key stakeholders. The process offered FLR interventions to restore degraded landscapes through productive and sustainable activities, such as ecotourism and new livelihood opportunities for internally displaced people and ex-guerrillas affected by decades of conflict. In this sense, ROAM in eastern Antioquia contributed towards positioning restoration as a key activity to support the peace process, providing alternative livelihood options for returning populations to previously occupied conflict zones. There is a clear opportunity for participatory monitoring in the FLR design and implementation phases, by incorporating indicators of socio-economic well-being and promoting and enabling local participation in monitoring, data analysis and discussion of the results, including those that highlight the social, ecological, and economic benefits of FLR at the landscape scale. In the \u2018post-conflict\u2019 process, FLR can play a significant role in supporting durable peace in Colombia, considering restoration as a long-term process with sustainable results that start from the local level. It can enable a greater connection to earth through nature and restoring degraded landscapes, restore trust and confidence among the community, and engage youth in promoting local change and peacebuilding. 40 6 Recommendations This section includes recommendations to enhance the ways that ROAM guidance and practice address governance, drawing on the 10 NRGF principles.

Related NRGF principles: All \u2212 Use the ROAM guidance and tools that already address governance and rights issues (see Table 2 and Box 2). \u2212 Draw on and develop additional guidance, tools and practices, including to address gaps (see Table 2) and further operationalise the recommendations below. This may include new ROAM-specific guidance as well as related resources (see Annex II) and approaches, protocols or guidance from rights-holders and stakeholders in a ROAM process. \u2212 Co-generate and share governance- and rights-related knowledge and experiences, including in ROAM training.46 \u2212 Engage partners with related skills and knowledge, including from Indigenous peoples\u2019 and local communities\u2019 organisations. 6.2 ROAM Phase 1: Preparation, consultation and planning Several recommendations that pertain to all ROAM phases are listed under Phase I because addressing them starts during planning. Recommendation 2: Convene inclusive and effective coordination for the ROAM process. Related NRGF principles: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8 Institutional partners convening and coordinating the ROAM process should be: \u2212 Representative of the diversity in the landscape, including Indigenous peoples and local communities. Partnerships with international organisations, including IUCN, may be helpful, but the process should not be driven by external actors. \u2212 Trusted by and accountable to rights-holders and key stakeholders. Engage facilitators experienced 46 Training could include skill-building in key governance areas, such as rights-mapping, facilitating multi-stakeholder groups that include diverse rights-holders and knowledge-holders, appropriately recognising and integrating diverse forms of knowledge, social/well-being analysis and conflict resolution. 41 in multi-stakeholder participatory processes and other requisite skills (e.g. conflict resolution). \u2212 Knowledgeable about the governance systems, rights and cultures in the landscape. \u2212 Well-coordinated amongst themselves (including across scales), with clear, agreed-upon roles and relationships. \u2212 Committed, with appropriate capacity. Longer-term impact may be enhanced by engaging diverse \u2018champions\u2019 with the political will, commitment and capacity to see FLR through. Recommendation 3: Fully integrate governance and rights in situational and legal and policy analysis and/or do a governance assessment. Related NRGF principles: All Carry out in-depth situational and legal and policy analyses that identify governance issues that may impact the equity, effectiveness and sustainability of FLR initiatives. If these analyses (and the FLR Readiness Diagnostic) are done early in the process, results can inform the initial restoration opportunities mapping. At a minimum, this information helps ensure that prioritised FLR initiatives will not cause harm. Beyond this, it can help identify areas where landscape governance can be improved. This may include appropriate recognition and support for Indigenous peoples\u2019 and local communities\u2019 rights (including self- determination and FPIC) and restoration / natural resource governance initiatives. Issues to consider include: \u2212 Governance arrangements - e.g. who governs (de jure and de facto) land, territories and resources across the landscape, and how? Is there appropriate recognition and devolution in policy? In practice? Why or why not? \u2212 Tenure47 and other human rights - e.g. what (and whose) are the customary and statutory rights to govern, own, access and use land, territories and natural resources in the landscape? What other procedural and substantive human rights may be impacted by FLR? Are local rights-holders aware of and freely able to act upon their rights? If not, what are the conflicts and barriers? \u2212 Laws, policies, rules and protocols that set the terms of, enable or impede equitable and effective FLR. Consider laws and policies from across levels and sectors, and from statutory and customary systems. With respect to statutory laws, consider fairness in their content and implementation across groups. Take into account local by-laws and community plans and protocols.48 \u2212 Cultural and knowledge systems - e.g. who are knowledge-holders in the context? How can diverse knowledge and practice for restoration, including Indigenous and local knowledge, be recognised, respected and included (with FPIC)?

Recommendation 4: Carry out a robust rights-holder and stakeholder analysis. Related NRGF principles: 1, 4 ROAM processes typically involve a stakeholder analysis. A meaningful analysis can help ensure an inclusive, legitimate process \u2013 knowing not just who to reach out to, but how different rights-holders and stakeholders can best be engaged and appropriately supported throughout the process. Towards this end: \u2212 Ensure analysis using unbiased, inclusive methods and based in deep understanding of the social, cultural and historical context \u2013 including Indigenous peoples, local communities and other rights- holders, knowledge-holders and stakeholders. \u2212 Take account of rights and power relationships. This could involve, e.g. \u2018rights and responsibilities\u2019 analysis and power mapping (together with the \u2018interest and influence\u2019 mapping often used in ROAM processes). Include groups who may be (positively or negatively) impacted by restoration but face barriers to influencing decisions. Recommendation 5: Ensure an inclusive process with full and effective participation in all phases. Related NRGF principles: 1, 3, 5 Inclusive decision-making with full and effective participation is important at all ROAM phases. Among others: \u2212 Respect and appropriately work with existing institutions, including community-defined processes and protocols for discussion and decision-making. \u2212 Be transparent and proactively share information with rights-holders and stakeholders49 \u2212 Invite and enable, but do not force or coerce, participation. If rights-holders and key stakeholders are opting out, listen to why and address concerns where possible. \u2212 Ensure rights-holders and key stakeholders are empowered partners. Share power and be inclusive of and responsive to diverse views, knowledge and priorities. \u2212 Ensure self-determined representation where direct participation is not an option.50 \u2212 Use contextually-appropriate, participatory methods co-selected/developed with rights- holders and stakeholders (in workshops as well as in data collection and analysis occurring between them). \u2212 Fully budget for participation throughout the process. 49 This can include information about what ROAM is; who is convening the process and what they are proposing; how (and in what) people can participate; what the potential benefits, limitations and risks are; and how concerns can be raised and addressed. Rights holders also need clear information about their rights, if not already known. 50 Representation can occur in different ways, and through elected officials, customary authorities or others with (formal or informal) legitimate mandates. Working with a diversity of representatives can enhance representation (Nuesiri, 2018) 43 \u2212 Include gender sensitisation and collectively develop a gender action plan for the ROAM process. \u2212 Proactively and appropriately support full and effective participation,51 including of Indigenous peoples, local communities, people of different genders and ages (including women and youth), and vulnerable or marginalised groups. Recommendation 6: Align the participatory process to the geographical and institutional scale(s) of the assessment, with inclusion at each level.

The criteria selected will vary with the particular objectives of the assessment\u2026\" (IUCN & WRI, 2014, p. 42). 54 See, for example, Hernandez & Vogt (2020) on indicators that evaluate restoration from an Indigenous lens. 55 For example, excluding FLR where there are tenure disputes may help ensure the ROAM process and the initiatives it identifies do not exacerbate concerns. At the same time, consistently prioritising restoration in areas with \u201cideal\u201d enabling conditions (e.g. clear and secure tenure, interested financiers, etc.) may reinforce marginalisation. 46 Recommendation 13: Ensure rights-holders and key stakeholders are leaders and empowered partners in data collection and analysis.

Recommendation 17: Ensure inclusive, transparent validation. Related NRGF principles: All Use inclusive, transparent processes (see Recommendations 5\u201310) for validating ROAM results and recommendations, so that final outputs reflect the rights, knowledge and visions of rights-holders and key stakeholders, including Indigenous peoples and local communities, with FPIC. Recommendation 18: Ensure final ROAM outputs identify FLR initiatives that can uphold rights and are aligned with governance principles. Related NRGF principles: All If not already done (e.g. see Recommendations 11 and 15), use participatory methods to assess whether initiatives identified or prioritised in ROAM outputs will uphold human rights and governance principles. This can be informed by the analyses in Phase I and II and further discussion with rights-holders and stakeholders during validation. While detailed restoration implementation plans are typically beyond ROAM\u2019s scope, the assessment process requires substantial financial, time and knowledge investments in identifying opportunities. Initiatives identified through ROAM processes should uphold and, wherever possible, enhance effective and equitable FLR governance, including the rights and priorities of Indigenous peoples, local communities, people of different genders and ages (including women and youth), and vulnerable or marginalised people who would be impacted. If the FLR initiatives identified cannot be effectively, equitably and sustainably implemented in a given landscape (a question that will often be determined by governance factors), they should only be included as \u2018opportunities\u2019 if ROAM outputs also offer clear guidance on what issues need to be addressed to make them viable options.

Coordination to carry forward ROAM outputs may require continuing or establishing multi-stakeholder processes. These should: \u2212 Work with and build on existing institutions and platforms as much as possible. \u2212 Represent and be answerable to rights-holders and key stakeholders, including Indigenous peoples and local communities. Accountability can be strengthened through, for example, peer review and shared reporting, for FLR financing and action. \u2212 Be comprised of diverse groups with the mandates, capacities and political will to carry out equitable and effective FLR over the long term. Some attributes may be built over time, such as through advocacy, training and shared learning. \u2212 Include diverse FLR \u2018champions\u2019 who are widely trusted and viewed as legitimate. Detailed FLR planning and implementation should be done with the leadership and partnership of local actors, including those whose lands, territories, waters and resources may be impacted, and should respect, promote and help more fully realise human rights. Recommendation 20: Enable longer-term and participatory monitoring, learning and adaptation of FLR plans and strategies Related NRGF principles: 1, 3, 5 While FLR implementation is beyond ROAM\u2019s scope, ROAM outputs should include recommendations or plans for participatory FLR monitoring, learning and adaptation. These could include peer exchange among local actors and analysis, documentation and communication of lessons learned. Monitoring could be done in connection with the Restoration Barometer,56 with additional indicators. 56 More information is available here: https://www.iucn.org/resources/conservation-tool/restoration-barometer.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56e50cbb-af22-4558-8587-01552c2e9e44": {"__data__": {"id_": "56e50cbb-af22-4558-8587-01552c2e9e44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in the Republic of Cyprus: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d616fd545dcd34b81194a13d07a0ca1c6ad547c2590e38ca8763201486cb936e"}, "2": {"node_id": "1bb70935-db11-4658-959a-918029309091", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef98bf3fa4728917dcdf294d724e5edd65f99a1c793e6a4c8444ee968b9c0c30"}}, "hash": "b64f4ba895ca6dee07f360ca696c94b0be5420b68cccfb825b4612d3b280bc0b", "text": "49 7 Conclusion The success of restoration efforts is in large part socially determined and governance is a crucial factor in the equity, effectiveness and sustainability of FLR initiatives. Mapping NRGF and FLR principles (Table 1) shows how applying the NRGF can reinforce and add value to FLR. ROAM seeks to operationalise the FLR principles through processes to identify and prioritise FLR initiatives. Understanding and enhancing the ways that ROAM guidance and practice integrate governance issues, therefore, can set the stage for and support equitable, effective and sustainable FLR. The preceding analysis shows that governance issues are important in each phase of ROAM. Many governance issues are already considered in ROAM guidance and practice, to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52988fb7-178e-4bb3-b6d7-a1bcb38abef0": {"__data__": {"id_": "52988fb7-178e-4bb3-b6d7-a1bcb38abef0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in the Republic of Cyprus: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f4dfb794ea195e7a6ad25b56d8ef782c6fc8fdfcfc8b8e5867c11d175ef4d037"}, "3": {"node_id": "aab8e61d-ec56-43e6-94b3-473c56df1758", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-republic-cyprus-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b43781e30b3b3df3a4eef66e5da456e41faa1629d640fe33ffe62b0a52065d82"}}, "hash": "62706a597ad27afd0abd2923e07f4b29d77429e339dbca0d5c22d3fa847e116d", "text": "varying extents and in different ways. There are also challenges and gaps that can be addressed. More fully integrating governance principles can enhance the opportunity for ROAM guidance and processes to support effective and equitable FLR and improved landscape governance. This publication offers 20 recommendations towards that end. The recommendations reflect both strengths and challenges identified in the analysis, including good practice that can be better reflected in ROAM guidance. In summary, key issues addressed in the analysis and recommendations include: \u2212 Inclusion and power dynamics: ROAM processes, like FLR more broadly, often confront and seek to address complex and inequitable power relationships. Key questions include who convenes and is invited into the process; who funds it; whose assumptions, knowledge and visions are reflected in prioritised restoration actions; who decides; who follows-up and implements FLR, etc. The ROAM assessment should be designed and implemented as an inclusive, multi-stakeholder process, with Indigenous peoples and local communities and people of all genders and age groups engaged as empowered leaders and partners in restoration, ensuring respect for rights, including FPIC. While ROAM processes generally strive to achieve inclusion, there are also challenges when it comes to practice. More systematic guidance and sharing of experiences can help ensure inclusive ROAM processes. \u2212 Rights and equity: FLR has the potential to (positively or negatively) impact rights and equity. Restoration\u2019s impacts on well-being need to be understood, including equity in the nature, scope and distribution of material and non-material benefits (and losses). In keeping with this, the leadership and focus of ROAM processes should include those who govern and implement FLR and are most impacted by land use decisions, including Indigenous peoples, local communities and women. Likewise, ROAM process convenors and stakeholders need a clear understanding of the governance context and tenure arrangements and, where appropriate, support for just tenurial and conflict resolution. \u2212 Diverse knowledge, culture and visions for FLR: Rights-holders and stakeholders bring diverse and valuable knowledge to FLR, including Indigenous and local knowledge. They also have diverse visions for what restoration means and how it can be achieved on their lands and territories. ROAM processes can be an opportunity for knowledge co-generation and sharing and for recognising and supporting the FLR contributions of different actors, including Indigenous peoples and local communities and people of different genders and age groups, with FPIC. \u2212 Scale and timeframe: As a cross-sectoral and cross-scale process informing the planning and design of long-term FLR, ROAM processes must effectively enable participation across scales. This requires understanding where rights-holders, stakeholders and other knowledge-holders are situated and where policy decisions are made. ROAM must also account for the time differences between when FLR opportunities are identified, implemented, pose costs and generate benefits. 50 \u2212 Context and history: ROAM processes should be based in a deep understanding of how current and historical governance contexts inform current restoration opportunities and how restoration can inform and improve (or undermine) broader landscape governance. \u2212 Continued learning and action: ROAM processes and outputs should encourage ongoing monitoring and action learning, including about governance, and contribute to adaptation, accountability and sustainability in FLR. This publication provides a step towards more fully integrating governance considerations in ROAM processes and resulting FLR strategies and plans. It can inform ROAM guidance, training, practice and learning going forward, including further research about the importance of governance for FLR.

Devolution: Decisions are taken at the lowest possible level appropriate to the social and ecological systems being governed, with particular attention to empowering the roles and authority of Indigenous peoples and local communities in natural resource governance \u2212 Legal and policy frameworks devolve natural resource management to capable institutions closest to the natural resources concerned. \u2212 Legal and policy frameworks for devolved \u2013 including Indigenous and community-led \u2013 natural resource governance are widely implemented. \u2212 Local institutions (including customary institutions) have the capacities and support they need for effective and equitable natural resource governance. \u2212 Appropriate recognition is given to the roles and authority of Indigenous peoples and local communities in natural resource governance. 5. Strategic vision, direction and learning: Natural resource governance is guided by an overall vision of desired environmental and social outcomes, and allows for adaptation in response to learning and changing conditions \u2212 Relevant legal, policy and management frameworks establish strategic vision and direction for natural resource governance. \u2212 The strategic vision and direction are set through inclusive processes that take into account the diverse values and forms of knowledge of rights-holders and stakeholders. \u2212 The strategic vision and direction incorporate key principles of environmental sustainability, such as the precautionary principle against risks of environmental and social harm. \u2212 The strategic vision and direction effectively and equitably address present threats and anticipate future challenges. \u2212 Natural resource governance and management activities are consistent with the strategies articulated in the vision. \u2212 Governance institutions have processes in place for ongoing monitoring, reflection and learning, thereby enabling responsiveness to changing conditions and needs. 6. Coordination and coherence: Actors involved in or affecting natural resource governance coordinate around a coherent set of strategies and management practices \u2212 Legal and policy frameworks across sectors responsible for or affecting natural resource governance are aligned. \u2212 Coordination mechanisms are in place to enable horizontal collaboration and coherence among multiple actors and sectors operating in the same geographical space or thematic area. \u2212 Mechanisms are in place to enable vertical coordination across multiple levels of actors with roles in the governance of an ecosystem or resource. \u2212 Institutions collaborate and overlap functions in ways that increase resilience. 58 Principles Criteria 7. Sustainable and equitably shared resources: Actors responsible for natural resources have the means necessary to carry out sustainable management and governance activities, including from the equitable sharing of benefits generated from natural resources \u2212 People responsible for natural resource governance have access to revenues and/or livelihoods that enable them to carry out resource management activities. \u2212 Available revenues and other resources provide sufficient economic sustainability for the people and actions required to sustainably manage the natural resource. \u2212 Benefits arising from the use of natural resources are shared equitably. \u2212 The sharing of revenues and other benefits provides sufficient incentive for the sustainable management of natural resources. \u2212 Losses borne by Indigenous peoples, local communities and all vulnerable, marginalised and/or minority people due to conservation \u2013 including restrictions on resource use to ensure sustainability \u2013 are prevented or, where unavoidable, are compensated. \u2212 Natural resources are managed sustainably so that following generations have equitable access to the benefits those resources provide. 8. Accountability: Actors responsible for or affecting natural resource governance are accountable for their actions and the environmental and social impacts they produce \u2212 The institutions responsible for natural resource governance have clearly defined roles and responsibilities. \u2212 The actors responsible for or affecting natural resource governance operate transparently and share relevant information on their actions openly and accessibly. \u2212 Appropriate capacities and mechanisms are in place to hold authorities involved in natural resource governance responsible for their actions (and inactions). \u2212 Social and environmental safeguards are adopted and implemented that explicitly take into account the situation of vulnerable groups and environments. \u2212 The potential impacts of governance decisions on vulnerable people and environments are understood in advance and avoided or minimised to the fullest extent possible. \u2212 Accountability mechanisms effectively rein in corruption. 9.

This annex includes just a handful of examples. It is not exhaustive and not all resources will be relevant for all contexts. Rights-holders and stakeholders may also have their own guidance and approaches, or other resources they prefer. Recognising and respecting rights and diverse governance systems, knowledge and practice ROAM processes should enable FLR approaches that recognise and respect human rights and diverse governance systems, knowledge and practice, including of Indigenous peoples and local communities. This requires that the ROAM process itself embodies such recognition and respect. The ROAM processes in Malawi and Mozambique incorporated innovative measures to recognise and include cultural knowledge and practice in restoration, including through the 10-question survey (see Box 2). This tool can be diffused more broadly, including within and beyond ROAM training and guidance. Recent publications that can provide important examples and sources of guidance include: \u2212 Toward a Tenure-Responsive Approach to Forest Landscape Restoration: A Proposed Tenure Diagnostic for Assessing Restoration Opportunities (McLain et al., 2021) proposes a rights actualisation framework for strengthening tenure analyses in future restoration opportunities assessments. \u2212 The Territories of life: 2021 Report (ICCA Consortium, 2021) \u201chighlights the importance of recognising Indigenous peoples\u2019 and local communities\u2019 rights and governance systems for effective and equitable conservation\u201d. It includes, inter alia, recommendations, over 17 detailed case examples and a global spatial analysis of the estimated extent of territories and areas conserved by Indigenous peoples and local communities. \u2212 In Indigenizing Restoration: Indigenous Lands before Urban Parks, Hernandez and Vogt (2020) describe three indicators that \u201crestoration projects must incorporate\u201d to \u201cre-evaluate[ ] restoration from an Indigenous lens\u201d: eco-colonialism, kincentric ecology and environmental narratives. They apply these indicators in the context of a restoration project at Daybreak Star Indian Cultural Center located at Discovery Park in Seattle, Washington. \u2212 The IUCN guidelines for gathering of fishers\u2019 knowledge for policy development and applied use (Cowie et al., 2020) support recognition and inclusion of \u201cfishers\u2019 knowledge as an important data stream in resource management.

Developing and respecting visions for restoration As noted above, while offering a pathway to new or refined FLR visions and strategies, ROAM processes should recognise and respect the visions, priorities and plans that communities in the landscape may already have or wish to develop.57 Where there is FLR demand, ROAM can incorporate participatory methods for further refining or reaching both broadly shared and diverse visions for restoration. Some resources and methods that may be useful resources and methods are described below. Participatory (2D and 3D) mapping: Participatory mapping can help build shared understanding of the landscape as it exists and as participants envision its restoration. It can also facilitate exchange about what (and whose) rights and responsibilities exist across the landscape. Among many examples and resources are: \u2212 In Forest Landscape Restoration: Restoring What and for Whom?, Boedhihartono and Sayer (2012) describe different visualisation exercises used in FLR, noting that their \u201cpreferred approach to initiate the participatory exploration of landscape scenarios has been the use of simple drawing exercises.\u201d \u2212 Mapping for change: practice, technologies and communication (PLA issue no. 54) includes articles and examples of participatory mapping, including considerations for ethical practice (see Rambaldi et al., 2009). \u2212 This Participatory Methods portal page has information about and links to resources on participatory geographical reference systems (PGIS) for mapping. Timelines and seasonal calendars: Participatory historical timeline creation can help reach shared understanding of how the landscape and its use have changed. This method was used to identify (sometimes conflicting) narratives about the landscape in the ROAM assessment in Indonesia (Bahsoan et al., 2014; Brown, 2021). Seasonal calendars can help illustrate changes in the landscape throughout the year \u2013 e.g. what resources are available and how and by whom they are used and governed (see Borrini-Feyerabend with Buchan, 1997). Visioning exercises and guided imagery: Beyond Fences Vol. 2 (Borrini-Feyerabend with Buchan, 1997) summarises guided imagery, starting by \u201cencourage[ing] participants to think [of] \u2026a vision for the future \u2026\u201d. 57 For example, Indigenous peoples and local communities governing conserved territories and areas may have (or wish to implement) community-led processes for documenting, visioning and taking steps to strengthen their governance and management, which may (or may not) include restoration. See, e.g. the process described in Strengthening your territory of life: guidance from communities for communities (Borrini-Feyerabend et al., 2021). 62 Facilitated modelling: Innovative, facilitated modelling and \u2018games\u2019 can help rights-holders and stakeholders explore potential solutions for the types of complex problems that FLR presents.

Recognising and fairly resolving conflict in FLR ROAM could be enhanced with guidance on the types of conflicts and justice issues that might emerge around restoration and ways that they can be fairly acknowledged and addressed, including in relation to recognition of rights and diverse visions and priorities for FLR (see section above on developing and respecting visions for restoration). There are also resources that speak more specifically to conflict management within FLR decision-making, which may be useful in ROAM processes.

Further, recognising the wider loss and degradation of ecosystems, the United Nations has declared 2021\u20132030 the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. Landscapes are shaped by decision-making and power relationships across multiple sectors and scales. FLR involves and impacts many actors over long periods, including Indigenous peoples and local communities who own, govern, manage and/or rely on areas, territories and resources within those landscapes. FLR governance concerns, among other issues, how and by whom restoration decisions are made (including on whose land and incorporating whose knowledge, vision and practice) and how FLR can impact rights and well-being in the short- and long-term. Governance is therefore a crucial factor in the effectiveness, equity and sustainability of FLR. The Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) provides a framework for governments and other rights-holders and stakeholders to define and prioritise actions for FLR in national or sub-national contexts, using participatory analysis of multiple factors. This publication analyses strengths, opportunities and challenges in how ROAM guidance and practice address governance issues. It considers both how ROAM processes are designed and carried out, and how they take into account governance of the target landscapes. It then presents lessons learned and offers recommendations on governance aspects of the ROAM framework and process with the aim of strengthening the ability of ROAM to inform effective, equitable and sustainable FLR. This analysis focuses on ROAM as a widely used framework that informs longer-term FLR, rather than comprehensively considering FLR itself. It offers inputs for developing additional governance guidance for ROAM processes going forward. The primary analysis methods were: (1) review of the most relevant sources of ROAM guidance; (2) analysis of the ROAM process in four countries \u2013 Colombia, Indonesia, Malawi and Rwanda \u2013 based on interviews and document review; and (3) additional research, including a review of targeted literature. The analysis was undertaken using the Natural Resource Governance Framework (NRGF), an IUCN knowledge resource that aims to provide a robust, inclusive and credible approach to assessing and improving natural resource governance. The NRGF framework includes values, principles and criteria for equitable and effective governance. The analysis also takes into consideration the FLR principles agreed upon by the Global Partnership on FLR (GPFLR), which ROAM seeks to operationalise. These two sets of principles address different subjects and have distinct objectives. Nonetheless, mapping the alignment between them shows that governance is intrinsic to many FLR principles and, thus, the NRGF can reinforce those principles. At the same time, because it goes further in identifying specific elements of effective and equitable governance, the NRGF can deepen consideration of governance in ROAM and, subsequently, the FLR initiatives identified through the ROAM process. Overall, this publication highlights that ROAM, like FLR, is a social and political process that is impacted by, and in turn impacts, different dimensions of governance, including equity and rights. The assessment process will determine whose knowledge, practice, rights and restoration visions are (and are not) reflected in outcomes. Therefore, while ROAM is not a governance assessment framework per se, taking governance issues into account is critical. This means, in part, ensuring that ROAM processes and outcomes do not inadvertently exacerbate governance concerns, e.g. by prioritising FLR initiatives that may marginalise or Principles of forest and landscape restoration \u2212 Focus on landscapes \u2212 Engage stakeholders and support participatory governance \u2212 Restore multiple functions for multiple benefits \u2212 Maintain and enhance natural ecosystems within landscapes \u2212 Tailor to the local context using a variety of approaches \u2212 Manage adaptively for long-term resilience Source: Besseau et al.

There is an opportunity to build on ROAM guidance to reinforce how governance considerations are integrated. Key findings Key findings from the analysis of how governance considerations are addressed in ROAM guidance and processes include the following (listed in relation to the NRGF principles):1 Principle 1 - Inclusive decision-making: Decision-making regarding natural resource policies and practices is based on the full and effective participation of all relevant actors, with particular attention to the voice and inclusion of rights-holders and groups at risk of marginalisation. ROAM guidance and processes emphasise stakeholder participation, including through stakeholder analysis aimed at better understanding which rights-holders and stakeholders can most benefit from FLR and influence the decision-making process . Yet, enabling full and effective participation remains challenging in practice, including with respect to ensuring inclusiveness, equitable power relationships (e.g. in designing and implementing multi-level, multi- stakeholder processes), sufficient resources (including time) and capacity (e.g. in facilitation). Principle 2 - Recognition of and respect for tenure rights: Rights to lands, resources and waters are recognised and respected, with particular attention to the customary, collective rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities, and to women\u2019s tenure rights. Understanding and respecting tenure rights, including customary and collective rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities, is key to equitable and effective FLR. Consideration of tenure rights is not central to ROAM guidance. Yet, in practice, ROAM processes frequently confront tenure issues, and address them in variable ways. Tenure rights, such as those related to ownership, governance, access, use and/or management of land, territories, water, trees and other resources, could be undermined if not well understood and fairly addressed in FLR, including where rights are unclear or unrecognised. More guidance and sharing of experiences about how ROAM processes and FLR can recognise, respect and uphold tenure rights are needed. Principle 3 - Recognition of and respect for diverse cultures, knowledge and institutions: Natural resource governance is grounded in sound and diverse forms of knowledge and respect for diverse cultures, values and practices. Recognition of diverse knowledge, knowledge-holders and culture has been increasing in ROAM processes, including through a new survey tool on culture. ROAM practice has also improved in recent years in terms of enabling knowledge co-generation and sharing, such as through collaborative learning between rights-holders and stakeholders. There are also aspects that could be strengthened, for example, through further guidance and more systematic practice on equitable knowledge co-generation and collaborative research, as well as the appropriate recognition and inclusion of diverse restoration knowledge, including cultural, Indigenous and local knowledge. 1 NRGF principles and associated graphics from Springer et al. (2021). vii Principle 4 - Devolution: Decisions are taken at the lowest possible level appropriate to the social and ecological systems being governed, with particular attention to empowering the roles and authority of Indigenous peoples and local communities in natural resource governance. Devolution is important to the ROAM process, for example, when ensuring that assessment scales enable decision-making about restoration at the most local level appropriate, with recognition of local (statutory and customary) governance systems, and the full and effective participation of rights-holders and stakeholders. It is also important to consider the opportunities and barriers for decentralised restoration in the landscape. For example, ROAM outputs can recognise and support Indigenous- and community-led restoration, in ways that respect self-determination and FPIC. Devolution is often considered in practice, particularly where national policy encourages or requires a decentralised restoration approach. However, addressing devolution more directly in guidance could ensure more consistent and comprehensive inclusion in ROAM processes. Principle 5 - Strategic vision, direction and learning: Natural resource governance is guided by an overall vision of desired environmental and social outcomes, and allows for adaptation in response to learning and changing conditions. Achieving FLR objectives requires clear vision, direction and learning. Developing a broadly shared, but often locally differentiated, vision for a future restored landscape is fundamental in ROAM and often one of its key outcomes. In practice, this is challenging to achieve. Rights-holders and stakeholders have different restoration visions and strategies across the landscape, which should be recognised and respected.

In terms of content, ROAM processes often (although to varying degrees) consider coordination and coherency in the institutional landscape for restoration. ROAM can provide a platform for improved coordination for FLR, with impacts within and beyond the assessment. For example, the creation of multi-stakeholder and cross- sectoral platforms have enhanced FLR coordination and coherence in some countries. Further guidance on the formation and governance of such platforms could help ensure that they are inclusive, including of Indigenous peoples and local communities, and enable equitable and effective FLR over time. Principle 7 - Sustainable and equitably shared resources: Actors responsible for natural resources have the means necessary to carry out sustainable management and governance activities, including from the equitable sharing of benefits generated from natural resources Restoration has economic, social/cultural and environmental costs and benefits. Benefit sharing and sustainability are often considered in-depth during ROAM processes, and the guidance suggests taking into account economic, environmental and social factors. However, while various material and non-material benefits are considered in ROAM processes, the costs of restoration are generally viewed more narrowly from an economic perspective. Analysing costs and benefits across geographical and temporal scales and considering distributional equity were also noted as challenges. ROAM guidance and processes could also integrate broader concepts of well-being, e.g. when considering impacts of proposed restoration actions. viii Principle 8 - Accountability: Actors responsible for or affecting natural resource governance are accountable for their actions and the environmental and social impacts they produce Transparency is important for accountability. ROAM guidance calls for transparency, and case analysis suggests that the process is often transparent to participants. There are also challenges. Process convenors\u2019 ability or willingness to coordinate and fulfil their roles varies. Further, when choosing restoration priorities, ROAM guidance does not provide a set of safeguards or a specific way to ensure that potential adverse social impacts are considered and addressed. There are several ways this could be, and sometimes is, done in practice (see Recommendations 11 and 18). Another challenge concerns answerability, or accountability, for longer-term restoration implementation and monitoring. Although long-term accountability is largely outside ROAM\u2019s scope, ROAM outputs can point the way to accountability, e.g. by providing information about who should be accountable to whom in FLR initiatives, including accountability to Indigenous peoples and local communities. Principle 9 - Fair and effective rule of law: Natural resource-related laws and their application are fair and effective and protect fundamental rights ROAM considers laws, policies and rules related to restoration as part of broader legal and policy analysis, e.g. as enabling factors. At the same time, there is little focus in ROAM guidance on considering the fairness of laws and their enforcement, including their consistency with fundamental rights. While resolving concerns related to the content or enforcement of law is likely to be outside the scope of a ROAM process, identifying such concerns can help ensure that they are taken into account, including in the prioritised FLR initiatives. Principle 10 - Access to justice and conflict resolution: People are able to seek and obtain remedies for grievances and resolve conflicts regarding land and natural resources While conflict resolution is not a focus of the guidance, ROAM processes often address related issues in practice. Some ROAM processes are intended, in part, to acknowledge and resolve conflicts so that rights-holder and stakeholder-defined FLR can move forward. ROAM assessments may also be carried out in landscapes where there are, or recently have been, conflicts that need to be taken into account in process design and facilitation. Conflict may also arise (or become more visible) during ROAM processes, such as around questions of who makes decisions, has rights and responsibilities, and benefits and bears costs related to restoration. Finally, access to justice and conflict resolution are key considerations for ROAM processes because they are important for effective and equitable FLR. More ROAM guidance and experience sharing in this area would be helpful. Recommendations Based on this analysis, the publication offers 20 recommendations to enhance the integration of governance considerations in ROAM guidance and practice. The recommendations summarised in the table below are aligned with the phases and key steps of ROAM processes. The recommendations reflect both the strengths and challenges identified in the analysis.

Fully integrate governance and rights in ROAM guidance and training. All ROAM Phase 1: Preparation, consultation and planning 2. Convene inclusive and effective coordination for the ROAM process. The convening and coordinating institutional partners should be trusted and accountable (including to rights-holders and key stakeholders), well-coordinated (including across scales), committed and supported by sufficient resources and capacities. They should reflect the landscape\u2019s diversity, including Indigenous peoples and local communities, and involve people with deep understanding of the context, including governance systems. Include FLR \u2018champions\u2019 at all levels to enable long-term, adaptive, devolved implementation. 1, 3, 4, 6, 8 3. Fully integrate governance and rights in situational and legal and policy analysis and/or do a governance assessment. Consider, inter alia: the full range of statutory and customary laws and policies, governance institutions and knowledge systems that guide (and can be impacted by) FLR; tenure and other substantive and procedural rights; land and resource- related injustices and conflicts; accountability arrangements and concerns; and the narratives and assumptions about who is responsible for deforestation and why. Take into account both the current and historical situation. All 4. Carry out a robust rights-holder and stakeholder analysis, including any Indigenous peoples, local communities and other local people who have connection to, own, govern, care for and/or rely on land, territories and natural resources in areas that may be impacted by FLR. Take account of differences in power, including across genders. 1, 4 5. Ensure an inclusive process with full and effective participation in all phases. This can be enabled by, among others: working with and through appropriate institutions at all levels; engaging rights-holders and key stakeholders as empowered partners; being transparent and responsive; fully budgeting for participation; and enabling full inclusion of Indigenous peoples, local communities, people of different genders and ages and potentially marginalised groups, through self-determined representation. 1, 3, 5 6. Align the process to the geographical and institutional scale(s), with inclusion at each level. Enabling meaningful participation across scales and sectors may require phased or tiered approaches, e.g. sub-national followed by national processes. Local actors who will lead, implement and be impacted by FLR should be partners in processes at all scales. 1, 3, 4, 5 7. Facilitate multi-stakeholder processes in ways that take account of, and positively impact, power dynamics, including to enable full and effective participation. All 8. Co-generate and respect diverse knowledge, including through multi-directional learning and contextually appropriate collaborative methods in all ROAM phases. Recognise, respect and include diverse ways of knowing, knowledge-holders and systems, including Indigenous and local knowledge, with FPIC. 3 9. Support fair, effective conflict recognition and resolution at the appropriate level. Work through statutory or customary mechanisms at the appropriate level and ensure rights-holders and stakeholders have information about and access to grievance mechanisms, including IUCN\u2019s. 10 10. Develop ROAM objectives and FLR visions with rights-holders and key stakeholders at each level, and with respect for a diversity of visions and strategies. Conveners should be transparent about their objectives and facilitate a process that is open and responsive to the visions and priorities of participants. Given ROAM\u2019s scale and FLR\u2019s timeframe, there may be a broad vision (e.g. a Bonn Challenge commitment) with diverse visions and strategies at more local levels (e.g. sacred forest restoration or expanded agroforestry). Visions and priorities may change over time. 1,5 x Recommendations for enhancing governance considerations in ROAM Related NRGF Principles ROAM Phase 1: Preparation, consultation and planning (continued) 11.

FCP has been integrated into the IUCN Forest and Grassland Team. 1 1 Introduction Governance is a crucial factor in the equity, effectiveness and sustainability of forest landscape restoration (FLR). Governance concerns questions of, inter alia, how and by whom restoration decisions are made (including on whose land and incorporating whose knowledge and visions) and how FLR can impact rights and well-being in the short- and long-term. In 2014, to assist governments and other rights-holders and stakeholders with making FLR actionable, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), in collaboration with the World Resources Institute (WRI), produced the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) (IUCN & WRI, 2014). ROAM provides a framework for governments, rights-holders and stakeholders to define and prioritise FLR actions in a national or sub-national context, using participatory analysis of multiple factors. The ROAM framework, and the processes through which it is applied, address governance issues to varying degrees. The objective of this publication is to present lessons learned and offer recommendations on governance aspects of the ROAM framework and process and, by doing so, reinforce the ability of ROAM to inform effective, equitable and sustainable FLR. The analysis uses the IUCN Natural Resource Governance Framework (NRGF) (Springer et al., 2021) as its primary lens and also takes into account FLR principles agreed to by the Global Partnership on FLR (GPFLR) (see Besseau et al., 2018). It analyses strengths, opportunities and challenges in how ROAM addresses governance in its guidance and practice. It then offers recommendations for further integrating governance issues in ROAM, as inputs for developing more comprehensive guidance and practice going forward. 1.1 Importance of governance for FLR and ROAM With vast areas of the globe facing deforestation and forest degradation, FLR has become a priority involving numerous actors. To date, 61 countries, through 74 pledges, have collectively committed to restoring 210 million hectares of degraded and deforested land in response to the Bonn Challenge2 and associated regional platforms.3 Further, recognising the wider loss and degradation of ecosystems, the United Nations has declared 2021\u20132030 a Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. There is increasing evidence and awareness that governance is fundamental to effective and equitable conservation (e.g. Bennett et al., 2019; Borrini-Feyerabend et al., 2013; Springer et al., 2021), including restoration (Mansourian, 2016). This includes growing recognition of the extensive coverage and conservation contributions of territories and areas governed by Indigenous peoples and local communities (e.g. Dawson et al., 2021; ICCA Consortium, 2021; IPBES, 2019). An expanding body of research addresses forest governance (e.g. Agrawal et al., 2008; Barrow et al., 2016; McDermott et al., 2010; Nuesiri, 2018; Ribot, 2016) and landscape governance (e.g. Blomley & Walters, 2019; G\u00f6rg, 2007; van Oosten, 2013; van Oosten et al., 2014; Ros-Tonen et al., 2014). While there is far less research on FLR and governance, this work is also growing (e.g. Erbaugh et al., 2020; Guariguata & Brancalion, 2014; Mansourian, 2016; Mansourian, 2017; McLain et al., 2021). This is crucial because, while insights from forest and landscape governance are useful, FLR presents distinct governance issues. Landscapes are social and ecological systems, shaped by decision-making and power relationships across multiple sectors and spatial and temporal scales. FLR involves and impacts many actors, including local rights-holders and stakeholders across landscapes. As Erbaugh et al. (2020, p. 1) note: 2 The Bonn Challenge is a global goal to bring 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested landscapes into restoration by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030. 3 See, for example, the AFR100 (the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative) and the 20x20 Initiative for Latin America.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1029827b-43c3-4971-a5c0-96cc99db48a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "1029827b-43c3-4971-a5c0-96cc99db48a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in Menorca: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "040f90327483595e6074e80b7fe75fb1c42d2788f9d71699d769a30f225b7552"}, "2": {"node_id": "1aaeec5b-07df-45e7-b114-6201e427c527", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3136781cee47baff181662f49ed56a6128ecd219afcdfa72ae58af8ebd0a4ad9"}}, "hash": "6fe9a7fa6aff4a72112ac28f7a522f1fcc3303b347ab6aa566ad45f8297e9898", "text": "2 While \u201c[f]orest restoration occupies centre stage in global conversations about carbon removal and biodiversity conservation\u2026 recent research rarely acknowledges social dimensions or environmental justice implications related to its implementation\u2026 Forest landscape restoration that prioritizes local communities by affording them rights to manage and restore forests provides a promising option to align global agendas for climate mitigation, conservation, environmental justice and sustainable development.\u201d The governance aspects of FLR intervention design and implementation are critical, including how and by whom decisions are made, and how costs and benefits are distributed (e.g. Adams et al., 2016; Reed et al., 2016; Walters et al., 2019).

The large areas over which FLR is planned (through processes such as ROAM) concern many rights-holders and stakeholders with different rights, interests and power relationships. For example, in Madagascar\u2019s Fandriana-Marolambo landscape, WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature) International, with the endorsement of the Government of Madagascar, raised funding from the French government in 2004 to implement a FLR programme in a landscape with 150,000 people from three different ethnic groups. These communities were initially wary of engaging in the project. As a result, significant adjustments had to be made to the project once it had started (Mansourian et al., 2016). While concerns were ultimately addressed, this example demonstrates, inter alia, the importance of ensuring that the vision and priorities of local peoples and communities are reflected in and drive initial FLR conceptualisation and planning. This publication focuses on ROAM rather than comprehensively considering FLR governance. ROAM aims to operationalise FLR principles and is a widely used methodology for identifying and prioritising FLR strategies and initiatives. Accordingly, a ROAM process contributes to the entire FLR process (including design, implementation and monitoring) and is a means to an end \u2013 not the end in itself. In different FLR phases, distinct aspects of governance may take on more importance (Mansourian, 2016). For ROAM, governance issues related to FLR planning and initiation tend to be most important/prominent. Furthermore, governance opportunities and challenges in the landscape will largely define how the ROAM process is carried out and what outcomes it generates. Key issues may relate, for instance, to tenure conflict (Lovelock & Brown, 2020; McLain et al., 2021) or lack of cross-sectoral coordination (Mansourian, 2017). Therefore, the rights-holders and stakeholders convening and participating in the ROAM process need to consider not only the state of governance in the landscapes in which restoration opportunities are being assessed, but also prioritise effective and equitable FLR strategies and approaches that can adapt to a changing governance context over time. ROAM guidance and processes address governance issues to varying extents and in evolving ways. A more systematic integration of natural resource governance principles can add value to ROAM.

With respect to both guidance and practice, the analysis considers, as much as possible, the process (e.g. how ROAM assessments are, or are meant to be, governed) and content (e.g. how governance issues in the target landscapes are, or are meant to be, considered during those processes). Audience: This publication aims to support ROAM practitioners, including conveners, coordinators, facilitators and other participants in the process. Some recommendations also pertain to ROAM guidance and training. It assumes that the reader is familiar with ROAM, including its phases and main steps. Methodology: Primary analysis methods used are: (1) review of the most relevant ROAM guidance; (2) analysis of four ROAM processes (from assessments in Colombia, Indonesia, Malawi and Rwanda) based on interviews and document review; and (3) additional research, including review of selected literature. The analysis also considers some recent changes in ROAM practice and training. It uses the NRGF as its primary lens and takes into account FLR principles. Case analysis: Cases were selected in collaboration with the IUCN Forest Conservation Programme5 and IUCN regional offices. Each case provides lessons for how governance has been \u2013 and could further be \u2013 integrated into ROAM processes. Collectively, the cases cover diverse regions, demonstrate a range of strengths and challenges, and include a variety of institutional partners. Each individual case had sufficient documentation available and associated points of contact willing to share reflections, included IUCN as a supporting partner and had completed all phases of ROAM.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d7a3697-2c64-454a-9b54-06b4b1482102": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d7a3697-2c64-454a-9b54-06b4b1482102", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in Menorca: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f269a859f0373b69e3a408869685be260aa8403c171a7c19bed3e6e42f5ef95"}, "2": {"node_id": "67fb2dad-51dc-4a2d-95ea-926773ca3684", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bb3f2f1a6f36f7c540f9bd61cbed57772f10a456d35b4fd1bf9651ab73ddd623"}}, "hash": "2d77a7e60c30762dcf551dccf737edc24ad97b1859499f3e7215524b2325e7dd", "text": "Interviews were held with at least three key informants per case.

Comprehensiveness: While this analysis aims to be fairly comprehensive, there is always more to learn. Interviews were largely limited to individuals from convening organisations. They do not include direct accounts from participating community members. This should be a priority for future analysis. Although interviewees were generally open, it was difficult to obtain information about certain issues, including aspects of accountability. This may be due in part to budget constraints that limited the time available for research and necessitated remote interviews. 4 Where data was available, the analysis also considers impacts, including how and to what extent ROAM has resulted in FLR coordination or implementation. 5 This refers to the name of the programme at the time that this publication was developed. FCP is now integrated into the IUCN Forest and Grassland Team. 4 2 Alignment between NRGF and FLR principles The analysis in this publication was undertaken using the NRGF, an IUCN knowledge resource created to provide a robust, inclusive and credible approach to assessing and improving natural resource governance. At its core is a normative framework of values, principles and criteria for equitable and effective natural resource governance (Springer et al., 2021; see also Annex 1). The NRGF aims to be applicable to diverse levels and natural resource governance contexts, including restoration. This analysis also takes account of the FLR principles agreed to by the Global Partnership on FLR (GPFLR) in 2018, which ROAM seeks to operationalise and advance.6 These principles unpack and describe the FLR process. Table 1 shows the alignment between these two sets of principles. Several points of caution are necessary in understanding this alignment mapping. Firstly, the two sets of principles reflect different objects: a normative framework for governance (NRGF) versus largely descriptive elements of a long-term forest landscape restoration process (FLR). Secondly, they address different subjects. NRGF principles focus on governance, while FLR principles focus on many dimensions of FLR (including governance). In particular, and in keeping with some of the most widely used definitions of FLR, the FLR principles reflect, among others, FLR\u2019s: (1) dual social-ecological dimensions; (2) scale (the landscape); and (3) long-term nature. Finally, the mapping only considers principles. The fuller meaning of NRGF principles is elaborated in criteria that consider, inter alia, the laws and policies, processes and practices that enable their realisation (see Annex 1). Despite these differences, governance is intrinsic to many FLR principles and thus, many of the NRGF principles can apply to and reinforce those of FLR. At the same time, the NRGF generally goes further in describing key elements of effective and equitable governance. Therefore, the NRGF can add value and deepen the approach to governance within ROAM, as part of longer-term FLR. Specifically, the mapping exercise (Table 1) highlights that: \u2212 Two principles, concerning participation and the recognition and inclusion of diverse knowledge and cultures, apply relatively strongly to both NRGF and FLR. \u2212 Three NRGF principles are moderately aligned with/reflected in FLR principles. \u2212 Three NRGF principles are weakly aligned with/reflected in FLR principles. \u2212 Two NRGF principles do not appear to be considered in the FLR principles, namely: accountability and fair and effective rule of law. \u2212 One FLR principle (maintain and enhance natural ecosystems within landscapes) does not map explicitly with any NRGF principle but reflects instead an underlying NRGF value. 6 The FLR principles have seen many iterations. The most widely agreed upon are those articulated by the GPFLR (see Besseau et al., 2018, Fig. 4, p. 18). ROAM initially worked with eight principles, which were broadly similar to those from GPFLR (see IUCN & WRI, 2014). However, more recently, the ROAM process has adopted the GPFLR set of six principles.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82466659-9dca-45fd-9e61-0b6ce531de9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "82466659-9dca-45fd-9e61-0b6ce531de9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in Menorca: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94219665571eb4751193d40f0fbd78bbd2617dc44bdc7a2bb78b2cd60fa67a04"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d7467ec-9197-4b68-9508-884aab58c01e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2da55c18d284122b36225bbfa74e9decf1711f382bf72ccbc06f13fafdbd102a"}}, "hash": "95a55d891707d760663251cb7ae400f4ff3d6d5af5f98c56e98e61b7fe687f03", "text": "5 Table 1: Alignment between NRGF and FLR principles NRGF principles FLR principles Inclusive decision-making: Decision-making regarding natural resource policies and practices is based on the full and effective participation of all relevant actors, with particular attention to the voice and inclusion of rights-holders and groups at risk of marginalisation.

The governance related lessons from each case are then analysed in Section 5, in relation to NRGF principles. As described in Section 1.2 (Scope and methods), these cases were selected in collaboration with IUCN, based on the criteria that they each had sufficient information available, included IUCN as a partner, and had completed all ROAM phases, as well as collectively covering diverse regions and lessons. 4.1 Colombia11 Restoration has become a key activity for Colombia to achieve its national conservation priorities and international commitments. The ROAM process in eastern Antioquia identified options for increased connectivity between landscapes, ecosystems and habitats, and provided insight into the potential for FLR in post-conflict Colombia (see Table 3). The process positioned FLR as a key activity to address the 2016 peace agreement, including through enabling alternative livelihood options for the 600,000 displaced people returning to previously occupied conflict zones.

Eastern Antioquia has been strongly impacted by the country\u2019s 50-year conflict, where many people were kidnapped or killed or have fled to escape the conflict. The Antioquia region as a whole includes 20% of those who were displaced (over one million people) (Buitrago & Valencia, 2013). The high p\u00e1ramo (high-elevation ecosystem) still contains anti-personnel mines and many \u2018no-go zones\u2019. The 2016 peace accord impacts land use because it includes the creation of a fund to provide three million 11 Case background draws on ROAM report (Isaacs-Cubides et al., 2017) and key informant interviews. 12 For more information, please see: https://banco2.com/. 12 hectares of land to the most impacted rural communities. These lands are expected to come from the update, demarcation and strengthening of forest reserves, and communities are expected to develop plans to protect the environment and manage it sustainably (Bustos & Jaramillo, 2016). At the national level, Colombia\u2019s 2013\u20132023 National Restoration Plan (MADS, 2013) promotes restoration of degraded ecosystems while recognising traditional uses that do not degrade ecosystems. The plan has three priorities: (1) ecological restoration; (2) rehabilitation; and (3) reclamation. Each priority includes corresponding actions, objectives and indicators, which are to be carried out over 20 years in the short term (three years), medium term (eight years) and long term (20 years). In Antioquia, multi-stakeholder dialogues were a key component of the ROAM process. Their outputs provided policy makers with options for strengthening territorial management. These options are informed by policy, legal and financial analyses, and many seek to build on initiatives already initiated by CORNARE.13 The ROAM process in Colombia also included a study of financial incentives for restoration as well as the identification and prioritisation of restoration opportunities in eastern Antioquia. Following the process, Grupo Argos S.A (a Colombian conglomerate with large investments in the cement and energy industries) and Celsia (Grupo Argos S.A\u2019s energy company, which owns hydro, thermal and wind power generation plants in Antioquia) financed pilot restoration projects in the six prioritised areas identified from the ROAM process. This form of FLR financing highlights both the potential for ROAM outputs to inform longer-term FLR initiatives and the importance of such initiatives being implemented through continued rights-holder and stakeholder engagement and monitoring, with accountability for social and environmental impacts. 4.2 Indonesia14 The ROAM process in Gorontalo, Sulawesi, Indonesia was initiated to assess mangrove FLR opportunities in a landscape where 5,304 hectares (out of an original 8,847 hectares) of mangrove forests had been converted to aquaculture ponds over the past two decades (see Table 4). The Tanjung Panjang Landscape includes a National Nature Reserve (TPNR) and a District-level Conservation Forest Management Unit (FMU-C), both of which had been illegally deforested for aquaculture use. The ROAM process included three phases: (1) planning and preparation; (2) data collection and analysis; and (3) results to recommendations. Phase 1 involved an inception workshop with 19 participants from 13 institutions, as well as an independent stakeholder analysis performed by the research team. Phase 2 involved field data collection, including stakeholder interviews, economic costs and benefits analysis and biophysical research to inform restoration opportunities mapping. The restoration opportunity mapping took place during a second workshop, attended by 42 participants representing 20 stakeholder groups from local government agencies, NGOs, the local fish farming community of Tanjung Panjang and academia.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ffe557d3-8f05-4483-8de1-68b6074e44ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "ffe557d3-8f05-4483-8de1-68b6074e44ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in Menorca: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa997427d664bf388484d56259275081d686d6bd5975bf3dab435cee843d6f57"}, "2": {"node_id": "58a21b22-cf55-4b50-9d21-e3cedffc4d8d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f992c0727aa9329ada7ea44b4c37995d8bc6d8e9d1bb5bd88edf98496b869d5"}}, "hash": "6a947bdad450e2d15039dc9ed81da7bf9d15e025c00b2a5d889f2d589c7b58f7", "text": "The participants were given information about the collected data, which they then used to collectively construct an historical timeline of mangrove restoration-related policy and governance in the landscape.

Phase 2 also included qualitative content analysis of stakeholder interviews to uncover underlying issues that posed barriers to mangrove FLR.

Phase 3 involved a validation workshop with 24 representatives from 14 institutions. During this workshop, the three restoration scenarios were adopted as phases of restoration. This phased approach was later ratified by the Provincial Planning Agency (BAPPEDA). Although the ROAM process resulted in consensus, clear concerns and barriers emerged during the process. The concerns became more evident once private sector funding was offered for the full restoration scenario, but was rejected by stakeholders for fear of inciting conflict or resulting in leakage.16 Stakeholders are currently interested in implementing phases 1 and 2, which would restore 2.5% and 15.9% of the deforested landscape, respectively. 4.3 Malawi17 In 2016, Malawi made a 4.5 million hectare national restoration commitment to the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100)18 and the Bonn Challenge (two million hectares by 2020 and 2.5 million hectares by 2030). Prior to their commitments, a pilot ROAM process was conducted in the Liwonde Forest Reserve by the Department of Forestry, USAID and WRI. Malawi then conducted a ROAM process in 2016 at both the national and local levels with support from IUCN, WRI and USAID. A multi-sector Task Force was organised to guide the process (see Table 5). 15 More recently, Presidential Instruction No. 120 (2020) defined supportive processes to enable realisation of this 2045 commitment, including a feasibility assessment, livelihoods support and improved governance to ensure conservation of restored mangroves. 16 Leakage in this context refers to the unanticipated increase in deforestation elsewhere. 17 Case background draws on ROAM report (Ministry of Natural Resources, Energy and Mining (MNREM) Malawi, 2017) and key informant interviews. 18 For more information, see https://afr100.org/. 14 Table 5.

The government aims to expand opportunities for investment in FLR over the long-term by creating enabling conditions for social enterprises, donors and investors. It also aims to meet its related international development and environmental commitments. These include commitments under AFR100, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs), e.g. the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) Land Degradation Neutrality Target, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Aichi Targets. In 2014, the Government of Rwanda, in partnership with IUCN and WRI, carried out a national forest restoration assessment using ROAM (see Table 6), in part to define how it would meet its commitment under the Bonn Challenge. The assessment identified forest restoration potential from expanding agroforestry (1,110,476 hectares), changing management in woodlots (255,930 hectares) and timber plantations (17,849 hectares), and restoring natural forests (13,933 hectares) and protected forests (128,191 hectares). The assessment report also noted a need for capacity building in the forestry sector, which had yet to fully recover from loss of knowledge and human resources due to the 1994 genocide (Ministry of Natural Resources\u2013Rwanda, 2014). The assessment showed that, for it to succeed, the strong FLR commitment from the government must be supported by an equally strong, coordinated effort by civil society, development partners and donors. The Rwanda ROAM process and its outputs have had a strong impact on FLR. For example, since 2015, they have directly informed IUCN FLR projects in the Eastern provinces (Clear Horizon Consulting, 2016) and influenced the execution of the GEF-funded Landscape Approach to Forest Restoration and Conservation (LAFREC) project, which commenced in January 2015 in the Gishwati-Mukura corridor and surrounding forest landscapes.24 22 BMU is Germany\u2019s Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety. 23 DFID was the UK\u2019s Department for International Development.

The aim is not to evaluate or compare these cases, each of which is a rich story in its own right. Rather, this section draws broad lessons from across the cases to inform the recommendations in Section 6. It also briefly introduces NRGF principles and criteria and their relevance for FLR and ROAM (see also Annex 1).25 Principle 1: Inclusive decision-making Relevance of principle In the NRGF, inclusive decision-making means that \u201cdecision-making regarding natural resource policies and practices is based on the full and effective participation of all relevant actors, with particular attention to the voice and inclusion of rights-holders and groups at risk of marginalization\u201d (Springer et", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6eda1934-82c6-4aa3-a0a6-ed859d794907": {"__data__": {"id_": "6eda1934-82c6-4aa3-a0a6-ed859d794907", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in Menorca: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6ffeb55c1883330c761b8f51de7936131cd54bf522114a7681cdd680edc9d393"}, "3": {"node_id": "42e82889-25fc-4d67-9f30-a381016ef29f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39a075379bbcf1a2c84d9935691851d766d360886e13dcc2ff706183c41078bc"}}, "hash": "df0a10fea361fac18a149f3a9a2b12207808d78057e3739773fd1e604b384b7a", "text": "al., 2021, p. v). The criteria for realising this principle include having legal and policy frameworks that mandate inclusion, as well as having socially and culturally appropriate processes that enable full and effective participation in practice. Inclusive decision-making requires, inter alia, rights holder and stakeholder capacity, access to information and appropriate support, as well as recognition and respect for the right to FPIC (Springer et al., 2021). Sustainable forest management practices and guidance acknowledge that inclusion is important for both ethical and practical (e.g. implementation facilitation) reasons (Ananda, 2007). Inclusive decision-making in FLR helps ensure legitimacy of interventions (van Oosten et al., 2019). When decisions to plant trees are made for political reasons and/or in a top-down manner, implementation may be hampered by a lack of funding, engagement or other obstacles (e.g. Wiegant et al., 2020). Participation in environmental decision- making is also a procedural right in itself and a key aspect of exercising other human rights. Inclusion means more than a \u2018seat at the table\u2019. It concerns who has (and who does not have) power and voice, and why. Where restoration is implemented at large scales, as with FLR, more rights-holders and stakeholders are involved, adding to the complexity of ensuring inclusive decision-making. Within FLR, it is therefore critically important to consider inequitable power relations in multi-stakeholder processes (Hjortso et al., 2005), such as in mangrove restoration (Thompson, 2018). Key findings Convening stakeholders and policy makers to identify restoration opportunities is central to ROAM processes. The cases show an overarching orientation towards inclusive stakeholder engagement. They also highlight challenges in enabling full and effective participation in practice. Convenors: ROAM processes are typically convened by governments and/or large national institutions (often in collaboration with international actors such as IUCN). It is less clear whether/how communities in the targeted landscapes are part of initial discussions. This is an area for further exploration. 25 While this section is structured as a principle-by-principle analysis, the principles are also inter-related and mutually reinforcing; some key interlinkages are noted. 17 Gender inclusiveness: Gender inclusiveness in ROAM processes varies. Gender mainstreaming in the Malawi assessment enabled considerable attention to gender roles and labour issues, particularly for women. The Malawi ROAM report suggests ways to improve women\u2019s inclusion and empowerment (MNREM Malawi, 2017). In Indonesia, the assessment (focused on negotiating between government and fish farmers) tried to encourage women\u2019s participation, but did not conduct a gender analysis, sensitisation or action-planning.26 Who is included? Who decides? Convenors typically decide which groups to invite based on stakeholder analysis and mapping. This analysis should be inclusive, well-informed and unbiased. In Indonesia, an independent organisation conducted additional stakeholder mapping to help ensure decisions were not made by any specific convenor. Rights-holders and stakeholders may also decline or limit their engagement. This choice should be respected, although it can also pose challenges and should prompt convenors to ask whether the process can be improved. For example, opportunity mapping in Indonesia could not resolve issues around fish farmers\u2019 livelihood requirements, in part because their direct participation was limited by their organisation\u2019s choice to send only two representatives, with positions prepared in advance. Furthermore, the Indonesian ministry responsible for natural resource law enforcement would not attend ROAM workshops, which eroded trust in the process and weakened the ability of people to hold the ministry accountable through the process.27 Representation: Inclusion in ROAM processes often involves representative rather than direct participation, e.g. having representatives from multiple communities in landscape-level processes (as in Colombia) or nested representation in national level processes (as in Rwanda). Ensuring trusted, self-determined representation is crucial \u2013 and often challenging.28 In Colombia, the assessment involved the junta de acci\u00f3n comunal, a community-level committee representing rural organisations. Juntas supported and coordinated with technicians during the assessment, including to ensure they were speaking to the right people. They have convening power at the community level and can help represent communities, including by relaying messages between the community and higher political levels. At the same time, some people felt that their representatives did not represent all community members\u2019 interests.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42e82889-25fc-4d67-9f30-a381016ef29f": {"__data__": {"id_": "42e82889-25fc-4d67-9f30-a381016ef29f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in Menorca: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6ffeb55c1883330c761b8f51de7936131cd54bf522114a7681cdd680edc9d393"}, "2": {"node_id": "6eda1934-82c6-4aa3-a0a6-ed859d794907", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df0a10fea361fac18a149f3a9a2b12207808d78057e3739773fd1e604b384b7a"}}, "hash": "39a075379bbcf1a2c84d9935691851d766d360886e13dcc2ff706183c41078bc", "text": "Appropriate formats: Full and effective participation requires appropriate formats \u2013 including with respect to time, location, language, facilitation methods, etc. (see Recommendation 5).

This should include information about the process and its potential benefits, risks and limitations.29 Trust: Trust (and trustworthiness) are important factors in inclusion and other governance principles. For example, in Colombia, communities were understandably wary of another planning process and tool from the outside. The university played an important role in facilitating discussions, responding to communities\u2019 concerns about the ROAM process and highlighting potential benefits. Trust between these partners had grown over time, allowing the university to work closely with communities, including to share information. Questions from communities included whether restoring land would result in it being taken from them. Power dynamics and their impact on inclusion and voice: Power relationships influence who participates and how they participate. Not taking power dynamics into account in participatory processes can have unintended outcomes such as recognising some actors while inadvertently excluding others (Walters et al., 2019). Even in ostensibly inclusive processes, those with more power can easily have more influence on the 26 Notably, these assessments were planned before publication of the ROAM Gender Guidelines. Further, more recent ROAM training includes content on gender inclusion and responsiveness. 27 See Box 1 for more information about willingness of different groups to participate in this ROAM process. 28 This also relates closely to issues of appropriate institutional choice across scales, discussed under Principle 4. 29 Inclusion also requires that community members and other rights-holders and stakeholders know their rights (see Principle 10) and have space to effectively share their own learning and knowledge (see Principle 3). 18 process and its outcomes. For example, in Colombia, decisions about who to include in the ROAM process were largely made by one government institution, whose choices likely reflected historical and political factors. Murcia et al. (2016), in reviewing restoration projects in Colombia, found that the vast majority were designed and implemented by government agencies with little to no local stakeholder participation. In Indonesia, the assessment brought together numerous government, NGO and academic stakeholders. However, while community rights-holders and stakeholders were represented, direct community participation was limited (some communities chose not to participate due in part to lack of interest in the process and, as noted above, fish farmers opted to send only two representatives) and power dynamics limited community members\u2019 voice in the multi- stakeholder process. The main land users (fish farmers) settled in the protected areas in the last two decades and have no formal rights or decision-making power over the lands in question (see Box 1). Such limits to participation were later addressed through household interviews and qualitative content analysis (Brown, 2021) conducted to amplify the fish farmers\u2019 concerns that were not raised during multi-stakeholder meetings due to these power dynamics. Resources: The assessment in Malawi involved a district-level participatory process, including \u2018stocktaking\u2019 meetings with stakeholders in their localities, district level technical groups and mobilised communities. This was enabled by the availability of substantial funds. In contrast, in Colombia, while the ROAM process convenors\u2019 intention was to reach many local communities, in practice relatively few were represented, due in part to insufficient funds to support engagement. Beyond funding, meaningful participation requires appropriate skills (e.g. to facilitate effective and equitable multi-stakeholder processes), time (with some groups needing substantially more, including to meet in advance if they wish), and other resources. Inclusion beyond ROAM: ROAM processes often establish or strengthen multi-stakeholder platforms for FLR. For example, in Rwanda, partners established an inter-ministerial platform that interviewees felt enhanced FLR participation and coordination. One interviewee noted that there are now youth movements for FLR across the country and that extension workers proactively reach out to women to participate in FLR activities. Interviewees also indicated that the ROAM process strengthened inclusive decision-making regarding natural resource governance more generally by focusing on village residents\u2019 participation. These multi-stakeholder ROAM/FLR platforms provide the potential for sustained participation in FLR beyond the assessment period. There are also important considerations about the governance of these platforms, such as whether they build on existing institutions (versus creating new ones) and are accountable and inclusive, including of Indigenous peoples and local communities.

NRGF criteria concern, among others, the existence of laws/policies/rules, processes and capacities to recognise, respect and enforce land and resource rights (Springer et al., 2021, p. 7). As summarised by Larsen and Springer (2016, p. 5): \u201cTenure rights with regard to natural resources refer to the social relations and institutions governing access to and use of land and resources (von Benda-Beckmann, von Benda-Beckmann, and Wiber 2006). Tenure rights determine who is allowed to use which resources, in what way, for how long and under what conditions, as well as who is entitled to transfer rights to others and how (Larson 2012). Tenure rights are often described as a \u201cbundle of rights\u201d comprised of rights to access, use, manage, exclude others from, and alienate land and resources (Schlager and Ostrom 1992). Different rights in the bundle may be shared or divided in a number of ways and among stakeholders, along with the obligations and responsibilities associated with rights.\u201d Appropriately recognising and supporting Indigenous peoples\u2019 and local communities\u2019 collective rights to lands, territories, water and natural resources is crucial for equitable and effective biodiversity conservation, including in light of their contributions to global environmental sustainability (see Dawson et al., 2021; ICCA Consortium, 2021). In FLR, tenure is important with respect to land and territories, forests, trees and goods and services from the trees (Mansourian & Sgard, 2019). Secure and fair tenure rights are important to equitable and sustainable restoration (McLain et al., 2021; Nagendra, 2007), while insecure tenure and the inability to resolve tenure issues are barriers to effective and equitable FLR (Lovelock & Brown, 2020). Persistent challenges include insecure or unclear rights to trees and forests, insecure and/or inequitable rights for women, lack of statutory requirements for landholders to restore land, and conflicts over forest ecosystem services amongst communities, commercial concessions and governments (McLain et al., 2021). Key findings ROAM processes grapple with tenure in varying ways. Tenure security can be considered as a \u2018bottle neck\u2019 or \u2018success factor\u2019. However, tenure rights and systems are rarely addressed in depth. Scope of rights considered: Where tenure rights are addressed in ROAM processes, the focus is often (though not exclusively) on statutory land rights. For example, in Rwanda, the majority of people have title deeds because national policy requires all land to be registered. In line with this, both the ROAM process and the broader Rwanda FLR taskforce focus on respecting titled land rights. In Colombia, land tenure maps were used to help identify those with statutory land rights. These are important considerations. Recognising and respecting tenure rights also often goes beyond respecting land title deed. It involves recognising and appropriately supporting communal and individual statutory and customary rights over access, use and ownership of land and territories, water, trees and other natural resources. Respecting tenure rights requires understanding how tenure systems function in both law and practice (which may differ). Unrecognised or contested tenure: ROAM processes are often implemented in landscapes where tenure rights are unclear, unrecognised, contested, shifting or otherwise insecure. It is important in ROAM processes to understand the tenure systems in the landscape, including any concerns and grievances. For example, engaging only those who currently hold secure, statutory tenure may lead to inequitable results, e.g. by excluding people(s) whose rights are not appropriately recognised in that statutory system. At the same time, FLR initiatives must ensure respect for human rights, even where tenure is not secure. In Indonesia, analysis of the ROAM process highlights the challenge and importance of meaningfully including and addressing the 20 human rights and well-being of land-users who do not have recognised tenure rights, and are therefore vulnerable to bearing the costs of, but being excluded from the benefits of, restoration (see Box 1). In Colombia, resolving tenure questions was difficult in part because of historical challenges in the landscape, including widespread displacement and resettlement during the 50-year armed conflict.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67d5749e-3dc0-4b78-830e-7d22b9c62357": {"__data__": {"id_": "67d5749e-3dc0-4b78-830e-7d22b9c62357", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in Menorca: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9cf657af5e7ea98f7546c998273221c49a58b001599880a6f8fdb1cbea135b03"}, "2": {"node_id": "60b3d266-906b-4fde-a7d7-68a812dee44c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1481e7e0ca7c9988280cae8c053f69a6525bbe6c3bab6b36c98e6a46c976e485"}}, "hash": "0af6c88108c980f5ce5f05cd6cbd7a0f049427ad992918d2dd5357518755e806", "text": "A key question \u2013 and a hope of many stakeholders \u2013 was whether restoration could play a role in integrating people who had been displaced or who laid down their arms.

While tenure rights were not directly addressed in the Malawi assessment, they were touched on in the Diagnostic (e.g. as a barrier to restoration) and through work on community forests. The work on community forests aims to reduce pressure on nearby protected areas and bring resource use in community forests closer to users, especially women. While not specifically raised in the cases analysed here, many regions where FLR might be implemented are facing widespread land grabbing and mass migration. Tenure rights are dynamic and complex, but it is crucial that they are understood within ROAM processes and reflected in the restoration priorities identified. Enabling discussions on tenure: Even where the ROAM process cannot resolve tenure issues, understanding the challenges and (in appropriate ways) making them visible during the process can have additional benefits, such as opening or advancing dialogues among rights-holders and stakeholders. In Indonesia, while ROAM had little direct influence on tenure laws/policies, government authorities involved in the process considered increasing community access to some areas for sustainable use. In Rwanda, interviewees felt that the process strengthened recognition and respect for tenure rights, including in the FLR projects it informed. In summary, case analysis shows that ROAM processes frequently contend with tenure (and other inter- connected procedural and substantive rights), whether by default or design. More in-depth and systematic guidance and training on taking account of tenure, including to clearly identify customary and statutory rights and related concerns in the landscape, could enhance the ROAM process. This can, in turn, contribute to the effectiveness, equity and sustainability of the FLR initiatives identified and prioritised through the process. Box 1. Inclusion and voice in the context of contested tenure: reflections from the ROAM process in Tanjung Panjang by Benjamin Brown, PhD, Research Associate at Charles Darwin University Research Institute for Environment and Livelihoods and Co-Founder of Blue Forests (Yayasan Hutan Biru) The ROAM process in Indonesia demonstrates the importance and challenge of enabling full and effective participation of all rights-holders and stakeholders in the landscape, including those who lack formal or recognised tenure rights. Two communities lived in or used the Tanjung Panjang landscape on a subsistence basis prior to large- scale conversion of mangroves, which began in 2000. Terrestrial farmers from the Gorontaloan community lived in the area behind the mangrove forests, utilising the mangrove area only minimally, as the resources in the upper watershed and terrestrial area behind the coast and were rich and more easily accessible. Capture fishers from Bugis, Bajau, Siau and Gorontaloan suku (ethnic groups) living to the East or West of the Tanjung Panjang peninsula frequently fished the rich waters offshore from the mangroves, occasionally entering the forest for subsistence gathering of crab and molluscs. These traditional uses have continued but at a reduced level, as the mangrove forest has been degraded. It is important to remember that no community tenure (access, use) rights are recognised within the mangrove forests of the Strict Nature Reserve, which comprises half of the peninsula) and was gazetted in 1995. 21 Box 1 (continued) From 2000 to present day, 5,304 hectares of the original 8,847 hectares of mangrove forest across the entire District of Pohuwato were converted to brackish water aquaculture ponds. Most of the fish farmers working these ponds relocated from South Sulawesi, many settling and establishing fish farms in areas where they did not have formal land rights. Currently, up to 8,000 fish farmers and their families live in the area, integrated to some extent with the Gorontalo farming community. The median income of a fish farming household is US$ 14,074 per year (compared to US$ 2,880 average annual income for the province), posing a significant opportunity cost to mangrove restoration. During the stakeholder analysis to identify participants for the ROAM process, members of these three communities were interviewed to determine their degree of interest in the process and in mangrove FLR (MFLR). The interviewed Gorontalo farmers showed little interest in ROAM or MFLR, as they felt their agrarian livelihoods were not impacted by mangrove loss, and they were glad for the economic contribution of the fish farmers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d66351a2-3c91-430f-9579-e624640d95a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "d66351a2-3c91-430f-9579-e624640d95a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in Menorca: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f30ad8f1d82c80fb74bc83276454e6c30190384862ecbe401c7430da29ca9ece"}, "2": {"node_id": "b8323b14-739a-4c44-af27-07d2397e0045", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7aedf07349cbaa44af6e97e9876a291a4b343bd047be778f467bc68522284089"}}, "hash": "7ac22999f8a1bd5339fa0b4401d7874655582107f6e7581f28107dca5a3d5613", "text": "Capture fishers expressed interest in the results of MFLR to enhance offshore fisheries populations but were un-willing to participate in the ROAM process, stating that they did not wish to become involved in the politics of the situation, which they felt were between the fish farmers, park managers and authorities.

Throughout the ROAM process, 42 participants representing 20 institutions attended three workshops: (1) introductory; (2) restoration opportunity mapping; and (3) validation. By the end of the workshop series, participant consensus was reached on a three-phase approach to MFLR totalling 113 hectares, 842 hectares and 2493 hectares of restoration respectively for each phase. This three-phase approach was adopted in Province of Gorontalo Spatial (RTRW) and Development Plans (RPJM) in 2018. Later in 2018, substantial private finance was offered to implement the three-phases of MFLR. However, at that stage, stakeholders rejected the financing offer over concerns of potential conflict and/or leakage (i.e. policy or practice change in one place that causes unanticipated increase in deforestation in other places) if MFLR were implemented. Noting that power inequities in the multi-stakeholder forums may have inhibited fish farmers and other stakeholders from sharing their true concerns, 22 interviews were carried out with fish farmer households and extension workers, and qualitative content analysis (Erlingsson & Brysiewicz, 2017) was performed to uncover latent themes that did not emerge during ROAM workshops. Based on the themes uncovered during these interviews, as well as discussions in the ROAM meetings, five socio-economic concerns with MFLR were identified: (1) issues around the legality of providing compensation to those considered to be \u201cillegal\u201d land users; (2) the expressed desire of fish farmers to continue farming for five to 20 years; (3) lack of fish farmer access to future benefits from MFLR; (4) lack of viable commensurate livelihood alternatives in the landscape, due to lack of land ownership/tenure by current land users (fish farmers); and (5) concerns about conflict being exacerbated if MFLR were to proceed. In addition to these major themes, 16 social, economic and political barriers were identified that inhibited or restricted MFLR. In summary, this case highlights the challenge and importance of ensuring that the ROAM process meaningfully includes and addresses the human rights and well-being of land-users who do not have recognised tenure rights, and are therefore vulnerable to bearing the costs of, but being excluded from, the benefits of restoration. These are not \u2018outlier\u2019 cases; they are common in deforested and degraded landscapes, and as such warrant attention in ROAM guidance and processes. 22 Principle 3: Recognition of and respect for diverse cultures, knowledge and institutions Relevance of principle Recognition of and respect for diverse cultures, knowledge and institutions calls for \u201cnatural resource governance\u2026 grounded in sound and diverse forms of knowledge and respect for diverse cultures, values and practices\u201d. It speaks to the importance of governance arrangements that respect cultural rights and enable people to contribute their diverse knowledge, innovation and capacity to sustaining nature, including through their own institutions and systems30 (Springer et al., 2021). Despite the importance of culture, Wehi and Lord (2017) find that it is rare to incorporate cultural practices in restoration. Indigenous and local knowledge systems remain underrepresented and, therefore, not properly integrated into restoration plans (Lake et al., 2018; Hernandez & Vogt, 2020). Appropriately recognising and including Indigenous and local knowledge and practice can enhance restoration effectiveness and scope, while upholding rights, as seen in Tanzania, Hawaii and South Korea (Walters et al., 2019; Lee & Krasny, 2015; Chang et al. 2020; Kurashima et al., 2020). It is also in keeping with the growing recognition and inclusion of diverse cultures and knowledge systems in international policy processes around ecosystem services, such as in the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) conceptual framework (see D\u00edaz-Reviriego et al., 2019).31 Key findings Rapid cultural assessment tool: The IUCN team in Eastern and Southern Africa developed a rapid cultural assessment tool consisting of 10 questions aimed at understanding and supporting the use of traditional and cultural knowledge in FLR (see Box 2).

For example, in Malawi, there was a focus on farmer-managed natural regeneration, a peer-to-peer technology transfer amongst farmers fostering natural regeneration of trees on their farms. ROAM processes may also include collective mapping and discussions about preferred local strategies, e.g. 30 The role of appropriate recognition and inclusion of local institutions and governance systems in ROAM processes, including those of Indigenous peoples and local communities, is discussed in relation to devolution (see NRGF Principle 4, next section). 31 As summarised by Diaz et al. (2018, p. 270), \u201cOne of the more recent key elements of the IPBES conceptual framework [\u2026] is the notion of nature's contributions to people (NCP), which builds on the ecosystem service concept popularized by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) [\u2026] NCP as defined and put into practice in IPBES differs from earlier work in several important ways. First, the NCP approach recognizes the central and pervasive role that culture plays in defining all links between people and nature. Second, use of NCP elevates, emphasizes, and operationalizes the role of Indigenous and local knowledge in understanding nature's contribution to people.\u201d 32 These community-conserved forests contain community graveyards. They are often small forests which have high cultural and biodiversity value. 33 In Malawi, customary leaders (Traditional Authorities) are formally recognised and hold a number of governing roles, including over customary land and resolution of related disputes. 34 For more information, see https://elti.yale.edu/about-elti. 23 for growing food. For instance, in Rwanda, the process included steps to help ensure that local people participated in choosing the native tree species they wanted on their land. One interviewee noted that Indigenous knowledge was important in this ROAM process, particularly in relation to sacred groves. Challenges and considerations: Case analyses also highlighted challenges and considerations for meaningfully and respectfully incorporating diverse knowledge and ways of knowing in ROAM processes, including: \u2212 Respecting knowledge-holders: Recognising and respecting diverse knowledge, including Indigenous and local knowledge, needs to be grounded in recognition and respect for diverse knowledge-holders. This includes respecting rights to FPIC. The ROAM process may be best approached as one of equitable knowledge co-generation and sharing (Austin et al., 2018). \u2212 Respecting different visions: Respecting diverse knowledge and cultural systems also means respecting diverse visions and perspectives regarding FLR, including where they do not align with those of ROAM process convenors. \u2212 Inclusiveness: Governance principles are inter-related. This principle (recognition and respect for diverse cultures, knowledge and institutions) is closely related to inclusive decision-making. People who are not meaningfully engaged in the process cannot effectively share their knowledge. This principle also relates to learning, as recognition of other knowledge systems can stimulate exchange. \u2212 Power dynamics: During an assessment process, power dynamics can impact whose knowledge is recognised and respected. For example, in Malawi, despite the direct and innovative way that cultural knowledge was accounted for in the assessment, the recognition of traditional knowledge was a political issue. As one interviewee noted, \u201cthere's always a tussle between the TAs [Traditional Authorities] and the nation-state authorities\u201d. In summary, this principle is central to ROAM, and FLR more broadly. Innovative approaches in ROAM processes in Malawi and Mozambique, including use of the survey tool (Box 2), could be adopted in other contexts. Likewise, knowledge co-generation and sharing approaches in more recent ROAM processes could be expanded. ROAM guidance and practice can also be strengthened through further integration of collaborative research approaches (including by and with local people) and guidance that supports more systematic recognition of diverse cultures and forms of knowledge, including Indigenous and local knowledge, with FPIC.

The FLR questions were derived and tested so that culture might be better taken into account in restoration programmes. The tool \u201810 culture questions for FLR\u2019 can be used as part of ROAM guidance and practices and included as one of the success or barrier factors in the Restoration Diagnostic (Hanson et al., 2015). The questions can be applied at the national, sub-national (e.g. district) or landscape level. Key informants who possess cultural knowledge are important interviewees, especially as cultural dimensions are often hidden or undisclosed within a landscape. Some knowledge is the domain of local communities or Indigenous peoples and will require free, prior, informed consent (FPIC) for its collection, use, storage and dissemination. The questions were applied in Malawi as key informant interviews (taking 14\u201360 mins to administer) and in the margins of workshops or during groupwork sessions. As culture is often ethnically distinct, different ethnic groups were interviewed. One particularly useful strategy was to apply the tool with traditional leaders who are custodians of culture and often play important roles in land governance in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Malawi, for example, the Traditional Authorities play an important and government- recognised role within communities and over land and natural resources. In Mozambique, the r\u00e9gulo (chief) plays a similar role. Interviews with TAs and r\u00e9gulos flagged the importance of involving traditional leadership, and, as a result, this involvement was strengthened during the FLR processes. The interviews also highlighted the presence of landscape features such as sacred groves \u2013 which are often nodes of local biodiversity and where local norms about landscape governance are often embedded and can affect whole landscapes \u2013 and the presence of species with specific cultural values. Overall, and depending on the context, cultural knowledge can be either a supporting factor or a barrier to restoration, and there may be different elements in a single culture that can work in different directions with regard to FLR. Successful restoration efforts may require the development of new, culturally sensitive knowledge about restoration, and this tool helps as a starting point. The \u201810 culture questions for FLR\u2019 are: 1. To what extent does culture influence FLR in the area? 2. What are the main themes or domains where culture influences FLR? a) Land, land tenure, governance and rights b) Specific landscapes, features in the landscape, specific sites (e.g. sacred natural sites) c) Specific plant and animal species (e.g. food, taboos and beliefs, medicines, construction) d) Arts and crafts e) Institutions and cultural leadership f) Spirituality and religion 25 Box 2 (continued) 3.

The NRGF focuses in part on recognition and support for Indigenous peoples\u2019 and local communities\u2019 roles, rights and governance systems. In many countries, decentralised natural resource governance is the main approach to devolution and is inscribed in law (Ribot & Larson, 2005), e.g. Malawi\u2019s 1998 National Decentralisation Policy. Other countries may require public consultation about natural resource rules. Even when supported by policy, decentralisation may not be implemented or effective in practice, due to limited resources or a lack of governmental will (Ribot et al., 2006). Further, decentralisation policies and practices may or may not recognise customary institutions. Devolution is important for FLR, particularly where it recognises and supports local actors as leaders and change agents in restoration, including Indigenous peoples and local communities. Devolution is not typically addressed in the wider restoration literature, but can be seen as fundamental to supporting collective action in restoration (Akello et al., 2017). Key findings ROAM process scale: Aligning the ROAM process with the social and ecological scales of the FLR initiatives that will follow is both critical and challenging. ROAM processes can be done at a single scale such as national or sub-national or at multiple scales such as a series of local/sub-national assessments followed by a national 26 assessment. The process scale often affects how devolution is considered. For example, a national-level process may not consider devolution to local authorities to the same extent as a sub-national process. However, restoration is implemented in specific sites. Strategies identified at national (or even landscape) scales may not be relevant for or respectful of local actors if they are not included in the process. Therefore, ROAM processes at any scale should centre local issues and actors, including Indigenous peoples and local communities (see Box 3). At the same time, local and landscape-level initiatives often require decisions or actions at multiple levels. For example, in Indonesia the assessment primarily concerned the landscape level, but key decisions had to be taken at the provincial level. Therefore, decision makers from the provincial level were included. Given this, devolution in ROAM processes is likely to be less about finding the \u2018right\u2019 scale and more about designing a process through which rights-holders, stakeholders and other decision makers can meaningfully connect across scales, with empowered inclusion of local actors in all cases. Devolution in ROAM is thus closely linked with coordination (see Principle 6). Institutional recognition and relationships: ROAM processes are implemented in partnership with various institutions. Recognising and working with appropriate institutions is crucial for the process to be fittingly devolved, as well as inclusive (see Principle 1), well-coordinated (see Principle 6) and accountable (see Principle 8). In Rwanda, interviewees reported that the ROAM process strengthened forest governance devolution by recognising the policy, finance and coordination roles of the central government, as well as the leadership across Rwanda\u2019s five provinces, 30 districts, 416 sectors, 2,148 cells and 14,837 villages. They acknowledged that FLR initiatives must have both strong \u2018bottom-up\u2019 and \u2018top- down\u2019 support and consent to be successful. The institutional relationships and pathways in ROAM processes often reflect national decentralisation law and policy. In Malawi, the process involved district level consultation and local government collaboration to align with the National Decentralisation Policy. As one interviewee noted, \"in Malawi, districts are implementers\". The district level has the administrative budgets and ability to locally implement national projects. Meanwhile, in Indonesia, the process involved stakeholders from across national, provincial, district and village-levels, but the institutional home was a provincial-level multi-stakeholder working group (and outcomes were captured in the Provincial Spatial Planning Policy), consistent with national decentralisation law.35 Prioritising devolved FLR: ROAM processes sometimes take account of whether and how decentralised restoration is enabled, e.g. in law and policy analysis.

The costs of not recognising the primary position of local people is that FLR programmes and projects may not be just, and will not stand the test of time, as they will not have the local leadership and \u2018ownership\u2019 that is critical for enduring success. ROAM processes can contribute to recognising and encouraging local leadership and ownership of FLR initiatives. When governments signed on to the Bonn Challenge to restore 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested landscapes around the world by 2020, and 350 million hectares by 2030, some, like the Malawi government, did so by listening to the needs of local communities. Before the government launched its National Forest Landscape Restoration Assessment (NFLRA) process in February 2016, it carried out a ROAM pilot assessment from October 2015 to February 2016 in Liwonde Forest Reserve, in the Machinga District. This included consultations with district officials and local people, including women and traditional leaders. The Malawi government initiated this bottom-up process before pledging 4.5 million hectares to the Bonn Challenge in September 2016 at the IUCN World Conservation Congress. The Government of Malawi maintains that its FLR process aims to achieve a higher quality of life for rural people alongside achieving national and global development targets. Malawi\u2019s consultations represent a good practice, achieved with support from the ROAM process. It ensures that FLR is bottom-up, avoiding situations where Indigenous peoples and local communities are implicitly coerced to support top-down decisions made by national governments without prior consultations. The Malawi case illustrates that FLR can and should follow a more inclusive path, which diverges from past histories of other natural resource interventions that have been pursued to the detriment of local people and without respect for their environmental and social rights. Indigenous peoples and local communities are often among the last actors and authorities to be informed, consulted and empowered in national and sub-national decision-making about natural resources. Token gestures like inviting representatives of local communities to regional, national and global dialogues, sometimes without ensuring that these representatives are freely chosen by local people, can be commonplace. The Malawi ROAM process implemented a different strategy by centring local institutions and actors. The local level should not be viewed as \u2018beneath\u2019 national and global actors in a vertical hierarchy; rather, national and global levels are constituted of local groups and serve local rights-holders and stakeholders. The local level is primary, and ROAM processes and FLR efforts and financing should fully invest in working with and at the local level. Principle 5: Strategic vision, direction and learning Relevance of principle Strategic vision, direction and learning calls for \u201cnatural resource governance [\u2026] guided by an overall vision of desired environmental and social outcomes, and allow[ing] for adaptation in response to learning and changing conditions.\u201d Vision and direction should be developed through \u201cinclusive processes that account for diverse values and forms of knowledge of rights-holders and stakeholders,\u201d considering present circumstances and future challenges. It requires, among others, \u201congoing monitoring, reflection and learning that enables responsiveness to changing conditions and needs\u201d (Springer et al., 2021). 28 For FLR, an adaptable vision informed by ongoing learning is important because restoration is a long-term process that needs to be integrated across diverse and dynamic landscapes. The landscape scale adds complexity in reaching a common vision for FLR because of its intrinsic diversity and plurality (van Oosten et al., 2019). Lesson learning is important for relatively new processes like FLR, but is missing in most interventions (Mansourian & Vallauri, 2020). Key findings Objectives for ROAM process: The degree to which ROAM processes have clear, shared objectives varies.

The process for reaching an FLR vision varies, including in how it includes rights- holders and key stakeholders. In Indonesia, participants listed their long-term objectives for FLR. These included a protected landscape, tranquillity, community well-being, sustainable livelihoods, alternative livelihoods for fish farmers, increased value of aquaculture products, intensification of aquaculture, improved technology, mangrove-based eco-tourism, and education and awareness. Key challenges and considerations around defining an FLR vision and direction include: \u2212 Diverse vision and strategies \u2013 ROAM processes often highlight different perspectives and priorities among rights-holder and stakeholder groups across the landscape. Some actors may already have a clear vision for whether and how they wish to support restoration, while others may wish to refine or create new visions and strategies and some may choose not to participate. In all cases, visions and strategies for restoration may or may not align with one another, or with those of ROAM convenors. Equity regarding whose visions and priorities related to FLR are prioritised through the ROAM process is therefore crucial, including ensuring that those of Indigenous peoples and local communities are recognised and respected. ROAM can seek a broadly shared but locally differentiated vision for FLR \u2013 e.g. a commitment to the Bonn Challenge implemented through diverse strategies, including Indigenous- and community-defined and led restoration and with respect for rights including to self-determination and FPIC. \u2212 Negotiated vision and strategies \u2013 Strategies may also be negotiated among participants. In Indonesia, the three distinct FLR visions (scenarios) initially developed through the ROAM process were eventually merged into a three-phased approach that would enable full restoration over 10-20 years. This three-phased approach was a compromise to enable sign-on by government bodies that would not agree to any strategy that they felt conflicted with formal government mandates, including a mandate to achieve full restoration. \u2212 Short-term and site-specific strategies integrated in a long-term landscape vision \u2013 Short- term and site-specific strategies can be part of the pathway to a long-term, landscape vision for equitable FLR. For example, small woodlots might ensure community fuelwood supply as other areas are designated for forest restoration or agroforestry systems. Embedding ROAM processes in existing visions and strategies: ROAM processes and FLR plans are often embedded in existing, related government visions, strategies or plans. For example, in Rwanda, FLR is aligned with the national forest policy and national transformation policy, and the ROAM process was seen as providing a roadmap to deliver these larger-scale visions. In Colombia, the ROAM process was embedded in the national restoration plan and seen as a way of delivering on the national restoration plan in eastern Antioquia. In Indonesia, participants noted how MFLR in Tanjung Panjang could contribute to national and 29 global policy and strategic commitments, such as Nationally Determined Contributions, National Blue Carbon Strategy, the national mangrove restoration policy, the 13th and 14th SDGs and the CBD Aichi Targets. Multi-directional learning grounded in historical and current context: The FLR vision and strategies resulting from the ROAM process are informed by numerous analyses. In this sense, learning is at the centre of the process. Which questions are asked (and unasked) in these analyses, and whose knowledge is (and is not) reflected in the answers, are therefore crucial considerations. The analyses informing the ROAM process should be inclusive and credible. Learning should be multi-directional, multi-scalar and inclusive (see Principle 3). The process should also reflect a deep understanding of the historical and current context, e.g. in analysing \u2018drivers of degradation\u2019 (see Box 4). Looking beyond the ROAM process: ROAM and FLR have different timelines. FLR visions and strategies developed during ROAM processes have to live beyond the assessment to be meaningful. Related challenges and considerations include: \u2212 Long-term learning and adaptation \u2013 The ROAM process can impact governance and, through that, long-term FLR implementation. For example, ROAM can improve the cross-sectoral collaboration needed for FLR implementation (as was seen in Rwanda).

Some interviewees suggested that the three leads lacked a common vision, and that only CORNARE had long-term legitimacy in the region, which adversely impacted ROAM outcomes and follow-up. In summary, this principle is important to ROAM, as the process seeks to reach a broad, shared vision for FLR. Particularly where the ROAM process and outputs can align with existing plans, strategies and visions, it can add significant value. Lack of a shared vision may impede future implementation of effective and equitable FLR.37 At the same time, ROAM processes often highlight the diversity of visions, priorities and strategies for restoration across the landscape. It is crucial that the process respects this diversity and ensures equity in terms of whose restoration visions and priorities are prioritised through the process. Learning and adaptation are also critical to the longer-term restoration efforts that ROAM processes aim to support. 37 Implementation may also be impacted by many other factors, such as lack of funding and/or clear champions. 30 Box 4. Placing drivers of degradation in context by Gretchen Walters, Assistant Professor, University of Lausanne, Institute of Geography and Sustainability ROAM assessments often list or analyse drivers of degradation. However, interpreting degradation and its drivers can be complicated, and sometimes driven by \u201creceived wisdom\u201d which adopts a degradation narrative,38 often incorrect and/or lacking analysis (Leach & Mearns, 1996). According to Leach and Mearns, for example, it is common to assume that swidden (sometimes referred to as \u201cslash and burn\u201d) agriculture causes deforestation, when this is not always the case. They note that is important to consider drivers of deforestation and degradation in context and to ensure they are not unfairly placed at the feet of marginalised people. Land degradation is a common theme associated with Malawi. In the Malawi ROAM report, indirect drivers of deforestation, as identified by stakeholders and rights-holders, include poor agricultural practices and the harvest of fuelwood. However, according to social scientists, there is another story behind Malawi\u2019s degradation, as described in the next paragraphs. Understanding these drivers will ultimately help target restoration initiatives appropriately. Drivers of degradation can vary spatially and by usage. For example, fuelwood consumption, a major concern in Malawi, comprises different uses, from using deadwood to collecting wood for commercial fish smoking. While some uses have little impact, others may be larger (Abbot & Homewood, 1999). For instance, fuelwood impacts can be highly localised and diverse, especially when destined for charcoal making, a key concern (Zulu, 2010). Zulu calls for \u201ca nuanced understanding of principle causes of deforestation, of wood fuel supply patterns and chains, wood fuel markets and trade, and patterns of energy use\u201d, demonstrating the variation in fuelwood demand throughout Malawi. The origins of degradation may not be straightforward and have long histories that should be taken in consideration. For example, in Malawi, degradation might be attributed to colonial era policies, which reduced local people\u2019s capacities to govern and manage their natural resources (Kwashirai, n.d.; McCracken, 1987). Degradation in the form of erosion emerged from large-scale colonial estates, which went unmanaged for many years (Mulwafu, 2002). These examples demonstrate that degradation is neither the result of one specific social group nor solely the result of present-day practice. Peter Walker\u2019s (2004) work on historical influences on restoration in Malawi is useful and is summarised in this paragraph. He found that degradation may be caused by land dispossession and resistance to tree planting. Large areas of land were taken from local farmers in the colonial era to create European estates, which occupied as much as 45% of the cultivable land and thus created land shortages for local farmers. The practice of creating estates continued under the Banda regime in the 1980s. A colonial concern was fuel wood supply, and although colonial foresters acknowledged that deforestation was driven by European tobacco estates, blame was placed on local farmers. Colonial efforts to address deforestation focused on planting exotic species, and colonial programmes to encourage villagers to plant exotic trees created an \u201capathy toward afforestation\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eab1dcf5-16d0-49be-9202-924ee838c2f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "eab1dcf5-16d0-49be-9202-924ee838c2f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in Menorca: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4640aee07747c712d3045b3cc74bfe8098ab65c631134b20ccc74de0d9c08f82"}, "2": {"node_id": "728dc5f0-ee7e-4170-831f-1347f5d66f85", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "507d97bdf6f44a7ed23aa88ea8a9f68f3a7d9f93f41df713069f172074a7fe06"}}, "hash": "699985b324d2ed29b3f69a124a17dd0b0c56f85b470a8e239f5cd68e5ccde773", "text": "Resistance to these tree planting programmes continued from the 1910s into the 1990s.

This includes horizontal coordination among actors working at the same governance level (e.g. within a district or village) as well as vertical coordination among actors working at different levels (e.g. from village to district to national government). It also pertains to coherence and alignment within and across natural resource and related sectors \u2013 e.g. in the laws and policies governing land tenure, forestry and agriculture in a restoration landscape (Springer et al., 2021). Given its multi-scalar, landscape orientation, this kind of coordination and coherence can be important for the success of ROAM processes and the FLR initiatives they prioritise. Key findings Leadership for ROAM processes: The choice of institutional leads in a ROAM process helps determine its governance and ultimate impact. In Colombia, for instance, a lead organisation helped to ensure broad acceptance of the process by rights-holders and stakeholders, make linkages with other relevant processes and actors, and provide long-term follow-up. In Malawi, the Forestry Department, as institutional lead, coordinated across devolved structures and helped ensure long-term sustainability and government follow- up. This resulted in a national programme and district level implementation plans with allocated funding. Multi-stakeholder coordination for ROAM processes: The ROAM process typically requires multi- stakeholder coordination. This can also enable longer-term coordination for FLR. For example, in Rwanda, a \u2018cross sectoral taskforce for FLR\u2019 was established. Interviewees indicated that this task force is widely seen as a major success, with neighbouring countries seeking to replicate it. In Malawi, a multi-sector task force guided and supported the national assessment process. This coordination translated into concrete collaboration around FLR, with the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Energy and local government coming together to reflect on implementing the FLR strategy. In Indonesia, the selection of the (pre-existing) Gorontalo Mangrove Management Working Group (KKMD) as the institutional home for the process helped ensure multi- sectoral, multi-stakeholder involvement. More recent ROAM processes have involved identifying or establishing a governance structure and team to implement the assessment following training. These governance structures are critical to participation throughout the ROAM process, and training teams encourage convenors to be inclusive in forming them. Areas for further exploration include how ROAM governance structures build on and align with existing institutions and connect local, landscape and national decision-makers. Cross-scale collaboration: ROAM processes often build on existing policies and institutions to enable cross-scale collaboration. For example, in Indonesia, national and district level forest governance arrangements required cross-scale collaboration between agencies. In Colombia, the ROAM process brought an international dimension to an existing restoration policy and increased the policy\u2019s visibility. At the same time, practice illustrates a number of related challenges. For example, operating jointly at larger (landscape) scales often requires a shift in mindset. This is particularly true as each convening group wants to emphasise its own independent actions. Coordination across diverse rights-holders and stakeholders in the landscape, operating with different timeframes, is also a challenge when bridging ROAM outcomes with implementation. For example, in Rwanda, one interviewee noted that, \u201cthe plethora of actors involved in FLR (\u2026) would imply a need for strong coordination efforts; the large amount of funds being generated for FLR also speak to the need for equitable benefit sharing\u201d. In all cases, cross-scale collaboration should support, rather than diminish, the role of local actors who will govern, implement and be impacted by FLR (see Box 3 and Principle 4). 32 Overlapping and unclear roles: ROAM processes may lead to \u201cover-coordination\u201d. For example, one interviewee felt that, in Colombia, too many people were seeking to lead, with limited resources and staff to deliver change on the ground. There are also challenges in understanding and respecting the roles of each rights-holder and stakeholder group, especially when there are many involved.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c6af159-93ab-4202-9924-06123755aec8": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c6af159-93ab-4202-9924-06123755aec8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in Menorca: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e82049348ad3214abf4a8fbc3db50800677f2ce906baa6926ff9a5aedc608b2"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8bf9811-5af6-4f10-9e03-54189d0073bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3c932ea6a11215f2e927acf930bbed7b59c210f068482925eec7bca22845f06e"}}, "hash": "2ba28e46baf3877fcc52907041232eb07be18f2cd677f58d441974ad760c0f22", "text": "For example, in Malawi, when the Restoration Diagnostic was carried out, it emerged that roles and responsibilities were not clearly understood, and it was unclear who held ultimate authority.

For example, in Malawi, the process included a review of policies, laws and regulations affecting restoration and concluded that there was need for harmonisation. In Colombia, the process contributed to the national restoration plan. To be complete, such analyses should consider alignment across the range of statutory and customary laws and policies related to restoration, including overlapping and conflicting provisions. These may include local, sub-national or national instruments across multiple sectors. In summary, this principle is highly relevant to ROAM and FLR, which call for coordinated approaches. ROAM guidance recognises the need to include key rights-holders and stakeholders, including women, both in the development of a coherent process and in the convening of a coordination group. Yet practice shows that achieving coordination and coherence across diverse groups and scales is challenging. Time is needed to enable reconciliation of different interests and priorities, even within the core team. ROAM processes can also help to identify ways to improve coherence among restoration related laws, policies and plans, including to better enable equitable and effective FLR. Principle 7: Sustainable and equitably shared resources Relevance of principle The principle of sustainable and equitably shared resources calls for \u201cactors responsible for natural resources [to] have the means necessary to carry out sustainable management and governance activities, including from the equitable sharing of benefits generated from natural resources\u201d (Springer et al., 2021, p. 24). Those who are governing and managing resources should have sufficient revenues and/or support from sustainable livelihoods and a fair share in diverse benefits. Losses borne by local rights-holders and vulnerable people resulting from conservation should be avoided or, where avoidance is not possible, minimised and fairly compensated. Benefits should be sustained over time, including for future generations. This principle addresses equitable benefit and cost sharing in its own right, and highlights that such equity is an important factor in whether people are able to meet environmental responsibilities (Springer et al., 2021). Restoration results in more than economic and environmental benefits; it extends to well-being and livelihoods (Erbaugh & Oldekop, 2018). Despite this, restoration literature often uses a financial perspective to focus on restoration costs and benefits (e.g. L\u00f6fqvist & Ghazoul, 2019). Key findings The cases illustrate a strong overall focus on FLR costs and benefits in ROAM processes, as well as some associated challenges. For example: 33 Distribution, including for those without secure tenure rights: ROAM processes typically include cost-benefit analysis of proposed restoration scenarios or initiatives. To understand whether these initiatives are likely to be equitable, the analysis needs to consider distribution, such as whose costs? who benefits? over what time? The analyses done in ROAM processes typically consider direct benefits for land-owners as well as indirect benefits for both people in the landscape more generally (e.g. clean water, and climate adaption, etc.). However, ROAM guidance does not substantively address questions of cost - benefit analysis where land users lack secure rights. These challenging cases do arise in practice. In Indonesia, for example, benefit sharing was considered in light of various groups\u2019 needs. Most fish farmers had migrated to and settled in the area without legal rights to the land or fish ponds (see Box 1). Given this, many fish farmers would not directly benefit from MFLR, and would face high opportunity costs. This, along with lack of commensurate livelihood alternatives for current land users within or around the landscape, posed a significant barrier to equitable and effective MFLR. Spatial and temporal scales of restoration: FLR is a long-term process. Some benefits will only accrue after many years, e.g. the 35 years it may take for a return on investing in mahogany trees (Colomer et al., 2018). Other FLR initiatives can generate shorter-term benefits, such as water retention, erosion control and increased soil fertility. Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR), for example, can yield relatively quick benefits in soil and wood material provision. These timeframes should be taken into account when discussing options with rights-holders and stakeholders. To understand if FLR initiatives will be equitable and cost effective, costs and benefits need to be considered in relationship to one another, both spatially and over time. Integrating these factors can be challenging.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8fbf899-dda5-4591-a94c-a23b697ab9b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8fbf899-dda5-4591-a94c-a23b697ab9b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in Menorca: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b25715b714f7d89bc8d03db333e366b20716eb65d7eda01b162f9809373a1b9"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa7d8ddd-4c37-4520-a0ec-4c9c9cf711f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a3668fad2a874671eb7fa33b442878a69b036b75d3018e84c5a048749be277de"}}, "hash": "fb0079e84ba5f15a1bb4b51e616b40f08d3a9b34096598aa69e06a135709e092", "text": "Integrating these factors can be challenging.

Conversely, in the scenario with the smallest proposed restoration area, the cost of restoration outweighed benefits even in the longer-term, particularly given the high opportunity cost to fish farmers. Considering diverse benefits and costs and well-being more broadly: The costs and benefits of restoration extend well beyond economic and financial aspects. While more recent ROAM processes have considered a fairly wide set of benefits, the considered costs still tend to be limited to economic factors. Considering a fuller set of social, cultural and economic benefits and costs, as well as the broader concept of well-being, could enrich the ROAM process. Robust trade-off analysis could also help rights-holders and stakeholders consider the intersections of social, economic and environmental outcomes of FLR.

However, many people do not benefit from the natural resources due to degradation. One interviewee suggested reframing the issue from \u201csharing the consequences of degradation\u201d to \u201csharing the benefits of restoration\u201d. This reframing could support communities in claiming rights, e.g. by raising this issue to governments to seek funding for restoration initiatives to increase food security. Communities as partners: According to one interviewee for Malawi, the approach to ROAM and finance was at times oriented around companies looking for labour for activities, such as tree-planting, rather than establishing a fair partnership with communities for investing in locally-controlled forests (see Elson, 2012). Agreeing on restoration costs and benefits: Funding and other limitations may result in insufficient time to resolve disagreements between rights-holders and key stakeholders on benefit and cost sharing, including opportunity costs. In summary, key aspects of this principle are reflected in the cost-benefit analysis in the ROAM framework. However, there are several factors that could be strengthened, including ensuring that the geographical and temporal scale of analysis matches the scale of implementation; considering a full set of social, cultural and economic costs and benefits, including their distribution; and integrating broader conceptualisation of human well-being. Principle 8: Accountability Relevance of principle Accountability calls for the \u201cactors responsible for or affecting natural resource governance [to be answerable] for their actions and the environmental and social impacts they produce\u201d (Springer et al., 2021, p. 25). It is enabled when those actors (and their institutions) are transparent and have clearly-defined roles, capacities and processes/mechanisms through which to meet their obligations. It involves being answerable for the impact of governance and management on rights-holders and vulnerable people and environments, as well as being able to address corruption (the use of public power for private gain) (Springer et al., 2021). Accountability can be seen as an instrument for just outcomes in the relationships among different agents, such as governments and citizens (Caddy et al., 2007). Accountable actors may be elected representatives, project managers (e.g. for the ROAM process), customary leaders or government agents or representatives. In processes involving powerful actors, accountability can be hindered by lack of political will, weak capacity for collective action, lack of resources and weak regulations (Nuesiri, 2016). FLR implementation requires accountability, i.e. answerability, especially given the timeframes and direct and indirect costs involved, including opportunity costs (Murcia et al., 2016). Importantly, accountability relates to being responsible for both actions (e.g. whether those with responsibility act fairly) and inactions (e.g. whether those with responsibility fail to meet their commitments and/or be transparent). Key findings Accountability relationships during the ROAM process: It is both important and challenging to ensure that the roles and responsibilities of actors in the ROAM process are clear, including how convenors will be accountable to the rights-holders and stakeholders involved. In Colombia, there were concerns raised about the accountability of the main government and international actors to local communities, although the university partner had a relationship of trust with communities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "030639b2-edae-4744-9fb8-1fec3e6077f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "030639b2-edae-4744-9fb8-1fec3e6077f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in Menorca: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "351605d7f3c770c942828f6bad3eb7cf2541f4dbb594e2f45d34a836a5795a94"}, "2": {"node_id": "61abcabf-e0e3-4e02-a480-2aee42767610", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c23d0556bff482af98887589b0114887ebdb258eb7b65ff01311aee340373ae"}}, "hash": "92515dbcbb1e10367d3953542350304399fd59eb613d336786ea7bb76595f347", "text": "35 Accountability for social and environmental impacts: FLR initiatives identified through ROAM processes should be socially and environmentally sound, including upholding rights and generating multiple, equitably shared benefits.

Accountability for the potential impacts of FLR can also be enhanced through ensuring an inclusive ROAM process. If the process is not inclusive, important restoration considerations may be excluded. For example, according to one interviewee working at the regional level in Kenya, where rangelands cover 75% of the country, a ROAM assessment did not include rangelands restoration as a key intervention until it was noted by a senior staff member of a participating NGO well into the process. At the same time, ROAM processes should avoid becoming forums for assigning blame for degradation. For example, in Indonesia, ROAM meetings were facilitated with an eye towards minimising scapegoating, especially of the fish farmers who established fish farms inside the protected area and the forest managers who previously \"allowed\" this landscape conversion. In this case, there were also efforts by fish farmers and an allied NGO to seek accountability for recent injustices, as well as stated intent from a government official to hold fisher farmers accountable for contributing to restoration39 (see also Boxes 1 and 4 and Principle 10). Accountability for FLR implementation: As FLR implementation and monitoring are outside the scope of the process, ROAM outputs generally do not define accountability mechanisms for these steps. This enables flexibility40 and might also avoid creating pressure to impose initiatives on rights-holders or stakeholders who were not directly involved. Further, funding and convening ROAM processes with the expectation that they must result in FLR could incentivise downplaying barriers to or risks of FLR. At the same time, concluding the ROAM process without clarity about whether (and by whom, when, etc.) the identified priorities will be carried forward can be frustrating for participants. In Colombia, for example, community members were disappointed when ROAM finished without any clear follow-up in the short-term, due in part to lack of funding. (In Malawi, funding from the GEF supported FLR implementation.) Assessment without responsive action is not a challenge unique to ROAM (e.g. Campese & Sulle, 2019). Nonetheless, it is a challenge worth addressing, including out of respect for the rights-holders and stakeholders who contribute their time, knowledge and vision. As noted in the Diagnostic, part of empowered decision-making is accountability for the decisions made. 39 Fish farmers and a local NGO filed a petition to the Ministry of Human Rights during the assessment period related to the GAKUM agency dismantling five fish farmers\u2019 houses the year prior in an enforcement operation. At the same time, the head of the Forest Management Unit said that the fish farmers should contribute in some way to restoration (reparations), and that he would pursue that mechanism in his jurisdiction. 40 For example, in Malawi, the assessment was convened by the Forest Department, but two of the five recommended initiatives were then implemented by the Ministry of Gender.

The ROAM process can help stakeholders identify better siltation capture solutions upstream, allowing for a more stable electric power source.

For example, the Malawi ROAM report notes areas where restoration could be enhanced by addressing accountability, e.g. in participatory forest management (MNREM Malawi, 2017). These steps could also include a focus on accountability for social impacts. At the national and international levels, the Bonn Challenge, while not a ROAM framework component, helps create accountability for FLR and could be linked to ROAM outputs. In particular, the Barometer42 promotes follow through on commitments (Dave et al., 2019). However, the Barometer includes only one social indicator \u2013 the creation of green jobs.43 In summary, while FLR implementation and monitoring are largely outside the scope, ROAM processes can point the way towards accountable restoration \u2013 e.g. by building in safeguards and being clear about who is (or could be) accountable to whom, including accountability to Indigenous peoples and local communities.

The forest sector is considered a high priority economic development sector in Rwanda (Ministry of Natural Resources Rwanda, 2014). Rwanda\u2019s Vision 2020 includes a target to increase forest cover to 30% of land area by 2020. A 2019 Rwanda Forest Cover Mapping exercise supported by IUCN shows progress towards meeting this target (Republic of Rwanda, 2019). Rwanda\u2019s FLR programme is impacting economic development, including expanding investment opportunities. The first steps Rwanda took to operationalise its FLR vision included the 2014 national forest restoration assessment using ROAM, in partnership with IUCN and WRI. Impacts of this ROAM process include: \u2212 Substantially influencing Rwandan FLR policy; \u2212 Providing a technical roadmap to move from the FLR vision to guided activities on the ground; \u2212 Enabling investment in FLR projects, such as the Forest Landscape Restoration in the Mayaga Region project, funded by the GEF for US$ 33 million; \u2212 Creating the \u2018Cross Sectoral Taskforce for FLR,\u2019 which strengthens coordination of FLR activities in Rwanda; and \u2212 Being the first African country to pilot the Bonn Challenge Barometer of Progress, which positioned Rwanda as a model for FLR in the region. \u2212 In short, the ROAM process provided practical inputs to execute Rwanda\u2019s FLR vision and made the country a leader in FLR on the African continent. This success has also raised the challenge of accountability between actors (top-down and bottom-up) and among actors (horizontal peer accountability) in FLR implementation. There is also an urgent need for independent verification of achievements (diagonal accountability). Strong accountability is crucial for sustainability, effectiveness and equity of FLR initiatives in Rwanda. 41 These pathways vary widely. For example, in Malawi the government wanted to use ROAM to address degradation, including the enhancement of public funding for restoration. In Colombia, the government saw ROAM as a contribution to ongoing peace crops initiatives. 42 The Restoration Barometer is a \u201cframework for identifying, assessing and tracking action on global restoration commitments\u201d. More information is available on: https://www.iucn.org/resources/conservation-tool/restoration-barometer. 43 It also includes the \u201cflexibility to designate by job duration, gender type, or job type (i.e. maintenance versus implementation)\u201d. 37 Principle 9: Fair and effective rule of law Relevance of principle Fair and effective rule of law means that \u201cnatural resource-related laws and their application are fair, effective and protect fundamental rights.\u201d This requires, among others, a clear system of natural resource-related laws and policies that are \u201cconsistent with human rights and take account of the situation of Indigenous peoples and local communities, women and vulnerable groups\u201d and that \u201cincorporate principles of environmental sustainability.\u201d It requires that laws and policies are equitably and humanely enforced, and that those responsible for implementation have the resources and capacities they need. (Springer et al., 2021) These are crucial considerations, as reforestation and restoration efforts have been associated with the miscarriage of justice in several instances (e.g. Zoomers, 2010; Rai et al., 2018). Case analysis and key findings When and how rule of law is considered: ROAM processes may consider rule of law in legal/policy analysis, theory of change analysis, and/or application of the Diagnostic, among others. These analyses often focus on how laws and policies facilitate or impede restoration. It is also important to consider the fairness of laws and their enforcement. Resolving concerns related to the content or enforcement of laws is likely outside the scope of a ROAM process. However, identifying concerns helps ensure that they are taken into account, e.g. in prioritising FLR initiatives and highlighting issues to be addressed during FLR implementation. For example, if there are unjust (or unjustly enforced) statutory tenure laws, FLR initiatives implemented through them may themselves be unjust. If there is a community forestry policy in place, but the processes for its implementation are unclear or inaccessible, FLR initiatives implemented through that policy may face those same barriers. For example, in the Malawi ROAM report, enforcement of some laws is highlighted as essential for reducing degradation (MNREM Malawi, 2017).44 The Rwanda assessment recognised a need to strengthen natural resource rule of law, though doing so has not yet been prioritised in FLR implementation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab0c0593-b3e4-4dd4-83fa-e0aa0c282562": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab0c0593-b3e4-4dd4-83fa-e0aa0c282562", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in Menorca: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7c6f48aec89de422a838872c166cf068a71d6e5dd5a37281025ac734f49f8d6"}, "2": {"node_id": "ffcd2dbf-8908-4dc3-ba76-73ba5289eccc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80da34c4a34c4686b49f8d6c9fb3d87f25d40848f79b7293e185796ce1684572"}}, "hash": "9af2b223dd5b44ad91b225ab86ac25842dcc7034dbab9efb027e34ab5e2386d3", "text": "Taking such issues into account can help ensure that FLR initiatives identified through ROAM processes will be fair and effective.

This revealed an important but complex story about the role that rule of law had played in the landscape over the last two decades, and what that implied for the current restoration options. Broadly, the conversion of mangroves to \u2018illegal\u2019 fish farming ponds had been tacitly allowed over the last 20 years for a number of reasons, including that this conversion resulted in substantial financial benefits for local law enforcement officers and other government agencies, and that restoration was not a legal option until 2013. In that context, most stakeholders realised the risk of only fully enforcing the law 20 years after conversion, including that doing so would result in displacement and violent conflict. This situation cannot be fairly resolved through law enforcement alone. A more comprehensive solution is required to fairly resolve this complex set of problems. 44 The ROAM report notes that it will be important to: \u201cEstablish appropriate compliance mechanisms to strengthen enforcement of related laws and policies, in particular for forest clearing restrictions and for community forest management. Weak enforcement of forest laws \u2013 underpinned by high resource demand, limited financial and human resources, rent seeking behaviour and corruption risks \u2013 were identified as a main barrier to achieving FLR at scale\u201d. One interviewee noted that the Forest Act was old and that the revision was not yet complete (but was underway at that time). It will largely raise fines and penalties to reduce illegal activities and so support restoration. 38 In summary, ROAM takes account of the legal and policy landscape. Giving more focus to whether the content and enforcement of laws is fair and consistent with human rights could enhance the ability of ROAM processes to support effective and equitable FLR implementation. This could be addressed in ROAM guidance. Principle 10: Access to justice and conflict resolution Relevance of principle Access to justice and conflict resolution means that \u201cpeople are able to seek and obtain remedies for grievances and resolve conflicts regarding land and natural resources\u201d. This requires, among others, that impartial and effective \u201cformal or informal mechanisms are in place to resolve conflicts and grievances regarding land and natural resources\u201d, that these mechanisms are known by and accessible to rights-holders and stakeholders, and that people are aware of their rights (Springer et al., 2021, pp. 28\u201329). Access to justice and the ability to resolve natural resource conflicts are part of ensuring sustainable restoration processes (Herrick et al., 2019). Case analysis and key findings Effective and equitable FLR requires access to justice and pathways for conflict resolution. While conflict resolution is not a focus of ROAM guidance, it is often a (more or less explicit) part of the process. Restoration involves governance questions such as how and by whom decisions are made, who has rights and responsibilities to what and who benefits and bears related costs. Injustices, grievances and conflicts related to such questions often precede \u2013 and can impact and/or be impacted by \u2013 the ROAM process. ROAM as part of a conflict resolution process: Some ROAM processes, such as in Indonesia, include an explicit objective of resolving a conflict. This requires substantial preparation, trust, appropriate and skilled facilitation, and follow-up. In Indonesia, historical timeline creation and opportunities mapping helped rights holders and stakeholders identify (sometimes conflicting) narratives about the creation of the nature reserve, the conversion of mangroves to aquaculture, and the forcible evictions of fish farmers (Bahsoan et al., 2014; Brown, 2021). Most stakeholders felt that enforcement operations were \"heavy-handed\" and appreciated that ROAM was seeking to identify a resolution (Brown, 2021). Importantly, the opportunity mapping and validation workshops in Indonesia included a nationally certified forest conflict resolution facilitator. Grounding the process in the context: There may be ongoing or past conflicts that are beyond the scope of what ROAM can (or should) resolve, but that are (or should be) defining aspects of the ROAM process approach, as was the case in Colombia (see Box 6). Access to justice and conflict resolution in ROAM processes and FLR actions: Concerns related to access to justice and conflict resolution were not raised in all cases. In Rwanda, interviewees stated that the ROAM process helped establish village land use planning as part of FLR decision-making, and that this has given local people a voice in FLR and led to conflict avoidance at the local level. (One interviewee also pointed out that, because resolving local tenure disputes satisfactorily in Rwanda is still very difficult to do,45 lands under ownership disputes tend to be excluded from FLR activities.) Interviewees in Malawi suggested that ROAM and FLR are generally viewed as positive.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d6ef7e0-1012-46e6-9ed1-82fa438ec138": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d6ef7e0-1012-46e6-9ed1-82fa438ec138", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Legal Recommendations in Menorca: Plastic Pollution", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc839b10c03a9439b14d1750bc0999705662e3f7383b1db81418fa766a4b7e60"}, "3": {"node_id": "a8a51524-b227-4079-838d-41ed329bd9e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-legal-recommendations-menorca-plastic-pollution", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "396db1aa31a5ba80eddb26f9c898607d695f5d1e48c83a19d47b65c14e8475d6"}}, "hash": "05f5ac4fbd1823640460409b1c161e96c7f8894a54aa116a3899a4912fc3684d", "text": "When there is an issue, such as when pine plantations in the north failed to hire from local communities, people can raise their concerns through the local chief to resolve the conflict. 45 For more information, see the LANDac\u2019s Food Security and Land Governance Factsheet on Rwanda available at: https://www.landgovernance.org/wp- content/uploads/2019/09/20160627-Factsheet-Rwanda.pdf. 39 However, grievances or conflicts may arise in relation to ROAM processes themselves and/or the FLR initiatives they identify. It is crucial that they be recognised and fairly resolved. Often conflicts can be addressed through existing (formal or informal) mechanisms at the appropriate level (village, district, etc.). Convenors should also ensure that there are fair, accessible and known grievance mechanisms for ROAM processes, including IUCN\u2019s grievance mechanism, when applicable. This is an area where more guidance and analysis are needed. In summary, this principle is important because FLR often involves challenging rights and governance issues. Equitable, sustainable restoration is unlikely in the context of ongoing conflict. ROAM processes have the potential to either help resolve and/or exacerbate resource-related conflicts and injustice in the landscape. More dialogue, guidance and training on enabling equitable conflict resolution and ensuring effective and fair mechanisms for grievance redress could strengthen ROAM. Box 6. Post-conflict landscapes and ROAM in Colombia by James McBreen, Senior Programme Officer, Forest Landscape Restoration, IUCN Experience with the ROAM process in Colombia highlights the importance of grounding assessments in their historical, social, and political context, and shows in particular the potential challenges and benefits of the process in a post-conflict setting. The department of eastern Antioquia, where the ROAM process was carried out, has one of the highest deforestation rates in Colombia, has been exacerbated by decades of internal armed conflict. Given that reality, and the new \u2018post-conflict\u2019 phase, there are inherent challenges in Colombia, which have implications for the environmental, cultural and socio-economic dynamics in the landscape. These include how landowners or users make decisions and challenges related to land tenure, and the arrival of displaced farmers and former guerrill3as who are reintegrating into society. There is uncertainty as to what patterns of land use can be expected in Colombia in the \u2018post-conflict\u2019 phase, and what the consequences for nature and livelihoods will be. In this context, the ROAM process in Colombia offered an opportunity and generated valuable experience for multiple stakeholders involved in landscape-scale planning, especially for restoration, to understand and practice the necessary integration of biophysical and ecological aspects with the social reality of the landscape. ROAM is characterised by its multi-stakeholder process, which should be built on dialogue and existing collaborative structures in the assessment area. In this post-conflict context, the ROAM process itself can be a valuable catalyst to foster relationships
