Les d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re Conf\u00e9rence mondiale sur les parcs nationaux, qui repr\u00e9sentaient soixante-trois pays, avaient recommand\u00e9 qu'une autre conf\u00e9rence mondiale ait lieu pendant I'ann\u00e9e du centenaire. R\u00e9pondant \u00e0 cet appel, le Congr\u00e8s des Etats-Unis et le pr\u00e9sident Nixon prirent les initiatives off,cielles qui devaient donner I'impulsion n\u00e9ces- saire \u00e0 la c\u00e9l\u00e9bration du centenaire de Yellowstone d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de 1972. La deuxi\u00e8me Conf\u00e9rence mondiale sur les parcs nationaux, organis\u00e9e au parc national de Grand Teton, devait en constituer l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement principal. En pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 cette conf\u00e9rence technique, la Commission du centenaire des parcs nationaux organisa une grande r\u00e9union \u00e0 Yellowstone pour c\u00e9l\u00e9brer les cent premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es d'exis- tence du parc. Tenue avant les s\u00e9ances techniques qui rev\u00eataient un caract\u00e8re interna- tional, cette r\u00e9union \u00e9tait avant tout une c\u00e9l\u00e9bration am\u00e9ricaine, une sorte de gigantesque f\u00eate d'anniversaire.

Les r\u00e9unions de Yellowstone, qui devaient constituer une c\u00e9r\u00e9- monie comm\u00e9morative, \u00e9taient bien moins empreintes de formalisme que les sessions techniques de la conf\u00e9rence qui eurent lieu ult\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 Grand Teton.

Un autre groupe de travail permit d'identifier les rapports qui existent entre les parcs nationaux d'une part, les parcs d\u00e9pendant des r\u00e9gions, des Etats, et des collectivit\u00e9s locales de I'autre. M. Andrus, gouverneur de l'Etat de l'Idaho, et M. Hathaway, gouver- neur de I'Etat du Wyoming, expos\u00e8rent le r\u00f4le que jouent leurs Etats respectifs en mati\u00e8re de parcs nationaux et de programmes de d\u00e9fense de la nature. Joe Skubitz et Orval Hansen, repr\u00e9sentants du Kansas et de I'Idaho au Congr\u00e8s, firent remarquer qu'un parc national n'existe pas dans le vide et qu'en cons\u00e9quence, de bons rapports entre le parc et son milieu ambiant sont indispensables \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense de son environnement interne. Parmi les nombreuses manifestations de solidarit\u00e9 internationale qui se d\u00e9roul\u00e8rent au cours de la conf\u00e9rence, V. V. Krinitskii, directeur des r\u00e9serves naturelles de I'Union des r\u00e9publiques socialistes sovi\u00e9tiques, devait offrir au parc national de Yellowstone, au nom du peuple sovi\u00e9tique, une sculpture et un sp\u00e9cimen naturalis\u00e9 repr\u00e9sentant deux animaux indig\u00e8nes \u00e0 la Russie et un livre sur la faune russe. Il annon\u00e7a \u00e9galement que I'U.R.S.S. avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 cinq parcs nationaux et r\u00e9serves naturelles depuis 1971, en I'honneur du cente- naire de Yellowstone. C'est au cours de la s\u00e9ance de cl\u00f4ture de la r\u00e9union de Yellowstone qu'eut lieu la pr\u00e9sen- tation officielle au pr\u00e9sident Thornton du rapport de la Conservation Foundation intitul\u00e9 16 <L'avenir des parcs nationaux>.

Hartzog, prie le directeur du parc national de Grand Teton, Gary E. Everhardt, de prononcer quelques mots de bienvenue. M. Everhardt exprime alors sa conviction que la conf\u00e9rence serait inspir\u00e9e par la beaut\u00e9 et la s\u00e9r\u00e9nit\u00e9 du cadre qui la pousseraient \u00e0 un effort suppl\u00e9mentaire de compr\u00e9- hension et de protection du monde naturel. On entendit ensuite des allocutions officielles de bienvenue et des v\u00e6ux pour la r\u00e9ussite de la conf\u00e9rence.

Pour commencer, le pr\u00e9sident Budowski rappelle que la pr\u00e9sente conf\u00e9rence se tient dix ans apr\u00e8s et en accord avecla Recommandation2T de la premi\u00e8re Conf\u00e9rence mondiale sur les parcs nationaux, r\u00e9unie \u00e0 Seattle.

R\u00e8glement int\u00e9rieur: Ce r\u00e8glement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9 avant le d\u00e9but de la conf\u00e9rence concerne la conduite des s\u00e9ances techniques (et en particulier les limites de temps de parole impos\u00e9es aux orateurs, et la remise au Secr\u00e9tariat de la conf\u00e9rence des textes \u00e9crits des interventions, pour en permettre la transcription). Le r\u00e8glement est adopt\u00e9 \u00e0 I'unanimit\u00e9. Proc\u00e9dure pour les recommandations et nomination du Comit\u00e9 pour les recommandations. En pr\u00e9sentant ce point, le professeur Kuenen insiste sur le fait que les sessions techniques doivent aboutir \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie de recommandations et non \u00e0 des r\u00e9solutions formelles. Cette d\u00e9cision sejustifie par I'origine tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente des participants qu'unissent cependant un int\u00e9r\u00eat commun pour les parcs nationaux ou leurs connaissances particuli\u00e8res de ce sujet. Les recommandations se feront donc sous leur responsabilit\u00e9 personnelle et des proc\u00e9- dures formelles de vote ne s'imposent pas; I'approbation ou la d\u00e9sapprobation des recommandations se fera \u00e0 main lev\u00e9e et tout participant ou tout groupe sera en droit de pr\u00e9senter des suggestions au Comit\u00e9 des recommandations, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il le fera au plus tard le dimanche 24 septembre \u00e0 midi.

Wirth, Etats-Unis COMPTE RENDU DU RAPPORTEUR Dans un retour au pass\u00e9, il faut essayer de faire le bilan des succ\u00e8s, des \u00e9checs et des probl\u00e8mes rest\u00e9s sans solution. C'est dans cet esprit que le pr\u00e9sident et les trois auteurs qui pr\u00e9sentaient leurs rapports ouvrent le d\u00e9bat. Dans le bref laps de temps consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation des rapports, on peut remarquer une nette tendance \u00e0 ne se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer qu'aux dix ou vingt derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, et cette tendance se confirme dans les commentaires des membres du Panel. Parlant delaTanzanie, John S. Owen dit qu'\u00e0 son avis, la le\u00e7on des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es peut se r\u00e9sumer en deux id\u00e9es-forces: la valeur intrins\u00e8que des parcs nationaux qui font partie du patrimoine national et les arguments \u00e9thiques en faveur de leur cr\u00e9ation et de leur conservation. D'apr\u00e8s C.

I. Cibulec, membre du Panel, signale ensuite les efforts de la Tch\u00e9coslovaquie pour promouvoir le concept de paysages prot\u00e9g\u00e9s dans lesquels certaines formes d'utilisation des terres sont autoris\u00e9es. Ainsi orient\u00e9e, la discussion qui suit est plus ax\u00e9e sur les probl\u00e8mes r\u00e9cents et les futurs besoins de la conservation que sur le pass\u00e9. Les principaux dissentiments portent sur l'opposition entre les arguments \u00e9thiques et \u00e9conomiques lorsqu'il s'agit de mettre en place un parc national. Que le tourisme puisse \u00eatre une source de revenus est pour certains un argument paternaliste et dangereux pour la conservation. Pour les autres, l'argument 23 du <patrimoine> ne peut \u00eatre compris et accept\u00e9 que par une tr\u00e8s faible minorit\u00e9 de la population et seulement dans un nombre limit\u00e9 de pays. D'apr\u00e8s eux, face aux pressions d\u00e9mographiques et aux n\u00e9cessit\u00e9s de d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique, les arguments \u00e9thiques ne rencontrent aupr\u00e8s des gouvernements et des responsables qu'un tr\u00e8s faible \u00e9cho. Il s'agit donc d'insister sur la contrepartie \u00e9conomique de l'essor touristique engendr\u00e9 par les parcs. Cependant, dans les deux cas, la priorit\u00e9 reste \u00e0 deux imp\u00e9ratifs essentiels qui sont l'aide aux pays en voie de d\u00e9veloppement quand il s'agit d'installer ou de conserver des parcs nationaux et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de faire l'\u00e9ducation des dirigeants.

Pour certains familiers du parc national de Yellowstone, il n'est, en effet, peut-\u00eatre pas inutile de rappeler qu'il existe de par le monde nombre de territoires prot\u00e9g\u00e9s qui ressemblent \u00e0 notre jubilaire ou qui, comme lui, portent le nom de parc national, mais alors en dif- f\u00e8rent profond\u00e9ment par ce que leurs dirigeants veulent y faire, ou m\u00eame tout simplement par ce qu'ils peuvent y faire.

S'opposer \u00e0 l'exploitation humaine afin de conserver esp\u00e8ces, \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes ou paysages. 2. Faire \u00e0 divers titres (r\u00e9cr\u00e9atif, \u00e9ducatif, culturel) b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier les visiteurs des heureux r\u00e9sultats de cette conservation. 3. Mettre cette conservation \u00e0 profit pour s'adonner \u00e0 des \u00e9tudes scientifrques impossibles ailleurs. On sait aussi laquelle de ces trois motivations - la deuxi\u00e8me - s'est trouv\u00e9e dominante dans I'esprit des pr\u00e9curseurs de I 872 : <dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasuring ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people>. Une question se pose alors: pourquoi ce souci s'est-il exprim\u00e9 aux Etats-Unis d'abord, et non pas en Europe? En fait, I'Europe, dont les r\u00e9volutions industrielle et agricole s'\u00e9taient \u00e9tal\u00e9es sur de longues p\u00e9riodes et qui, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 diverses contingences, s'\u00e9tait progressivement adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 la plupart de leurs effets, ne voyait que peu se transformer son environnement naturel au fil du XIXe si\u00e8cle. Tout au plus la chasse y avait-elle parfois rar\u00e9fr\u00e9 le gibier au point que quelques souverains ou puissants seigneurs aient voulu se r\u00e9server des domaines cyn\u00e9g\u00e9tiques personnels, s\u00e9v\u00e8rement gard\u00e9s contre le braconnage des manants. Ce faisant, 25 ces grands de la terre pr\u00e9paraient parfois inconsciemment le berceau de r\u00e9serves natu- relles ult\u00e9rieures telles Fontainebleau, Rambouillet, les Royal Forests britanniques ou encore le domaine de chasse des ducs de Savoie aujourd'hui devenu le parc national du Gran Paradiso. Il en \u00e9tait tout autrement aux Etats-Unis, sous la pouss\u00e9e de pionniers entreprenants et peu \u00e9conomes des ressources naturelles, auxquels une technologie d\u00e9j\u00e0 puissante permettait des interventions brutales dont ils tiraient, d'ailleurs, souvent l\u00e9giti- mement frert\u00e9: d\u00e9frichements, implantation de rail, de villes-champignons, d'industries, extermination des bisons, etc. C'est donc fondamentalement pour opposer, au moins localement, dans une r\u00e9gion", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2daea883-cf46-4e6e-943d-f421879bd768": {"__data__": {"id_": "2daea883-cf46-4e6e-943d-f421879bd768", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/deuxieme-conference-mondiale-sur-les-parcs-nationaux-parcs-nationaux-de", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deuxi\u00e8me Conf\u00e9rence Mondiale sur les Parcs Nationaux, Parcs nationaux de Yellowstone et de Grand Teton, Etats-Unis, 18-27 septembre 1972 : compte rendu", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/deuxieme-conference-mondiale-sur-les-parcs-nationaux-parcs-nationaux-de", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0b4a7af2611f1686a01d377b2f9892db72b4164b1acce52e2e4829b0f424180"}, "3": {"node_id": "8f21c190-0bf2-411b-af3c-969b4dcf6ba0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/deuxieme-conference-mondiale-sur-les-parcs-nationaux-parcs-nationaux-de", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ca4e4b12d6dbbb58f71027cb3c9cd5ef2b0d5966d67bc064005db7988d18b6e"}}, "hash": "da110efcc587f5838c52ada3818c2bd269f55ba1ee00cbb992f9d8fa3ee48f6e", "text": "rep\u00e9r\u00e9e comme particuli\u00e8rement belle, une barri\u00e8re \u00e0 ces actions de mutilation - ignor\u00e9es en Europe - que les promoteurs du parc national de Yellowstone ont livr\u00e9 leur combat et remport\u00e9 leur victoire au Congr\u00e8s de Washington, en pensant \u00e0 l'<enjoyment of the people> du temps pr\u00e9sent et des temps \u00e0 venir.

Nous tenterons \u00e9galement de d\u00e9gager les principaux probl\u00e8mes qui se posent actuellement de par le monde \u00e0 ceux \u00e0 qui incombe la responsa- bilit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er et de g\u00e9rer correctement des parcs nationaux. En ce qui concerne l'\u00e9largissement quantitatif du r\u00e9seau mondial, la p\u00e9riode fut marqu\u00e9e par quatre facteurs importants: dans les pays industrialis\u00e9s se manifeste une sensibilisa- tion nettement meilleure des opinions publiques en faveur de la notion de parc national; dans les pays en voie de d\u00e9veloppement, les dirigeants ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 savoir que par les parcs nationaux de bonne qualit\u00e9 il est possible d'attirer de riches touristes \u00e9trangers: sur le plan g\u00e9n\u00e9ral le fait saillant fut f internationalisation des pr\u00e9occupations et I'aug- mentation consid\u00e9rable des interventions d'aide bilat\u00e9rale et multilat\u00e9rale; enfin, un nouveau membre fit son apparition dans la famille des parcs nationaux;le parc marin, Dans plusieurs pays industrialis\u00e9s o\u00ecr pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment des parcs nationaux n'avaient pu \u00eatre cr\u00e9\u00e9s que gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la t\u00e9nacit\u00e9 de quelques dirigeants luttant, dans I'indiff\u00e9rence du public, contre de puissants int\u00e9r\u00eats priv\u00e9s, on a vu na\u00eetre ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es des condi- tions d'ambiance politique nettement meilleures. Et cela a permis de mobiliser les cr\u00e9dits et de r\u00e9ussir les acquisitions n\u00e9cessaires pour muer en parcs nationaux nouveaux quelques zones encore relativement peu envahies par les occupations et les exploitations humaines. Tel est incontestablement le cas des Etats-Unis o\u00f9, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une conjoncture d'opinion publique notoirement plus sensibilis\u00e9e dans le bon sens, une centaine de territoires de tailles diverses ont, depuis dix ans, pu \u00eatre inclus dans le <park system> du pays, dont six furent dot\u00e9s du statut l\u00e9gal de parc national.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f21c190-0bf2-411b-af3c-969b4dcf6ba0": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f21c190-0bf2-411b-af3c-969b4dcf6ba0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/deuxieme-conference-mondiale-sur-les-parcs-nationaux-parcs-nationaux-de", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deuxi\u00e8me Conf\u00e9rence Mondiale sur les Parcs Nationaux, Parcs nationaux de Yellowstone et de Grand Teton, Etats-Unis, 18-27 septembre 1972 : compte rendu", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/deuxieme-conference-mondiale-sur-les-parcs-nationaux-parcs-nationaux-de", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0b4a7af2611f1686a01d377b2f9892db72b4164b1acce52e2e4829b0f424180"}, "2": {"node_id": "2daea883-cf46-4e6e-943d-f421879bd768", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/deuxieme-conference-mondiale-sur-les-parcs-nationaux-parcs-nationaux-de", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da110efcc587f5838c52ada3818c2bd269f55ba1ee00cbb992f9d8fa3ee48f6e"}}, "hash": "1ca4e4b12d6dbbb58f71027cb3c9cd5ef2b0d5966d67bc064005db7988d18b6e", "text": "Le m\u00eame ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne a \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9 parall\u00e8lement au Canada, dans divers Etats d'Australie, en Nouvelle-Z\u00e9lande o\u00f9, en 1964, naquit le vaste parc national de Mount Aspiring (272797 ha.), en Afrique du Sud, dont le groupe des six parcs nationaux s'est encore 26 r\u00e9cemment enrichi, notamment par le parc national c\u00f4tier et forestier de Tsitsikama.

Les exemples viennent \u00e0 I'esprit en foule, tant en pays industrialis\u00e9s: Etats-Unis, Canada, Suisse, Japon, Su\u00e8de, Nouvelle-Z\u00e9lande, Australie, etc. qu'en pays en voie de d\u00e9veloppement: Murchison Falls en Ouganda, Los Alerces en Argentine et Corbett en Inde. A ces pressions cherchant \u00e0 s'exercer selon les voies l\u00e9gales moyennant le biais de I'inter- vention politique s'ajoutent alors des actions moins licites, moins avou\u00e9es, plus rares en pays industrialis\u00e9 - encore que les sp\u00e9culations fonci\u00e8res dans le parc national des Abruzzes en Italie ne soient un secret pour personne - plus fr\u00e9quentes peut-\u00eatre en pays en voie de cl\u00e9veloppement, telles ces vastes coupes de bois accord\u00e9es dans des r\u00e9serves de Sumatra \u00e0 de grandes compagnies capitalistes \u00e9trang\u00e8res par des autorit\u00e9s locales.

De la derni\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie sont les innombrables braconnages - rhinoc\u00e9ros, vigognes, parmi les plus c\u00e9l\u00e8bres - ou coupes illicites - palmitos au parc national de I'Iguazu - commis impun\u00e9- ment parce que les gardes qui devraient les emp\u00eacher sont trop peu nombreux, sans armes, et parfois de connivence avec les d\u00e9linquants. Et les infractions que les autorit\u00e9s n'osent pas r\u00e9primer pour des motifs politiques sont par exemple des pr\u00e9sences, dans le territoire th\u00e9oriquement par\u00e7 national, de paysans fam\u00e9liques accompagnant du b\u00e9tail \u00e9galement farn\u00e9lique, que I'on ne saurait trop o\u00f9 repousser.

Les exemples abondent. Chacun de vous en a plusieurs en t\u00eate. Pensez au ptobl\u00e8me des concessions, des transports, des logements, des d\u00e9lassements, des prestations. En France' on s'est battu pour d\u00e9fendre la Vanoise. Le Canada se passionne pour le lac Louise. Les championnats de ski ont lorgn\u00e9 le Banff, les Tatra, Shikotzu-Toya. Un symposium r\u00e9cent s'est pench\u00e9 sur le seul probl\u00e8me du <snow-mobile>. On reparlera souvent de ces sujets dans les heures \u00e0 venir. 31 Heureusement que la situation peut souvent \u00eatre am\u00e9lior\u00e9e par une sage utilisation des parcs nationaux eux-m\u00eames comme instrument d'\u00e9ducation du public. A nouveau, les Etats-Unis ont montr\u00e9 la voie dans cette direction en multipliant avec succ\u00e8s dans leurs territoires prot\u00e9g\u00e9s les services interpr\u00e9tatifs, les mus\u00e9es, les feux de camp, les sentiers balis\u00e9s. Et nous en aurons termin\u00e9 lorsque nous aurons encore \u00e9voqu\u00e9 le troisi\u00e8me des objectifs pouvant avoir motiv\u00e9 les promoteurs d'un parc national: I'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la recherche \u00e9colo- gique. Pour des motifs politiques, cet objectif, lorsqu'il s'agit d'un parc national et non d'une r\u00e9serve scientifique, ne peut gu\u00e8re se concevoir seul mais doit se combiner avec des buts touristiques, m\u00eame s'abriter derri\u00e8re eux pour se faire politiquement admettre, le territoire prot\u00e9g\u00e9 conportant alors de petites r\u00e9serves int\u00e9grales noy\u00e9es dans de vastes secteurs ouverts aux visiteurs. Ces r\u00e9serves int\u00e9grales ont ainsi I'aspect d'une r\u00e9alisation accessoire, m\u00eame si pour les promoteurs elles correspondent \u00e0 I'essentiel. Et ainsi se trouve soulev\u00e9 un autre probl\u00e8me d'actualit\u00e9, celui du zonage, dont I'importance devient partout de plus en plus perceptible. D\u00e9j\u00e0 en 1967, envertu de ce principe du zonage, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 admis sur la liste des Nations Unies les parcs nationaux japonais qui, pourtant, ne respectent les crit\u00e8res CIPN que sur moins de la moiti\u00e9 de leur \u00e9tendue.

MAXNICHOLSON Convocateur international PBI/CT, c/o The Nature Conservancy, 19 Belgrave Square, London, S.W.1 On peut excuser les premiers pionniers et ceux qui les ont suivis tout au long du premier si\u00e8cle de d\u00e9veloppement des parcs nationaux, d'avoir pens\u00e9 que, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 eux, le mouye- ment avait surv\u00e9cu aux difficult\u00e9s de ses d\u00e9buts.

Compar\u00e9s \u00e0 des difficult\u00e9s aussi chroniques et aussi complexes que celles que nous venons d'\u00e9voquer, les probl\u00e8mes pos\u00e9s par la mise en r\u00e9serve de parcelles appartenant \u00e0 de vastes \u00e9tendues de terres encore vierges, et par la protection de ces parcelles contre les empi\u00e9tements d'une population encore relative- ment clairsem\u00e9e, appara\u00eetront sans doute r\u00e9trospectivement comme quelque chose de facile. Si les parcs du monde doivent r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 doubler le cap de leur deuxi\u00e8me centenaire, ce ne pourra \u00eatre que gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un appui plus efficace du public, fond\u00e9 sur des conceptions beau- coup plus claires et sur une gestion beaucoup plus professionnelle, permettant ainsi d'assurer I'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 fondamentale des parcs en d\u00e9pit d'une utilisation plus large et plus diversifi\u00e9e. Sans aller jusqu'\u00e0 vouloir couper le cordon ombilical de la tradition et des investissements sentimentaux qui remontent aux origines du mouvement, ceux qui le dirigent doivent apprendre \u00e0 marcher sans s'embarrasser des entraves dues \u00e0 ses origines particuli\u00e8res. Le <mouvement romantique>> du d\u00e9but du XIXe si\u00e8cle a cess\u00e9 depuis longtemps d'\u00eatre un \u00e9l\u00e9ment culturel dominant, mais, pour beaucoup de leurs partisans, les parcs nationaux demeurent la vivante image des valeurs romantiques et constituent, de ce fait, un ana- chronisme flagrant dans le monde moderne. Pour ces loyalistes r\u00e9solus, les parcs natio- naux sont le d\u00e9cor d'une ardente histoire d'amour avec la nature sauvage, faisant appel \u00e0 des \u00e9motions passionn\u00e9es et d\u00e9daignant les voies de la raison pour se mettre au service d'une terre indompt\u00e9e, vierge, myst\u00e9rieuse et digne d'adoration, qui emporte ses fid\u00e8les hors du monde o\u00f9 nous vivons. C'est \u00e0 l'attitude et \u00e0 l'\u00e9nergie de ces chaleureux partisans que I'on doit beaucoup de la force du mouvement des parcs nationaux, et aussi une part JJ ctoissante de sa faiblesse.

L'adjectif (national) est plus pr\u00e9cis, bien qu'il ait ici deux sens. Il signifie d'abord, d'un point de vue qualitatif, que les parcs poss\u00e8dent des caract\u00e9- ristiques dont I'importance d\u00e9passe le plan local, r\u00e9gional ou m\u00eame provincial, car elles sont parmi les plus remarquables en leur genre existant sur le territoire national d'un pays, et constituent un apport de grande valeur au patrimoine mondial. C'est la raison pour laquelle les parcs nationaux ont m\u00e9rit\u00e9 d'\u00eatre choisis et sauvegard\u00e9s et sont devenus i'objet d'une tutelle constante au niveau le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 de I'Etat, car ils sont confi\u00e9s \u00e0 la 34 nation pour la nation dans des conditions restreignant \u00e0 l'extr\u00eame les possibilit\u00e9s juri- diques d'ali\u00e9nation ou d'ing\u00e9rence dans leur fonctionnement. Il s'agit donc bien aussi de parcs nationaux sur le plan constitutionnel. Ce n'est que r\u00e9cemment, que beaucoup, m\u00eame parmi les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 per- cevoir ces implications d\u00e9taill\u00e9es et multiples. Un simple terme tel que celui de <non- ing\u00e9rence>> peut donner lieu \u00e0 une multitude de complications scientifiques, techniques, juridiques et administratives. Dans la t\u00e2che monumentale qu'il a d\u00fb accomplir en pr\u00e9pa- rant la Liste des Nations Unies des parcs nationaux et r\u00e9serves analogues, Jean-Paul Harroy a d\u00fb d\u00e9finir et essayer d'appliquer une s\u00e9rie de normes de base avant de d\u00e9cider auxquels des parcs dits nationaux du monde, le terme de <parc national> pouvait vrai- ment s'appliquer. Cet exercice tr\u00e8s n\u00e9cessaire, et qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre fait depuis longtemps, a montr\u00e9 combien de personnes responsables avaient, consciemment ou inconsciemment, adopt\u00e9 ou accept\u00e9 des pratiques et des normes contraires au concept du parc national. Ainsi, plusieurs simples parcs de banlieue situ\u00e9s dans de grandes agglom\u00e9rations se paraient de I'adjectif national. Dans d'autres cas, des villes, des villages, des usines et des fermes, des mines et des plantations foresti\u00e8res avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 inclus sans discrimination dans les listes. Certains parcs nationaux d\u00e9pendaient d'autorit\u00e9s provinciales ou m\u00eame d'auto- rit\u00e9s locales, sans m\u00eame que le terrain soit propri\u00e9t\u00e9 publique. Dans bien des cas \u00e9gale- ment, il n'existait pas de plans d'am\u00e9nagement, ni m\u00eame de budget ou de personnel qua- lifl\u00e9. M\u00eame parmi les parcs nationaux les mieux g\u00e9r\u00e9s, on consid\u00e9rait que le plus important \u00e9tait de montrer une faune spectaculaire, tandis que dans d'autres on se contentait dc paysages grandioses ou d'arbres magnifiques.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b0faac4-5379-4461-b74b-479898c5d73b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b0faac4-5379-4461-b74b-479898c5d73b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/deuxieme-conference-mondiale-sur-les-parcs-nationaux-parcs-nationaux-de", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deuxi\u00e8me Conf\u00e9rence Mondiale sur les Parcs Nationaux, Parcs nationaux de Yellowstone et de Grand Teton, Etats-Unis, 18-27 septembre 1972 : compte rendu", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/deuxieme-conference-mondiale-sur-les-parcs-nationaux-parcs-nationaux-de", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69cd324df55cc135cdafb99f613ef4a36d47a2d2c17695b19b0da4323f5081e8"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce91c798-9184-407e-a9ae-bae1ab962f7f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/deuxieme-conference-mondiale-sur-les-parcs-nationaux-parcs-nationaux-de", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ed90ed0a3a24c541bac50728f77af551b2cf4296f94b1090d468e389f49d3c9"}}, "hash": "2e1f569ede874624fe09bac5a20e57c17c2586f2a4cd0da0c78eb3bf4ca5eb60", "text": "Tous ces objets \u00e9taient dignes de protection, mais impliquaient la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er toute une s\u00e9rie de parcs de types diff\u00e9rents, ayant des qualit\u00e9s diverses et se heurtant \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes diff\u00e9rents dont on avait souvent n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de comprendre la port\u00e9e.

Le succ\u00e8s m\u00eame de la Liste des Nations Unies ainsi que d'autres initiatives, en augmentant le prestige des parcs nationaux, rendait la distinction entre parcs plus difficile et plus embarrassante. Certaines zones naturelles \u00e9taient destin\u00e9es avant tout \u00e0 la recherche scientifique, \u00e0 la conservation du gibier ou de la faune sauvage; pour d'autres c'est leur int\u00e9r\u00eat particulier du point de vue g\u00e9ologique, arch\u00e9ologique ou historique qui en avait suscit\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ation.

Ce ne sont cependant pas des parcs nationaux, et les efforts bien intentionn\u00e9s que I'on pourrait faire pour les confondre avec ceux-ci ne pourront causer que des difficult\u00e9s.

Cependant, \u00e0 part quelques brillantes exceptions, comme le parc national Albert (qui a fait I'objet de plus de cinq cents \u00e9tudes scientiflques), ces espoirs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tristement d\u00e9\u00e7us. Il est extraordinaire que nous ne sachions vraiment que si peu de choses sur la majorit\u00e9 des parcs nationaux du monde, et que l'on ait fait si peu d'efforts, jusqu'\u00e0 une \u00e9poque toute r\u00e9cente, pour les \u00e9tudier s\u00e9rieusement. Il est m\u00eame difficile, comme nous essayons de le faire dans le cadre du Programme biologique international, de rassembler suffisamment de donn\u00e9es de base pour pouvoir comparer le contenu et les conditions de plusieurs parcs appartenant au m\u00eame groupe. L\u00e0 o\u00f9 le personnel des parcs comprend des savants ou des naturalistes, ces derniers ont trop \u00e0 faire pour pouvoir entreprendre des \u00e9tudes s\u00e9rieuses, car ils doivent s'entretenir avec les visiteurs, leur servir de guides et de conseillers et r\u00e9diger des textes publicitaires. Jusqu'\u00e0 ces tout derniers temps, si l'on tentait de poser la question des \u00e9tudes \u00e9cologiques, et des moyens de les conduire, \u00e0 la direction de la plupart des parcs nationaux, on obtenait comme unique r\u00e9action une expression de profonde ignorance. On pourrait citer, pour illustrer ce point, I'amusant incident qui s'est produit en Afrique orientale, lorsqu'un conseil d'administrateurs de parcs fut invit\u00e9, \u00e0 sa r\u00e9union annuelle, \u00e0 autoriser I'engage- ment d'un \u00e9cologiste.

Et c'est \u00e0 peine si, par instants, nous pouvons nous sentir fiers de ce qu'a accompli le mou- vement des parcs nationaux au cours de ses cent premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, lorsque nous r\u00e9alisons que le sort de l'humanit\u00e9 sera peut-\u00eatre mis en jeu au cours du deuxi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle de vie de nos parcs. Je souhaiterais pouvoir vous dire que nous nous retrouvons ici pleins de confiance et de fiert\u00e9, convaincus que I'homme peut faire face \u00e0 tout ce que l'avenir lui pr\u00e9pare.

Le surpeuplement de nos parcs nationaux durant ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es appara\u00eetra comme une chose relativement minime par rapport \u00e0 la pression massive qu'exerceront les popu- lations futures. Nous ne pouvons pas m\u00eame \u00eatre assur\u00e9s que m\u00eame un plan de survie nous garantira ou simplement prolongera I'existence de I'humanit\u00e9, si nous songeons que la population actuelle, par suite d'exigences qui s'accroissent par \u00e0-coups exponentiels, a d\u00e9j\u00e0 presque \u00e9puis\u00e9 une bonne part des ressources naturelles du monde. 40 Seule l'intelligence de l'homme, mobilis\u00e9e comme elle l'est ici aujourd'hui, pourra ralentir ou modifier ce courant. Personne ne peut dire avec certitude si les parcs nationaux du monde auront une quelconque influence \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Cependant, si nous avons appris une chose au cours des dix ann\u00e9es qui se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9es depuis notre premi\u00e8re conf\u00e9rence, c'est que nos parcs poss\u00e8dent des valeurs qui d\u00e9passent de beaucoup leur valeur r\u00e9cr\u00e9ative ou esth\u00e9tique.

L'analyse des \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes entreprise dans le cadre du Programme biologique international constitue un\"effort majeur pour I'approfondissement de ces connaissances.

Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ces \u00e9tudes, nous commen\u00e7ons \u00e0 percevoir qu'un \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me ne fonctionne efficacement que s'il se trouve dans un \u00e9quilibre relatif. Tous ces syst\u00e8mes poss\u00e8dent des m\u00e9canismes d'autoprotection qui r\u00e9duisent les effets des perturbations dans les transferts d'\u00e9nergie. Nous commen\u00e7ons \u00e0 nous rendre compte qu'il est n\u00e9cessaire de maintenir les \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes dans leurs \u00e9tats de stabilit\u00e9 respectifs, ce qui exige souvent une \u00e9valuation du r\u00f4le que joue la diversit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de ces syst\u00e8mes. Nous commen\u00e7ons seulement \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre que nos \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes ont une capacit\u00e9 limite optimale repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la masse des organismes qu'ils peuvent contenir tout en conser- vant leur \u00e9quilibre, c'est-\u00e0-dire sans d\u00e9gradation \u00e9cologique. Nous utilisons maintenant ce concept afin de conna\u00eetre avec exactitude les capacit\u00e9s limites de nos parcs, dans I'espoir que nous pourrons calculer le nombre optimum de visiteurs qu'un parc peut tol\u00e9rer sans que ses ressources subissent des dommages irr\u00e9versibles. Les tentatives faites actuellement pour d\u00e9terminer les capacit\u00e9s limites de nos parcs sont uniquement bas\u00e9es sur des donn\u00e9es empiriques.

D'apr\u00e8s la formule empirique appliqu\u00e9e actuellement dans le parc des lacs Rae, on s'efforce de r\u00e9par- tir les usagers dans le temps et I'espace, afin d'atteindre les deux objectifs fondamentaux de 4l la gestion des parcs: att\u00e9nuer les effets de la pr\u00e9sence humaine sur les ressources du parc et am\u00e9liorer la qualit\u00e9 de I'exp\u00e9rience de la nature sauvage v\u00e9cue par le visiteur. La capacit\u00e9limite du point de vue des visiteurs pourrait cependant \u00eatre calcul\u00e9e en fonction des ressources disponibles et des frais d'entretien; il ne devrait pas \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire de la fixer suivant des donn\u00e9es arbitraires. La capacit\u00e9 d'une r\u00e9gion vraiment sauvage, en ce qui concerne le nombre des visiteurs est probablement de z\u00e9ro. Qu'une piste soit trac\u00e9e et nous avons un facteur tangible sur la base duquel nous pouvons \u00e9valuer ce que co\u00fbtera cette augmentation de la capacit\u00e9 limite. La capacit\u00e9 maximum d'un parking est \u00e9gale au nombre de places disponibles pour les voitures. Dans un h\u00f4pital, c'est le nombre de lits. Tout \u00e9quipement a \u00e9galement sa capacit\u00e9 optimum, d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par le point \u00e0 partir duquel les choses commencent \u00e0 se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer par suite d'une utilisation excessive. La capacit\u00e9 limite est ainsi une relation \u00e9cologique entre le public et les \u00e9quipements qui lui sont destin\u00e9s. Pour les \u00e9quipements dont la capacit\u00e9 est connue, pour lesquels on conna\u00eet le nombre d'entr\u00e9es et de sorties, et pour lesquels on a \u00e9tabli des niveaux optimum d'utilisation, on peut d\u00e9terminer, pour n'importe quel parc,la capacit\u00e9 limite num\u00e9rique. Elle sera fonction de la capacit\u00e9 des \u00e9quipements du parc \u00e0 accueillir des visiteurs. L'usage d'un \u00e9quipement ne devra \u00eatre limit\u00e9 que si l'utilisation le d\u00e9grade plus rapidement que les efforts d'entretien ne peuvent pr\u00e9venir cette d\u00e9gradation. Dans ce contexte, la capacit\u00e9,limite devient un simple probl\u00e8me d'analyse des syst\u00e8mes. Le r\u00f4le de l'\u00e9cologiste doit consister avant tout \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le moment o\u00f9 se produit une d\u00e9gradation inacceptable de I'environnement naturel. La capacit\u00e9 limite est d\u00e9ter- min\u00e9e apr\u00e8s I'implantation d'\u00e9quipements. Ainsi, il est indispensable que, dans la planifi- cation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'un parc, on tienne soigneusement compte des consid\u00e9rations \u00e9cologiques pour fixer l'emplacement des installations initiales. Nous n'avons certainement pas suffi- samment bien r\u00e9ussi en cela. La d\u00e9termination des capacit\u00e9s limites dans ce contexte ne fera qu'emp\u00eacher une d\u00e9gra- dation irr\u00e9versible des ressources naturelles; mais cette capacit\u00e9 limite ne sera pas n\u00e9ces- sairement li\u00e9e \u00e0 ce qui donnera au visiteur le sentiment d'une exp\u00e9rience de qualit\u00e9.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b65244fa-2630-4f94-a7c5-16596ebe6bf1": {"__data__": {"id_": "b65244fa-2630-4f94-a7c5-16596ebe6bf1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/deuxieme-conference-mondiale-sur-les-parcs-nationaux-parcs-nationaux-de", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deuxi\u00e8me Conf\u00e9rence Mondiale sur les Parcs Nationaux, Parcs nationaux de Yellowstone et de Grand Teton, Etats-Unis, 18-27 septembre 1972 : compte rendu", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/deuxieme-conference-mondiale-sur-les-parcs-nationaux-parcs-nationaux-de", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f6ef3585cdf24751f141986d5a454039786763aa31ce28cef15747fe9b3b7650"}, "2": {"node_id": "006c3d89-5e1f-4f92-800e-5243f2343b8b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/deuxieme-conference-mondiale-sur-les-parcs-nationaux-parcs-nationaux-de", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9cf5706047a2604c2eeecacfc9c584e917f7baf1efab3f6fca9b3258d6b5b769"}}, "hash": "475dee431edb3603c3e157a89c2070aad4e65f5c017333e79391280904aa0d14", "text": "On peut esp\u00e9rer que le succ\u00e8s obtenu dans les parcs en utilisant la notion de capacit\u00e9 limite pourrait trouver son application dans des \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes plus \u00e9tendus et dans I'am\u00e9- nagement de milieux ne faisant pas partie de parcs.

Tous les pays repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s ici aujourd'hui doivent faire face \u00e0 de s\u00e9rieux probl\u00e8mes d'envi- ronnement, \u00e0 I'int\u00e9rieur comme \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de leurs parcs nationaux. La disparition de tous les l\u00e9opards d'Afrique, de tous les alligators des Everglades et de tous les ours blancs de l'Arctique serait une perte pour tous les pays. Ici, dans les parcs nationaux de Yellowstone et de Grand Teton, la prolif\u00e9ration du wapiti (Cervus canadensis) a constitu\u00e9 un probl\u00e8me pendant des ann\u00e9es. Ou plut\u00f4t c'est I'homme qui a suscit\u00e9 ce probl\u00e8me, parce qu'il ne savait pas, au d\u00e9part, g\u00e9rer les troupeaux en 42 expansion. Ce n'est pas que les conservateurs de nos parcs et nos biologistes n'aient essay\u00e9 de le faire. Mais ils faisaient simplement \u00e6uvre de pionniers dans un domaine qui n'avait jamais fait I'objet de recherches suffisantes, et qui avait surtout \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solu par I'abattage, le pi\u00e9geage ou le transfert des animaux exc\u00e9dentaires.

Il est encore trop t\u00f4t pour r\u00e9pondre explicitement \u00e0 ces questions, mais je crois que nous nous trouvons sur un terrain solide si nous analysons \u00e0 fond cette nouvelle m\u00e9thode de gestion. Dans quelle mesure la pr\u00e9dation est-elle vitale pour la r\u00e9gulation des populations de wapitis? Jusqu'\u00e0 ces temps derniers, I'extermination g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e et indiscrimin\u00e9e des pr\u00e9- dateurs sur la plupart des terres publiques permettait difficilement de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question.

Dans un environnement totalement diff\u00e9rent, sur le cordon littoral du Cape Lookout National Seashore, en Caroline du Nord, nous avons constat\u00e9 que les efforts que nous avions faits pour stabiliser les dunes pouvaient \u00eatre inefficaces et m\u00eame nuisibles. Une \u00e9tude \u00e9cologique de cette c\u00f4te a montr\u00e9 que c'est l'homme, et non la mer, qui en est le pire ennemi. L'homme intervient dans les m\u00e9canismes naturels qui permettent aux \u00eeles de r\u00e9sister aux formidables assauts de la mer. Les cyclones et autres grandes temp\u00eates jouent un r\u00f4le significatif dans I'existence du cordon littoral. Lors des temp\u00eates, la mer balaie compl\u00e8tement ces \u00eeles basses et se d\u00e9verse dans les eaux int\u00e9rieures pour s'\u00e9couler ensuite par des goulets qui se sont creus\u00e9s dans les cha\u00eenons les plus faibles du cordon.

La suppression des incendies de for\u00eats n'a pas toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 dans le meilleur int\u00e9r\u00eat des parcs. La croissance du sous-bois dans la for\u00eat de s\u00e9quoias g\u00e9ants (Sequoiadendron g\u00edganteum) des parcs nationaux de Sequoia et de Kings Canyon, s'est acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la protection que lui a donn\u00e9 le Service des parcs nationaux. Nos biologistes se rendent maintenant compte qu'un incendie dans ce luxuriant couvert v\u00e9g\u00e9tal serait un v\u00e9ritable holocauste et pourrait d\u00e9truire les vieux arbres. Avant la cr\u00e9ation des parcs, la s\u00e9quence des incendies naturels, qui r\u00e9duisaient l'\u00e9paisseur du sous-bois, jointe \u00e0 l'\u00e9corce \u00e9paisse et r\u00e9sistant au feu des s\u00e9quoias, \u00e9liminait le danger d'incendie dans les hautes branches, fournissant en m\u00eame temps un sol min\u00e9ral optimum pour la germination des graines. Les conservateurs des parcs r\u00e9tablissent maintenant le feu en tant que facteur \u00e9cologique, pour la pr\u00e9servation et le maintien du climax- incendie des for\u00eats de s\u00e9quoias.

Certains terrains de camping, par exemple, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9s par inadvertance dans les habitats saisonniers des grizzlis. Ces camps devraient \u00eatre ferm\u00e9s et r\u00e9install\u00e9s dans des endroits plus appropri\u00e9s. L'utilisation excessive des zones recul\u00e9es a suscit\u00e9 des propositions sugg\u00e9rant de cr\u00e9er un syst\u00e8me de permis ou d'enregistrement. L'utilisation locale excessive de ces zones m\u00e9rite certes que I'on s'en pr\u00e9occupe. Mais nos efforts seraient beaucoup plus fructueux si nous pouvions appliquer ici nos concepts de capacit\u00e9 limite, au lieu de limiter arbi- trairement I'acc\u00e8s des lieux. Ce qui est particuli\u00e8rement n\u00e9cessaire est une d\u00e9cision d'am\u00e9nagement modifiant I'acc\u00e8s des visiteurs dans le temps et dans I'espace. Une telle solution vaudrait la peine qu'on s'y arr\u00eate, m\u00eame si elle ne permettait qu'\u00e0 une personne de plus de visiter une zone sans la d\u00e9grader. 44 Les probl\u00e8mes des parcs nationaux dans d'autres continents et dans d'autres biomes ne seront certainement pas semblables aux n\u00f4tres, mais les principes que nous appli- quons pour tenter de r\u00e9soudre les n\u00f4tres peuvent peut-\u00eatre s'appliquer \u00e0 vos parcs. R\u00e9cemment, en tra\u00e7ant les limites des terres publiques que l'on devrait mettre en r\u00e9serve en Alaska, le secr\u00e9taire de I'Int\u00e9rieur parlait de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de <penser en termes d'\u00e9co- syst\u00e8me>.

Dans le cadre de ces efforts, le Service des parcs nationaux insiste vivement sur la mise en \u00e6uvre d'un programme d'\u00e9ducation en mati\u00e8re d'environnement dans les parcs et les \u00e9coles publiques. L'effort principal s'exerce \u00e0 travers le programme NEED (National Environmental Education Development - Programme national d'\u00e9ducation en mati\u00e8re d'environnement).

Les principes du NEED ont pris un sens nouveau en raison de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat accru qui se manifeste pour les parcs urbains. Notre population est maintenant \u00e0 7\\o/o une popula- tion urbaine et la meilleure fa\u00e7on de lui faire prendre conscience de I'environnement et de le lui faire conna\u00eetre est de commencer \u00e0 agir en ville.

C'est une id\u00e9e inspir\u00e9e, mise en avant I'an dernier par 45 Gerardo Budowski, directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'Union internationale pour la conservation de la nature et de ses ressources (UICN) et ancien sp\u00e9cialiste des programmes d'\u00e9cologie et de conservation aupr\u00e8s de I'Organisation des Nations Unies pour l'\u00e9ducation, la science et la culture (UNESCO). D\u00e9crivant la diversit\u00e9 comme <le trait le plus marquant d'une \u00e9thique globale et l'\u00e9l\u00e9- ment fondamental de la citoyennet\u00e9 mondiale>, M. Budowski a, \u00e0 mon avis, d\u00e9fini I'un des objectifs les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s qui puissent faire l'unit\u00e9 du mouvement mondial des parcs nationaux. Il a insist\u00e9 sur (la diversit\u00e9 que l'on trouve dans l'environnement surtout lorsqu'il se rapproche le plus de son \u00e9tat naturel>. Il a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 que ces divers milieux naturels pourront aider <<tous les peuples \u00e0 sentir qu'ils d\u00e9tiennent un patrimoine qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis au cours de millions d'ann\u00e9es et continuera \u00e0 se transmettre sous la forme de paysages, d'animaux sauvages et de plantes, dont l'homme n'est \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent que le tuteur \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re>. M. Budowski, qui dit s'\u00eatre inspir\u00e9 dans ses observations d'une communication faite par Th\u00e9odore Monod en 1970, recommande la diversit\u00e9, non pas seulement comme facteur de stabilisation \u00e9cologique, mais \u00e9galement comme le fondement de l'\u00e9ventail d'options le plus riche qui s'offre \u00e0 I'homme. Il a fait un vigoureux plaidoyer en faveur de l'\u00e9ducation, n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00e9velopper la sensibilisation \u00e0 I'environnement et I'appr\u00e9- ciation de sa diversit\u00e9. Il a parl\u00e9 en termes \u00e9mouvants de <l'extraordinaire r\u00e9ceptivit\u00e9 de lajeunesse d'aujourd'hui dans le monde entier>. J'ai beaucoup voyag\u00e9 dans les parcs de mon pays et j'ai trouv\u00e9 partout, parmi la jeunesse des autres pays ainsi que du mien, le m\u00eame ardent d\u00e9sir, la m\u00eame soif et la m\u00eame r\u00e9action devant notre syst\u00e8me de parcs nationaux. La nature ne peut peut-\u00eatre plus nous convaincre qu'elle est toujours notre habitat naturel, mais elle peut \u00eatre extr\u00eamement persuasive puisqu'elle a servi de mod\u00e8le \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re d'\u00eatre de notre civilisation que nous avons model\u00e9e et tiss\u00e9e \u00e0 son image.

Les jeunes s'en rendent compte. Les parcs sont leur tour d'ivoire et leur laboratoire.

Otto Soemarwoto (pr\u00e9sident): Le premier rapport nous a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 quelques-uns des succ\u00e8s obtenus au cours de la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie, mais notre attention s'est surtout port\u00e9e sur les imperfections et les nombreux probl\u00e8mes qui ont surgi, parfois comme cons\u00e9- quences directes de nos r\u00e9ussites. Parmi ces probl\u00e8mes, certains sont toujours sans solu- tion de sorte qu'il est difficile de trouver la limite pr\u00e9cise entre le pass\u00e9, le pr\u00e9sent et I'avenir. N\u00e9anmoins, cette session devrait, dans la mesure du possible, rester tourn\u00e9e vers le pass\u00e9 et ax\u00e9e sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de conserver son \u00e9lan au syst\u00e8me des parcs dont nous avons h\u00e9rit\u00e9. Professeur Jean-Paul Harroy (auteur du Rapport l): Je me suis limit\u00e9, dans mon texte, aux dix derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, c'est-\u00e0-dire au temps \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis la premi\u00e8re Conf\u00e9rence mondiale sur les parcs nationaux qui s'est tenue \u00e0 Seattle. Quatre points fondamentaux se sont d\u00e9gag\u00e9s au cours de cette p\u00e9riode: dans les pays industrialis\u00e9s,l'opinion publique a accus\u00e9 un revirement pour soutenir les responsables des parcs nationaux; dans le tiers monde, le tourisme est apparu comme un argument puissant en faveur de I'installation de parcs ou r\u00e9serves nationales; sur le plan international, le flux d'aides bilat\u00e9rales et multilat\u00e9rales ne cesse de s'accro\u00eetre; enfin, les parcs marins, dont f id\u00e9e r\u00e9sulte de la Conf\u00e9rence de Seattle connaissent une mont\u00e9e d'int\u00e9r\u00eat sans cesse croissante. Tenant compte de tous ces progr\u00e8s, mon rapport vise \u00e0 faire un bilan des r\u00e9alisations et des difficult\u00e9s qui se pr\u00e9sentent. 41 E. Max Nicholson (auteur du Rapport 2): Historiquement, nous n'avons pas trahi I'esprit de ce feu de camp de Yellowstone que nous voyons maintenant avec un peu de recul. Il ne faudrait pas voir Frederick Law Olmsted devenir le h\u00e9ros oubli\u00e9 du mouvement en faveur des parcs. C'est gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ses efforts de pionnier g\u00e9nial dans le Yosemite, au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 1860, que la vieille tradition europ\u00e9enne de parcs priv\u00e9s ou municipaux fut enfin transform\u00e9e en une id\u00e9e nouvelle, portant sur la conservation et l'am\u00e9nagement de grands secteurs naturels pour le bien de tous.

Je pense que la cr\u00e9ation du mouvement mondial \u00e0 Seattle en 1962 repr\u00e9sentera une \u00e9tape tout aussi d\u00e9cisive que le feu de camp de Yellowstone.

Cette nouvelle mutation devait, par sa force, se montrer capitale pour les parcs nationaux. Nous ne pouvons plus nous permettre d\u00e9sormais de n'\u00eatre que de simples techniciens aux vues \u00e9troites: notre travail se situe \u00e0 la charni\u00e8re entre la terre (avec toutes les ressources de la biosph\u00e8re) et l'homme (avec toutes ses poten- tialit\u00e9s et son besoin de r\u00e9alisation). Pour harmoniser ces deux donn\u00e9es, notre lutte doit s'orienter selon trois grandes directions: la science doit porter son int\u00e9r\u00eat aux probl\u00e8mes de coexistence et d'une sage utilisation des terres; il faut \u00e9laborer des syst\u00e8mes de parcs et des programmes de gestion; enfin, il faut modifier le comportement humain gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 I'intervention des services interpr\u00e9tatifs, de l'\u00e9ducation et de la participation.

Mon rapport traite du probl\u00e8me de la fr\u00e9quentation normale et excessive des parcs et je pense qu'une \u00e9tude d\u00e9taitl\u00e9e du parc national de Yellowstone montrerait que malgr\u00e9 I'aflux des visiteurs dans les terrains de camping, les h\u00f4tels, les auberges et le bassin des geysers, l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me est en bonne sant\u00e9. Je tiens cependant \u00e0 souligner I'importance pour 48 le Service des parcs nationaux d'\u00e9tudier les questions telles que: la capacit\u00e9 d'accueil; la fa\u00e7on d'obtenir des donn\u00e9es chiffr\u00e9es et une r\u00e9glementation de la fr\u00e9quentation; quels outils sont efficaces, lesquels ne le sont pas; comment encourager une exploitation raisonnable, d\u00e9courager une exploitation d\u00e9raisonnable? Je pense ici aux probl\u00e8mes de gestion courants qui se posent dans notre syst\u00e8me de parcs nationaux et par exemple \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude, si tardivement entreprise, de l'\u00e9valuation des cons\u00e9quences des incendies. Condi- tionn\u00e9s par l'ours Smoky (symbole de la lutte contre I'incendie), les Am\u00e9ricains voient le feu avec une peur panique; nous, administrateurs de parcs, nous devons le voir en rapport avec l'\u00e9volution de l'environnement et en fonction de ses cons\u00e9quences \u00e9colo- giques. Mon rapport aborde aussi les possibilit\u00e9s \u00e9ducatives des parcs, qu'il s'agisse d'activit\u00e9s libres ou dirig\u00e9es, ainsi que les nombreux probl\u00e8mes qu'il nous faudra affronter si la d\u00e9mo- graphie continue \u00e0 cro\u00eetre et si la consommation incontr\u00f4l\u00e9e des ressources naturelles n'est pas frein\u00e9e. Mais je reste conflant dans I'avenir des parcs nationaux dans leur second si\u00e8cle d'existence. L'homme est capable de penser et de raisonner et je crois que les d\u00e9fen- seurs des parcs peuvent faire de ce mouvoment mondial un nouvel exemple, encore plus important et plus signifrcatif, de la sagesse dont I'homme peut faire preuve.

Plus que toute autre id\u00e9e, plus que les arguments fond\u00e9s en premier lieu sur le revenu touristique, c'est cet argument qui peut apporter le meilleur soutien aux parcs nationaux. L'argent a bien s\u00fbr son importance, mais ce n'est ni le but final, ni la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 fondamentale d'un parc et c'est une erreur de se comporter comme s'il en \u00e9tait ainsi. Trop souvent, des arguments financiers entrent en conflit avec l'\u00e9thique sur laquelle reposent les parcs nationaux. Il devient donc en\u00e7ore plus fondamental de s'adresser \u00e0 l'opinion publique en faisant jouer surtout les arguments \u00e9thiques. Deuxi\u00e8mement, il est tr\u00e8s impor- tant que les habitants de pays industrialis\u00e9s et surtout les organismes donneurs d'aide reconnaissent que si leur aide porte essentiellement sur le d\u00e9veloppement sans se pr\u00e9occu- per de la conservation, leur attitude se soldera par la perp\u00e9tuation, \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle globale, des erreurs d\u00e9j\u00e0 commises dans les pays donneurs d'aide. Nous n'avons jamais insist\u00e9 assez fort sur ce point: c'est une des erreurs du pass\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle il faut rem\u00e9dier dans I'avenir. Conrad L. Wirth (membre du Panel): On pourrait avoir I'impression que nous avons fait, par le pass\u00e9, une s\u00e9rie d'erreurs; mais parmi ces erreurs, nombreuses sont celles qui nous ont permis un grand pas en avant. L'une d'elles, dont j'ai eu connaissance pour la premi\u00e8re fois quand elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise par Tom Vint et ses coll\u00e8gues, fut de vouloir \u00e9laborer un plan de gestion globale pour chaque r\u00e9gion, plan qui portait \u00e0 la fois sur l'emplacement des routes, la manipulation et l'\u00e9tude de la faune d'un parc, et sur tous les autres probl\u00e8mes d'am\u00e9nagement. La plus grande difficult\u00e9 consiste ensuite \u00e0 mettre ce plan global en application;je pense qu'en ce qui concerne ce point, toutes les conditions fondamentales, I'essentiel de ce qu'ont pu apprendre les administrateurs d'organismes de parcs nationaux, 49 est admirablement bien r\u00e9sum\u00e9 dans le Rapport l, dont I'auteur expose les quatre condi- tions n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c5c45779-606c-4db4-9c3b-948287e3ce28": {"__data__": {"id_": "c5c45779-606c-4db4-9c3b-948287e3ce28", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/deuxieme-conference-mondiale-sur-les-parcs-nationaux-parcs-nationaux-de", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deuxi\u00e8me Conf\u00e9rence Mondiale sur les Parcs Nationaux, Parcs nationaux de Yellowstone et de Grand Teton, Etats-Unis, 18-27 septembre 1972 : compte rendu", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/deuxieme-conference-mondiale-sur-les-parcs-nationaux-parcs-nationaux-de", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff39939f78cb26fc1e423fb45e5259f13c85a01c264688542befcdbc1fe8b116"}, "3": {"node_id": "7f92dba2-e60a-415b-95a0-e385877d9cf1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/deuxieme-conference-mondiale-sur-les-parcs-nationaux-parcs-nationaux-de", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1aae34fd39abb00ea39c58d7ae4cec9ba919fa8772cc720d3ef799e737bbe5d7"}}, "hash": "e5d129bf1336f7ac5151690ba60b83f178abca5b5541aac6e8b6ce3dbe0641c9", "text": "bonne mise en place d'un parc national. Jean Gahuranyi Tanganyika (membre du Panel): Il faut bien insister sur un point: si on utilise les parcs comme zones de loisirs, c'est bien \u00e0 cause de la valeur naturelle intrins\u00e8que de ces zones; mais cette fr\u00e9quentation ne doit jamais se traduire par une recrudescence d'am\u00e9nagements et d'installations. Si l'on travaille pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de I'homme et de la nature et si I'on veut respecter les ressources naturelles, il faut, par exemple, que les \u00e9quipements se situent \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du parc. On peut cependant tol\u00e9rer certaines voies d'acc\u00e8s, dans la mesure o\u00ccr elles n'interf\u00e8rent pas avec la pr\u00e9vention de l'\u00e9rosion et tiennent d\u00fbment compte des conditions climatiques. Que cette r\u00e8gle n'ait pas toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9e n'est pas une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Les pays en voie de d\u00e9veloppement doivent trouver leurs propres solutions et, dans le domaine de la conservation de la nature, ce qui est bon dans certains pays ne I'est pas forc\u00e9ment dans d'autres. Le pr\u00e9sident de mon pays a dit: <Nous voulons \u00eatre s\u00fbrs que, quand les experts auront transform\u00e9 le monde vivant en un environnement artificiel, il restera encore dans notre pays des \u00e9chantillons de nature \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat pur>; il a \u00e9galement fait remarquer que l'\u00e9puration d'une rivi\u00e8re est une op\u00e9ration co\u00fbteuse qui n'aboutit que rarement \u00e0 lui rendre sa puret\u00e9 originelle. Ivan Cibulec (membre du Panel): La Tch\u00e9coslovaquie se f\u00e9licite d'avoir, dans la for\u00eat vierge de Boubin, situ\u00e9e dans la cha\u00eene bois\u00e9e des monts de Boh\u00eame, une des plus ancien- nes r\u00e9serves naturelles mondiales. Cette r\u00e9serve a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie en 1858, de sorte que nos \u00e9tudes et notre documentation sur cette r\u00e9gion remontent \u00e0 il y a plus d'un si\u00e8cle.

Ce que je tiens \u00e0 faire remarquer, c'est qu'il est de premi\u00e8re urgence de prot\u00e9ger ce qui reste du patrimoine naturel et culturel mondial; il serait donc un peu vain de gaspiller trop de temps et d'\u00e9nergie sur des questions de terminologie se rapportant aux parcs ou sur I'application stricte de crit\u00e8res. Ce qui est prioritaire, c'est d'assurer quelques mesures de conservation constructive.

J'aimerais \u00e9galement que le professeur Harroy pr\u00e9cise la question des aspects n\u00e9gatifs du tourisme. C.

Ils accusent d'ailleurs souvent les parcs nationaux de constituer un danger d'incendie, et ne demandent qu'une chose; la suppression des feux courants incontr\u00f4l\u00e9s dans les plus brefs d\u00e9lais. Rocco Knobel (Afrique du Sud): Dans le parc national Kruger, le feu est reconnu comme outil d'am\u00e9nagement et depuis environ vingt ans, quelques 3000 parcelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9serv\u00e9es puis br\u00fbl\u00e9es tour \u00e0 tour pour mettre en \u00e9vidence les effets positifs ou n\u00e9gatifs de cette pratique.
