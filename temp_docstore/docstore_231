When news media are overzealous in their reporting and take on the role of moral \u2018watchdogs\u2019, they contribute further to this stigmatization. \u2022\ufffd Exacerbating this situation is the fact that the overall quality of journalism in Sri Lanka, as in some other parts of the world, is poor. Few journalists adhere to basic ethics such as confidentiality and anonymity. In the case of HIV and KAPs, the problem is exacerbated because sex and sexuality are taboo subjects, and sex work and sexual minorities are criminalized by the state. Journalists reflect the same biases and legal frameworks of the larger society of which they are a part. Education and training in journalism is almost always restricted to the technical aspects of the profession, rather than equipping students with a greater understanding of media theory and ethics, issues of human rights and social justice, and the mandates of an independent press. \u2022\ufffd Another issue is the widely differing perceptions on the role of the news media as an institution in a functioning democracy, and conflict or lack of understanding between the news media on the one hand and NGOs and marginalized communities (including key affected populations) on the other. Typically, NGOs and KAPs expect the media to report on their concerns with far greater sensitivity and depth than they do, while the media may be uninterested, see itself as a moral \u2018watchdog\u2019, or feel no particular responsibility or obligation to do so. \u2022\ufffd News media may also see their work in terms of being a corporate entity having to survive in an increasingly competitive market place, who therefore make choices on their stories and reporting based on their management or readership. Market imperatives, the increasing commercialization of the news media industry, and the media\u2019s role in reporting on critical social issues \u2014 these are fundamental and critical debates that have started to occur across the globe, and Sri Lanka is no exception. \u2022\ufffd Influencing the media is difficult. Firstly, media advocacy efforts of development agencies are often ad hoc and fragmented and may lack significant outcomes; for example, workshops draw mostly young journalists with little influence over their publications. Further, if the media industry is driven 2 The Global Commission on HIV and the Law (2012). Risks, Rights and Health. UNDP: New York City. 9 by politics and business, it makes it difficult to gain the sustained support of senior editors and journalists for other development and social issues, including health. These are challenges common to the South Asia region, as well as other parts of the world. Finally, the low prevalence of HIV in Sri Lanka further exacerbates the problem as it is not seen as an important or prominent issue. \u2022\ufffd There is a widespread absence of a culture of citizens\u2019 rights in Sri Lanka, and this is especially true in the case of key affected populations who come from a long history of marginalization and disempowerment. In the case of media coverage, NGOs and KAPs have remained largely unaware of official redressal systems available, and a deep-rooted sense of self-stigma and intimidation have contributed to the lack of official complaints in response to the preponderance of negative coverage. \u2022\ufffd The increasing democratization of social media including individual blogs presents new challenges in terms of quality control, as well as new opportunities that can be tapped for increasing KAP voices in the public domain. recommendations This study addressed a challenging issue and yielded critical insight into the role of the news media in Sri Lanka in reflecting and perpetuating stigma and discrimination against key populations affected by HIV. It also captured a complex web of factors that influences such coverage: the criminalization of sex work and homosexuality in the country\u2019s legislation; a long history of stigmatization of behaviours that fall outside the hetero-normative framework that defines Sri Lanka\u2019s culture and society; and the gaps and challenges confronting the media advocacy efforts of development agencies. Based on the desk review, content analysis and SSIs, the study identified a core set of recommendations for Sri Lanka\u2019s national HIV prevention programme. Understandably, these recommendations can only be effective if pursued through a concerted approach with the active participation of a wide range of stakeholders. However, if the news media is to play a proactive and independent role in a functioning and pluralistic democracy, protecting the rights of all citizens irrespective of sexual orientation, gender identity, or choice of sex work as a legitimate profession, the actions detailed below", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15a8c69a-fd6d-49a1-acbf-56afb89e192a": {"__data__": {"id_": "15a8c69a-fd6d-49a1-acbf-56afb89e192a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Stigma, Discrimination and Key Affected Populations: Strengthening the Role of Media Advocacy in Sri Lanka through a Critical Analysis of News Media Coverage", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5a509ac7ced93b2018514d1788cbc0ecbee8bbcdb076c5473dadcd1f694f4aed"}, "3": {"node_id": "b68de5e9-3d20-4a0b-9d5d-83c99e82a939", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ffd688f0f008e76b1e762e99c742f8364c2c6fc521e017463f5ef1226d15f012"}}, "hash": "a5df906014be80291e6f604a96c8daee6794c933b5f78e8ea539b86e6b503824", "text": "will be critical to the success of efforts to strengthen the role of media advocacy in Sri Lanka in relation to HIV and the rights of key affected populations. 1. Place stigma and discrimination experienced by key affected populations within the broader context of marginalization, human rights violations and equity issues in sri lanka. This is a critical first step, especially necessary given that HIV prevalence in Sri Lanka is low, hence not seen as an \u2018attractive\u2019 issue for media coverage. Key affected populations, like other marginalized segments of the population in the country, lack effective access to education, health, housing and other necessities. This basic social vulnerability is further exacerbated by their sexual orientations, gender identities or choice of sex work as a means of livelihood, pushing them even further to the fringes. This larger context of disenfranchisement is critical. There is a need for greater attention to it. Attention to stigma and discrimination is a part of the larger global development agenda, as represented by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and discussions on the post-MDG agenda in which Sri Lanka is a participant. 2. express full support for and leverage ongoing media reform measures that are aimed at resurrecting media autonomy and ethics to facilitate gains for coverage of all marginalized populations, including kAPs. In this context, media advocacy efforts must be grounded not so much in the argument for increased HIV coverage, but rather, improving the quality of coverage of all marginalized populations, including key affected populations, based on the fundamental premise of protecting their human rights. In this context, the National Media Policy (2007) provides a useful framework, given its focus on \u2018achieving excellence in the total practice of media by creating a people-centred, development-oriented, free, and responsible media culture as required by a well\u2010 informed and democratic society\u2019 while also promoting \u2018unity in diversity and harmony\u2019. executive summAry 10 Stigma, diScrimination and Key affected populationS: Strengthening the role of media advocacy in Sri lanKa through critical analySiS of newS media coverage 3. create a national committee of senior journalists, lawyers, human rights activists, HIV programme representatives from government, UN agencies, NGOs and KAPs that can act as a hub to provide technical advice, and anchor and monitor progress on media advocacy efforts. The committee must be mandated with the task of acting as a pressure group to monitor media coverage, improve reporting standards, and create an enabling environment for the ethical and sensitive coverage of issues relevant to key affected populations. 4. Adopt a multi-tiered, segmented approach towards working with different news media, based on their ownership (government or private), ideological stance (liberal or conservative), and quality of coverage. Initially, start working closely with liberal newspapers and individual journalists that have provided somewhat better coverage on HIV and key affected populations; over time, these efforts will grow organically to establish quality benchmarks for others to follow and create an overall enabling environment for improved media coverage of marginalized populations. 5. intensify efforts to mainstream Hiv as an issue within cross-cutting government programmes as well as in media advocacy. HIV is a multisectoral issue, and in some parts of the world \u2018HIV and Development\u2019 and \u2018HIV and Gender\u2019 arguments have been successfully leveraged in media advocacy to expand coverage beyond the health domain. This mainstreaming must be reflected in the media advocacy strategy: for example, given that business occupies a salient position in Sri Lanka\u2019s news media, this space (as well as those for gender and other dimensions of HIV) can be effectively leveraged to increase the range and breadth of coverage on HIV. 6. mobilize and leverage high-level political and policy commitment to create an enabling environment for HIV prevention and the human rights of key affected populations. Political leaders and senior policy makers must be fully sensitized and oriented on the issues and key talking points; this will enable them to publicly advocate for HIV prevention and KAP rights, so that a politics and personality-driven media industry picks these issues up for coverage. 7. design and implement a strategic and multipronged media advocacy programme including workshops, guidelines and terminology for media coverage, site visits to HIV-relevant programmes, and regular \u2018news feeds\u2019, as well as, importantly, partnership-building with media houses responsible for both news and entertainment programming.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b68de5e9-3d20-4a0b-9d5d-83c99e82a939": {"__data__": {"id_": "b68de5e9-3d20-4a0b-9d5d-83c99e82a939", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Stigma, Discrimination and Key Affected Populations: Strengthening the Role of Media Advocacy in Sri Lanka through a Critical Analysis of News Media Coverage", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5a509ac7ced93b2018514d1788cbc0ecbee8bbcdb076c5473dadcd1f694f4aed"}, "2": {"node_id": "15a8c69a-fd6d-49a1-acbf-56afb89e192a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5df906014be80291e6f604a96c8daee6794c933b5f78e8ea539b86e6b503824"}}, "hash": "ffd688f0f008e76b1e762e99c742f8364c2c6fc521e017463f5ef1226d15f012", "text": "Conducting a rapid \u2018stigma assessment\u2019 of journalists, and using the findings as a baseline to measure the effectiveness of media advocacy interventions would provide added value.

As well as this, NGOs and KAPs must empower themselves with knowledge of human rights and HIV-related programmes, policies and issues so that they can effectively identify their key messages and advocate with the media. Vigilant communities with a greater degree of political awareness of their rights as citizens and consumers of the media can substantially bolster their engagement, not only with the media but also with politicians and policy makers. 9. empower ngos and kAPs in \u2018citizen journalism\u2019 in keeping with the increasing democratization of social media. In addition to being a fundamentally empowering process, placing the tools of communication in the hands of communities could yield multiple benefits, including a greater authenticity and diversity of news coming directly from marginalized communities, with the potential of further amplification through mainstream news media. Potentially, this could result in more positive and sensitive coverage on the active participation of key affected populations in HIV prevention efforts and in promoting and advancing basic human rights. 10. strengthen the role of the Press complaints commission of sri lanka (Pccsl) in monitoring HIV coverage and facilitating official redressal for inappropriate or negative coverage. The study learnt 11 that based on official requests, the PCCSL in recent years has played a very effective monitoring role with regard to reportage on suicide and mental health; this experience can be effectively translated to the domain of HIV and KAPs. 11. involve senior editors and the management of media houses to ensure their buy-in and thus facilitate sustainability. Experience demonstrates that high-profile partnership-building, including exposure visits for senior editors to successful HIV programmes within the Asia/South Asia region, has helped catalyse their interest and engagement, and provided a wider perspective on HIV and the human rights of Key Affected Populations. Involving senior journalists from neighbouring countries such as India, which has had significant success with media advocacy, can also help defuse the notion that HIV and the rights of KAP is a Western-driven agenda. 12. design and conduct capacity-building interventions for journalists that break out of the usual information-dissemination workshop mould to creatively and effectively sensitize journalists to their own biases, especially with regard to sexuality, a sensitive and taboo subject. Expand outreach for these programmes to include regional languages, provinces and \u2018stringers\u2019 (freelance journalists) from rural areas. The study identified some possible creative approaches to such sensitization. In addition, capacity-building for the media must necessarily be multi-tiered and customized for different staff cadres within newspapers, including those involved with copy- editing and design and layout. 13. Provide clear contact points for the media to reach out to, and facilitate regular interaction between communities/NGOs and journalists to facilitate greater trust and understanding, as well as the recognition of their common cause in protecting citizen rights. Building mutual trust and partnerships is crucial to a sustainable response. 14. encourage powers of self-regulation within the media in the interest of ownership and sustainability. Autonomous bodies such as the Free Media Movement (FMM) can play a vital role in encouraging discourse on media coverage of key affected populations, and push for the human rights of these marginalized communities. Within this context, the media can and must recognize the larger implications of HIV prevention efforts, and the value of community mobilization efforts for key affected populations, and thus play a larger advocacy role, highlighting gaps in the response and human rights violations. 15. work through media/journalism colleges and institutions to build a cadre of journalists equipped not merely in the technical production aspects of a market-driven industry, but a larger appreciation of media theory, ethics, human rights and social justice, and the role of the media in a functioning democracy. This can help institutionalize and sustain sensitive, ethical coverage on HIV and key affected populations within the overall framework of human rights, social exclusion and equity. In parallel, efforts should be made to mainstream sensitization efforts to multiple domains \u2014 cinema, television, radio, theatre \u2014 and a range of other popular cultural forms that define the collective imagination of a nation. conclusion A complex web of factors has contributed to the negative and often damaging media coverage on HIV and KAPs in Sri Lanka.

Over the course of more than 30 years, notable strides have been made to reduce stigma and discrimination towards people with HIV (PLHIV) and key affected populations (KAPs) such as sex workers, men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people (TG), and people who use drugs (PWUD). \u2018Key affected populations\u2019 refers to those most likely to be exposed to HIV or to transmit it \u2013 their engagement is critical to a successful HIV response, i.e. they are key to the epidemic and key to the response.5 These efforts to reduce stigma and discrimination towards key affected populations have included developing supportive legislation and policies, advocacy and community mobilization through networks and collectives, and media campaigns involving celebrities and \u2018champions\u2019, i.e. high-profile supportive individuals. However, while there are pockets of success, stigma and discrimination continue in many forms in different parts of the world. Sri Lanka is a case in point. With a low-level epidemic of 0.3% prevalence and limited HIV programming, Sri Lanka has witnessed high levels of stigma and discrimination against key affected populations over several years.6 Even though the Constitution of Sri Lanka Article 12 (2), Chapter 3 spells out the fundamental rights of citizens and the principle of non-discrimination7, it does not explicitly protect sexual minorities who have diverse sexual orientation or gender identities. The criminalization of MSM and other vulnerable populations is often a direct result of penal codes from the colonial era, similar to those found in other former British colonies such as India, Malaysia, and Singapore as well as in several African nations. Coupled with the social stigma attached to their behaviours, this criminalization contributes to the abuse, intimidation, unlawful detention and human rights violations of KAPS.8 Aggrieved parties have the possibility of making an application before the Supreme Court on the basis of the violation of their fundamental rights. However, given the high levels of stigma and discrimination, and the absence of constitutionally stated rights to equality and non-discrimination, key affected populations are rendered invisible in the eyes of society and the law, with no form of redress. This factor plays a role in deterring them from reporting the acts of discrimination, abuse and violence that confront them. The media and its journalists both reflect and perpetuate the prevailing stigma and discrimination of the society in which it is located, both through acts of omission and commission. There is no discourse on the basic human rights of key affected populations, nor a questioning of the outdated legislation 3 Reducing Stigma and Discrimination: a Critical Part of National AIDS Programmes: A Resource for National Stakeholders in the HIV Response.

While this has mainly been perpetuated in the print media, it has been picked up and amplified by electronic and social media, thus reaching a wider audience. Civil society agencies have attempted to conduct media advocacy and sensitization workshops on HIV, the increased risk and vulnerability of key affected populations, and their rights to equality. However, these efforts are undermined by several factors: the high turnover of journalists, and the fact that these workshops are mostly attended by junior journalists with no larger decision-making powers to influence their publications. Specific media guidelines for reporting on HIV, which have been effective in facilitating more positive coverage in other countries, are absent in Sri Lanka. A media incident in September 2011 is particularly illustrative of the issues discussed in this report: the stigmatization of a key affected population combined with problems with Sri Lankan journalism itself. \u2018The Rivira episode\u2019 involved a sustained and scathing \u2018expos\u00e9\u2019 by the Rivira newspaper on the HIV prevention efforts of an NGO working for MSM as endangering the tradition and culture of Sri Lanka. The Office of the President\u2019s call for an investigation further intensified a sense of fear and discrimination, further driving underground the most marginalized segments of society, and forcing both the closure and/or suspension of several NGOs. The Rivira campaign displayed a complete lack of basic media ethics, and violated fundamental journalistic principles of anonymity and confidentiality. This episode posed the question to NGOs, the government and the media of the media\u2019s role and responsibility, especially with regard to covering HIV prevention efforts in the country. If Sri Lanka is to play its role in achieving the global strategic vision of zero discrimination, zero infections and zero deaths caused by HIV, strategic media advocacy, sensitization and partnership-building is of urgent necessity. Efforts are currently underway in Sri Lanka to develop and finalize the second National Strategic Plan (NSP) on HIV for 2012\u20132016. It is therefore an opportune time to engage in actions that will strengthen the role of media in reducing stigma and discrimination against key affected populations, and thus contribute to an overall enabling environment for HIV prevention and care in the country. This study, therefore, is a first step in this direction. Conducted between July and October 2012, the study uses a multipronged design to critically understand the nature of stigma and discrimination in media coverage, the influence of legislative and media frameworks, and develop recommendations to strengthen media advocacy. The methodology \u2014 involving a detailed desk review, content analysis of media coverage, and semi-structured interviews with a range of stakeholders \u2014 was used to identify a new and effective course for media advocacy under the National Strategic Plan and Sri Lanka\u2019s Round 9 grant from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. This study also responds to recommendations made at the high-level SAARCLAW South Asian Roundtable Dialogue on HIV and the Law (held in Kathmandu, Nepal, 7\u20138 November 2011 and supported by the International Development and Law Organization (IDLO) and UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre); it also responds to recommendations of the UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Dialogue of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law (Bangkok, 17 February 2011) and its follow-up meeting in Sri Lanka in February 2012. This activity also reflects commitments under the HLM and UNESCAP Resolutions 66/10 and 67/9, and the recommendations made at the national consultation on MSM, HIV and sexual health in November 2009 in Negombo, Sri Lanka. goals and objectives of the study \u2022\ufffd To demonstrate the media\u2019s role in reflecting and perpetuating stigma and discrimination against KAPs and PLHIV in Sri Lanka. \u2022\ufffd Provide recommendations for strengthening the role of media advocacy in creating an enabling environment for HIV prevention and care. cH 1. rAtionAle, objectives And scoPe oF tHe study 14 Stigma, diScrimination and Key affected populationS: Strengthening the role of media advocacy in Sri lanKa through critical analySiS of newS media coverage methodologies The study used a mix of research methodologies, both quantitative and qualitative, which included: 1.

Due to ease of access, the study focused on the print news media. This was understandably a significant limitation given that radio, television and the internet increasingly serve as news sources. In addition, the study recognizes that a society\u2019s perception and understanding of issues is shaped not only by the news media, but also, and perhaps equally powerfully, by other kinds of media programming such as entertainment. In fact, entertainment-education \u2014 the strategic integration of social/educational messaging through entertainment formats such as soaps and talk shows \u2014 has fast gained ground as a key strategy to trigger social change. However, this was not within the scope of this study. 2. The study focused on the content analysis, the desk review and SSIs to understand the nature of news media\u2019s role in reflecting and perpetuating stigma and discrimination. However, media and communication studies clearly point to the need to consider the concept of media effects: the effects that media has on individuals and society, and the subjective differences in how audiences receive, interpret and make meaning of their exposure to the media. While media effects is an important domain, this was not within the scope of this study. 3. Another constraint was that due to the uneven representation of newspapers from the three languages in the study (with Sinhala papers accounting for the maximum number and Tamil newspapers the least), cross-language comparisons were not feasible. Also, the large, multi- language database for the Content Analysis component of this study presented some challenges. The various nuances and complexities of language such as in Sinhala and Tamil may have been lost in the process of transcribing and coding. 4. There was almost no coverage of IDUs during the time period for the study, but rather a preponderance of coverage on people who use drugs. Hence, the study decided to include PWUDs as a key affected population, rather than IDUs given the extreme stigmatization and criminalization of this group both in real life and in media coverage. 15 The Role of Stigma and Discrimination in HIV Prevention and Care understanding stigma and discrimination \u201cIf we do not appreciate the nature and impact of stigma, none of our interventions can begin to be successful. AIDS is probably the most stigmatised disease in history.\u201d9 \u2013 Edwin Cameron, Constitutional Court Justice, South Africa With an estimated 34 million people living with HIV globally,10 the HIV epidemic has highlighted a stark reality \u2014 that it disproportionately affects those already caught in a cycle of disenfranchisement and marginalization due to inequities stemming from poverty, gender, and lack of access to education and health care. Within this context, key affected populations are even more severely disenfranchised, given that their behaviours are severely stigmatized and little understood. Homosexuality and same-sex relationships are conflated with paedophilia, deviancy and perversion. Homosexuality is characterized as an illness sorely in need of a cure. Sex work has historically been conflated with trafficking and forced exploitation as the last recourse of \u2018fallen women\u2019. However, sex between men and sex work are activities that place MSM and sex workers at greater risk to HIV at the same time that they place them as the objects of high levels of stigma and discrimination. The criminalization of these behaviours have forced populations associated with them underground and into near invisibility, challenging outreach efforts for HIV prevention. Simply defined, stigma is \u2018a process of devaluation\u2019, an all-pervasive attitude that is expressed through language, behaviour, harassment and ostracization. Discrimination is the acting out of stigma: the unfair and unjust treatment of an individual through acts of omission or commission based, in this case, on their real or perceived HIV status or association with groups at greater risk to HIV.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22a0510e-96eb-4a9a-b2bc-43ad3d73a399": {"__data__": {"id_": "22a0510e-96eb-4a9a-b2bc-43ad3d73a399", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Stigma, Discrimination and Key Affected Populations: Strengthening the Role of Media Advocacy in Sri Lanka through a Critical Analysis of News Media Coverage", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "25f007dd9e56dd9fe2284ec74a18e4778f29a6b21325cd74fe968284e1102777"}, "2": {"node_id": "3817251a-2290-43ec-b25e-63bb8e890dc6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6504f8a41c13428b2c2f6a2689caa21e566a29865f319ff65651c058d79f9f40"}}, "hash": "f91a8cc701fad4cd565c255e891ba3fe750907692fdb49ee4ca158951d9b96cf", "text": "Discrimination may be institutionalized through existing laws, policies and practices that negatively target PLHIV and marginalized groups.11 Stigma and discrimination are all-pervasive, and can occur in multiple settings: within the home and family, work, public spaces, health-care services, schools, places of worship, and housing.

Reducing stigma and discrimination is critical to ensuring Universal Access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care and achieving Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 6, while also protecting human rights, fostering respect for PLHIV and KAPs, and reducing HIV transmission. The media has a vital role to play in this effort. A conceptual Framework for understanding the role of the media Nothing is more compellingly true than the fact that today the media is the prime shaper of our perceptions, our \u2018meaning making\u2019 of the world around us. The explosion of all-pervasive, omniscient 24/7 media, be it newspapers, radio, television or the internet, has resulted in literally creating a worldwide web which relentlessly mediates our experience of the world around us. While media\u2019s role as a \u2018magic bullet\u2019 \u2014 that is, a force that has direct and unmediated impacts on audiences \u2014 has long since been disputed,14 there is little doubt that it acts as a powerful force in shaping our perception and understanding of the world around us. An important strand within this domain of understanding is the media\u2019s role in shaping social and cultural mores, and in creating the \u2018Grand Narratives\u2019 of our time.

While these narratives are most often played out in the visual media (cinema, documentary, entertainment programming), the news media also play an important role.

Briefly, the theory refers to the ability of the media to determine what is important and worthy of debate in the public domain, based on the frequency and prominence of coverage given to issues.16 The theory was formally developed by Maxwell McCombs and Donald Shaw; however, its genesis appears to lie with Bernard Cohen when he first observed: \u201cThe world will look different to different people, depending on the map that is drawn for them by writers, editors, and publishers of the paper they read.\u201d17 An important implication in this statement is that the \u2018truth\u2019, as defined by journalism, can vary based on the ideological and socio-cultural lenses defined by individual journalists, newspapers and of course their ownership and management, which increasingly lie in the hands of large corporations. Media analysts then argue that the real function of the media lies not so much in reporting the \u2018truth\u2019 but in \u2018manufacturing consent\u2019 as famously elaborated upon by Noam Chomsky in his seminal work Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media.18 This report draws from the above theoretical frameworks. the news media and Hiv The news media has played a vital role in the HIV epidemic from the very start, communicating news on the virus, its modes of transmission, and efforts to halt its progression. At the same time, the news media has reflected the deeply engrained prejudices of society against PLHIV and KAPs. Recognizing its power to both reflect and alter perceptions, HIV programmes in different countries have deployed a range of strategies to strengthen and leverage news media for creating an enabling environment. These strategies have included sensitization workshops for journalists, partnership- building with senior editors, exposure visits to HIV prevention programmes, and facilitating interactions with PLHIV and KAPs. Media advocacy packages and guidelines for terminology and reporting have served as effective tools for journalists across the world, contributing to significant positive shifts in HIV coverage. Two innovative approaches are of particular note, both supported by Avahan, the India AIDS Initiative of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. When Avahan was launched in 2004, it was clear that the focus would be on targeted interventions for HIV prevention among key affected populations. Ten years of media advocacy efforts in India did not produce the outcomes desired; it was clear that a radically new approach was needed to reduce stigma and discrimination. 15 Datta, Bishakha (2005) Not a Sob Story: Representing the Realities of Sex Work in India.

The predominant mode of transmission, counting for 82.8%, is through unprotected sex between men and women, followed by 12.3% through unprotected sex among MSM. Vertical transmission accounts for 4.4%, infected blood 0.4% and injecting drug use 0.5% of all transmission.20 While this is a low-level epidemic, sentinel surveillance studies indicate that seroprevalence among key affected populations has been increasing over the years. For example, between 2009 and 2011, seroprevalence among female sex workers increased from 0 to 0.2%, among MSM from 0.48 to 0.9%, and among drug users from 0 to 0.2%. Experience from other countries in South Asia has shown that concentrated HIV epidemics can expand quickly and affect the wider population through \u2018bridge populations\u2019 (for example, men who have sex with partners from both higher-risk key affected populations and lower-risk populations). Sri Lanka also has certain socioeconomic and behavioural factors that could ignite a larger epidemic in the country: the presence of a large youth population, internal and external migration, a hidden but flourishing sex industry, low levels of condom use, and concurrent sexual relationships among key affected populations. Recognizing this potential threat, the National AIDS Committee (NAC) recommended a greater focus on targeted interventions (TIs) aimed at key affected populations. This was further endorsed by the National Strategic Plan (2007\u20132011), which aimed at increasing the coverage and quality of TIs, including treatment, care and support. Recognizing that criminalization, stigma and discrimination towards KAPs could negatively impact access to and utilization of prevention services, the National AIDS Policy (NAP) of Sri Lanka, adopted in 2011, emphatically endorsed \u201cprevention, treatment, care and support for all citizens in a non- discriminating environment where the protection of fundamental rights are upheld to the highest standards as enshrined in the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.\u201d Mapping studies estimate approximately 35,000\u201347,000 Female Sex Workers, 24,000\u201337,000 Men who have Sex with Men and about 305,000 drug users (of heroin, cannabis and opium) in Sri Lanka.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf5f7838-3980-44f0-b57b-951185e46c3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf5f7838-3980-44f0-b57b-951185e46c3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Stigma, Discrimination and Key Affected Populations: Strengthening the Role of Media Advocacy in Sri Lanka through a Critical Analysis of News Media Coverage", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d01481bbc1323c2a6e68de32c60ebf8f4e6b3377da9c2e9e6a0fa821e87a80c"}, "2": {"node_id": "2286a29d-2b43-44a3-b639-80119812b0cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3db1ef0383ec08e4c237677c1bf04df95acc5b5c07068dd48c5b37da0d096322"}}, "hash": "67374ea27cea0726095eaa15ad147b17286a67ef1efbd1637785993791e101d8", "text": "Consistent condom use among female sex workers during the last sexual act with a paying partner was in the range of 80\u201395% and 64% among men who had sex with another male partner.

The review also drew attention to programme gaps such as an insufficient focus on key affected populations such as FSW and clients, MSM and partners, and drug users, and the inadequate involvement of NGOs and private sector in providing coverage of services. Similarly, a 2007 study indicates that coverage of behaviour change interventions for FSW, MSM and drug users is less than 10%.24 box 3: Hiv Preventive knowledge and behaviours in sri lanka \u2022\ufffd Only 66% of MSM knew that condoms could prevent HIV \u2022\ufffd Only 41.2% of MSM had used a condom with regular male partner, and only 25.6% had used a condom with a non-regular partner at the most recent sexual exposure \u2022\ufffd Only 2.6% of youth reported condom use during their last anal sex encounter with a male partner \u2022\ufffd Only 42.6% of sex workers and 13.6% of MSM had ever sought HIV testing and counselling Clearly, stigma and discrimination play a critical role in inhibiting service uptake, especially among key affected populations who do not have sufficient information, ability or opportunity (resources, tools and supportive environments) to negotiate safer sex, safer drug use, or access to HIV treatment and care. The next section examines the legislative frameworks underpinning the criminalization and stigmatization of discrimination towards KAPs in Sri Lanka. legislative Framework in sri lanka A fundamental challenge to HIV programmes across several countries in the South Asia region is the tension between government endorsement and support for Targeted Interventions on the one hand, and the criminalization of sex work and homosexuality in the country\u2019s Constitution. This is the case in Sri Lanka as well (India successfully waged a lengthy battle against Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalized so-called \u2018unnatural\u2019 sex. This resulted in the striking down of this legal provision, as it pertains to consensual sex between adults, by the Delhi High Court in July 2009).25 Sri Lanka\u2019s HIV policies and programmes provide active endorsement of Targeted Interventions for HIV prevention and care among KAPs. The National AIDS Policy (NAP), for example, recognizing the intimate link between HIV and human rights efforts endorses prevention, treatment, care and support for all citizens in a non-discriminating environment where the protection of fundamental rights is upheld to the highest standards as enshrined in the Constitution.

To cite another example, under Article 15, restrictions a) and b) on freedom of expression mirror what is said in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but the constitution of Sri Lanka goes one step further with the Clause c) restriction which refers to written and unwritten law. This Clause is particularly problematic when it comes to KAPs because of the criminal classification of their behaviours (refer to Box 5 for details of specific legislation), and the reference to unwritten law that provides ample scope for misinterpretation, subjectivity and abuse. box 5: legislation relevant to sex work, Homosexuality and drug use 1. section 365A which criminalizes homosexuality 2. section 365A of the Penal Code (1883) criminalizes sexual activity between two consenting adults of the same sex: No.2 (cap 19) refers to the \u2018sex against the order of nature\u2019 and \u2018gross indecency\u2019.

All in all, a multiplicity of factors \u2014 archaic, ambiguous and loop-holed legislation, historically and deeply engrained prejudices, and a genuine lack of awareness \u2014 converge to create a climate of stigma and discrimination towards KAPs in Sri Lanka. This is further reflected and perpetuated by the media industry, whose journalists are drawn from the same larger society. Sensitizing and working closely with the news media is, therefore, critical to increasing their understanding of human rights with regard to sexuality and gender, and of the critical contributions of KAPs to HIV prevention. An informed and sensitive news media is vital to facilitating debate and discourse critical to the functioning of a vibrant democracy, one that delivers on its promise to protecting the fundamental human rights of all its citizens, especially those who are disenfranchised and marginalized. the news media in sri lanka \u2014 A background Today, Sri Lanka has 38 publications (newspapers and magazines), 15 newspaper publishers, 51 radio stations and 5 community radio stations, and 22 TV channels across 15 TV stations.29 The Sri Lanka Press Institute (SLPI) in the Ministry of Mass Media and Information is the nodal state agency for regulating the news media, while the Press Complaints Commission of Sri Lanka (PCCSL) is the nodal autonomous body mandated with regulation and, as the name suggests, official redressal of complaints against the news media.30 The news media in Sri Lanka, as an institution, is arguably undeveloped in terms of media regulations, policies and practices with continuing questions of autonomy and ethics (refer to Box 7 for key developments in the news media in Sri Lanka). Clear guidelines for media ethics and reporting have been developed and shared by the Editors Guild (refer to Annex C). While guidelines for HIV coverage and terminology have been developed, their poor dissemination has resulted in their lack of effectiveness. Media analysts also critique the state of journalism education in the country, citing its singular focus on technical skills for media production and the neglect of broader and critical foundations that can equip students with a sound understanding of media theory, frameworks and ethics critical to improving the functioning of journalism.31 box 7: key recent developments relating to media Autonomy in sri lanka: 1991: Government moved to introduce media commission to Sri Lanka. In response, the standing committee of journalists is formed by journalists and media personnel who see the Media Commission as a form of censorship. 1992: The first public meeting of the Standing Committee of Journalists as the Free media movement took place soon after a crackdown on an insurgency, when the media struggled to document the human rights abuses, including torture and murder, of insurgents. The FMM aimed to act as a platform for diverse viewpoints on the rights and responsibilities of the media community. 1998: the colombo declaration on media Freedom was signed by the FMM, the Editors Guild and the Newspaper Society of Sri Lanka.

This trend is not new: in February 1995, the Ravaya reported on an operation carried out on a person with HIV at the Colombo General Hospital. The newspaper alleged that the patient had bribed the doctors to carry out the operation, thereby creating the impression that those with HIV lack basic integrity, and have no right to medical treatment. Journalists have violated basic codes of ethics such as confidentiality and anonymity in reporting on HIV. For example, one newspaper reported the death of a child as a result of AIDS, providing details of her location, her parents\u2019 occupations, and the subsequent death of the second child \u2014 enough evidence for the community to easily identify them.33 Coverage on KAPs is even more negative and strident. Articles expressing fear or hatred of homosexuals and transsexuals appear regularly in the media, as noted by the CEDAW Shadow Report, especially among state-owned newspapers. An announcement from the Women\u2019s Support Group (WSG) of a conference for lesbians in July 1999, for example, met with fierce public opposition. One of these protests came in the form of a letter to the editor published in The Island, which advocated the rape of conference participants by convicted rapists. The complaint filed against this letter was dismissed with the Press Council, the government body mandated with redressal of complaints, condemning lesbianism as \u201csadistic and salacious\u201d.34 32 Signatories included the Sri Lanka Press Institute, the Press Complaints Commission of Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka College of Journalism, the Newspaper Society of Sri Lanka, the Free Media Movement, the Sri Lanka Working Journalists Association, the Sri Lanka Tamil Media Alliance, the Sri Lanka Muslim Media Forum, the Federation of Media Employees Trade Union, and the South Asian Free Media Association \u2013 Sri Lanka Chapter. 33 Centre for Policy Alternatives (July 2007).

The caption read: Rivira camera lens captured this picture of the members of the homosexual organization \u2018Companions on a Journey\u2019 while they were distributing condoms and \u2018Easy Glide\u2019 lubricants to homosexuals, near the public toilet in front of the Cargills building in Fort. The journalist had posed as a gay man seeking CoJ services ostensibly in the interest of \u2018investigative journalism.\u2019 The article attacked CoJ as an organization promoting homosexuality with the funding of international agencies, and elaborated: \u201cAccording to Sri Lankan Penal Code, the homosexual act is a grave offence. Let alone the legal background, such an act is an unacceptable sexual relationship, shunned by the majority of people in our country. But some organizations in this country have come under the influence of dollars of international NGOs, and in the guise of HIV prevention activities, try to safeguard this unacceptable sexual relationship, promote it, and provide a legal environment conducive to it.\u201d Providing the name and addresses of CoJ\u2019s offices, the article highlighted the fact that they were located near primary and secondary schools, thus endangering the lives of young children. It urged parents to protect their children from the homosexuals working at CoJ, thereby equating homosexuality with paedophilia, a common misconception in Sri Lanka. CoJ was forced to close down its offices immediately and suspend its HIV prevention activities under Round 9 of the Global Fund grant for HIV. Over the next few weeks, Rivira continued its campaign in the form of a series of articles that presented the detrimental effects of \u2018promoting\u2019 homosexuality in Sri Lanka. Both CoJ and the National STD/AIDS Control Programme (NSACP), the government\u2019s nodal agency for HIV, were in the line of fire. \u201cCompanions on a Journey institution plays a powerful role in the STD/AIDS Control programme implemented under the Ministry of Health. A senior official stated that since the Health Ministry does not have programmes to directly reach prostitutes and people with homosexual behaviour, they obtain the support of various NGOs. Although this is the opinion of health officials, what happens is the increase of homosexuals. If condoms are distributed by NGOs for AIDS prevention, we would like to ask health officials whether Easy Glide is distributed to eat. It is by using this situation that the institute called \u2018Companions on a Journey\u2019, which calls for the legalization of homosexuality in this country, escapes the net of the law and continues their course of actions well.

The list included leading newspapers such as Daily News, Dinamina and Thinakaran (refer to Annex B for a list of papers included in the database). A team of 6 researchers (2 per language) reviewed and compiled articles related to the relevant KAPs in the chosen newspapers. Data was gathered manually and entered into Microsoft Excel and Epi Info. Key words and phrases used to select articles across all languages included variations of HIV, AIDS, sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender, sex work, prostitution, brothel, massage parlour, homosexual, gay, drugs, drug user, drug addict, ganja, heroin, and injecting drugs. Data was analysed based on the following format: 1. volume or the number of articles with one or more of the relevant search words. 2. Placement of the article within specific sections of the newspaper (such as the front page, or Business, Health or Society). This was an important criterion, indicative of its importance and how the publication wants to communicate the issue to its readers. 3. location of the story (national or international). This was an important factor in the analysis, indicating the interest and ability of the newspaper to carry local coverage on these topics or its dependence on wire services for international news. 4. Format of the article. This was an important factor in determining the scope of the coverage possible within specific formats such as news, feature, and editorial. While news reports, by definition, simply report events considered \u2018news\u2019, features allow for more in-depth, complex and nuanced writing, while editorials and columns serve as space for the publication to express its editorial opinion and advocate for specific actions. 5. content of story. This was another level of analysis and was examined through five sub-categories: \u2018HIV/health programme and services\u2019; \u2018socio-cultural issues and personal stories\u2019; \u2018law enforcement\u2019; \u2018sexuality\u2019; and \u2018stigma and discrimination\u2019. 6. kAPs covered.

In some cases, where percentages are misleading because the data set is too small, both percentages and data have been provided. Findings from the content analysis 1. volume of coverage In total, the analysis found a total of 2440 articles on HIV, KAPs and related issues during the time period for the content analysis. Of these, the Sinhala media had the most number of articles (1545), followed by English (562) and Tamil (333). Because only three Tamil newspapers were included in the database, in contrast to seven each for English and Sinhala, cross-language comparisons in terms of percentages are not possible; however, it was clear that the Sinhala press was the frontrunner in terms of volume of coverage in relation to the English media. Four of the 17 newspapers belonged to the government-owned media house, the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd group42, which accounted for 479 articles. A bulk of the coverage (40.8%) was in the Sinhala press, followed by the English press (38.8%) and Tamil press (20.4%). In the English press, coverage was maximum in the Island (39%) followed by the Daily News (24%). Among Sinhala papers, Divaina (31%) was followed closely by Lankadeepa (29.7%); while in the Tamil media, Veerakesari (41%) was followed by Thinakural (35.8%). Figure 1: volume of coverage across languages 23+63+14 2. location of coverage The location of the stories provides some indication of the priority accorded to HIV coverage by the newspapers. Most of the articles (1545 or 63%) were datelined Sri Lanka, indicating a stronger focus on coverage from within the country (refer to Graph 2 below which shows the location source matched to coverage in each language). Of the 41 articles on MSM, there was an almost equal division between national and international stories (20 and 21 respectively); in the case of transgender people, the corresponding figures are 2 and 42 Daily News, Sunday Observer, Dinamina and Thinakaran English Sinhala Tamil 1545 333 562 cH 4.

The low coverage of MSM and TG overall, and from within the country, perhaps suggests insufficient programming with these groups, coupled with, inadequate media attention to these issues. Of the coverage that focused on female sex workers, a majority (315 or 91%) was from within Sri Lanka; for PLHIV, 78 stories or 63% were national coverage. All 1920 articles on people who use drugs were sourced from within the country.

Placement of Articles The placement of stories in specific sections of the newspaper plays a huge role in determining how these stories are framed and understood.

When cross-analysing the placement of stories with coverage of KAPs, it was found that a majority of stories in the Crime section was on people who use drugs (1839 or 91 %), followed by FSWs (177 or 8.8 %); most of these stories were on brothel raids, arrests and crackdowns on drug cartels. Coverage in the Society section focused primarily on FSWs (140 or 50.7%) followed by PLHIV (59 or 21.4%) and PWUD (51 or 18.5%). In the Health Section, a majority (27 or 64.3%) focused on people who use drugs. The bulk of the coverage on MSM (21 or 51.2%) and TG (5 or 41.7%) was in the Society section, while the Crime section featured four stories on MSM and the Health section one for each of these groups.

Format of Articles This was an important criterion for the analysis since different formats within the newspaper provide very different opportunities and scope for news media coverage. Different formats identified include advertisements, columns, features, editorials and news reports. The bulk of the coverage (2267) was in the form of brief daily news reports, followed by features trailing way behind at 135. Columns and editorials together added up to only 12. Cross-analysis of formats and KAPs suggests that reports were by far (93%) the main format for coverage on all KAPs, with PWUDs accounting for 82% of this coverage. FSW had the maximum coverage in terms of columns/editorials (7 of a total of 12) which are crucial platforms for analysis and advocacy. The bulk of the features (47) coverage was devoted to PLHIV, while the majority of front-page articles (22 out of 24) were on people who use drugs. The high preponderance of daily reports \u2014 an undifferentiated mass of news on arrests, raids and crackdowns \u2014 juxtaposed with the low volume of articles in the form of features is disappointing, given that the latter is a valuable space for more in-depth, nuanced and human interest stories that provide a human face to the epidemic and KAPs. Similarly, the few examples of columns and editorials indicate that this platform, which can potentially play a critical role in facilitating informed debate and advocacy on HIV and KAPs, is severely underutilized.

Moreover, a bulk of the coverage focused on middlemen and drug dealers rather than the users per se. For example, only 11% of coverage on heroin was on heroin users, with the figure being 21% in the case of ganja. The disproportionate focus on people who use drugs can be clearly seen not as a concern about HIV but due to their criminal activities with the police serving as a key source for such coverage. Coverage of MSM and transgender people was particularly low, despite the high prevalence of HIV among MSM.44 Articles on MSM included local sub-groups such as beach boys and male sex workers. Low levels of mobilization and programming for MSM and TG, and their limited engagement with the media is a possible reason for this low volume of coverage. kAPs covered and location of coverage With the exception of MSM and TG, most of the coverage of KAPs was from within Sri Lanka. In the case of MSM, coverage was almost equally divided between national and international datelines (21 and 20 respectively), and in the case of transgender people, 10 of the 12 articles had international datelines. The low coverage of MSM and transgender people could be indicative of several things: the low visibility of these groups in the public domain, an insufficient focus in the national programme on these groups, and their poor community mobilization, and a resulting lack of advocacy. A majority of articles on FSW (315) and PLHIV (78), and all the articles on people who use drugs, are set in Sri Lanka, and are mostly focused on brothel raids, arrests and crackdowns on drug rings. Figure 6: coverage of kAPs 14+2+5+78+1 44 The analysis used behaviour and identity as key criteria in determining if articles were to be classified under MSM or TG. If the article focused on behaviour, it was classified as MSM, and under TG if it focused on transsexual gender and identity. FSW MSM PLHIV PWUD TG 78.7% 14.1% 1.7% 5.0% 0.5% cH 4. Findings From tHe content AnAlysis 36 Stigma, diScrimination and Key affected populationS: Strengthening the role of media advocacy in Sri lanKa through critical analySiS of newS media coverage kAPs covered and section Placements As indicated earlier, PWUDs received the maximum coverage overall, with a bulk of the coverage in the Crime section (1839 or 95% of the total coverage on PWUDs). PWUDs were also the primary group covered in the Health section (27 of 42 articles). FSWs were the second most common KAP appearing in the Crime section with 177 articles, which accounted for 51% of all coverage on FSW. Of the 276 articles in the Society section, a majority (140) were focused on FSWs, followed by PLHIV (59 or 21%) and PWUD (51 or 18%). The majority of the coverage on MSM (21 of 41 stories, or 51%) was in the Society section; similarly, in the case of transgender people, a bulk of the coverage (five of the total 12 stories) was in the Society section. Of the 12 editorials/opinion pieces, four were on PLHIV, three each on MSM and PWUD, and two on FSW. Only one article featured on the front pages, and that was focused on PLHIV. kAPs covered and \u2018voice\u2019 By looking at direct or indirect quotes, the study examined whose voice is primarily represented in the stories, since this plays a significant role in the overall perspective or slant of the article. Not all articles had quotations, but of the total number of quotes found, the police was the primary voice in over 43% of the articles, followed by KAPs (18%), and civil society (15%).

The article also published photographs of those arrested along with their names, with no thought to informed consent or confidentiality, the cornerstones of ethical journalistic reportage, especially in the context of HIV. Articles in the \u2018socio-cultural and personal stories\u2019 category were 28 in number or 8% of all stories on female sex workers, of which more than half were located internationally. Among these were reports of well-known personalities \u2018caught\u2019 as it were, with sex workers, providing salaciousness typical of such coverage. For example, \u2018David Beckham reappeals court case against woman who claimed he paid for sex\u2019 (Daily News, 21 January 2012). Local stories portrayed betrayal and deception on an unimaginable scale: \u2018Child and 9 women sent to National Child Protection Authority\u2019 (Lankadeepa, 24 Nov 2011) and \u2018Mother sells daughters into prostitution\u2019 (The Island, 30 June 2012), alongside the shock value of students leading double lives as sex workers (Leisure and Living section, The Island, 8 January 2012). Despite the high prevalence of HIV among female sex workers, only six stories were classified in the \u2018HIV/health programmes and services\u2019 category; again, despite the discrimination and rights violations confronting this group on a daily basis, there were only two stories on cases of stigma and discrimination affecting this group.

The analysis was conducted at two levels: cH 4. Findings From tHe content AnAlysis 38 Stigma, diScrimination and Key affected populationS: Strengthening the role of media advocacy in Sri lanKa through critical analySiS of newS media coverage 1. First, the study looked at representations across four categories: \u2022\ufffd criminal if the KAPs/their behaviours focused on the illegal aspects of the behaviour leading to arrests, raids, crackdowns or being taken to court. \u2022\ufffd victim if the KAPs were presented as lacking any choice or agency in deciding the course of their lives. This was especially evident in the case of female sex workers and PLHIV, the latter being described as \u2018patients\u2019 who have little hope of leading normal lives and who face a death sentence, in contrast to the view in other countries of HIV as a condition that can be \u2018managed\u2019. \u2022\ufffd immoral if the KAPs\u2019 behaviours and choices were seen as running counter to the social norms and values of Sri Lankan society.47 This was especially relevant to MSM, TG and FSWs. \u2022\ufffd Positive, empowered if the articles positioned KAPs as having dignity and basic human rights in their practise of alternative sexual or other behaviours, and that they lead normal lives. 2. Second, the study looked at the overall treatment of the story in terms of headlines, the nature of the headlines, where and how the stories are positioned within a newspaper, the choice of words and phrases in the story, and visual imagery such as photographs and illustrations. These provide subtle but powerful clues to deeply engrained beliefs and values, social norms and behaviours (refer to Box 8 below). msm and transgender People The coverage on MSM focused overwhelmingly on the \u2018immoral\u2019 nature of their behaviours (19 stories or 46.3%). Homosexuality is described in these articles as \u2018unnatural\u2019, \u2018against nature\u2019 and \u2018against religions,\u2019 and MSMs are referred to as \u2018sexual weirdoes\u2019 and \u2018shameless\u2019. Not surprisingly, of the seven articles which portray MSMs as \u2018positive, empowered\u2019, six are internationally datelined, and discuss same-sex rights in a context where homosexuality is not criminalized. examples of Positive coverage It should be noted that the analysis did reveal instances of positive, nuanced and humanizing coverage, though they were few in number. To cite some examples of stories that seek to inform and educate readers: reportage on the tussle between the Health Ministry and the provinces over a move to introduce reproductive health education in schools; a positive feature on LGBTs coming together for a sports competition (5 December 2010, Sunday Leader), and a detailed Sunday Leader two-page feature examining the issue of sex work from various frameworks \u2014 moral, legal, cultural, feminist \u2014 which was noteworthy in its efforts to provide readers with sufficient information to form an informed opinion. There were also a number of human interest articles: a personal story focused on Elton John\u2019s surrogate child, \u2018New Baby for Elton\u2019 (Daily Mirror, 28 Jan 2011), which talks about same-sex couples, surrogacy and adoption in the United Kingdom. Other examples include \u2018The Life Journey of a Sexual Rights Activist, Upeksha\u2019 (The Sunday Leader, 15 May 2011), a positive and empowering story of a lesbian\u2019s coming to terms with her sexual preferences, and her struggles and growth as an activist; while \u2018My story: the gay movement in Sri Lanka\u2019 by Sherman Anthony de Rose (Sunday Leader, 8 May 2011) is another portrayal of struggle and resilience. These personal testimonials by representatives of KAPs are humanising and uplifting, rare among overwhelmingly negative representation. 47 This negative category is different from the criminal category because it is especially focused on \u2018moral\u2019 dimensions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bfce2743-6989-4460-81ab-7daa1056ca0e": {"__data__": {"id_": "bfce2743-6989-4460-81ab-7daa1056ca0e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Stigma, Discrimination and Key Affected Populations: Strengthening the Role of Media Advocacy in Sri Lanka through a Critical Analysis of News Media Coverage", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b91432a8ad173214efbe7ff6878b13c81a48b7b89b76b35c068d68e67990cb4b"}, "2": {"node_id": "782fd54e-f64a-4199-88c2-ca1a212f9a6d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4840f1e8081b939911dc64d960f548fa80563a31e0f349de944f2bed6729495"}}, "hash": "5cb16d9938a01211a149db20eecd3fede0eb700ad8a137928d0340ff3cac96a9", "text": "39 Figure 7: representation of kAPs across different categories 48 1900 1850 1800 200 150 100 50 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 5 28 19 3 3 3 56 47 3 4 0 18 37 7 45 152 112 1850 Not Available Victim Immortal Empowered Criminal A feature headlined \u2018Strange boys that pleasure tourists\u2019 (Irida Lankadeepa, 15 Aug 2010) mentions young transgender males in the context of sex work; however, because this was presented as behaviour rather than as an issue of gender identity, the article was classified under MSM.

While it is entirely possible that these stories are carried, in true tabloid style, to highlight something bizarre about society, given the relative dearth of serious coverage on HIV, they do seem to typify a certain attitude on the part of journalists towards key affected populations. This problematizing results in a conflation of MSM with paedophilia: in a first example, triggered by an alleged case of child sexual abuse, a commentary on MSM behaviour linked it to paedophilia, and warned readers to be careful since the incident was located close to schools: \u2018Sexual abuse: police initiate enquiries\u2019 (Daily Mirror, 8 January 2011).

Headlines were a give-away of the nature of the stories, with \u2018brothel raided\u2019 a common description: \u2018Brothel raided\u2019 (The Island, 8 June 2010) and \u2018Brothel raided, 3 quizzed\u2019 (Sunday Observer, 25 September 2011). Other headlines read \u2018Prostitution house captured: 4 women arrested\u2019 (Thinakkural, 9 August 2010); \u20185 people including 3 girls arrested for sex work\u2019 (Veerakesari, 25 Nov 2011); \u2018Brothel raided, 5 arrested\u2019 (Lankadeepa, 13 December 2011); and \u2018Brothel raided, 3 young girls netted\u2019 (Divaina, 3 October 2011). The dominant theme of female sex workers as criminals was followed by their portrayal as victims (112 or 33%) with little agency or choice in their destinies. In these stories, FSWs are consistently tricked or forced into \u2018prostitution\u2019 (note the use of this term instead of the more neutral \u2018sex work\u2019, indicative of the media\u2019s judgmental attitude or ignorance towards this group): \u2018Women sent to Singapore for prostitution\u2019 (Dinamina, 1 September 2010). Another article conflates love outside marital confines with the danger of prostitution, thus further reinforcing traditional taboos. \u2018Love has made girlfriend get into prostitution, lover and 3 friends remanded\u2019 (Divaina, 20 August 2010). Within this framework, FSWs are sometimes portrayed as synonymous with HIV: \u2018Curtailing prostitution and preventing AIDS\u2019 (Sunday Leader, 18 December 2011). Persistently and unremittingly, the stories weave a Grand Narrative of \u2018prostitution\u2019 as a world of deception, force, violence, crime, immorality \u2014 and HIV.

This focus on criminalization is also evident in the fact that only 297 (15.5%) of all articles on people who use drugs were actually about people who use drugs, with the rest focused on middlemen and drug dealers. Of these, most (93%) were news reports of police enforcement. People who use drugs are portrayed as hardened criminals, junkies and petty thieves, with no distinction made between drug use and drug addiction. The only solution to this issue of drug use that is presented in the articles is abstinence; the concept of harm reduction is an alien concept. 41 A Positive editorial Within a landscape of incorrect, negative and fiercely stigmatizing coverage, mention must be made of a positive and progressive editorial titled \u2018Vagrancy, brothels and prostitution and laws against the poor\u2019 (Daily Mirror, 17 April 2011). The editorial critiques the legislation that allows arbitrary arrests of sex workers, describing it as a throwback to \u2018Victorian times\u2019 and advocating that it be reviewed and amended. As editorial such as this one provides valuable opportunities for informed debate on sensitive subjects, and others like it need to be encouraged.49 PlHiv A bulk of the media coverage (45 or 37%) on PLHIV was in the \u2018positive, empowered\u2019 category; however, a closer examination reveals that the articles were not so much about people and families affected by HIV as much as they are about events such as World AIDS Day and the launch of a new NSACP programme. Commonly occurring words include \u2018unprotected sex\u2019, \u2018discrimination\u2019, \u2018sex workers\u2019, \u2018homosexuals\u2019 and \u2018treatment\u2019 \u2014 and of course \u2018AIDS\u2019 and \u2018AIDS patient\u2019 (especially in headlines), despite years of efforts to change terminology from \u2018patient\u2019 to person living with HIV. The choice of stories from international locations reflects how the Sri Lankan media wants to position HIV. For example, an article headlined \u2018AIDS patients are eating cow shit before they take the pill due to lack of food\u2019 (Veerakesari, 29 July 2011 as picked up from the Irin Plus News, 28 July 2011), talks about the desperate measures of PLHIV during the financial crisis in Swaziland. Given the dearth of overall coverage on PLHIV, this choice of an article from another country demonstrates an inclination towards the negative positioning of HIV. It is interesting also to note that the original English report, translated into Tamil, uses the term HIV which was then changed to AIDS. Of all articles on PLHIV, 34 of them or 27.9% portray them as victims, reflecting the general perception of society. Especially common are portrayals of women infected by their husbands (and who are therefore \u2018innocent victims\u2019), and children with HIV due to vertical transmission. These articles are written in a manner designed to evoke sympathy and even pity, as opposed to articles that blame and shame PLHIV. In terms of representation of PLHIV, there is a more even split, with 34% (41 articles) having negative representations of PLHIV and 32.8% (40) which contain positive representations. overall representation across positive, negative and neutral categories In order to arrive at the \u2018big picture\u2019 of how KAPs are represented, the study analysed the representations across three basic categories \u2014 positive, negative, and neutral (refer to Figure 8 below). 49 Efforts were made to identify any follow up letters/responses to this editorial but information was not available cH 4.

Juxtaposed alongside these are images of several uniformed policemen, icons of power and respectability [8]. As in the case of all coverage that focuses on the criminal aspects of KAPs, the police emerge as primary voices (43%) both visually and textually, the long arm of the state restoring law, order and morality. 50 By way of explanation, one of the editors interviewed for this study suggests this was a default option, to circumvent guidelines forbidding use of pictures of local FSWs without informed consent. However, semi-structured interviews indicated this might have also stemmed from the perception that sex work and homosexuality are Western trends and influences in danger of corrupting traditional Sri Lankan culture. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 cH 4. Findings From tHe content AnAlysis 44 Stigma, diScrimination and Key affected populationS: Strengthening the role of media advocacy in Sri lanKa through critical analySiS of newS media coverage conclusions The Content Analysis covered a wide and difficult terrain, revealing as many insights as challenges, chiefly to do with language and translations of articles. However, notwithstanding these limitations, the analysis provided some valuable findings: 1. An overwhelming pattern in the coverage was the invisibilization and problematizing of msm and transgender people; as well as the conflation of msm with \u2018corrupt\u2019 western influences. The volume of coverage of MSM was extremely low, despite the fact that MSM account for almost half the HIV prevalence in the country. There was a preponderance of MSM coverage in the Society sections, with representations of homosexuality and transsexuality as a social problem, a Western fetish threatening the social fabric. Some coverage conflated MSM with paedophilia. Coverage of MSM was almost equally divided between national and internationally datelined stories, while 10 of the 12 stories on transgender people were international. The use of international stories could suggest several things: the low levels of national programming and advocacy with these groups, and their attendant low visibility in the public domain, or the limited engagement of this group with the media. On the positive side, internationally datelined articles also increase the possibility of more positive, multidimensional coverage on this severely stigmatized group with several human interest stories, such as Elton John having a baby through a surrogate, as well as debates on issues such as same-sex marriage.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5905609a-329c-4d61-9b95-e871ede2e15c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5905609a-329c-4d61-9b95-e871ede2e15c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Stigma, Discrimination and Key Affected Populations: Strengthening the Role of Media Advocacy in Sri Lanka through a Critical Analysis of News Media Coverage", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5de8aeddcbd62b569e1f3d51b59c7a975dbbc0a2bfa03fccb7f540900bb0dbcb"}, "2": {"node_id": "e9042172-1b9d-4f4d-a949-972c2b521b19", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68de06dfdf17c457ae75810348c1d3356bd57a39e0af62420d6ea39e321cd525"}}, "hash": "63e35e78a384dc45cadc0df55da9b63415e4b36c0073fac8729f6b630ada5d20", "text": "2. the analysis revealed that the predominant coverage of Hiv and kAPs was on Pwuds, together with an excessive focus on criminalization, despite the low contribution of this group to the HIV transmission dynamics in the country.

The content and visual imagery of these reports set drug use within a world of vice and crime with the police acting as the long arm of the law restoring order and morality. 3. In terms of agenda setting, the content analysis suggests that the media\u2019s role with regard to supporting Hiv prevention and the human rights of kAPs has been extremely limited. On the contrary, the media has mostly reflected and further perpetuated the prevailing stigmatization and criminalization of these groups. 45 Findings from the Semi-Structured Interviews While the Content Analysis reflects the direct experience of media coverage of KAPs, in order to gain a more holistic understanding of the issue, this study also conducted semi-structured interviews (SSIs) with a range of over 25 stakeholders representing government bodies, NGOs, KAPs and the media (refer to Annex A for a complete list of stakeholders interviewed). The discussions provided a wide and vastly divergent landscape of experiences and perspectives on the role of media with regard to HIV, while also identifying key challenges and recommendations for strengthening the quality and quantity of media coverage in this domain. i. trends and Patterns Overall, most stakeholders believed that the low volume of media coverage on HIV was a direct result of the low prevalence of HIV and consequent limited programming in the country. In addition, as many journalists pointed out, health and HIV are low priorities for a media industry that is driven today mostly by politics and business. Most stakeholders felt that in recent years there was a slight, barely perceptible shift in the terminology used, especially in the English-language press. This was especially true in the case of national HIV-related events (such as the release of the National AIDS Policy) where press releases have been issued by the Health Ministry and the NSACP, thus reducing the scope for erroneous or negative terminology in these instances. Some stakeholders believe that the typical focus of coverage is narrow with HIV framed mostly as a medical issue with attendant coverage on treatment, care and support programmes. Misplaced notions of morality ensure that discussion on sex and sexuality \u2014 even within health columns \u2014 is rejected and replaced by frivolous \u2018lifestyle\u2019-reporting presenting MSM as rich playboys frequenting gay sex parties, and \u2018expos\u00e9s\u2019 on students leading double lives as sex workers. Dr Tudor Weerasinghe (Rector, Faculty of Journalism, Sripali Campus, University of Colombo) points to the irony of \u201carticles clarifying myths and misconceptions on HIV running parallel to stigmatizing stories on PLHIV and MSM.\u201d Several respondents believe that the media coverage simply mirrors traditional popular perceptions of \u2018Sri Lankan culture\u2019 which is equated with a hetero-normative framework, and one that that is strongly grounded in traditional Buddhist culture. Any variation from this, such as homosexual or transsexual behaviour and identities, is regarded as immoral and deviant, and justifiably ends with a tragic conclusion. In this framework, AIDS is portrayed as punishment for those who have erred and strayed away from prescribed moral paths. Coverage of MSM and transgender people is variously described by stakeholders as being \u201cbrutal and violent,\u201d representing \u201cthe dark side of society, one populated by vagabonds and wasters.\u201d Coverage of MSM in particular was problematic. Kumari from the organization Lanka Plus believes that MSM are presented as \u201cparasites, feeding off our culture. The media has a hateful attitude towards the gay community, it\u2019s scary and cruel. This is something that even an average citizen shouldn\u2019t do, leave alone the media. It\u2019s all about \u2018exposing\u2019 the community.\u201d Contextualizing this skewed representation, Upali Saram (Editor, Divaina) points out, \u201cWe haven\u2019t provided enough scientific evidence and perspective to understand and legitimize alternative sexual behaviours and identities, such as that of MSM and TG.\u201d Sunil Jayasekere, the Convenor of the Free Media Movement, echoes the same view: \u201cThere\u2019s an absence of university studies and research from within Sri Lanka that can be reported in the media, and pushes our thinking on these issues.\u201d For example, the issue of choice vs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86be2c7d-8a97-41b1-9647-fd4a59c36585": {"__data__": {"id_": "86be2c7d-8a97-41b1-9647-fd4a59c36585", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Stigma, Discrimination and Key Affected Populations: Strengthening the Role of Media Advocacy in Sri Lanka through a Critical Analysis of News Media Coverage", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c7107fa0f40b44e5dda9bbf1994044ae3a8705e6a5d69852d390fcf3544e416"}, "2": {"node_id": "fc7dd9bd-0ba1-4d53-998c-04408d8fdf31", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a7a2ff348f092b9aa6dcfe2a7d70580e8118336679640b852a61c2c5fdec46c"}}, "hash": "f0c1a723e9db8e93978a21820fb6de9e85ae9b2f134b952e725e9210823c1ce0", "text": "force, which has occupied a central and contentious position within discourse on sex work, would be a useful debate to be covered in mainstream news media. cHAPter 5 cH 5.

This is the underbelly of life in Sri Lanka, a life that newspaper readers don\u2019t often personally encounter, but experience vicariously through the newspapers. \u2018Investigative journalism\u2019 and \u2018expos\u00e9s\u2019 then become the guise for sensationalistic journalism that violates basic journalistic ethics. Citing an example, Sampath Samarakoon (Centre for Policy Alternatives), describes the coverage of a particular journalist who \u201csupposedly befriends sex workers \u2014 only to write about how bad their lives and characters are.\u201d The frequent interaction between the police and crime reporters is another crucial factor for the abundant and negative coverage on KAPs in the crime sections. \u201cAbout a year ago the police asked all papers to publish pictures of some supposed porn stars; thankfully, only one paper followed suit, but the fact that they did, shows that we have an extremely hypocritical press with relation to sex,\u201d notes Samarakoon. Within this landscape, brothel raids, arrests and crackdowns on drug dens and sex \u2018rackets\u2019 become the primary representation of KAPs, especially people who use drugs and sex workers, whose voices are rarely represented within the coverage. \u201cThere is never any analysis or background to put a human face to these arrests, to understand the underlying causes,\u201d notes Kamal Liyanarachchi, (Director, Press Complaints Commission of Sri Lanka (PCCSL, the nodal independent agency responsible for media monitoring and redressal). The \u2018other\u2019 is typified by negative, stock stereotypes and whose identity is equated with criminal behaviours. For example, all beach boys are viewed as sex workers; MSM and transgender people are immediately conflated with paedophiles and child abusers (a recent article in The Island by a well- known and respected counsellor was cited as an example); and sex workers are the tragic victims of trafficking and violence, with little agency or choice in their destinies. PLHIV are sick and dying \u2018patients\u2019 and HIV is a death sentence, not a life condition like diabetes that has to be managed. A representative from Positive Hopes Alliance, a PLHIV network, corroborates this media perspective based on personal experience. \u201cJournalists want to photograph the thinnest parts of my body; they want people to feel sad about us and pity us.\u201d This positioning of HIV as a punishment for sins is deliberate, rather than inadvertent, observes K. Janaranjana (Editor, Ravaya). \u201cIt is their express intention\u201d to induce fear into the readers in order to deter them from straying away from prescribed norms. A related point, as some noted, was the dependence on the same community voices in the media coverage, thus limiting the divergence of perspectives from the community. For example, Princey Mangalika, an HIV positive woman is often quoted in the Tamil/Sinhala press, which may reflect the overall unwillingness of PLHIV to be publicly represented. In another example, in coverage of the campaign to repeal section 365A of the Sri Lankan Penal Code that criminalizes homosexuality, the same visible community advocates are used every time. NGOs and KAPs felt that divergent viewpoints and the absence of a sense of unity among KAPs were other reasons for ineffective engagement with the media. Roshan de Silva from Ceylon Today and Niluka Perera from Diversity and Solidarity Trust (DAST) cite the example of the Rivira episode as a case in point. \u201cEveryone in the community started fighting and name calling. There was absolutely no unity, so we couldn\u2019t get together to respond at all, let alone complain to the press.\u201d ii. underlying issues and challenges 1. Poor quality of journalism overall, and poor awareness of media ethics While the experiences of most NGO and KAPs with the media paint a grim picture, journalists and media analysts provide a perspective that helps place these issues in a larger context.

Janaranjana, Editor, Ravaya Publications, notes: \u201cThe fact is that journalists often think they know everything; they don\u2019t like to learn anything new.\u201d In order to build the long-term capacity of journalists, the Sri Lanka College of Journalism has a class on Media Law and Ethics in the first semester, and a class on \u2018Special Topics\u2019 in the third semester. The Special Topics presents an opportunity for focusing on social issues requiring a different approach to reporting; to date, modules have been conducted on gender, violence, drug abuse and post-conflict issues but none yet on HIV or KAPs. Anuradha Herath (Director, Sri Lanka College of Journalism) cites the constraints: \u201cWe take our cues from the industry, where politics and business reign, not health or HIV.\u201d 2. media advocacy efforts of development agencies \u2014 ad hoc, fragmented Over the last few years, NGOs and UN bodies have attempted to engage with the news media on HIV and issues related to KAPs. However, these efforts have been ad hoc and fragmented. Requests made to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry for Mass Media and Information to take ownership and provide leadership to these media advocacy efforts have not yielded any results. Moreover, these efforts are stymied by the lack of involvement of senior journalists and decision- makers. For example, workshops are attended only by young journalists who have no decision-making powers to influence their media houses. Senior editors seem particularly recalcitrant to engage with these issues, an attitude, some believe comes from a common \u2018know-all\u2019 position. Further, the high turnover of journalists and editors challenge any long-term sustained effort. Revathi Chawla (National Programme Officer, HIV and Youth, UNFPA) mentions a regular paid Question\u2013Answer column on sexuality in a women\u2019s magazine in Sinhala and English that they had initiated around 2004\u2013 05. Unfortunately due to a change of editors, this was discontinued. Media guidelines and glossaries with recommended terminology have been effective in improving coverage in other countries. However, none of the stakeholders were aware of or had seen such guidelines in Sri Lanka.51 C. Dodawatha (Training Officer, Associated Newspapers of Ceylon, a government-owned media house) urged that if these guidelines do exist, someone in the HIV sector needs to take leadership and share them effectively with the media. However, stakeholders such as Dr. Weerasinghe and others question the value of such codes and guidelines. \u201cThere are so many codes\u2026 including those reporting on politics and the war, but there is no practical application of [them].\u201d In a media culture which is really a business that is all about \u2018sell, sell, sell\u2019, the rights of minorities are bound to be violated, he says, indicating that self-regulation by the media is the only sustainable option. Another critical issue is the choice of spokespersons, and the incorrect and misleading statements made by public figures, says Nehama Jayawardene (Women\u2019s Support Group (WSG)), an observation echoed by Chawla. As examples, Jayawardene cites a column in The Island by a well-known and respected counsellor in Sri Lanka which equated same-sex behaviour with a disorder like paedophilia; and a Health Minister who declared that there are no lesbians and gays in Sri Lanka.

NGOs and KAPs also lack knowledge of and capacity to work with bodies that handle media complaints. The SSI discussions brought into sharp focus the conflicts between NGOs and the media. Many NGO and KAPs reported on their efforts to engage with media by placing stories with them and providing interviews. However, experiences abound of being misquoted and misrepresented, or information critical to a report \u2014 such as the contact information for a positive network \u2014 being omitted. Letters to editors pointing out inaccurate, negative coverage are never published; phone calls are never taken or returned. While such concerns are legitimate, discussions revealed that NGOs representing KAPs lack basic knowledge of how the media actually works, their constraints, and their code of ethics. Nor were they aware of their right to complain about coverage and the process for such complaints. Only a few had heard of the PCCSL, and none had ever filed an official complaint.52 Jake Oorloff, Sakhi Collaboration, voiced concerns about the lack of a designated person within an NGO or KAP group to talk to the media; he also noted the time involved in redressal. Some positive networks were under the misconception that complaints should be redressed by the Ministry of Health via the NSACP. Very few, if any, NGOs or members of KAPs have ever entered a newsroom; yet, there is a complete lack of recognition of their own limitations in working with the media. Lakshman was the only NGO stakeholder to clearly indicate that they need capacity-building for working with the media. It is also noteworthy that in addition to poor knowledge of the news media, many KAPs and NGOs were ignorant of important HIV programme-related documents directly relevant to their concerns \u2014 such as the National AIDS Policy. This lack of awareness was prevalent even among senior NGO staff, who seemed only vaguely aware of relevant programmes and policy documents, and had not participated in any shared discussions on them. This lack of political awareness must be addressed. 52 The only exception was Roshan De Silva from DAST who called the PCCSL to complain about an advertisement in the paper promising a cure for HIV. Because there was no breach of confidentiality or privacy, the PCCSL advised them to contact the Medical Council instead. 49 Underlying this diffidence and disempowerment is the high levels of stigma within communities. For example, even among MSM, those who are HIV-positive are stigmatized within their own communities. Many of them are reluctant to even identify themselves as MSM, as either homosexual or bisexual, which makes mobilization and organization on the basis of sexual identity difficult. \u201cThey talk about their sexual preferences as if it\u2019s merely a fun activity, something they engaged in at school since there was no other option,\u201d observes Dissanayake. \u201cIf MSM themselves don\u2019t acknowledge their sexual behaviour, how can we expect the media to grasp the finer nuances, the greys?\u201d Community members indicate that the all-pervasive nature of stigma results in HIV projects themselves being stigmatized. \u201cStigma prevents us from speaking to the media, and at the same time it\u2019s stigma that we\u2019re trying to challenge \u2014 so it\u2019s a Catch 22,\u201d sums up one community representative. NGOs and KAP representatives also lack capacity or knowledge of how to launch complaints about inaccurate or damaging media coverage. For example, in the case of the Rivira episode, no complaints have ever been officially filed with the PCCSL. Several stakeholders indicated a feeling of helplessness, confusion and lack of understanding of why, despite several discussions and indications of support, an official letter of complaint was not filed with the PCCSL.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdb2f26a-8683-4a39-8e00-bb1f0d55ac07": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdb2f26a-8683-4a39-8e00-bb1f0d55ac07", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Stigma, Discrimination and Key Affected Populations: Strengthening the Role of Media Advocacy in Sri Lanka through a Critical Analysis of News Media Coverage", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11164d32d6f3539957caba3a95e8cf1bc4dca96f69b2078e0230209eb1216ada"}, "2": {"node_id": "988b297d-8ed7-423e-a03d-9fd2bfbec970", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/stigma-discrimination-and-key-affected-populations-strengthening-role-media-advocacy-sri-lanka-through-critical-analysis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b6c109d7542e9a30bea14ecad1f8cc51de22e20ed1c0ed66baaa38aa40f882d"}}, "hash": "c93fb1f00fbaaafb79bbc001dbd269551c35c808fd2ec097e5d0ba18cb47fb11", "text": "Liyanarachchi wryly notes, \u201cThe only complaint concerning the Rivira articles came from someone in Ratthanapitiya village who had taken offence because the location of the office of Companions on a Journey was recorded as Ratthanapitiya Walawwatta Road, and he wanted people to know that this had nothing to do with his village.

Typically, NGOs and KAPs expect the media to perform a responsible and educative role with regard to social issues, while the media itself perceives its role as an institution that needs to survive in a competitive, market-driven industry. Dodawatha is quick to dismiss idealistic expectations of media with a note of realism: \u201cNo one writes to educate the masses or to improve the lives of marginalized communities. We want to write stories that excite the public.\u201d He cites a recent story about someone who died in prison who was HIV positive, where everyone who shared the ward was ordered to be tested. \u201cThis is the kind of story that sells papers.\u201d NGOs and KAPs should recognize the pressure on media to generate \u2018interesting\u2019 news, and provide journalists with HIV stories with interesting angles so that they can be reported on in different sections of the paper such as business or politics, as well as health. While taking cognisance of market imperatives, other editors such as Saram underline the media\u2019s responsibility to provide information and report accurately (\u201cWhere else will they get it from?\u201d).

Those different from us also have a right to live in this society.\u201d Nehama Jayawardena of the Women\u2019s Support Group argues that the media discourse should be within a framework of \u2018rights\u2019, not morality: \u201cWhether you like it or not, people are going to have same-sex encounters, they are going to take drugs, they are going to have sex.\u201d So rather than sensationalize such stories, she believes the media should, within these contexts, provide information on safer sex, harm reduction and other HIV preventive behaviours. This is in keeping with global conventions outlining fundamental rights to information on sexual and reproductive health, and the media\u2019s crucial role in ensuring the protection of these rights. 4. Absence of a culture of citizens\u2019 rights The South Asia region, as in other parts of the world, is marked by the absence of a culture of citizen\u2019s rights; this is true for Sri Lanka as well. Few people are aware that they have rights as media consumers, points out Liyanarachchi.

However, Indira Hettiarchchi (HIV Officer, ILO) points out that this rapidly proliferating domain could present new problems and challenges in terms of the quality and control of the material. media Advocacy efforts for Hiv in sri lanka In an attempt in recent years to strengthen media coverage on HIV, different UN bodies and NGOs have launched initiatives such as media workshops. However, most of these workshops are attended by young journalists with no power to influence their larger media houses. In addition, the high turnover of journalists and the lack of institutionalization undermine the sustainability of these efforts. Currently, the Family Planning Association (FPA) of Sri Lanka conducts a session every quarter with about four journalists to talk about Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH), including HIV. At the same time, their pilot project, Hamunupitya, involves training of about 20 young journalists on SRH and HIV, with the aim that they will write and present these stories to the Ruhunu Sevaya radio station. FPA will review the stories to ensure their quality prior to their dissemination. The project is likely to be scaled up based on experience and learnings. Indira Hettiarchchi (HIV Officer, ILO) describes a three-month radio programme on HIV conducted in 2006 in partnership with the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC): \u201cWe even had people calling into the show from abroad and asking questions,\u201d she says, as proof of the reach and power of such mass media programming. 51 Bibliography Berger, A.A.

The intention of this publication is to draw high-level policy attention of governments, donors and other stakeholders to the issues associated with the impact of the recent fnancial crisis on people living with HIV and their households. The organization of the symposium would not have been possible without the close collaboration of our partners: Asian Develop- ment Bank (ADB), the Joint United Nations Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS), World Bank, the Global Fund Against Tuberculosis, AIDS and Malaria (GFATM), the Asia Pacifc Network of People Living with HIV (APN+) and the support of the ICAAP IX secretariat and the Government of Indonesia. Our thanks and gratitude to Dr. Christoph Benn, Director of External Relations and Partnerships, GFATM; and Jef O\u2019Malley, Director of HIV/AIDS Practice, UNDP; for chairing the symposium. We would like to gratefully acknowledge the contribution of the panelists and discussants: Dr. Debrework Zewdie, Director, Global HIV/AIDS Programme, World Bank; Prof. Chandra Yoga Aditama, Director General of Communicable Diseases, Ministry of Health, Indonesia; Ross McLeod, Consultant, ADB; Caitlin Wiesen, Regional HIV Practice Leader, UNDP Regional Centre for Asia and the Pacifc; G. Pramod Kumar, Senior Programme Advisor, UNDP Regional Centre for Asia and the Pacifc and Shiba Phurailatpam, Coordinator, Regional Coordinator, APN+ for their invaluable insight that made this event a success. The symposium and follow-up report was organized by the UNDP Regional HIV Practice team for Asia Pacifc under the leadership of Caitlin Wiesen. Special thanks to Pramod Kumar assisted by Bhagya Ratanayake, Ramaaya Salgado, Milinda Rajapaksha, Kumudari Nayantara and Durga Pulendran for coordinating the symposium and the production of this report; to Asha Krishnakumar for the initial draft and to Ian Mungall for the design and layout. 1 Background A glaring shortcoming in most of the analyses of the recent and ongoing financial crisis has been the lack of attention to its impact on people living with HIV (PLHIV) and their households. Already burdened by the severe socio-economic impact of AIDS-related illnesses and various forms of socio-economic ex- clusion, people living with HIV are among the most vulnerable to external shocks such as the financial crisis. In addition, the possibility of donors rolling back resources in the wake of the crisis worsens the situation as the AIDS programmes, most importantly treatment, in many countries in the region are largely dependent on donor funds. A recent World Bank/UNAIDS study1 concludes that a majority of countries will be forced to cut their HIV programmes as they are dependent on external sources of sup- port that will be reduced because of the crisis. In addition, depletion of available resources could result in a reduction of national budgets for prevention, care and treatment programmes. The most significant factor concerning the impact of the financial crisis on people living with HIV is that even during normal times they are under extreme socio-economic stress and vulnerability, as shown by relevant studies in the region2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "983df45c-869a-43b8-8dff-1f429ac17e33": {"__data__": {"id_": "983df45c-869a-43b8-8dff-1f429ac17e33", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/impact-financial-crisis-people-living-hiv-and-their-households-symposium-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Impact of the Financial Crisis on People Living with HIV and their Households - Symposium Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/impact-financial-crisis-people-living-hiv-and-their-households-symposium-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6524dc079eb9552a1620651770d564f6a9d5c9a10a972f7acc96d4a7692946cc"}, "2": {"node_id": "23852bed-c567-445f-ab4a-e1e27693b17f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/impact-financial-crisis-people-living-hiv-and-their-households-symposium-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4494110b5e2d1a571a1809d6df584dce03271c62349e905c064fa9061dd7762b"}}, "hash": "ae4056ff8d43b645adacde8f73157f43f316261e2970f004bb5529870d9bb64b", "text": "Early results from the study on the socio-economic impact of HIV at the household level in five provinces of China show that the burden of HIV at the household and per capita levels is significant compared to the non-HIV households across a wide spectrum of indicators ranging from loss of income to education of children. Reduced workforce participation of adults of productive age and additional burden on older people and children are substantially higher among HIV-house- holds.

HIV also led to school dropouts, which is higher among girls, and considerable household burden on women. Discrimination is rampant and had a wide-ranging impact. PLHIV suf- fered more income loss due to stigma and discrimination than their poor health conditions. Similarly in Indonesia, medical expenses of HIV-affected households were more than three times high- er than the non-HIV-affected households and the former experienced loss of income four times higher than the latter. Fear of stigma and cost factors drove many to migrate out of their places of domicile - about 32 per cent of the respondents said they were migrants for these reasons. The impact of HIV on education with inter-generational and gender consequences was very evident: while the school dropout rate appeared the same among the lower age group (7-12 yrs) for both PLHIV and non-HIV-affected households, it was about 10 per cent higher for the former in the 13-15 yrs age group. Girls dropped out at twice the rate of boys. Regarding coping mechanisms, a majority of HIV- affected households used up savings and borrowed while in some cases children were sent to work. Among the non-HIV-affected households, apathy and indifference was the common attitude towards PLHIV. Food security and HIV The volatile food price situation in the region is also of serious concern in this context. Since 2000, food prices have been rising in Asia and the Pacific and throughout the world, with particularly sharp increases since 2007. Globally, food prices rose by 66 per cent between mid-2005 and August 20083. Current projections on how these increases affect the poor in developing countries show that increases in the poverty headcount are likely to be severe, eliminating much of the progress in poverty reduction 1 The global economic crisis and HIV prevention and treatment programmes: vulnerabilities and impact, World Bank and UNAIDS, 2009 2 Studies on the socio-economic impact of HIV at the household level in China and Indonesia (to be published) UNDP and national partners 3 Table 1a, Indices of Primary Commodity Prices, 1998-2008, IMF, 2008, and quoted in The Threat Posed by the Economic Crisis to Universal Access to HIV Services for Migrants, Preliminary Findings, Joint United Nations Initiative on Mobility and HIV/AIDS in South East Asia (JUNIMA), 2009, Page 7 BACkGRoUND 2 that has been made in recent years4. Rises in food prices are likely to affect HIV-affected households more than those at the same income level that are not affected by HIV. In some cases, HIV-affected households spend a lower proportion of their total expenditure on food than their non-HIV counter- parts, implying that these households divert the money that they would otherwise spend on food for medical expenses. Food price-rise will likely impact the quality as well as the quantity of diet of HIV-af- fected households. While expenditure on grains do not vary much by income, HIV-affected households with higher incomes spend more money on protein-rich food items like meat, eggs and dairy products and nutrient-rich vegetables and fruits. Evidence also shows that HIV risks increased during the crisis, with a rise in the number of sex workers in less formal settings as more women were trafficked for commercial sex work. These risks coincided with drastic cuts in health budgets and funding for HIV prevention programmes. Thus, in the current crisis, job losses and economic pressures may lead to the entry of vulnerable people into sex work and also lead to a rise in trafficking. This is especially worrisome as the bulk of job losses in the region have been in the export-led manufacturing sector, which employs women in large numbers. Recent evi- dence from Cambodia, where a large number of internal migrant women have been laid off from the garment sector, reveals a link between the current crisis and their entry into sex work5.

The studies commissioned by the World Bank, ILo and UNDP to understand the impact of the 2008 economic crisis show that the real impact is on the individual and at the household level, especially in the low- and middle-income countries. The impact is particularly severe on vulner- able populations, including people living with HIV. The unfolding of the ramifi cations of the economic crisis has led to pervasive doubts about the future of global funding for HIV/AIDS programmes. This is a major cause for concern since the Global Fund to fi ght AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) supports nearly 55 per cent of the PLHIV families in the South East Asia region. The GFATM is not running out of money anytime soon and all its donors have confi rmed their pledge. There would be a new replenishment cycle till 2013, beginning next year and all the programmes that GFATM is currently supporting in the region will continue. It is a challenge to increase universal access to treatment and move towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), particularly when there is concern regarding the availability of funds in the future, not just from GFATM, but for health in general in the low and middle-income countries. This issue must be high on the agenda, not only in donor countries, but also in the implementing countries. \u201cThough there is reason for concern, there is no reason for panic because of the economic crisis. If all stakeholders work together, the continuation of funds for the life saving HIV programmes in the region can be assured.\u201d Dr. Christoph Benn, is a physician with special training in Tropical Medicine and Public Health.

Considerable domestic resources are going into HIV/AIDS in middle-income countries such as Indonesia and Thailand and this may eventu- ally be the only way to sustain efforts. There are significant resources for HIV/AIDS, but not enough. While the resource gap is 40 per cent, the coverage is lower than 60 per cent. The primary cause for low coverage is inefficiency in the use of existing resources. Economic crisis and HIV/AIDS funding History suggests that financial crisis suppresses aid as it is linked to GDP. For example, the Nordic coun- tries contribute 0.7 per cent of their GDP to development aid. Therefore, when there is an economic crisis and a country\u2019s GDP growth is affected, the aid does get affected. However, it does not necessarily improve with economic recovery. For example, Japan had committed 1 per cent of its GDP for overseas Development Aid (oDA), but the 1990 crisis and the sharp contraction of its economy that followed led to a dramatic fall in the oDA. Even when the economy recovered after the mid 1990s, the GDP growth did not recover to the 1990 level, which translated into a much lower oDA. Thus, the question is when the economy recovers, will it be possible to fill in the 40 per cent resource-gap needed to address HIV/ AIDS. Those affected are also countries that depend on domestic resources to fund HIV/AIDS. In the case of Botswana, which has one of the highest prevalence rates in the world, 89 per cent of total HIV/AIDS funding is from domestic sources. The economy of Botswana, which is dependent on diamonds and minerals with 40 per cent of its GDP coming from exports, took a sharp downturn during the 2008 global economic crisis with diamond exports falling 89 per cent. This affected HIV/AIDS funding signifi- cantly, which in turn impacted a large number of people who were dependant on government financial support for treatment. Impact on the responses to HIV/AIDS A March 2009 survey by the World Bank, UNAIDS and WHo in 71 countries covering 3.4 million people on treatment, studied the impact of economic crisis on treatment and care in the immediate future PRESENTATIoNS By PANELISTS Dr. Debrework Zewdie is the Director, Global HIV/AIDS Program for the World Bank. Prior to this position she managed the AIDS Campaign Team for Africa (ACTafrica), and led the team which was responsible for the US$1 billion Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP I and II) for Afri- ca. Before joining the Bank in 1994, Dr. Zewdie was Deputy Regional Di- rector of the Africa Region for the AIDS Control and Prevention project (AIDSCAP) of Family Health International in Nairobi, kenya and worked in 16 African countries. She has a Ph.D. in Immunology from the Univer- sity of London and has been published in over 100 journals and book chapters on a variety of subjects Dr. Debrework Zewdie 7 and in the next 12 months. The study confirmed that the economic impact will affect treatment - while eight countries have already felt the impact, all the 22 countries that were surveyed expect the crisis to impact their treatment efforts in the next 12 months. Among the areas that could be impacted include scaling-up of treatment. The impact of the crisis on treatment efforts would be higher if more people are on treatment. For in- stance, the study shows that more than 60 per cent of people would be affected in some African coun- tries, while countries in Central Asia, where the HIV treatment coverage is low, will have a lower impact. Treatment interruption will lead to increased mortality and morbidity, higher transmission risks, in- creased incidence of tuberculosis, and higher burden on hospitals. The Brazil example shows that with more people on treatment, there is a fall in demand for hospital beds and hence saving of resources in hospitals. Cuts in government services and private sector prevention efforts will lead to a rise in new infections. At present, for every person on treatment, three to five people get infected. It is thus important to invest in prevention, especially among most-at-risk groups. But with a fall in funds, prevention efforts may take a back seat. Moving forward The existing funds have to yield better results.

Prof. Dr. Yjandra Yoga Aditama Global Economic Crisis: The Situation in Indonesia There are an estimated 277,000 PLHIV in Indonesia, which has an active programme for prevention, treatment, care and support for PLHIV. There is a widespread fear that the economic crisis could inter- rupt the efforts due to failure in funding commitments by donors. Among other things, a fall in funding for treatment could lead to an increase in HIV related mortality and morbidity; increase in drug resis- tance; reduction in prevention of transmission; and increase in the incidence of HIV. 8 The main challenge in Indonesia is to maintain and expand access to HIV prevention and treatment. For this, there is a need to use existing funds more efficiently and plug the funding gaps immediately. It is imperative to monitor risks of future programme interruptions and develop plans for an uncertain environment, including resource mobilization strategies for longer terms. This should be done by all stakeholders at the international (including institutions such as WHo, UN- AIDS and GFATM), national (central, provincial and district governments), community (including private entities), and individual levels (people and their families). PRESENTATIoNS By PANELISTS Dr Ross McLeod is an economist with experience in designing, cost- ing, implementing, evaluating and reviewing development and health projects across a wide range of countries in Africa, Asia and the Austra- lia-Pacific. With a Doctorate of Philosophy, his focus is on the union of science and economics. He was involved in the analysis of the socio- economic impacts of the AIDS Epidemic in Asia for the Commission on AIDS in Asia and also is a member of the International and French As- sociations for Health Economics. AIDS in Asia, Sustaining the Response in the Economic Crisis Funding for HIV prevention and care in Asia-Pacific Funding for prevention and care has increased from $0.6 billion in 2004 to $0.9 billion in 2007 with India and China accounting for nearly 40 per cent of regional spending. The expenditure per person is the highest in Thailand and Cambodia, while the average regional spending per person is $0.30. Expendi- ture on prevention is higher than treatment at $0.3 billion. Vulnerability to the economic crisis The budgets for national programmes in the countries of the region as a percentage of the GDP have been severely affected with falling growth due to the economic crisis. The Asian programmes rely on external financing and the financial burden is the greatest for programmes with higher ART spending. Targeting of response \u201cDesigning programmes to minimize HIV incidence and contain treatment cost is crucial. A focused response can prevent 80 per cent of new infections. A targeted programme can reduce the number of PLHIV by 3.1 million in 2020.\u201d Dr. Ross McLeod 9 The inability to achieve behavioral change among vulnerable populations is leading to a rise in the incidence of HIV. Studies show that universal coverage of high risk groups such as men having sex with men (MSM), sex workers and intravenous drug users (IDUs) has the highest impact. of the current $0.9 billion spent for AIDS prevention and care in Asia, less than $0.1 billion is targeting the most-at-risk populations (MARPs). Studies suggest that the resources needed for care will be $1 bil- lion more in 2020 for comprehensive intervention, and without increases in the coverage of MARPs the ART need would further increase. Thus it is important to have a targeted response. Containing programme cost Containing cost is crucial as prevention is a public good. User-fee for care and treatment is not afford- able for most people and it is difficult to implement as well. While the first-line treatment is out of the reach of most low-income households, the second-line treatment is almost impossible for them.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9789cc1a-fd7e-4d2b-b60d-ad7b10bb85a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "9789cc1a-fd7e-4d2b-b60d-ad7b10bb85a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/impact-financial-crisis-people-living-hiv-and-their-households-symposium-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Impact of the Financial Crisis on People Living with HIV and their Households - Symposium Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/impact-financial-crisis-people-living-hiv-and-their-households-symposium-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7951626a0577280107575f8cac7ab1c59853d469c8b1c3834212ab3e887cc00"}, "2": {"node_id": "b5987ef1-aba7-4a8d-9041-e7a269d44195", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/impact-financial-crisis-people-living-hiv-and-their-households-symposium-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "914cc42825001f5b6e2d309a1c52808cf31f1081aabeabf6b1801fd690eca4c0"}}, "hash": "aa6338f025b14bf8c106ce74b55e1cd4f403f3b5d2cbfb67330b74f821fb2f92", "text": "PRESENTATIoNS By PANELISTS Caitlin Wiesen is the UNDP Regional HIV Practice Leader and Pro- gramme Coordinator for Asia and the Pacific.

Typically they experience severe social and economic impacts compared to households that are not HIV-affected. This is primarily because HIV-affected households experience loss of income due to disease and/or discrimination; family member/s give up the option to work in order to care for someone living with HIV in the household; and the direct cost of medical care is higher among HIV-affected households. In addition, the medical expenses of an HIV-affected poor household often cut into the already inad- equate food budget. Malnutrition is particularly risky for PLHIV as deficiencies in micronutrients hasten the progression of the disease and HIV infection increases the body\u2019s need for energy, particularly for those on ART. 6 Ibid 3 Caitlin Wiesen 10 PRESENTATIoNS By PANELISTS \u201cThe socio-economic impact and coping strategies of HIV-affected house- holds that push them to draw down on their savings, liquidate essential as- sets, and pull children from school to care for the sick and dying have severe consequences that make this particular community extremely vulnerable to any external shocks such as food and fuel price increases.\u201d The study shows that the poor HIV-affected households reduced consumption expenditures that they would otherwise have made for essential items by 37 per cent. All households below the wealthiest quintile (80 per cent of households surveyed) would fall below the poverty line as a result of the income and expenditure effects of HIV. Core findings of the study Expenditure on food and medical care by HIV-affected households Across the studies poorer HIV-affected households consistently spent a lower proportion on food and a higher percentage on medical expenses than those not affected. For example, in Thailand, HIV-affected households spent just over 40 per cent of their income on food compared with non-HIV household counterparts who spent over 60 per cent of their income on food. Conversely, HIV-affected house- holds spent a much higher proportion of household income on medical expenses or close to 40 per cent compared with non-HIV households who spent less than 10 per cent. Spending less on food had consequences in terms of both the quality and quantity of food consumed by HIV-affected households. While HIV-affected households spent more on medical expenses, first line ART treatment was out of reach for many of the poorest households. Even where treatment was provided free of cost, difficulty of access to services created a formidable barrier. Particularly vulnerable are those in rural areas who sometimes have to travel for several hours or take a full day to travel to urban or peri-urban centers for follow up monitoring and testing of CD4 counts. It often required absenting themselves from work leading to further loss of income. It particularly disadvantaged women who found that leaving their families and households for a day to seek treatment was not an option. Coping strategies among HIV-affected households The top response of HIV-affected households to coping with increased medical expenses was borrow- ing from friends and relatives. Many of the HIV-affected households were forced to liquidate assets such as farmland, animals and jewelry to meet healthcare needs. HIV-affected households were found to have larger outstanding loans, and higher dissavings than non-HIV households due to high medical costs, increased absenteeism and loss of work. In Vietnam, HIV-households from the lowest quintile were twice as vulnerable as those from the highest quintile to liquidation of assets. While 40 per cent of the medical needs of the lowest quintile HIV-households were met by liquidating assets, for house- holds from the highest quintile, 82 per cent of medical expenses came from their savings. Impact of the food support programme Food support programmes helped HIV-affected households spend less on food, and more on children\u2019s education. The Cambodian experience shows that the food support programme led to better health and hence lower expenditure on medical costs. It also led to a decrease in household expenditure on food. Households accessing food support programmes spent more money on protein-rich food com- pared to the period when they were not on food support, increasing both the quality and quantity of food for the family. Household savings in food and medical expenses also translated into increased support to children's education. 11 PRESENTATIoNS By PANELISTS Key recommendations \u2022\ufffd These 5 country studies show that even in the absence of a crisis poor HIV-affected households are in a far more precarious", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55c2ab59-51bd-496c-b862-fb6b7d72240c": {"__data__": {"id_": "55c2ab59-51bd-496c-b862-fb6b7d72240c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/impact-financial-crisis-people-living-hiv-and-their-households-symposium-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Impact of the Financial Crisis on People Living with HIV and their Households - Symposium Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/impact-financial-crisis-people-living-hiv-and-their-households-symposium-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33405471e8ec87227f2053ae48d350832336e289f35b467ca353bb1570bfe832"}, "3": {"node_id": "02560579-6493-42b6-a267-12a1e9e8e976", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/impact-financial-crisis-people-living-hiv-and-their-households-symposium-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33f235c33f3ec0c89db330c17b49895e70a250c8b42e5c3ebf967958f0f5e3a6"}}, "hash": "f3e04c51fa3d124869ad6fb093fc50ed7ca5dd14d8763a6ff9ac59561895004a", "text": "predicament than their non-HIV affected counterparts.

This makes HIV-affected households extremely vulnerable to any external shocks - from economic crises to food and fuel price increases. \u201cHIV-affected households that are poor are at the risk of being pushed into severe poverty compared to the non-HIV households and hence addressing their needs should be prioritized in stimulus packages and social protection schemes.\u201d \u2022\ufffd Programmes focusing on poverty alleviation and social safety nets need to integrate HIV-affected households -- especially women headed households -- within schemes ranging from micro-credit, medical and life insurance, conditional cash transfers and employment guarantee schemes to pen- sion support. \u2022\ufffd The access of women, particularly widows, to credit and income generating opportunities needs to be maximized and efforts for the legal empowerment of women need to be intensified.

Nearly half of the 400,000 workers employed in the diamond industry were laid-off towards the latter half of 2008. Though there has been considerable attention to the impact of the economic crisis on Surat\u2019s dia- mond industry across the world, a fact that was not sufficiently acknowledged was the condition of people living with HIV in the city. Based on information from people living with HIV in the area, UNDP, in partnership with the local PLHIV networks, undertook a qualitative study to assess the situation and recommend impact mitigation steps in 2009. The study employed in-depth interviews of people living with HIV and their households, key-informant interviews and case studies. As a control group, some non-HIV households were also included in the study. The respondents were chosen using convenience sampling. Three case studies from this study are presented here. \u2022\ufffd Thirty-four-year-old Piyushbhai Sushilkant, whose family had set up the first diamond polishing machine in Surat, is now without a job and a dangerous CD4 level of 15. From about $200 a month before the onset of the crisis, he earns nothing today. Without adequate food and basic nutrition, he is unable to tolerate ART and hence stopped treatment. He is desperately seeking some gov- ernment or civil society intervention or inclusion in the social protection schemes to tide over the situation. He feels that eventually the industry may return to normalcy, but is unsure if he will be alive to see that. \u2022\ufffd Thirty-six-year-old Ushaben\u2019s husband died of HIV-related illnesses a year ago, leaving her and their daughter with HIV. The mother and child eke out a living selling toys in the streets of Surat. From a decent life supported by her husband\u2019s job in the diamond industry, they now barely man- age to take home $10 a month, forcing them to survive on one meal a day at the best of times. With both on ART, this situation takes a heavy toll on their health. Unable to tolerate the ARV without sufficient food consumption, both Ushaben and her daughter are on the verge of disruption of ART. A timely cash-transfer or a livelihood programme could have helped them stay afloat until the economy recovers and she finds some employment either in the diamond or the ancillary industry.

Pramod Kumar 13 PRESENTATIoNS By PANELISTS The study from Surat highlights the need to recognize the special vulnerabilities of people living with HIV during socio-economic shocks. Particularly silenced by fear, stigma and various covert and overt so- cial exclusion, their needs should be acknowledged by existing social protection schemes and periodic initiatives mounted by national and local governments. Shiba Phuralaitpam is the Regional Coordinator of the Asia Pacific Network of People Living with HIV, based in Bangkok. He has been a known activist for the rights of people living with HIV, particularly for the expansion of universal access of ARV. He is also an active advocate for harm reduction and rights-based responses in the region. Shiba Phuralaitpam Impact of Economic Crisis on People Living with HIV and their Households More money is needed to address HIV. The Commission on AIDS in Asia report shows that only 26 per cent of PLHIV in this region are currently getting treatment. It is very important to look at the developments, such as the overall health infrastructure and women\u2019s empowerment, that the HIV programmes have helped to build, which would be lost if funds for HIV programmes are cut-back or stopped. Globally, there is a need for worry because funds are not enough. There is a need for all stakeholders to work together for capacity building and to improve the service delivery mechanisms of the health sec- tor. There is not enough money for all this. The issues of great concern include national and international budget squeeze on funding for HIV/AIDS, lack of real data, job-cuts experienced by PLHIV in many pockets of the world that are mainly depen- dent on export oriented sectors, excessive external dependence by most countries for funds for ART, cuts in donor and bilateral funding for GFATM, and doubts about the continuation of direct funding by donors/foundations for treatment, prevention, needle exchange and Methadone programmes. \u201cHIV prevention and care services are still under-funded and there is no room for further cuts. Social safety nets and stimulus packages should inte- grate HIV prevention and care needs.\u201d There is a need to take a macro view. If there are cut-backs in HIV funding, treatment gets affected and people living with HIV will get sick; they cannot work and earn or their family. If this happens to the whole community, the entire economy of the country or region is affected. 14 PRESENTATIoNS By PANELISTS Discussion HIV/AIDS funding Responding to questions, Dr. Debrework Zewdie said the initial activism around HIV/AIDS funding led to its rising from $4 billion in 2004 to $13 billion in 2008. Now, there are a number of new agendas that donor agencies are pushing. There is a need for activism again to show that the result of deserting any of the services that are currently being pursued in HIV programmes is going to be costly. There is thus the need to push for efficiency in the use of resources. In the beginning, the World Bank used different menus for different countries, but had the same set of programmes in high and low prevalence areas. After the approach of \u201cknow your epidemic,\u201d efficiency became extremely important. Food Security and HIV In the beginning, food security and nutrition were neglected in all HIV/AIDS programmes, said Dr. Ze- wdie. But with treatment, there is considerable focus on this. Thus, one of the shifts within the World Bank is to invest more money on food security. \u201cThe HIV/AIDS programmes are not going to solve the fundamental prob- lems of poverty, inequality, and stigma and discrimination, which make people vulnerable in the first place.\u201d The World Bank is investing much more on food security now than it used to 10 years ago. Mr. Christoph Benn said that food supplements are included in a number of programmes supported by the Global Fund. Though the Global Fund has to play its part, it does not have all the answers. There is a need to collectively respond to the problem of food security. Certainly, there is a need for more money to ad- dress all the issues. Multisectoral responses and social safety nets There is a noticeable reversal to the old paradigm of looking at HIV/AIDS as only a health problem, which is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e98874d3-faca-4961-8fb4-def3e7b6ecc1": {"__data__": {"id_": "e98874d3-faca-4961-8fb4-def3e7b6ecc1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/impact-financial-crisis-people-living-hiv-and-their-households-symposium-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Impact of the Financial Crisis on People Living with HIV and their Households - Symposium Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/impact-financial-crisis-people-living-hiv-and-their-households-symposium-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b17bc8508b3bcac3f6f73b286fbd5744dbae211d56c3ae4affe06ba2923cdaba"}}, "hash": "b17bc8508b3bcac3f6f73b286fbd5744dbae211d56c3ae4affe06ba2923cdaba", "text": "dangerous, said Dr. Zewedie. World Bank programmes have always had social safety nets, but only now are they being applied to HIV/AIDS. Ms. Caitlin Wiesen stated... \u201cAt the household and community levels, the impacts are severe; people do not distinguish between the need for food, health and education. There is thus a compelling need to make it a multi-sectoral issue and for everyone to work across silos in a much better way.\u201d The weakest link has been the inability to prioritize households within existing social safety nets. 15 PRESENTATIoNS By PANELISTS Concluding Remarks The general opinion from the floor was that efficiency should be an important aspect of every pro- gramme. There is indeed a moral obligation for efficiency. If we are unable to show results, there are going to be challenges in sustaining the investment in HIV, particularly during times of resource con- straints. There are at least two kinds of efficiency that have to be addressed. one of them is management ef- ficiency, in terms of how much money can get through a system to support delivery of services or other kinds of interventions. It is very important to look at the value addition, or the lack of it, and understand how much money gets to where it is meant for. There are very interesting pieces of data that have been shown at other conferences, for example the massive variation in unit cost of providing counseling and testing across different countries because of different management structures. The voluntary counsel- ing and testing centres (VCTCs) that cater to five clients per day as opposed to one that caters to 100 clients a day have radically different unit costs in terms of the cost per person served. The other issue of efficiency is around the choice of interventions. Part of the message of the Commis- sion on AIDS in Asia report is that too much money is being spent on things for which it is said that not enough is being spent. For instance, a lot of money has been spent on general awareness programmes and no one feels that it is bad, but the question is what kind of impact does it have on reducing new infections? Who are getting infected and what are the most effective ways of protecting them? In order to sustain treatment funding, there is a need to stop the growth of new infections. That means that there is a need to look at the most efficient and strategic investment options to stop new infec- tions, which in the Asia-Pacific region continues to be primarily among clients of sex workers, MSM, IDU, and women who are involved with those men. Not that the general population should be ignored, but they have to be reached through low-cost ways. There is a need to make sure that anti-stigma and awareness messages get out there for free by using media, entertainment events etc., rather than by funding large information programmes. According to the World Bank survey, one third of countries account for 61 per cent of the people glob- ally on ARV, and they are expected to be affected by the economic crisis. This is a call for action. The households affected by HIV were already vulnerable before the economic crisis. As seen from the stories from Surat, their vulnerability has been exacerbated by the crisis, and it is important to pay immediate attention to this. There is a need to work together on a cross-MDG and cross-development agenda. This includes fighting poverty and hunger. There is a need to continue with strategic HIV prevention programmes, but there is also a need to make sure that the broader development and human rights programmes target those with HIV and those who need them most.

An overview of the international standards for the right to health, including their specific application to migrant workers, is included as context for this situational overview. At a global level, the catalyst for this report is the adoption of the World Health Assembly (WHA) Resolution on the Health of Migrants in 2008. Among other things, this resolution calls for the promotion of migrant-sensitive health policies;1 the establishment of health information systems containing disaggregated data to support analysis of migrant health needs;2 and the documentation and sharing of information and best practices for meeting the health needs of migrants in countries of origin, return, transit, or destination.3 While ratification of international standards on migrant workers\u2019 rights, and particularly the right to health, differ across the region, the unanimous adoption of the WHA resolution by all 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \u2014 Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam \u2014 provides a significant regional mandate for action to address the health-related vulnerabilities of migrants, including migrant workers. At the regional level, specific impetus for the preparation of this report also comes from the second Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue on Migrant Workers\u2019 Access to Health and HIV Services in the ASEAN Region, held in Bangkok in November 2011. This meeting was co-convened by the UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub and the ASEAN Secretariat, with technical support from members of the Joint United Nations Initiative on Migration, Health and HIV in Asia (JUNIMA). During meeting proceedings, government and civil society representatives from each of the ASEAN Member States discussed priorities for action in addressing the health vulnerabilities of migrant workers throughout the whole migration cycle. In particular, participants at this meeting 1 World Health Assembly, Resolution on Health of Migrants, article 1. 2 Ibid., article 3. 3 Ibid., article 5. 9 The Right to Health called for the development of a comprehensive situational overview of migrant workers\u2019 health access and related challenges in the region, both to inform policy and to support future advocacy efforts. The specific aim of this report is to fill this identified gap in the literature. All content provided throughout the report is based on desk review; discussions during multi-stakeholder dialogues; and correspondence with government, civil society, and fellow agencies within the UN family. Draft versions of the report have been reviewed by each of these stakeholders at various stages throughout the writing process. Funding for the report has been jointly provided by the Governance and HIV, Health, and Development Practice Teams within the UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub. The materials covered in this report are arranged as follows: Section I reviews the definitions of the right to health, most comprehensively outlined in article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and supplemented by later comments from the ICESCR Committee. This section also introduces the health-related components of international standards specific to migrants\u2019 rights, the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families (ICMW), Migration for Employment (No. 97), Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention (No. 143), and Domestic Workers Convention (No. 189). In brief, the \u2018right to health\u2019 is understood as an inclusive right that encompasses a range of complementary rights, such as the right to access food and nutrition, housing, safe and potable water, adequate sanitation, safe and healthful working conditions, and health-related education and information.4 For any individual, the right to health means having the freedom to control one\u2019s health and body, and the entitlement to a system of health protection that provides equality of opportunity for all.5 In practice, this right may be best understood as \u201ca claim to a set of social arrangements \u2014 norms, institutions, laws, an enabling environment \u2014 that can best secure the highest attainable standard of health.\u201d 6 Following this theoretical introduction, Section I sets the context for the remainder of the report by reviewing current research and understandings of the health vulnerabilities facing migrant workers throughout the migration cycle. Throughout each of the four key stages of migration \u2014 pre-departure, transit, settlement in host country, and return \u2014 migrant workers can face health-related barriers on a regular basis that go beyond their lack of recognition under the host country\u2019s labour laws.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "711a2ffd-d98f-4576-8a2d-8f3865888995": {"__data__": {"id_": "711a2ffd-d98f-4576-8a2d-8f3865888995", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8576b950b88d052b0bd936f5352fbe9da391db65ca4ebfc0a4c60b05a10df9ff"}, "2": {"node_id": "78274172-edcb-4ba8-96c1-3075ec533a54", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a11c06d369cff73e0dcc00789b8606ff3e5b39ff27063cf976ddf5952da93610"}}, "hash": "b164567313389da11c9530fd6e8f875e4cc1abc75a2e3c3471ec247fc1f9da25", "text": "These include stigma and discrimination, social exclusion, precarious employment status, exploitative working conditions, and increased occupational health and safety hazards. 4 Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (CESC), 2000, \u201cSubstantive Issues Arising in the Implementation of the International Covenant on Economic,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "afdcc88e-8775-45c3-a115-18b7e0762855": {"__data__": {"id_": "afdcc88e-8775-45c3-a115-18b7e0762855", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "575f387f643e1cf2b2cc3e085c049c4a9d0fcb0b3701077c29bbc18acc5541fc"}, "3": {"node_id": "c58ed075-6868-4058-aee6-3b11c5ca2999", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad194712ca7043bf22e67f95e2e4974a2210f41df826c08f3bb66f34be187221"}}, "hash": "ef61fb1a30e3daf9dea1e9c18246d45beadfb8fc1e6230e6b368b2e7c77d92bf", "text": "Social and Cultural Rights\u201d, General Comment no. 14, article 11. 5 Ibid., article 8. 6 World Health Organization (WHO), 2005, 25 Questions and Answers on Health and Human Rights. 10 Executive summary Section I concludes by outlining the framework for the ASEAN-specific remainder of the report. In 2010, subsequent to the adoption of the WHA Resolution on the Health of Migrants, a follow-up Global Consultation on Migrant Health was organized by the World Health Organization and the International Organization for Migration. This consultation produced an Operational Framework for Migrant Health, which included four main pillars, or priority areas, to assist in the realization of the WHA resolution. These are: (i) establishment of policy and legal frameworks; (ii) monitoring of migrant health; (iii) partnerships, networks, and multi-country frameworks; and (iv) creation of migrant-sensitive health systems. Sections II and III of this report provide an up-to-date, region-specific situational overview of labour migration flows and volumes, socio-economic context for migration, and labour migration governance. Section II provides a regional snapshot, while Section III provides country-specific profiles for each of ASEAN\u2019s 10 Member States. In brief, more than 14 million cross-border migrant workers originate from within South-East Asia. While more than 6 million of these workers will remain in the region, the remainder will cross into other regions such as the Arab States and Europe. These workers will move between source and host countries through formal government processes or travel in clandestine ways without proper documentation. Notably, an increasing number of these workers are women, and travelling alone. They may be motivated by opportunities for increased income, vertical job mobility, and skills improvement. They may also be driven to leave their home country by a combination of poverty, critical unemployment levels, or political or environmental upheaval. Despite the variety of reasons for migrating to work, commonalities exist. The majority of these workers will find themselves in low-skilled, labour intensive sectors in the host countries. Each of these sectors, such as construction, domestic work, agriculture, and seafood processing, presents its own specific set of health hazards, in addition to the broad set of health vulnerabilities that all low-skilled migrant workers face, as introduced in Section I. This report\u2019s regional and country-specific reviews of the broad set of challenges hindering migrant workers\u2019 access to health systems and support are structured around the four pillars of the Operational Framework for Migrant Health, and findings are summarized in Table 3. Regional recommendations for action under these four pillars are also provided at the close of Section II. Further, country-specific recommendations are included at the end of each country profile in Section III. 11 The Right to Health Introduction T he economic contribution of low-skilled migrant workers within the South-East Asian region is without question. Source countries reap significant benefit from migrant remittances and greater employment opportunities in the face of high unemployment levels at home. In turn, host countries have access to new sources of labour in the face of demographic and socio- economic changes that might otherwise be detrimental to key export industries. At the same time, it is widely agreed that the rights of migrant workers will diminish once they cross international borders.7 As in other regions across the globe, South-East Asia\u2019s migrant workers can face stigma and discrimination, social exclusion, lack of recognition under labour laws, precarious employment status, and exploitative working conditions on a regular basis.

At the regional level, specific impetus for the preparation of this report also comes from the second Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue on Migrant Workers\u2019 Access to Health and HIV Services in the ASEAN Region, held in Bangkok in November 2011. This meeting was co-convened by the UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub and the ASEAN Secretariat, with technical support from members of the Joint UN Initiative on Migration, Health and HIV in Asia (JUNIMA). During meeting proceedings, government and civil society representatives from each of the 10 ASEAN Member States discussed priorities for action in addressing migrant workers\u2019 health vulnerabilities throughout the whole migration cycle. In particular, participants at this meeting called for the development of a comprehensive situational overview of migrant workers health access and related challenges in the region, both to inform policy and to support future advocacy efforts. However, what is missing is a comprehensive situational overview of the status quo within the region \u2014 of labour migration governance and its implications for health access policies for migrant workers; of existing data sources and collection processes on migrant workers\u2019 health access; and of existing research and practices hindering or supporting the realization of migrant workers\u2019 right to health in the region. The specific aim of this report is to fill this identified gap in the literature. It provides a broad-based, consolidated, regional knowledge resource as a supplement to the aforementioned mandate for action on migrant health, with a particular focus on low-skilled migrant workers. Its production is based on commentary from government, civil society, and within the United Nations family, which suggests that there is a strong need for a comprehensive situational overview of migrant workers\u2019 health access in the region, including existing legal, social, and cultural barriers. All content provided throughout the report is based on desk review; discussions during multi- stakeholder dialogues; and correspondence with governments, civil society organizations, and agencies within the UN family. Draft versions of the report have been reviewed by each of these stakeholders at various stages throughout the writing process. Funding for the report has been jointly provided by the Democratic Governance and HIV, Health, and Development Practice Teams within the UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub. The three separate sections of this report provide: \u2022 an overview of international standards for the right to health, including their specific application to migrant workers; \u2022 a regional situational overview of low-skilled labour migration; of labour migration governance; and of legal, social, and cultural barriers to health access for low-skilled migrant workers; and \u2022 separate country profiles of the above for each of the 10 ASEAN Member States. 13 Migrant workers and the right to health Section I The Right to Health 14 Section I The Right to Health What is the \u2018right to health\u2019? T he World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as \u201ca state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease.\u201d10 It is influenced by a broad range of factors, including income and social status, social support networks, education and literacy, employment/working conditions, social environments, physical environments, personal health practices and coping skills, healthy child development, biology, gender, and culture.11 A definition of the \u2018right to health\u2019 encompasses a similarly broad range of factors. It is not simply the right to be healthy or the right to health care. It includes complementary rights, such as the right to access food and nutrition, housing, safe and potable water, adequate sanitation, safe and healthful working conditions, and health-related education and information.12 The norms, or standards, for the right to health are specifically outlined in article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "376eff0f-c1d8-4905-af5f-894e28581659": {"__data__": {"id_": "376eff0f-c1d8-4905-af5f-894e28581659", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1faeeb0d41adb8f9ccf97e128b737a26b18692481fa9c4a79ee17bd94ffe3887"}, "2": {"node_id": "ec66aef2-12ab-47dc-b67a-b00ac29ccfe7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "549bf8da3b8485abd8cc9bfbfaba15714c138d9d75b5af203645374c0c04949d"}}, "hash": "16d7b07ad7da083869e1ca697dc2b633098ad9770601a953ca5d6f9a571dccdf", "text": "This article prescribes the \u201cright of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.\u201d It includes specific provisions for child and maternal health; environmental and industrial hygiene; medical access and attention for all; and prevention, treatment, and control of diseases.13 10 Preamble to the Constitution of the WHO as adopted", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff5a4047-a62d-48e9-a4b9-0200c92e9f93": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff5a4047-a62d-48e9-a4b9-0200c92e9f93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39e1479ad926829b02e6b81e5b86fdda795acf0c984364c494397ebe50896c84"}, "3": {"node_id": "56af52b1-f0c2-48e2-890e-c1562e6ccfef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "278124fd4a1a9b0f83d41c944879497425cc54ca1c7b097e962ff3f948679fdf"}}, "hash": "1d559f115c4cc479cf4d828103c0f490de43c51e12c0e5cceb2ccaabdf17e097", "text": "by the International Health Conference, New York, 19\u201322 June, 1946; signed on 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 states (Official Records of the World Health Organization, no. 2, p. 100). 11 Hamilton, N., 2010, \u201cMigration Health: Emerging Perspectives\u201d, Health Policy Research Bulletin, vol. 17, pp. 3\u20137, at www.healthcanada.gc.ca/ hpr-bulletin. 12 CESC, General Comment no. 14, article 11. 13 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), article 12. 16 What is the \u2018right to health\u2019? Since the ICESCR entered into force in 1976, the right to health has been further expanded on by the ICESCR Committee.14 According to Comment 14 from the Committee, the right to health for individuals means the freedom to control one\u2019s health and body and the entitlement to a system of health protection that provides equality of opportunity for all.15 For State Parties to the ICESCR, there is an obligation to respect, protect, and fulfil the right to health. In practice, this requires the creation and promotion of health and support systems based on four key principles: \u2022 Availability of functioning public health and health-care facilities, goods, and services, including safe and potable drinking water, adequate sanitation, hospitals and clinics, and trained medical and professional personnel receiving domestically competitive salaries. \u2022 Accessibility of health facilities, goods, and services, defined by the principle of non- discrimination, particularly with regard to the vulnerable or marginalized. This includes physical accessibility, economic accessibility (affordability), and information accessibility.16 \u2022 Acceptability of health facilities, goods, and services, which must be respectful of medical ethics and culturally appropriate. \u2022 Quality of health facilities, goods, and services, which must be scientifically and medically appropriate and of good quality, including skilled medical personnel, scientifically approved and unexpired drugs, safe and potable water, and adequate sanitation.17 Beyond the ICESCR, aspects of the right to health are also covered in a range of other key human rights instruments. Some of these protections are covered in Table 1. A detailed summary of specific conventions and the rights they cover is also found in the Annex of this report. 14 The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESC) is the body of 18 independent experts that monitors implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights by its States parties. 15 CESC, General Comment no. 14, article 8. 16 Ibid., article 4. 17 Ibid., article 12. 17 Section I The Right to Health Table 1 RIGHT TO HEALTH IN INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS Convention Relevant articles and comments Right to health protections International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) ICESCR Article 7 The right to safe and healthy working conditions.

These include standards with regard to medical examinations; care and hygiene before the migration journey, during the journey, and on arrival;22 equality of opportunity with regard to social security;23 weekly rest periods; and protection from abuse. 18 International Convention on the Protection of Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, p. 9. 19 Ibid., article 28. 20 Ibid., articles 43 and 45. 21 Ibid., article 25. This article has important implications for advocacy on recognition of predominantly female foreign domestic workers, who are not recognized under employment law in any of the host countries among ASEAN Member States. 22 International Commission of Jurists, Migration and International Human Rights Law, p. 211. 23 ILO Convention No. 143, article 10. 19 Section I The Right to Health In line with these international standards, current global health approaches also endorse the public health benefits of a functioning health system accessible to all, without discrimination.24 These approaches emphasize the need to address disparities in health status in order to improve overall public health. For migrant workers this means that their health status is no longer framed as a threat to human security or a source of disease, as it may have been in the past. Instead, exclusion and discrimination is replaced with a push for equitable, culturally sensitive service systems, supported by education and health promotion. In reality, however, despite the ICESCR\u2019s comprehensive standards for right to health, and their specific application to migrant workers in the conventions and approaches described above, migrant workers can face a broad range of potentially serious health challenges throughout the migration cycle. A growing body of research addresses some of these connections between health and migration25 and the range of health vulnerabilities of each stage of the migration continuum.26 World Health Assembly Resolution on the Health of Migrants The WHO Resolution on the Health of Migrants was adopted by all WHO Member States, including all 10 ASEAN Member States, at the 61st World Health Assembly in 2008. This resolution recognizes that health outcomes can be influenced by the multiple dimensions of migration, that some groups of migrants experience increased health risks, and that there is a need for additional data on migrants\u2019 health and their access to health care.

In essence, this framework establishes four priority pillars to help WHO Member States to operationalize the goals of the Resolution on the Health of Migrants. The four pillars focus on: (i) the establishment of policy and legal frameworks; (ii) monitoring of migrant health; (iii) partnerships, networks, and multi-country frameworks; and (iv) creation of migrant-sensitive health systems. Key priorities for action were established under each of these pillars, as summarized in Table 3.32 32 WHO, 2010, Health of Migrants the way forward; report of a global consultation, Madrid, Spain, 3\u20135 March, 2010. 22 The right to health for migrant workers Table 3 PRIORITIES FOR ACTION UNDER THE WHO/IOM OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR MIGRANT HEALTH Monitoring migrants\u2019 health, priorities Ensure the standardization and comparability of data on migrant health Increase the better understanding of trends and outcomes through the appropriate disaggregation and analysis of migrant health information in ways that account for the diversity of migrant populations Improve the monitoring of migrants\u2019 health-seeking behaviours, access to and utilization of health services, and increase the collection of data related to health status and outcomes for migrants Identify and map: 1) good practices in monitoring migrant health; 2) policy models that facilitate equitable access to health for migrants; and 3) migrant-inclusive health systems models and practices Develop useful data that can be linked to decision-making and monitoring of the impact of policies and programmes. Policies and legal frameworks affecting migrant health, priorities Adopt and implement relevant international standards on the protection of migrants and the right to health in national law and practice Develop and implement national health policies that incorporate a public health approach to the health of migrants and promote equal access to health services for migrants, regardless of their status Monitor the implementation of relevant national policies, regulations and legislation responding to the health of migrants Promote coherence among policies of different sectors that may affect migrants\u2019 ability to access health services Extend social protection in health and improve social security for all migrants Migrant-sensitive health systems, priorities Ensure that health services are delivered to migrants in a culturally and linguistically appropriate way, and enforce laws and regulations that prohibit discrimination Adopt measures to improve the ability of health systems to deliver migrant-inclusive services and programmes in a comprehensive, coordinated and financially sustainable way Enhance the continuity and quality of care received by migrants in all settings, including that received from NGO health services and alternative providers Develop the capacity of the health and relevant non-health workforce to understand and address the health and social issues associate with migration Partnerships, networks and multi-country frameworks, priorities Establish and support ongoing migration health dialogues and cooperation across sectors and among key cities, regions and countries of origin, transit and destination Address migrant health matters in global and regional consultative migration, economic and development processes (e.g., Global Forum and Development, Global Migration Group, RCPs, United Nations High-Level Dialogue on International Migration and Development) Harness the capacity of existing networks to promote the migrant health agenda 23 Section I The Right to Health Protecting migrant workers\u2019 right to health in the ASEAN region W ithin the ASEAN region, the Philippines and Indonesia are the only states to have ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families. Although Cambodia signed the convention in 2004, it has yet to ratify it.33 While ratification of this and international standards on migrant workers\u2019 rights and right to health differ across the region, the unanimous adoption of the WHA Resolution on the Health of Migrants provides a significant regional mandate for action to address the health-related vulnerabilities of migrants, including migrant workers. 33 United Nations, Treaty Collection, at https://treaties.un.org.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ed35afe-e286-4bd6-8125-cbf337a5c56c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ed35afe-e286-4bd6-8125-cbf337a5c56c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d6a3752a78cf359cda1cfba21c834846412fd60a7b1b62d4aadd3bf972a619f"}, "2": {"node_id": "2a96d8da-1739-4534-88d5-8406af58b412", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e62d4e3cb717e0b323fe059f412577f9c9708a05c3e7cd9f3b5a7f13dec573b7"}}, "hash": "481f2ea320b9f356bc6aa286827889dc9c4df172e4f5fa125266683bfcb0a823", "text": "33 United Nations, Treaty Collection, at https://treaties.un.org. 24 Protecting migrant workers\u2019 right to health in the ASEAN region As the evidence base on migrant health vulnerabilities continues to grow, a number of other regional processes within ASEAN are also beginning to call for stronger responses on these issues.

The following is a broad summary of some of the factors determining migrant health in each of four key migration stages: pre-departure, transit, settlement, and return. A number of key overarching issues related to the increased health vulnerabilities of migrant workers are also mentioned throughout, including feminization of the workforce, politicization of migration and securitization of borders, privatization of the recruitment process, HIV-related travel restrictions, and stigma and discrimination. Pre-departure phase Migrants\u2019 pre-migratory health status is a determinant of health throughout the migration cycle. A broad range of factors will influence pre-migratory health status, including socio-economic status, biology, genetics, behaviour, and environment.48 Migrants\u2019 level of health education and awareness will exert a strong influence over health outcomes throughout the migration cycle. While pre-departure training for migrant workers is legislated in some source countries, it is not always the case that health is well-covered. From the perspective of the migrant, much of this information is also delivered in the days immediately prior to departure, leading to it being lost amidst other departure information. In many cases, the delivery of pre-departure training is the responsibility of private recruitment agencies, while governments lack the human resource capacity to monitor delivery and its quality. Increased privatization of the recruitment process and the shift in governance of workers from departments and ministries of immigration or labour to for-profit recruitment agencies can also increase the health vulnerability of workers. Pre-migratory access to medical treatment, medical testing, and the provision of safe working conditions and sanitary housing is now the responsibility of private recruitment agencies in many countries. Research suggests that there is 41 Zimmerman, C., Kiss, L., and Hossain, M., 2011, \u201cMigration and Health: A Framework for 21st Century Policy Making\u201d, Public Library of Science (PLoS) Medicine, vol. 8(5). 42 World Health Assembly (WHA), 2008, Health of Migrants, report by the Secretariat, article 6. 43 International Organization for Migration (IOM)/WHO, 2009, Financing Healthcare for Migrants: A case study from Thailand. 44 Burns, 2010, in IOM, Thailand Migration Report 2011, p. 24. 45 Mahidol Migration Centre, 2011, Migrant Workers Rights to Social Protection in ASEAN: Case studies of Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, and Thailand; International Labour Organization (ILO), 2008, Social Health Protection: An ILO strategy towards universal access to health care. 46 Brabant, Z., 2012, \u201cHealth situation of migrants with precarious status: review of the literature and implications for the Canadian context\u201d, Journal of Social Work in Public Health, vol. 27(4), p. 336. 47 European Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2011, Migrants in an Irregular Situation: Access to health care in 10 European Member States. 48 Gushulak, B.

Although the region is seeing an increase in bilateral cooperation on the recruitment and deployment of migrant workers, policy reviews suggest that increased regulation of the recruitment process does not necessarily lead to increased protections for migrant workers. In some cases, increasingly complex, bureaucratic, and expensive recruitment processes are leading migrants to travel undocumented. Increasing numbers of undocumented workers will receive little to no pre-departure health preparation and have little to no access to health services throughout the migration cycle.

This weak legal position translates directly into vulnerabilities in other areas of life, including health care and access to services.54 Lack of legal recognition can also lead indirectly to exclusion from health care, as employers may use a range of exploitative methods for controlling workers, including holding passports or identity cards or not hiring workers who refuse to give up passports.55 A lack of formal identification and papers makes access to health care particularly difficult. Research in other regions, particularly among undocumented workers, also discusses the implications of a potentially widespread practice of migrants using the identification or health care cards of others to access services, which can cause issues in terms of non-matching health profiles and treatment histories. Social exclusion and work-related social problems can have serious detrimental effects on migrant workers. Issues range from lack of linguistic and cultural affinity with host country surroundings to specific job-related issues of confinement and isolation. For example, the physical confinement of domestic workers to one workplace prevents physical access to community contacts and health care providers. Similar isolation exists for example for predominantly male seafarers, who are often away at sea for long periods of time, with little or no contact with health care providers. Lax occupational health and safety standards, particularly in those sectors such as construction, plantation, and domestic work in which low-skilled migrant workers are concentrated, can have serious influence on health. Lack of safety training or linguistic barriers that minimize the effectiveness of training when it does exist can exacerbate potential dangers; and research suggests that there are significant rates of injury and work-related deaths among migrant workers.56 Regarding migrants\u2019 approach to use of health services, research shows that those arriving from fee-for-service environments may be unaware or unfamiliar with the provision of nationally insured services, even where they do exist.57 Fear of potential consequences of accessing health services can also affect those travelling from well-policed environments. Recent research on health access for irregular migrant workers in the European Union found five main barriers to receiving and providing care: (i) costs of care and complex reimbursement procedures; (ii) unawareness of entitlements by health providers and beneficiaries; (iii) fear of detection due to information passed on to the police; (iv) discretionary power of public and health care authorities; and (v) quality and continuity of care. Some of these obstacles often also concern emergency health care.58 Cultural competency of health care providers and the ability to deal with diversity are recognized as integral components of effective health care in host countries.59 Caregivers require greater awareness of pre-departure factors for migrant populations in order to accommodate specific 54 Brabant, Z., op. cit. 55 Human Rights Watch, 2010, Slow Reform: Protection of Migrant Domestic Workers in Asia and the Middle East. 56 Ibid. 57 Gushulak and MacPherson, op. cit. 58 European Agency for Fundamental Rights, op. cit. 59 Gushulak and MacPherson, op. cit.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2716b70-23cd-4149-874b-c7730e9431ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2716b70-23cd-4149-874b-c7730e9431ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e747e250ee51cd04e349a7c724ed442dda8bb0d55b5908116432f22d16b2e353"}, "2": {"node_id": "0dbdac4c-f576-4fcc-a9b3-df33ac4e606a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ed38b247385ce64078850063a78dc35ceb654d346f194ed4ac9cafee7e2f0550"}}, "hash": "0b264a58ae5bf9461651d0a1c78d5650f52600595568b094c42489daf2f3b164", "text": "cit. 59 Gushulak and MacPherson, op. cit. 31 Section I The Right to Health migrant needs and to reduce barriers related to different cultural norms.60 There is a growing evidence base to support culturally sensitive, non-discriminatory care that places a high value on the ways in which communication between health care providers and clients could and should be improved.61 Poor policy coordination and contradictory policy goals, such as increasing foreign labour requirements while maintaining", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d8df45d-e26d-4fa7-9ffc-fdb080addfd1": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d8df45d-e26d-4fa7-9ffc-fdb080addfd1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e0f1ccaeb1c7bb58ada6d1f9cf8879ac926d9712fc09b0f863fe96afcf99de17"}, "3": {"node_id": "4be564bf-866e-4fc2-81b0-32b393c0a902", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "25c6d0fd4bf1c394cad9ba183b6df7654588873eabb4ee9156fda2086c44d0c8"}}, "hash": "f6111db27274c28aaf641080d72dcaf7a44c7d8c1f94d88e9d526a0e04a6a483", "text": "restrictive rights for migrants, can pose indirect health challenges by increasing the number of undocumented or irregular workers migrating to meet labour demands in host countries.62 Commentators have recommended that health access and care need to be removed from politics63 or issues of legal migration. Return and re-integration phase Accumulation of health factors throughout the migration cycle can lead to detrimental health outcomes following return to the home country. Migrants who have experienced precarious employment, suffered poor work and living conditions, or experienced social isolation and difficulties in accessing health services may have been exposed to other risk factors that promote poor health. Those who, for example, have been deported due to HIV status or other illness may need health care that does not exist in their home countries or which they cannot afford.64 Method of return is also a factor. If migrants are deported or forcibly returned, they may not receive adequate health assistance during detention or referral to health services prior to and post-return. In all host countries in the ASEAN region, documented migrant workers must undergo mandatory medical screening following arrival. Deportation can occur for a number of reasons, including pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and hepatitis status. In many cases, migrant workers are not informed of the results of mandatory medical testing or the specific reason for deportation, nor are they offered counseling or access to health services.65 60 Ibid. 61 IOM, 2010, Migration Health: Report of Activities 2010, p. 8ff. 62 Zimmerman et al., 2011, Migration and Health: A framework for 21st century policy-making. 63 Summerskill, W. and Horton, R., 2011, \u201cHealth in South-East Asia\u201d, The Lancet, vol. 373(9763), pp. 355\u2013356. 64 Davies, A.

More than 6 million of these workers move to work in other countries within the region, while the remaining move to other regions, such as Europe and the Arab States. Primary source countries within the South-East Asian region are Cambodia, Lao PDR, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, and Viet Nam. Primary host countries are Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and Brunei Darussalam \u2014 hosting 90 percent of the region\u2019s migrant workers, alongside workers from South Asian countries, particularly Bangladesh and Nepal. Low-skilled migrant workers travelling within, to, and from the South-East Asian region may move between source and host countries through formal government processes or travel in clandestine ways without proper documentation. Undocumented or irregular migrant workers \u2014 that is, those migrants who enter a country without proper documentation or who remain in a country following expiration of legal documentation \u2014 are present in all 10 ASEAN Member States, though to varying degrees. 36 Low-skilled labour migration in the South-East Asian region The distinction between documented and undocumented or irregular workers is by no means clear, with many workers shifting fluidly between the two statuses. For example, a migrant worker may enter a country with proper documentation but become irregular as a result of changes in employment, visa or permit overstay, employer negligence, or the inability to navigate and/ or afford legal registration procedures. The high volume of undocumented or irregular labour migration that occurs alongside migration through formal government processes in this region makes accurate estimates difficult to ascertain. The two principal migration corridors within South-East Asia are the Mekong subregional corridor and the archipelagic ASEAN corridor.66 In the first corridor, Thailand is the main destination country for migrant workers from neighbouring countries within the Greater Mekong Subregion, namely Myanmar, Cambodia, and Lao PDR. Low-skilled migrant workers from Viet Nam are also found in Thailand,67 Cambodia, and Lao PDR. In the second corridor, Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei Darussalam are the major destination countries. These three countries host significant numbers of migrant workers from Indonesia, as well as increasing numbers from Cambodia, Myanmar, and Viet Nam. Migrant workers from South Asia also flow into South-East Asian host countries, particularly Malaysia and Singapore. Singapore, for example, is one of the top five destination countries for migrant workers from Bangladesh.68 Malaysia has also been the top destination for documented Nepalese migrant workers for a number of years, hosting 38 percent of total documented deployments of Nepalese migrant workers in 2009.69 Increasing numbers are also moving into the Arab States (mainly Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain) and East Asia (mainly Taiwan, Republic of Korea [henceforth South Korea], Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and Japan). For example, the number one destination region for documented Filipino female domestic workers is the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia.70 Cambodia and Myanmar are also deploying an increasing number of female domestic workers to the Arab States, driven in particular by an Indonesian Government moratorium on supplying its female domestic workers to this region. For Viet Nam, the East Asian region is a primary destination, with the top three host countries for Vietnamese domestic workers being Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. 66 Kaur, A., 2010, Labour Migration in Southeast Asia: Migration policies, labour exploitation, and regulation, Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy, vol. 15(1), pp. 6\u201319. 67 Although these workers are not formally recognized under Thai legislation. 68 Asia-Pacific RCM Thematic Working Group on International Migration including Human Trafficking, 2012, Situation Report on International Migration in South and South-West Asia, p. 34. 69 Ibid., p.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef8e3404-63f3-4258-9399-4dacf4d19f7f": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef8e3404-63f3-4258-9399-4dacf4d19f7f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "81dbde28311d5cff612bf1844baafd67e543595dd3cf360dd466e480d754c7ef"}, "2": {"node_id": "4c091cbf-b50d-42ab-961b-9b5e581769cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "70f1c853fffb600c87ec1e66c967b76a174a647b40a3f6af6b690e8166485d3a"}}, "hash": "8d15631124b3acce576ea51c10bf20d245dbe96b19b35ed79f6a03d14d4b6719", "text": "34. 69 Ibid., p. 82, based on statistics provided by Nepal\u2019s Department of Foreign Employment. 70 Philippines Overseas Employment Administration, 2010, Overseas Employment Statistics: 2010, at http://www.poea.gov.ph/stats/2010_Stats. pdf. 37 Section II The Right to Health Estimates of labour migration Within the region, the Philippines and Indonesia are sources of the greatest number of migrant workers.

In the case of Indonesia, official estimates place approximately 6 million migrant workers abroad, including 4.2 million documented workers and 2 million undocumented workers.72 By comparison, at the lower end of the scale, current estimates of Vietnamese migrant workers abroad, both documented and undocumented, are approximately a half-million, with an annual deployment target of 90,000 documented workers as of 2012.73 Estimates from other countries are difficult to verify, given the high numbers of irregular migration that occurs. For example, both Cambodia and Lao PDR are very new to the formalized processes of labour migration, with more than 90 percent of Laotian workers travelling via irregular means. Among host countries, Malaysia and Thailand are host to the greatest volumes of workers. In 2011, Malaysia was host to approximately 2.3 million migrant workers, including just over 1 million documented and 1.3 million undocumented workers,74 while in the same year Thailand was host to approximately 1.5 million documented or semi-documented workers and between 1.5 million to two to four-times this number of undocumented workers.75 In terms of workforce percentages, migrant workers constitute a significant proportion of the workforce in the region\u2019s two other host countries, Brunei Darussalam and Singapore. In Brunei Darussalam, the predominantly low- and semi-skilled temporary migrant workforce constitutes approximately 25 percent of the total workforce. In Singapore, this figure is approximately 30 percent. With regard to gender ratios, recent estimates point to a feminization of labour migration in the region, particular among primary source countries. For example, in Indonesia the ratio of female to male workers in 2011 was 64 percent to 36 percent. In the Philippines, government statistics also suggest that more than 60 percent of deployments over the past 10 years have been female.76 71 Philippines Department of Labour and Employment, 2011, The Philippine Labor and Employment Plan, 2011\u20132016, p. 12. 72 IOM, 2010, Labour Migration from Indonesia: An Overview of Indonesian Migration to Selected Destinations in Asia and the Middle East, p. 15. 73 Vietnamese Ministry of Labour, Invalids, and Social Affairs (MoLISA), 2012, \u201cOver 25,000 Vietnamese workers working abroad\u201d, 16 May 2012, at http://english.molisa.gov.vn/news/viewdetail/tabid/339/newsid/54806/seo/Over-25-000-Vietnamese-workers-working-abroad/language/ en-US/Default.aspx. 74 Malaysian Ministry of Home Affairs, 2011. 75 IOM, 2011, Thailand Migration Report 2011. 76 Department of Labour and Employment, 2011, The Philippine Labor and Employment Plan, 2011\u20132016, p. 12. 38 Low-skilled labour migration in the South-East Asian region Socio-economic context of labour migration Major socio-economic factors that drive the flows of low-skilled migrant workers within, from, and to the ASEAN region include differing population demographics, economic disparity, periods of political instability, and environmental upheaval. While high unemployment, relatively low earning capacity, and poverty is a factor for those leaving source countries, rapid socio-economic development and the increasing participation of women in the workforce in host countries drive the continued demand for workers in host countries. In addition to these key factors, long, porous borders between neighbouring countries and trans- border linguistic and cultural affinities also strengthen migratory links between certain source and host countries. In many of these cases \u2014 for example, between Myanmar and Thailand and between Indonesia and Malaysia \u2014 \u2018pioneer\u2019 workers from source countries with a long history of out-migration have established strong cross-border linkages that act to encourage the aspirations of those in later generations. In the case of source countries within the region, the oversupply of labour as a result of either lack of economic growth or failure of job growth to match economic growth can be critical. For example, in Lao PDR, where 55 percent of the population is under 20, there are critical unemployment levels in the 15\u201324-year-old age range.77 In the Philippines, where job growth has been unable to keep up with population growth in recent years, those in this age group face unemployment rates more than twice the national average.78 In source countries experiencing high unemployment, aspiring and current migrant workers cite poverty, opportunity for increased income, vertical job mobility, and skills improvement as the drivers for seeking work across borders.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1147ae9c-bae1-4ea4-847e-0386e43a74d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "1147ae9c-bae1-4ea4-847e-0386e43a74d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ef0611e232f218bdf56a2221c5db16e34cb5bc821f43b457e977e1c1261997e"}, "2": {"node_id": "62866592-eb61-4e53-afbf-f44f0c6d4847", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b452c3bfa52a1e9513f76a3c66df0145de3a3d5c3de87ee84f62d48bf1123906"}}, "hash": "e4a7146b16e01ed6f752262aa7824c34f416e07a085b421119ff6fb5a73a02d0", "text": "In terms of development policy, Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam officially endorse labour migration as a poverty alleviation and development strategy.

In Brunei Darussalam, more than 80 percent of employees in mining and related industries and 75 percent of employees in the agricultural, forestry, and fishery sectors are temporary migrant workers.81 In Thailand, demand for migrant workers is greatest in fishing, seafood processing, agriculture, construction, and domestic employment industries,82 while in Malaysia and Singapore the demand is greatest in construction, manufacturing, maritime, and service industries.83 In the Malaysian electronics industry, which contributes 60 percent of total manufactured exports and accounts for 8 percent of the GDP, a number of employers claim that their business activities would come to a standstill if they were not allowed to use migrant labour, primarily because the jobs in those fields are perceived as hazardous and \u2018dirty\u2019 to the average Malaysian.84 The migrant workforce in electronics companies currently varies between 20 and 60 percent.85 In Thailand, Myanmar migrant workers in key export industries, such as fishing and seafood processing, contribute an estimated $11 billion, or 6.2 percent of the GDP, to the Thai economy.86 These workers work predominantly in jobs for which Thai employers are unable to recruit national staff. A more recent socio-economic factor influencing low-skilled migration flows in the region is the increase in women in the skilled workforce in host countries, such as Malaysia and Singapore. This has contributed in particular to a dramatic increase in demand for low-skilled female migrant workers in the domestic service industry. In Singapore, for example, where specific government policies are directed at increasing employment for middle-class women, domestic workers now constitute approximately 40 percent of the documented foreign workforce,87 with an estimated one fifth of all households employing at least one live-in domestic worker.88 The increased demand in the domestic service industry has resulted in an increase in female migrant workers migrating alone,89 with women currently constituting an overall majority of migrants leaving sending countries within the region.90 For example, in Indonesia women constitute 64 percent of the overseas labour workforce, while in the Philippines women constitute 53 percent,91 having accounted for more than 60 percent of total deployments over the past 10 years.92 81 Department of Economic Planning and Development, Government of Brunei, 2010, Brunei Final MDG Second Report, p. 9. 82 IOM, 2011, Thailand Migration Report 2011. 83 Ministry of Manpower, Government of Singapore, 2011, Statistics: Foreign Workforce Numbers, retrieved 1 March 2012 at http://www.mom.gov. sg/statistics-publications/others/statistics/Pages/ForeignWorkforceNumbers.aspx. 84 Lee, 2010, \u201cLabor Shortage Issues Forum\u201d, on Penang Institute website at http://penanginstitute.org/v3/resources/articles/event/169-labour- shortage-issues-forum. 85 Borman, S., Krishnan, P., and Neuner, M., 2010, Migrant Workers in the Malaysian Electronics Industry: Case Studies on Jabil Circuit and Flextronics. 86 Ditton, M. and Lehane, L., 2009, Towards realizing health-related Millennium Development Goals for Migrants from Burma in Thailand, Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics, vol. 4(3), pp. 37\u201348. 87 Ministry of Manpower, Singapore, op. cit. 88 UN Women, 2011, Made to Work, retrieved 1 February 2012 at unwomen-nc.org.sg/uploads/Day%20Off%202011%20June%2022.pdf. 89 Teng, Y.

In many cases, however, these protections have proven difficult to enforce beyond national borders. In host countries in the ASEAN region, labour migration policies have shifted from periods of amnesty to periods of strict controls on work permits and \u2018unauthorized\u2019 migration.93 As a consequence, migrant workers are alternately framed by policy makers as threats to national security or integral to the operation of key industries. In Malaysia, for example, undocumented workers have previously been \u2018silently welcomed\u2019, while more recently, following economic crisis, strict measures to control unauthorized migration and strict work permit controls have been emphasized.94 In Thailand, low-skilled labour migration has been regulated according to three guiding principles of national security, protecting working opportunities for Thai persons, and support the growth and development of Thailand95 \u2014 with different principles emphasized according to the political climate of the time. Generally speaking, academic, social, and political commentary on the implementation of labour migration legislation and policy across the region suggests that it can be limited and lacking in clarity. In many cases the operations of institutions responsible for managing labour migration are hindered by a lack of clear distribution of responsibilities and clear coordination of limited financial and human resources. 96 This lack of clarity on roles of multiple government and private stakeholders involved in labour migration processes hinders efforts to protect migrant workers throughout the migration cycle. In the case of Indonesia, for example, the management of the migration process for overseas foreign workers has been described as a complex, multi-stakeholder process complicated by a lack of 93 Kaur, op. cit. 94 Kanapathy, V., Controlling Irregular Migration: The Malaysian Experience. 95 Alien Employment Act 2008, section 7. 96 Orbeta, Jr., A. and Abrigo, M., 2011, \u201cManaging International Labour Migration: The Philippine Experience\u201d, Philippines Institute for Development Studies, Discussion Paper Series No. 2011\u201333. 41 Section II The Right to Health clarity in key legislation and the existence of conflicting government directives.97 As a result, the establishment of effective mechanisms for the protection of Indonesian migrant workers has been hindered by problems of coordination, confusion, and conflicts of interest and authority among various stakeholders involved. With regard to the very limited, and in many cases complete absence of, protections for undocumented workers, some commentators have suggested that the increased focus on legalization processes for migrant workers has resulted in even less protections for undocumented and semi-documented workers. For example, the Thai Government\u2019s policy of regularization and the Malaysian Government\u2019s amnesty were both aimed at ensuring proper documentation for workers, which in theory would lead to better protections, although in reality the cost of the legalization process (which is often relatively expensive) creates a greater financial burden on migrant workers. Migrant workers and advocacy groups note that the relative expensive cost of the legalization processes is not matched with a commensurate increase in earnings.98 The legislated exclusion of low-skilled migrant workers in certain sectors from national labour laws is also a particular problem hindering protection of migrant workers in host countries of the South-East Asian region. For example, in the case of Malaysia, the Employment Act, which regulates migrant workers conditions, excludes domestic workers, named as \u201cdomestic servants.\u201d In Brunei and Singapore, migrant domestic workers also face similar exclusions from employment law. In Brunei, a supplementary order Employment (Domestic Workers) Regulations 2009 governs which sections of the general Employment Order 2009 will apply to migrant domestic workers. In the case of Singapore, while employment of foreign migrant workers is generally governed under the Employment Act 1961 and the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Chapter 91A), only a range of provisions under the latter apply to migrant domestic workers. In many cases, in lieu of recognition under national labour laws, host countries utilize MoU agreements with major source countries as a means to manage and protect migrant workers. In Malaysia, MoU negotiations with source countries deal primarily with domestic workers excluded from national employment legislation. As such, they become the sole official source of protection for such workers. In recent times, MoU negotiations between Malaysia and source countries, such as Indonesia and Cambodia, have faced considerable hurdles, with protracted negotiations lasting a number of years. In certain cases, sole reliance on such mechanisms, operating independently to national legislation, has also had a series of negative implications for migrant workers. For example, in the absence of a comprehensive migration policy, Malaysia\u2019s reliance on separate agreements with different host countries has created a hierarchy in terms of rights and benefits available", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fde5c388-cbbc-4c36-aebd-8a1e78c063ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "fde5c388-cbbc-4c36-aebd-8a1e78c063ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a6fdf83ea8a2287e5d832248650c3b05f93495d4467a7724c0b1ac93f73f647"}, "3": {"node_id": "254afa8a-42c4-482e-94ff-a94ced3b8589", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b59c41eb86a0ccdd20d2721ead37bdd3a44297e108c126788d8afa9afb0ae7c1"}}, "hash": "bb24df6fbb7265e94c3c638652f650e394e330bfe7c542b2585f90f493d5bac2", "text": "to workers from different countries.

For example, Thailand signed a MoU on labour migration management with Lao PDR in 2002, and Myanmar and Cambodia in 2003. These MoU supplement national legislation by outlining the specific steps to be taken by host and source countries in facilitating entry, stay, and work permits for migrant workers. Two of their primary goals are to regularize those undocumented or semi- documented workers already in the country, and to create structures to ensure all new workers entering the country are documented. However the \u2018protective\u2019 factors of such MoU are indirect, in the sense that legalization facilitates access to a range of legislated rights, such as minimum wage and access to health care, and not an explicit focus of these agreements. The vulnerability of low-skilled migrant workers in this region also continues to be exacerbated by the increasing privatization of the recruitment process, coupled with the lack of government resources to monitor the practices of recruitment agencies and a lack of enforcement practices when recruitment agencies exploit migrant workers. Commentators in Malaysia, for example, have suggested that \u201cthe evolution of the recruitment process in recent times has seen that recruitment agencies and labour hire companies now dominate the recruitment process, while the Department of Immigration role has been reduced to granting visas.\u201d100 A number of migration practitioners and migrant advocacy groups recommend that recruitment practices need to be improved in order to reduce irregular migration flows and address widespread abuses, such as excessive fees and costs, misrepresentation, and contract substitution.101 99 \u201cRI-Malaysia MoU fails to provide needed safeguards for migrant workers\u201d, Jakarta Post, 1 June 2011, at http://www.thejakartapost.com/ news/2011/06/01/ri-malaysia-mou-fails-provide-needed-safeguards-migrant-workers.html. 100 Kaur, op. cit., p. 13. 101 ILO/AP-Magnet, 2011, Discussion paper based on an online discussion on \u201cImproving and Regulating Recruitment Practices in Asia and the Pacific\u201d, at http://apmagnet.ilo.org/resources/resource-content/discussion-paper-ap-magnet-1/at_download/file1. 43 Section II The Right to Health Migrant workers\u2019 health in the South-East Asian region Monitoring migrants\u2019 health Regional discussions involving representatives from ASEAN ministries of health, labour, and foreign affairs and migrant advocacy groups have identified a range of key challenges in the area of monitoring migrants\u2019 health. These include: (i) lack of funding and capacity for data collection; (ii) lack of standardization due to differences in national health systems; (iii) lack of coordination on data consolidation among the various stakeholders who collect data; and (iv) lack of good practice examples for data collection and disaggregation.102 While anecdotal evidence and fragmentary data clearly demonstrate that the living conditions and general work environment for many migrant workers is poor, the evidence base to inform decision-making and consequently track progress at the regional and national level is limited. An additional concern expressed by certain stakeholders is that data collection processes that do exist are focused on profiling and exclusion, for example, on medical testing for HIV and 102 UNDP/ASEAN Secretariat, 2011, Report of Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue on Migrant Workers\u2019 Access to Health and HIV Services in the ASEAN Region, at http://www.junima.org, pp. 37ff.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "254afa8a-42c4-482e-94ff-a94ced3b8589": {"__data__": {"id_": "254afa8a-42c4-482e-94ff-a94ced3b8589", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a6fdf83ea8a2287e5d832248650c3b05f93495d4467a7724c0b1ac93f73f647"}, "2": {"node_id": "fde5c388-cbbc-4c36-aebd-8a1e78c063ea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bb24df6fbb7265e94c3c638652f650e394e330bfe7c542b2585f90f493d5bac2"}}, "hash": "b59c41eb86a0ccdd20d2721ead37bdd3a44297e108c126788d8afa9afb0ae7c1", "text": "37ff. 44 Migrant workers\u2019 health in the South-East Asian region subsequent deportation of workers, rather than for the purposes of creating evidence-based policy and improved services.

In terms of data analysis, while a broad range of raw data is available at the local level, data analysis is hindered by the lack of a standardized set of indicators at the national level.105 In host countries where the demand for migrant workers is high, governments may fear an unknown burden of debt for providing health care and may thus seek to control workers\u2019 access to health services or social security initiatives. In these cases, the absence, or lack of consolidation, of reliable data on migrant workers\u2019 health vulnerabilities and health-seeking behaviour hinders the development of effective cost-benefit analyses to address host countries\u2019 concerns regarding the costs of equal access. In source countries with significant numbers of undocumented migrant workers, for example Lao PDR and Cambodia, large numbers of departing workers will have little to no contact with health professionals prior to departure, having received very little preparatory information about health and safety in the host country.106 Given this lack of interaction with health systems and services, there is limited opportunity for the collection of any data on migrant workers\u2019 health. Although private recruitment agencies as well as both international and local non-governmental organizations may interact with migrant workers pre-departure and post-return, there are very few existing mechanisms for sharing or collating this data. In countries across the region, private recruitment agencies are increasingly taking on the soul responsibility for carrying out health assessments in accordance with the needs of receiving countries. However, these agencies are not subject to any mechanism for collating or sharing such data. Data collation and sharing issues are not only a result of the privatization of recruitment processes. Limited multisectoral involvement in monitoring systems within and between government agencies is also an issue. For example, in the case of Lao PDR it is known that embassies and consulates work to connect migrants to social support services, but there is no mechanism for the 103 These are: (1) household registration (TR 38/1), (2) work permit, (3) medical examination, (4) compulsory migrant health insurance, (5) voluntary migrant health insurance, (6) infectious diseases surveillance (506 Report), (7) HIV/AIDS sentinel serosurveillance (506/1 Report), (8) prevention of mother-to-child of HIV database, and (9) migrant health care service utilization and cost. 104 These are: (1) Ministry of Immigration for household registration (TR 38/1), (2) Ministry of Labour for work permit, and (3) Ministry of Public Health for the seven health databases. 105 Jitthai, N. et al., 2010, Migration and HIV/AIDS in Thailand, IOM, p. 21. 106 Lee, C., 2007, \u201cExploitative Labour Brokerage Practices in Cambodia: The Role and Practices of Private Recruitment Agencies\u201d (unpublished paper), cited in Cambodian Development Research Institute, 2011, \u201cIrregular Migration from Cambodia: Characteristics, Challenges and Regulatory Approach\u201d, Working Paper Series No. 58. 45 Section II The Right to Health collation of data on such practices. There is also limited communication among all stakeholders involved throughout the migration cycle, including the Ministry of Labour, embassies abroad, civil societies, and unions.107 In certain countries in the region multi-stakeholder agreements on data collection and consolidation do exist. In Malaysia, for example, agreements exist among the ministries of Home Affairs, Human Resources, and Health to consolidate data,108 much of which may be generated following the planned implementation of a biometric surveillance system that includes migrant workers. On a positive note, countries with a long-established history of labour migration have taken steps towards improving the monitoring of migrant health. For example, the Indonesian Ministry of Health maintains a web-based data collection system, the Indonesian Health Information System, which includes migrant workers. At this stage, however, data is disaggregated only by employment sector, with no differentiation between workers in Indonesia and overseas foreign workers.

Indonesia ratified this early in 2012, and related amendments to its Indonesian Republic Act No. 39 year 2004 regarding Placement and Protection for Indonesian Overseas Workers are currently under discussion in Parliament.110 107 Ibid. 108 Report of Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue, op. cit. 109 United Nations, Treaty Collection, at www.treaties.un.org. 110 These are further discussed in the Philippines and Indonesia country profiles of this report. 46 Migrant workers\u2019 health in the South-East Asian region Since the establishment of the Special Rapporteur on Migrant Workers\u2019 Rights, country visits within ASEAN have been made to Indonesia (2006) and the Philippines (2002). While the focus of the visit to Indonesia was to examine and hear testimonies on the rights of female domestic workers, the focus of the visit to the Philippines was more general, although a key outcome was concern regarding the vulnerability of female workers and the increasing involvement of private recruitment agencies in brokering labour migration.111 The Philippines is also the only country to have ratified the Migration for Employment Convention (C97), the Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention (C143), and the Domestic Workers Convention (C189). In the case of the Convention Concerning Domestic Workers (C189), while the Philippines chaired the Domestic Workers Convention negotiating process and Indonesia expressed strong support, both Singapore and Malaysia abstained from voting on its adoption in 2011. The latter countries stated that the concerns of domestic workers could be addressed within the framework of existing national laws and policies.112 Varying levels of ratification of international standards for promotion and protection of migrant workers\u2019 rights, particularly among host countries within the region, mean that legislated protections for workers vary significantly across the region. There is no agreed joint regional policy approach towards the management and treatment of migrant workers, and in the majority of cases it remains unclear how the competing demands of host and sending countries, and the sometimes competing aims of economic development and migrants\u2019 rights protections, might be reconciled. Although the ASEAN Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of Migrant Workers\u2019 Rights represents formal regional agreement to address cases of abuse and violence towards the region\u2019s workers113 and protect and promote workers\u2019 fundamental human rights, welfare, and human dignity, this declaration is not legally binding. Calls to implement the declaration at the regional and national level have also been hindered for a number of reasons. First, in order for the declaration to be implemented, an instrument for its implementation must be drafted and endorsed. As of mid-2013 a draft instrument on the implementation of the ASEAN Declaration on migrant workers had not been shared, and it remains unclear what range of migrants\u2019 rights it will cover. Regional discussions on policy and legal frameworks have identified a gulf between the international law that comes into existence following convention ratification, and the national laws and policies that might subsequently be implemented under guidance of these conventions. Key challenges relate to: (i) who would be monitoring the implementation of international law within ASEAN; and (ii) which sector or focal point might take charge of implementation within the 111 For full reports, see http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G02/154/42/PDF/G0215442.pdf?OpenElement. 112 Hangzo, P. and Cook, A., \u201cThe Domestic Workers Convention 2011: Implications for migrant domestic workers in Southeast Asia\u201d, Insight: A Publication of the Centre for Non-Traditional Security Studies, April 2012. 113 Bacalla, T., 2012, \u201cASEAN urged to set up mechanism for migrant rights\u201d, Vera Files, 10 September 2012, at http://verafiles.org/asean-urged- to-set-up-mechanism-for-migrant-rights/. 47 Section II The Right to Health national environment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a1e864c-7065-437a-811c-d089be85f0d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a1e864c-7065-437a-811c-d089be85f0d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fdac5b016080a896828e6401262444b79264500e5f8bd3f48f055a465560d5db"}, "2": {"node_id": "31a1e3f1-e3c3-4450-8deb-dfe077cb2d4f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8cfd7de962d88c0c68f523b41c0d64d1fcb87e6fae234b70152e9363bd88e1ca"}}, "hash": "e594fae541ac2ac3fa2f1c5ac50615e563617fb4e1da95553b1d0155bf4e034a", "text": "47 Section II The Right to Health national environment. In those cases where legislated equal access existed, migrant workers were often unaware that such access applied to them.114 In addition, in all sending countries within the region, private recruitment agencies and employees are legally liable to some extent to ensure that the migrant workers they recruit are able to access health protections, such as health insurance and medical care. Under host country regulations, the onus to ensure such access in many cases is on private employers.

In terms of nationally legislated health-related protections currently applicable during the pre- departure stage, labour export law in all six source countries includes reference to pre-departure training, although only the Philippines, Indonesia, and Cambodia have issued policy directives regarding the inclusion of health components during training sessions. Commentary suggests, however, that these components are often only very brief and training in general is delivered close to departure time, when migrants have many other concerns in mind and are unable to absorb such a great deal of information. In reality, many migrant workers will embark on the migration cycle with low levels of health awareness, coupled with low levels of awareness of their rights in terms of health access that may be available to them in the host country, often resulting in also low levels of health-seeking behaviour. The broader efficacy of such pre-departure training is also undermined in certain situations given that a significant majority of workers migrating are undocumented. In Cambodia, for example, the introduction of Prakas 108 on Education of HIV/AIDS, Safe Migration and Labour Rights for Cambodian Workers Abroad was intended to ensure that pre-departure training would be delivered on \u201cworking environments\u2026, labor law, human rights and other customary laws of the country for which they will work.\u201d However, given the fact that up to 95 percent of cross-border migration is now irregular,115 a majority of departing migrants will have no access to such training, nor will they have access to any of the protections included in such training once in the host countries. Once in host countries, South-East Asia\u2019s migrant workers continue to face a range of legislative barriers hindering access to health, exacerbated again by lack of awareness on the part of workers, government officials and health service providers of what limited rights do exist. In the workplace, the variety of jobs in which low-skilled migrant workers are concentrated come with their own particular vulnerabilities in terms of health outcomes. For example, construction workers face a range of occupational health and safety hazards, including working with hazardous tools and materials with no training, working in confined spaces, and lack of language abilities to read safety signs or communicate with managers. Predominantly female domestic workers also face situations of abuse, bonded labour, and lack of 114 Report of Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue, op. cit., pp. 32ff. 115 Cambodian Development Research Institute, 2011, \u201cIrregular Migration from Cambodia: Characteristics, Challenges and Regulatory Approach\u201d, Working Paper Series No. 58, p. 9; Djamin, R. , 2011, \u201cMigrant Workers and the State: A Regional Agenda\u201d, presentation delivered at UNESCO Conference on Migrant Workers in Asia: Policies and Practices in Social Science, 14 July 2011. 48 Migrant workers\u2019 health in the South-East Asian region access to rest, leading to a variety of adverse health outcomes. Yet lack of employment security can leave migrant workers with little or no ability to seek redress for rights violations with regard to their own health outcomes. With specific regard to HIV/AIDS, a continuing area of concern in the ASEAN region is the existence of HIV-related travel restrictions on entry, stay, and residence in three of the four host countries within the region: Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore. Although migration is not a risk factor for HIV, the conditions encountered during the migration cycle have been found to increase migrant vulnerability to HIV; and migrant workers are currently included as vulnerable populations under HIV/AIDS country strategies in each of the countries within the ASEAN region. For example, data from a recent Integrated Bio Behavioural Surveillance (IBBS) study in the six provinces with the highest HIV prevalence rates in Thailand has shown higher HIV-prevalence rates among migrant workers than the national population, with 2.5 percent for workers from Cambodia and 1.16 percent for those from Myanmar.

While some host countries have piloted such initiatives as the provision of volunteer migrant health workers who are able to act as interpreters (Thailand) and establishing hotlines staffed by experienced migrant workers (Singapore), these initiatives are not widespread, and often are only pilot projects or are carried out ad hoc in the region. They are also significantly hindered by the lack of data on the health-care seeking habits and patterns of migrant workers, which are needed to provide an evidence base to support the continuation or extension of such programmes. For example, although research on workplace management for linguistically diverse migrant workers in Brunei suggests that lack of language skills plays a key role in the inability to access services,117 translators or interpreters are not provided in health care facilities, primarily as a result 116 Marin, M., \u201cMigrant-Sensitive Health Services\u201d, presentation delivered at ASEAN Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue on Migrant Workers\u2019 Access to Health and HIV Services in the ASEAN Region, November 2011. 117 Santoso, D., 2009, \u201cThe construction site as a multicultural workplace: A perspective of minority workers in Brunei\u201d, Construction Management and Economics, vol. 27, p. 532. 49 Section II The Right to Health of the lack of data to advocate for their necessity.118 Where interpreters are required in the provision of health promotion and care, it is necessary to rely on members of the existing workforce.119 In the case of Thailand, while migrant worker volunteers from Cambodia and Myanmar may be engaged in provincial areas, these programmes are hindered by government restrictions on the type of work migrants are able to carry out, which prevents the formal hiring of qualified Cambodian or Burmese migrants to work to provide ongoing translation services.120 One important health access initiative introduced during the pre-departure stage, aimed at enhancing systems sensitive to the health of migrant workers, is the legislated access to portable health insurance. For example, under a Philippines Government initiative, migrant workers are provided with life and personal accident insurance and monetary benefits for work-related injuries, illness, or disability during employment abroad. In 2011 the Indonesian Ministry of Labour also passed a decree on insurance for migrant workers, although this insurance mechanism can only be used for opportunistic infections; and at this stage, initial reports also suggest that the process of accessing insurance can be quite complicated, and possession of a policy does not guarantee the rights of labour migrants to claim insurance in host countries, with a number of reported difficulties in lodging claims.121 One area where the Philippines\u2019 work on the creation of migrant-sensitive systems for its workers has been used as a good practice for other sending countries relates to its work on repatriation and reintegration of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) deported from host countries after having been found to be HIV-positive. As discussed in Section II of this report and in relevant country profiles, Brunei, Singapore, and Malaysia place restrictions on travel, entry, and stay of people living with HIV, as do countries in the Arab States, which are host to increasing numbers of low- and semi-skilled OFWs. The Philippines has now established legislation and policies that aim to protect its migrant workers in this regard, including the Republic Act 8504: Philippine AIDS Prevention and Control Act, Department Order 01-04 s. 2006 (Guidelines on the Referral System of Repatriated OFWs Diagnosed with HIV Abroad) and Memorandum circular on implementation of RA10022 with respect to referral/ decking system being implemented by OFW clinics. A national strategic plan and programmes also exist to address migrant workers\u2019 access to HIV services, although discussions suggest that there are a number of challenges in implementation, including: (i) gaps in relationships between the Department of Labour and embassies in countries receiving Filipino workers; and (ii) where issues related to undocumented workers are handled by the Department of Foreign Affairs and those related to documented workers are handled by Department of Labor, there is no mechanism for referral. 118 Report of Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue, op. cit. 119 Ibid. 120 National Human Rights Commission of Thailand, 2008, Good Practices to Protect and Promote Migrant Workers\u2019 Rights in Thailand: Lessons- learnt from NHRCT and its counterparts through people\u2019s capacity building and networking for enhancing human rights mechanisms, p. 8.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7bae4b0-ff8e-48e6-8cc5-c6ed040ee6b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7bae4b0-ff8e-48e6-8cc5-c6ed040ee6b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca1371d7084104a4890da90edef49ac4f2456e1f4666a45c6645cb7879ad80f7"}, "2": {"node_id": "9e88d8b3-33f7-483b-9d00-69e05c514653", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "06e5dab70f3872fa025d96b75f852e692fbb190d79565174d45c7955407dc353"}}, "hash": "fdaae2a02ddce7df05489057b81616678dcc9030689501b25e4959492e67fd96", "text": "8. 121 IOM, 2011, Labour Migration from Indonesia, discussions at ASEAN Multi-stakeholder Dialogue on Migrant Workers\u2019 Access to Health and HIV Services in the ASEAN Region, November 2011. 50 Migrant workers\u2019 health in the South-East Asian region Partnerships,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b87ff67-f558-45fb-b417-352f64acae45": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b87ff67-f558-45fb-b417-352f64acae45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "75bac5511795d2357841a58cc50fff1a583618d22bb610ec84af770df4f2b07b"}, "3": {"node_id": "1546fd99-59d6-4ccc-bf15-86d46a7ca56a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db9a4132fa3bd365441e492dbcc5cdd07bd80176922d381bb8d8fd51d759d857"}}, "hash": "560c73ce1355e714b519aa010c0f86605280ba1b944514300c73e0e268d72223", "text": "networks, and multi-country frameworks A number of multi-country and regional initiatives exist that include a focus on migrant health, including: the Colombo Process,122 which at its most recent regional meeting in 2011 addressed migrant health under the broader thematic focus of \u2018migration with dignity\u2019;

In the construction industry, more than 85 percent of employees are temporary residents, predominantly temporary migrant workers. Similarly, more than 80 percent of employees in mining and related industries and 75 percent of employees in the agricultural, forestry, and fishery sector are temporary migrant workers.129 127 Brunei Final MDG Second Report, op. cit. 128 Santoso, op. cit., pp. 529 527. 129 Ibid, p. 9. 58 Country profile: Brunei Darussalam The demand for migrant workers in Brunei continues to grow, with reports in early 2012 suggesting that Brunei was facing a shortage of approximately 40,000 workers in various sectors, including construction, mining, and services.130 In-migration overview There are approximately 100,000 documented migrant workers in Brunei,131 primarily found in what the nation\u2019s employment legislation terms \u2018industrial undertakings\u2019 \u2014 including mining and related industries, construction, and transport.132 As in other countries, estimates of the number of undocumented workers are difficult to confirm.

Although Brunei does not tend to utilize bilateral MoU with source countries as a means to manage labour migration, recent news reports suggest that Indonesia has instigated discussions with Brunei regarding the establishment of MoU on the placement and protection of its migrant workers in the country.139 Brunei has not ratified the International Convention on the Protection of Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families or the ILO\u2019s Migration for Employment Convention (No. 97), Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention (No. 143), or the 2011 Domestic Workers Convention (No. 189). In late 2011 it was reported that Brunei was in the process of amending the Employment Order 2009 to be in line with certain ILO standards on labour migration; however, it is unclear what form these amendments will take and when they might be enforced.140 As is the case across the region, private recruitment agencies play a strong role in the placement and potential protection of migrant workers in Brunei. Lack of resources to monitor these agencies has allowed migrant workers travelling to Brunei to be exploited and/or abused throughout the migration cycle. Despite efforts in early 2012 to tighten the licensing requirements for private recruitment agencies, migrant workers reportedly continue to be subject to such rights abuses as debt bondage, non-payment of wages, passport confiscation, abusive employers, and confinement to the home.141 Generally speaking, while legislation governing labour migration does not focus on the protection of migrant workers\u2019 rights, the government has recently implemented certain policy measures aimed at protecting migrant workers, including arrival briefings, inspections of workplace facilities, and a telephone hotline for worker complaints.142 Immigration Act 2006 Regulation 15 of this act sets out the rules regarding entrance of non-citizens for work or employment. All those who intend to work in Brunei, with the exception of Malaysian and Singaporean citizens, must be in possession of a valid Employment Pass, which specifies an individual\u2019s employer and is valid for a maximum period of five years. Workers are restricted to the original employer through whom the labour pass was obtained. Immigration law allows for prison sentences and caning for workers who overstay passes, for undocumented immigrants seeking work, and for workers employed by companies other than their initial sponsor.143 Further regulations under this act deem it an offence to employ any person who has entered Brunei without a proper labour permit, has had this permit cancelled, or has re-entered following 139 NZ Week, Indonesia working on MoU on migrant workers with 6 countries, 1 February 2013, at http://www.nzweek.com/world/indonesia- working-on-mou-on-migrant-workers-with-6-countries-46903/. 140 Report of Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue, op. cit., p. 47. 141 Quratal-Ain Bandial, \u201cBrunei on Tier 2 of human trafficking list\u201d, The Brunei Times, 22 June 2012, at http://www.bt.com.bn/news- national/2012/06/22/brunei-tier-2-human-trafficking-list. 142 US Department of State, 2010, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Brunei, p. 15. 143 Ibid. 60 Country profile: Brunei Darussalam previous removal. Employers may also be held liable for any costs incurred by the government with regard to maintenance, repatriation, or removal of those whose permits are cancelled or who contravene the regulations of the act.144 Research suggests that, in practice, many undocumented workers will enter the country on short- term social visits or visit passes, then overstay the granted period for these passes and take on work. There are also reports of domestic and construction workers paying fictitious employers in order to obtain labour passes before working freelance.145 In some cases, migrant workers have been held responsible for their own illegal status, although this has occurred as a result of a former employers\u2019 negligence rather than through fault of their own.146 Employment Order 2009 This legislation provides migrant workers,147 with the exception of domestic workers and seamen, with many of the same legal protections as Brunei citizens employed in the private sector under standard contracts of service.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93f72269-8a65-494f-9680-caa8df40520e": {"__data__": {"id_": "93f72269-8a65-494f-9680-caa8df40520e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85e1e55ae648bdbe7932cd64adc41faec058737a45169e3f27f2def7657a363d"}, "2": {"node_id": "62262ad7-eb60-4f6e-a9c9-e0cb3c964e5b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f9ad89635c7ba8e288c7387be2c70120bab5d7dfdf91799e54c86f17d2832bc"}}, "hash": "34f6478f00e65cba038f2e810b4c8641b87f560bc5eeae115b8ac97e987a9f83", "text": "Legislated protections include minimum standards for contracts of service, including a maximum salary period of one month.148 The Employment Order also prohibits withholding of salaries by private recruitment agencies, and those who fail to comply with these regulations can be fined up to $3,000 and jailed for one year.

The prohibition of salary withholding by private recruitment agencies also provides little protection for migrant workers who have signed contracts of service with recruitment agencies in source countries, which are not held to the same minimum standards as those legislated in Brunei.153 Although it is unclear how many complaints have been filed against recruitment agencies, contractors, or subcontractors, or what the rate of success of such complaints has been, the Department of Labour reported in 2012 that it was making efforts to begin enforcing these legislated licensing requirements for all recruitment agencies.154 Recent research also suggests that within construction worksites an absence of reliable or direct channels to convey complaints to management, whether due to language issues or to management not taking complaints seriously, can lead to a lack of protection of migrants\u2019 rights under legislation.155 Employment (Domestic Workers) Regulations 2009 This additional set of regulations details which of the regulations contained in the Employment Order 2009 cover domestic workers. Applicable protections include minimum standards for contracts of service and maximum salary periods, while clear exceptions include eligibility for a range of health benefits, including maternity leave. In practice, while reports suggest that new employers of domestic workers are briefed on labour laws and regulations, and that, for example, domestic workers are required to be present during the signing of employment contracts so that labour officers can brief them on their rights and obligations,156 domestic workers continue to face violations of the protections proscribed in national employment legislation. For example, recent news coverage of cases under trial this year in Brunei includes the case of an Indonesian domestic worker held under forced labour conditions.157 Domestic workers from Indonesia have reportedly faced salary being withheld for between two and three months, while some families have been found to withhold wages to compensate for labour broker or recruitment fees that they are charged and as a tool with which to maintain the service of the workers.158 Further documented rights violations include passport confiscation, confinement to the home, and contract switching. 152 Ibid. 153 United States Department of State, 2012, 2012 Trafficking in Persons Report Brunei. 154 Bandial, Quratal-Ain, \u201cBrunei on Tier 2 of human trafficking list\u201d, The Brunei Times, 22 June 2012, at http://www.bt.com.bn/news- national/2012/06/22/brunei-tier-2-human-trafficking-list. 155 Santoso, op. cit. 156 Bandial, Quratul-Ain, \u201cMigrant Workers\u2019 Complaints Drop\u201d, The Brunei Times, 20 August 2011, at http://www.bt.com.bn/news- national/2011/08/20/migrant-workers-complaints-drop. 157 Bandial, \u201cBrunei on Tier 2 of human trafficking list\u201d, op cit.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e970d3e0-6846-46cf-acc4-9cb1aafe7105": {"__data__": {"id_": "e970d3e0-6846-46cf-acc4-9cb1aafe7105", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0344db2891fb59ed72bbed0fe3627b5237a80cd800b9b1fa88ee8ede3dccb6c3"}, "2": {"node_id": "9bd797e3-4f24-4cdd-a442-641ffbdd5649", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b22c113de388cc849e2aed2113e0d14c68003df39cb26203f68d2040c8c566d"}}, "hash": "fa3144e53272ccfd0efa9b66fdfb9ca69e572314b16f72213867e916439d9477", "text": "158 CARAM Asia, 2011, Reality Check: Rights and Legislation for Migrant Domestic Workers. 62 Country profile: Brunei Darussalam LABOUR MIGRATION AND THE RIGHT TO HEALTH In terms of international standards on right to health for all, Brunei is not a signatory to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which provides the most comprehensive provisions for the protections of the right to health.

Importantly, as a Member State of the World Health Organization, Brunei is committed to the WHO Resolution on the Health of Migrants, adopted at the 61st World Health Assembly in 2008, which recognizes increased health risks for groups of migrants and calls for the promotion of migrant-sensitive health policies and equitable access to health promotion, disease prevention, and care.159 It is unclear, however, how this resolution has enhanced health care and access for migrant workers in Brunei since its endorsement in 2008. Monitoring migrants\u2019 health Migrant rights\u2019 groups, non-government organizations, and international organizations have advocated for the inclusion of migrant workers under Brunei\u2019s policy of universal health care. Generally speaking, inadequate relevant surveillance systems mean there is almost no data on migrant worker\u2019s health needs and health seeking behaviour.160 Despite constituting more than 25 percent of the private sector workforce, migrant workers are not separated from the general workforce in government health strategy, and disaggregated data on migrant workers is not kept. Given this lack of data, an evidence base to advocate for migrant workers\u2019 inclusion in health financing is difficult to compile. Policies and legal frameworks affecting migrant health The provision of health care to citizens and permanent residents is a strong priority of the government of Brunei. Both these groups are eligible for government-funded access to health care, and total expenditure on health per capita is $1,486 \u2014 considerably more than the regional average.161 However, temporary residents, including migrant workers, are not eligible for government-funded health care, and all health care provided must be privately-funded. 159 WHA 61.17, Resolution on Health of Migrants. 160 Report of Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue, op. cit., p. 52. 161 WHO, Country Health Profile: Brunei Darussalam, at http://www.who.int/countries/brn/en/. 63 The Right to Health Section III Within national legislation, health care access and coverage for migrant workers is currently based on a system of employer liability. According to the Employment Order 2009 employers are responsible for providing for \u201cmedical attention and treatment with medicines of good quality, first aid equipment\u201d162 as well as provisions for paid leave during pregnancy and after childbirth (although domestic workers are not eligible for the latter). While employers are not mandated to provide medical insurance for foreign workers, the Labour Commissioner has publicly advised employers to take on medical insurance for employees, in order to reduce their costs in case of an accident and to prevent the burden of debt on the Ministry of Health.163 In addition to covering medical attention and care, employers are also mandated to provide documented migrant workers with accommodations and sanitary arrangements that are sufficient and hygienic, as well as a sufficient supply of wholesome water.164 Regarding health in the workplace specifically, the Workplace Safety Health Order 2009 covers migrant workers alongside citizens in the private sector and stipulates minimum measures for protecting employees in the workplace. The order includes the regulations for incident reporting, first aid, risk management, workplace safety and health, registration of factories, construction, and abrasive blasting. According to this order, employers are responsible for taking measures necessary to ensure the workplace health and safety of employees, including the provision of necessary training and supervision.165 While research on the extent of implementation and enforcement of health-related components of the above-mentioned legislation is limited, reports suggest that while the Department of Labour has generally enforced labour regulations effectively, enforcement in the unskilled labour sector has been lax, especially for migrant workers at construction sites. Although the law permits a worker to leave a hazardous job site without jeopardizing his employment, this does not generally occur.166 More generally speaking, the fact that liability for payment and facilitation of health access lies with employers can render such protections far less accessible for low-skilled migrant workers who may fear termination of employment due to injury or need for health care.

Migrant-sensitive health systems There are no existing national government or non-government networks focused on addressing migrant workers\u2019 health needs. Although research on workplace management for linguistically diverse migrant workers in Brunei suggests that lack of language skills plays a key role in the inability to access services,169 translators or interpreters are not provided in health care facilities, although this may be more a result of the lack of data to advocate for their necessity.170 Where interpreters are required in the provision of health promotion and care, it is necessary to rely on the existing workforce.171 Partnerships, networks, and multi-country frameworks Brunei has no formal established bilateral agreements with source countries, and in the past the country has declared it has no intention to enter into formal bilateral or multilateral agreements on labour migration, despite a strong push from established source countries such as the Philippines.172 While recent reports from the Indonesian Minister for Manpower and Transmigration suggest that Indonesia has instigated talks with the Brunei Government on the possibility of a MoU concerning protection and welfare of its workers in Brunei,173 it is unclear what stages such talks have reached. 168 Report of Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue, op. cit.; supplemented by feedback provided by Brunei Ministry of Health official on first draft of this report. 169 Santoso, op. cit. 170 Report of Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue, op. cit. 171 Ibid. 172 OECD, 2004, Migration for Employment: Bilateral Agreements at a Crossroads, p. 192. 173 \u201cIndonesia working on MoU on migrant workers with 6 countries\u201d, op. cit. 65 The Right to Health Section III RECOMMENDATIONS Monitoring migrants\u2019 health 7 Design and implement systems for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of disaggregated data on migrant workers, examining health care needs and health-seeking behaviour. 8 Carry out cost analysis for the inclusion of migrant workers alongside citizens and permanent residents in the provision of government-funded universal access to health care.

Where economic growth has occurred in the country, it has not been matched by employment growth,174 leading to an impending influx of approximately 250,000 new entrants into the job market annually.175 The government currently promotes overseas employment as a general poverty alleviation strategy,176 and the country\u2019s National Strategic Development Plan 2009\u20132013 prioritizes finding jobs for workers abroad in response to rising unemployment levels, particularly among those in the 15\u201324 year age range.177 In terms of drivers for migration, the majority of Cambodians migrate due to increased income opportunities abroad.178 In 2010 remittances from Cambodian migrants reached $0.4 billion, constituting approximately 3 percent of GDP.179 Research has found that up to 40 percent of Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand report remittances as the main income source for their family. Such remittances are spent on food, debt repayment, health care, agricultural inputs, and durable household assets.180 In addition, the reported payment of large cash advances by 174 Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training/ILO, 2010, Policy on Labour Migration for Cambodia. For example, between 2005 and 2007 an average 10.5 percent growth in GDP was accompanied by only a 2.5 percent growth in employment. 175 Asia Foundation, 2011, Cambodia\u2019s Labor Migration: Analysis of the legal framework.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b4405e8-92bd-44e1-a6d3-85149575f769": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b4405e8-92bd-44e1-a6d3-85149575f769", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4165ae7421de26a8d726a5279cce449ae080c2dc3dac971acd058b78a85a21b9"}, "2": {"node_id": "8ab30012-be6a-40c5-ab46-6314e8e71376", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b770d0e1ea9260b6cc839cad8b9bed8218776b4ffae896c58c396c3fa7467298"}}, "hash": "0f5b75ecb3749d27df5b52ee7b3e85913cd478ceb3ef058eabbda2d5d9c9bae2", "text": "175 Asia Foundation, 2011, Cambodia\u2019s Labor Migration: Analysis of the legal framework. 176 Human Rights Watch, 2011, They Deceived Us at Every Step: Abuse of Cambodian Domestic Workers Migrating to Malaysia, p. 77. 177 Royal Government of Cambodia, 2010, National Strategic Development Plan, Update, 2009\u20132013, p. 158. 178 They Deceived Us at Every Step, op. cit. 179 Asian Trends Monitoring, 2012, \u201cLow-income migration, when the marginalized move across borders\u201d, Bulletin 14, p. 6, at http://www. asiantrendsmonitoring.com/2012/01/06/bulletin-14-low-income-migration-when-the-marginalised-move-across-borders/. 180 \u201cIrregular Migration from Cambodia\u201d, op. cit., p. 9. 68 Country profile: Cambodia recruitment agencies to impoverished families has offered additional incentive for migrants to seek employment abroad.181 Despite a government push for formalized migration policies and processes, it is important to note that officially managed labour migration is a relatively new phenomenon in Cambodia. Cross-border Cambodian migrants can be classified into two categories, namely, \u2018short-term, short range\u2019 workers engaging in daily cross-border work and \u2018long-term\u2019 workers engaging in migration to central, eastern, and southern provinces of Thailand or to Malaysia.182 Recent research suggests that up to 95 percent of all cross-border migration is irregular, citing the complexity, cost, and time-consuming nature of formal recruitment processes as the main reason behind such high levels of movement outside official processes.183 Out-migration overview Major destinations for cross-border migrant workers are Thailand, Malaysia, and South Korea.184 Recent estimates by the Cambodian Ministry of Labour suggest that approximately 125,000 documented Cambodians are working abroad in these countries, plus Japan.185 Current Thai Government estimates of the number of documented and undocumented Cambodian workers in that country range between 120,000 and 180,000.186 Past estimates from Cambodian officials in Malaysia have suggested that approximately 40,000 Cambodians were working in Malaysia between 2008 and April 2011,187 while more recent reports suggest that up to 50,000 female Cambodian domestic workers could be working in Malaysia today.188 More accurate estimates of migrant", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1bd7e3c-f795-40a2-ac86-e515259b841e": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1bd7e3c-f795-40a2-ac86-e515259b841e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da183bc8d200031ada9d88b810320c47bacd82f03921807650e691ce77db32e1"}, "3": {"node_id": "81ee915f-f126-48b7-8359-e642fdda2fd1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a14572d9dd452af331cb4e306741ea488704aac8902a261c11596b89a07491c"}}, "hash": "0841a3973dd5489e5ec7ef9e4e92d500cf172ef25fc5da574e2724fd5c30da49", "text": "worker numbers are difficult to ascertain, given the fact that most cross-border migration is irregular. A 2011 survey of 507 households in six high-migration villages in Cambodia \u2014 including returned and intending migrant workers, government officers, migration experts, and local community chiefs \u2014 found that irregular migration had been the most popular form among Cambodian workers seeking jobs overseas.189 While legal recruitment is complex, slow, and costly (approximately $700 to Thailand), informal recruitment requires only a few days, few or no documents, and a considerably lower cost ($100\u2013180).190 181 Ibid. 182 IOM, 2011, Thailand Migration Report, p. 14. 183 \u201cIrregular Migration from Cambodia\u201d, op. cit., p. 9; Djamin, R., 2011, \u201cMigrant Workers and the State: A Regional Agenda\u201d, presentation delivered at UNESCO Conference on Migrant Workers in Asia: Policies and Practices in Social Science, 14 July 2011. 184 Asia Foundation, 2011, Cambodia\u2019s Labor Migration: Analysis of the Legal Framework, p. 4. 185 ASEAN-China Free Trade Area, 2012, \u201cCambodian legislators, officials talk to enhance migrant worker rights\u201d, 12 November 2012, at http:// www.asean-cn.org/Item/6491.aspx. 186 IOM, 2011, Thailand Migration Report. 187 They Deceived Us at Every Step, op. cit. 188 Radio Free Asia, 2013, \u201cMalaysian Couple Breaks Maid\u2019s Jaw\u201d, 5 June 2012, at http://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/jaw-06052012181109. html. 189 Philippine Institute for Development Studies, 2011, \u201cIrregular Migration from Cambodia: Characteristics, Challenges and Regulatory Approach\u201d, Discussion Paper Series No.2011 26. 190 Ibid. 69 The Right to Health Section III Gender distribution amongst cross-border migrant workers is also difficult to ascertain given the dominance of irregular migration; however, it is estimated that more than half of all documented migrant workers from Cambodia are female.191 It is important to note that this overall distribution ratio differs significantly according to country of destination. Among registered workers heading to Thailand, approximately 63 percent are male and engaged in the agriculture and construction industries, while females are predominantly engaged in the agriculture and, to a lesser degree, household sectors.192 While Cambodian workers travelling to South Korea are generally male, working in manufacturing, construction, and agriculture, workers heading to Malaysia are predominantly female domestic workers.193 Accurate data on the deployment of female domestic workers to Malaysia has been particularly difficult to gather in recent years, primarily due to the effects of government-issued moratoria on such deployments following high-profile cases of abuse in Malaysia. In 2008, following an Indonesian Government moratorium on the deployment of Indonesian household workers to Malaysia, recruitment agencies increasingly turned to Cambodia to obtain domestic workers. The Malaysian Embassy in Phnom Penh subsequently estimated that the number of visas issued to Cambodian domestic workers more than tripled between 2008 and early 2010, with Malaysia issuing approximately 24,700 work visas to new and extending domestic workers from Cambodia in 2010.194 In 2011, however, the Cambodian Government issued a similar moratorium on the deployment of Cambodian workers to Malaysia following further reports of abuse, and in some cases, deaths of workers. While this moratorium has led to a decline in official deployments in recent years, it is suggested that this decline has been mirrored by an increase in irregular migration of female migrant workers. LABOUR MIGRATION GOVERNANCE Out-migration of Cambodian labour migrants and the related management of this process by private recruitment agencies is governed by Sub-decree 190 on the Management of the Sending of Cambodian Workers Abroad through Private Recruitment Agencies (revised August 2011). In December 2013 the government also launched eight new prakas (ministerial regulations) to support the implementation of Sub-decree 190. These cover the recruitment process and pre- departure orientation training, operating standards, on-site and repatriation services, inspection requirements for private recruitment agencies, and complaint receiving mechanisms for migrant workers.195 In addition to this legislation, general approaches to labour migration governance are addressed in the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training\u2019s Policy on Labour Migration 191 Reality Check: Rights and Legislation for Migrant Workers, op. cit., p. 7. 192 IOM, Thailand Migration Report 2011, p. 12.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81ee915f-f126-48b7-8359-e642fdda2fd1": {"__data__": {"id_": "81ee915f-f126-48b7-8359-e642fdda2fd1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da183bc8d200031ada9d88b810320c47bacd82f03921807650e691ce77db32e1"}, "2": {"node_id": "d1bd7e3c-f795-40a2-ac86-e515259b841e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0841a3973dd5489e5ec7ef9e4e92d500cf172ef25fc5da574e2724fd5c30da49"}}, "hash": "4a14572d9dd452af331cb4e306741ea488704aac8902a261c11596b89a07491c", "text": "7. 192 IOM, Thailand Migration Report 2011, p. 12. 193 Asia Foundation, 2011, Cambodia\u2019s Labor Migration: Analysis of the Legal Framework, p. 8. 194 Reality Check: Rights and Legislation for Migrant Workers, op. cit., p. 25. 195 For an English translation of these eight prakas, including related annexes, see http://apmagnet.ilo.org/resources/cambodian-prakas- ministerial-orders-2. 70 Country profile: Cambodia for Cambodia, formulated in 2010 with technical assistance from the International Labour Organization.

Although the country is a signatory to the ICMW, it has been noted that its provisions may have limited application for the protection of Cambodian migrant workers given that none of the primary host countries for workers have signed or ratified the ICMW, and workers are subject to the laws of these countries throughout the majority of the migration cycle.197 While the government\u2019s National Strategic Development Plan, Update 2009\u20132013, contains a commitment to improving working conditions overseas, particularly for female Cambodians,198 general commentary on legislation and policy related to labour migration of Cambodian workers has labelled it as sporadic and limited, without comprehensive coverage.199 Some of the key reasons cited for abuse of workers\u2019 rights during the migration process include lack of clarity on key stakeholder roles and responsibilities, lack of ability to monitor practices of recruitment agencies, and lack of serious punishment for corrupt recruitment agencies. Policies on labour migration for Cambodia The Cambodian Government\u2019s policy on labour migration, formulated in 2010 with the assistance of the International Labour Organization, identifies the three main policy challenges for migration as being: (i) improved governance; (ii) protection and empowerment of workers; and (iii) harnessing migration for development.200 It has been noted, however, that while this policy document may emphasize the need to protect migrant workers, protection is not a central theme in the regulatory 196 Royal Embassy of Cambodia UK, 2012, \u201cCambodia\u2019s Parliament Passes Deal to Send Laborers to Qatar\u201d, 26 August 2012, at http://www. cambodianembassy.org.uk/e-news/index.php?lang=&menu=2&menucat0=0&k=1&year=2012&month=8&readmore=1&ck=6&page=0. 197 Chan, S., 2009, \u201cReview of labour migration management, policies and legal framework in Cambodia\u201d, ILO Asia-Pacific Working Paper Series, p. 11. 198 Royal Government of Cambodia, 2010, National Strategic Development Plan, Update, 2009\u20132013, p. 158. 199 \u201cIrregular Migration from Cambodia\u201d, op. cit., p. 11. 200 Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training/ILO, 2010, Policy on Labour Migration for Cambodia. 71 The Right to Health Section III provisions of the Cambodian Government.201 It is also particularly important to note that this recently formulated labour policy contains few references to the management and protection of irregular migrants, who constitute the great majority of labour migrants from Cambodia.202 Certain specific recommendations for ensuring adequate protection for migrant workers, for example, the posting of labour attach\u00e9s to Cambodian embassies abroad, were key recommendations in this 2010 policy document,203 but it is unclear the extent to which these initiatives have been implemented. To date, it has been reported that one embassy secretary in each of Malaysia, Thailand, and South Korea has been temporarily assigned to handle work related to Cambodian migrants.204 Further protective measures recommended in this policy document have also proven difficult to implement, including: (i) the provision of effective remedies to all migrant workers in cases of rights violations; (ii) the creation of effective channels through which migrant workers can lodge complaints against abusive practices and fraud; and (iii) the implementation of effective enforcement mechanisms and sanctions to deter unethical recruitment practices.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a67f0f00-0bd1-412f-b6ff-03c00fe562ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "a67f0f00-0bd1-412f-b6ff-03c00fe562ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "066a2a0c514fe8aea580cc169345cdbb443991e62a688bc95103a911f2009650"}, "2": {"node_id": "83d10b61-ba2a-49a0-8e79-e12d9526f0b3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa0fa0a20d4010888f7fc1a5bd06636c9b9f8a26b74c1d6b1585f10b8030471b"}}, "hash": "326b7446b7ce69c67b6c0bbbc4b0765e10e84865db03eb7a2c604cee5dd8c7f7", "text": "The key reasons cited for these difficulties are the increased involvement of private recruitment agencies in labour migration processes, lack of clarity of stakeholder roles in legislation, and lack of capacity and resources for monitoring and legislation enforcement.205 Sub-decree 190 on the Management of the Sending of Cambodian Workers Abroad through Private Recruitment Agencies This sub-decree essentially replaces the earlier Sub-Decree 57 on Sending Khmer Migrants to Work Abroad. While it names the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training (MoLVT) as the key government agency responsible for sending Cambodian workers abroad, it also essentially turns over responsibility for all stages of the migration cycle \u2014 including recruitment, pre- departure training, employment/contracting, and travel \u2014 to private recruitment agencies.

In particular, research conducted by Human Rights Watch in 2011 on Cambodian domestic workers being deployed to Malaysia noted that the Cambodian Government had not taken concrete steps to properly investigate or punish those responsible for instances of abuse of legislated protections, including: credible reports of child recruitment and abuses in training centres, including the deaths of three women in training centres during the previous year.211 Nevertheless, in the first case of a successful prosecution, a Cambodian court in September 2011 convicted a manager of the VC Manpower Recruitment Agency and sentenced him to 13 months in prison for illegally detaining underage workers. With the 2013 launch of eight prakas to supplement legislation on sending migrant workers abroad, the government was able to address a number of the criticisms and issues described above. For example, the Prakas on Private Recruitment Agencies details specific requirements, including security bonds and reporting requirements, for permission to operate for private recruitment agencies.212 The Prakas on Inspection of Private Recruitment Agencies also details inspection requirements for recruitment agency premises, including provisions for special inspections following MoLVT\u2019s receipt of complaints relating to labour disputes, working conditions, illness, work related accidents, or general misconduct.213 The Prakas on the Recruitment Process and Pre- departure Orientation and Training contains step-by-step outlines of the duties and responsibilities of parties involved in the deployment of migrant workers departing Cambodia. In addition, the Prakas on the Promulgation of Minimum Standards of Job Placement Services Abroad Contracts contains provisions aimed to address the previous absence of standards for working conditions, job status, and benefits for migrant workers, while the Prakas on Complaint Receiving Mechanism for Migrant Workers lays out the mode and means for formulating, submitting, receiving, and responding to complaints from migrant workers. This stronger set of standards establishes the systems and services to address some of the contract violations experienced by migrant workers, as identified in a CARAM Asia study in partnership with the national civil society organization Tenaganita. For example, violations experienced by migrant domestic workers, including changes in their working conditions (such as lower wages and debt bondage); irregular or no payment of wages; verbal, sexual, and physical abuse; and confiscation of personal documents.214 208 Ibid. 209 Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights (LICADHO) 2011, \u201cComments on the Sub-decree on the Management of the Sending of Cambodian Workers Abroad Through Private Recruitment Agencies.\u201d 210 Ibid., p. 11. 211 They Deceived Us at Every Step, op. cit. 212 articles 3, 4, 5. 213 article 3. 214 Reality Check: Rights and Legislation for Migrant Workers, op. cit.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79ec220d-43e2-4965-b8a2-a56b0fe2c84b": {"__data__": {"id_": "79ec220d-43e2-4965-b8a2-a56b0fe2c84b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "91c8151342ae56751a19ed2219b97674838eb21fa3924c27b6628e557f51a7ef"}, "2": {"node_id": "c5a5231e-84e3-46ee-8719-b6db03e55db0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b42a080ba8457c36342e47b6659890f149546a38b0f81ee52a8f6f0d18a94fef"}}, "hash": "914c9f77bf9f9b694c0d3e6ba26fd9cc865368125720f2194e0bac13837698ae", "text": "214 Reality Check: Rights and Legislation for Migrant Workers, op. cit. 73 The Right to Health Section III Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of Thailand and the Government of Cambodia on Cooperation in the Employment of Workers Cambodia signed this memorandum of understanding with Thailand in 2002 in an effort to regulate existing migration practices.

These work permits are then renewable for another four years, after which it would be necessary to leave Thailand for a period of three years before re-registering. Upon their introduction, MoU processes were intended to become the official method for recruiting new migrant workers from Cambodia to Thailand. However, at the end 2010 only approximately 50,000 workers had been recruited via the MoU processes, with workers continuing to engage in short-term, undocumented, cross-border work. Due to the continuing existence of a parallel system of registration for undocumented Cambodian workers already in Thailand, new workers were also less likely to engage in relatively costly and lengthy MoU recruitment processes. For further information on labour migration governance for Cambodian migrant workers and the operation of both MoU and parallel registration processes in Thailand, please see the Thailand Country Profile of this report. Bilateral memoranda of understanding between Cambodia and Malaysia In October 2011, the Cambodian Prime Minister announced an indefinite ban on the sending of Cambodian domestic workers to Malaysia. This official ban came as a response to increasing reports of abuse, including a number of deaths, of Cambodian migrant workers in Malaysia. According to the details of the ban, those maids that were already contracted and in possession of travel documents were permitted to be deployed.216 However, human rights groups and parliamentary opposition members in Cambodia nevertheless reported that some recruitment agencies were ignoring the ban and sending new workers.217 In February 2012, the Cambodian Working Group for Domestic Workers, a coalition of civil society groups, submitted a formal Call to Action endorsed by 65 national and international civil society groups, calling upon the governments of Cambodia and Malaysia to \u201csign a bilateral agreement 215 Chantanavich, S. and Jayagupta, R., 2010, \u201cImmigration to Thailand: The Case of Migrant Workers from Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia\u201d, in Segal, Elliot et al.

Given this lack of interaction with health systems and services, there is limited opportunity for the collection of any data on migrant workers\u2019 health. While private recruitment agencies, as well as both international and local non-governmental organizations, may interact with migrant workers during pre-departure and post-return, there are also no existing mechanisms for sharing or collating this data. Cambodian Government representatives in regional multi-stakeholder discussions have noted this lack of coordinated management of limited health screening data, citing a lack of funds to support the development of comprehensive data surveillance systems and the difficulty of collecting data from private recruitment agencies as key barriers in the development of better monitoring.225 For example, private recruitment agencies will carry out health assessments in accordance with needs of receiving countries, but they are not subject to any mechanism for collating or sharing such data within Cambodia. In the case of migrants returning to Cambodia as a result of health-related issues \u2014 for example, deportation due to HIV status \u2014 there are also no established referral or notification processes and no clear data on numbers of deportations that might help shape return and reintegration programmes and services.226 Policies and legal frameworks affecting migrant health While Cambodia\u2019s national health budget has grown substantially in recent years, health spending remains low on a per capita basis, at approximately $119.227 No nationwide social security programme exists to cover all workers, and approximately 60 percent of health expenditure is out-of-pocket. A Law on Social Security Schemes for Persons Defined by the Provisions of the Labour Law was passed by Parliament in 2002. Although a subsequent sub-decree in 2007 brought the Cambodian National Social Security Fund into force in 2008, it has focused primarily on work accidents and injury insurance for workers, and has served mainly the domestic textile industry.228 The fund is currently financed by employer contributions and only applies to those who are working in Cambodia. Portable insurance and social security protection are not available to migrant workers departing the country. According to Sub-decree 190 on the Management of the Sending of Cambodian Workers Abroad through Private Recruitment Agencies, responsibility for arranging social security and access to health care for migrant workers while abroad sits entirely within the purview of the recruitment agencies. These agencies are also responsible for the pre-departure working and living conditions 224 Lee, C., 2007, \u201cExploitative Labour Brokerage Practices in Cambodia: The Role and Practices of Private Recruitment Agencies\u201d (unpublished paper), cited in \u201cIrregular Migration from Cambodia\u201d, op. cit. 225 Report of Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue, op. cit., p. 52. 226 Ibid. 227 WHO, 2009, Cambodia Statistics, at http://www.who.int/countries/khm/en/. 228 Samydorai, S., 2009, \u201cSocial Security for Migrant Workers in ASEAN\u201d, at http://arossasia.wordpress.com/2012/07/06/19-social-security-for- migrant-workers-in-asean-samydorai/. 76 Country profile: Cambodia of recruited workers.229 In reality, such arrangements for both pre-departure and the period of deployment are very difficult to enforce.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "349b9fd8-36d7-442a-90fc-8a57a38d8ae0": {"__data__": {"id_": "349b9fd8-36d7-442a-90fc-8a57a38d8ae0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6db723db5fc382ace63a1bb1876c9aa879f1b5289aa0189bc8ea37bbf890aef5"}, "2": {"node_id": "ecf42fcb-b59b-455a-8bf8-e5c4d7d1dde7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9f80f18eda6adf98e0aeba38b25685c9a737240ab25a34fbe3197ca14af55a2d"}}, "hash": "3026f8700c9d5a7441f9229a4d5f19a732b04e41d97fec7074fafa7a217778fd", "text": "As noted by CARAM Asia in a review of Sub-decree 190, given that the legislation provides no clear standards for administration of pre-departure centres, there are ongoing accusations of illegal detention, exploitation, and other forms of abuse against recruited workers.230 For workers experiencing such difficulties, there is often little access to redress. Research by Human Rights Watch in training centres in Cambodia for migrant workers being deployed to Malaysia found that labour agents restricted prospective workers\u2019 freedom of movement and limited their communication with relatives until they left for Malaysia. Despite legislation requiring certain standards, centres were found to be overcrowded, providing poor living conditions without access to adequate food, water, or medical care. Migrant workers noted that they experienced verbal, psychological, and sometimes physical abuse, while sick domestic workers were denied proper medical care or had medical expenses added to their existing recruitment debts.231 Yet workers who had already committed large sums of money to recruitment agencies remained unwilling or unable to remove themselves from adverse conditions once in transit from home towns.

In this regard, one important piece of legislation aiming to improve such awareness prior to moving abroad is Prakas 108 on Education of HIV/AIDS, Safe Migration, and Labour Rights for Cambodian Workers Abroad. Under this legislation, the Committee for the Control of HIV/AIDS under the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training is mandated to provide training on methods of general welfare and HIV prevention, while the MoLVT also encourages relevant stakeholders to \u201cconduct pre-, during, and post-departure training for Cambodian workers, and to reintegrate them into society following repatriation.\u201d232 However, although this prakas notes that inspections will be carried out by MoLVT officials to ensure that training is being delivered on \u201cworking environments\u2026, labour law, human rights and other customary laws of the country for which they will work\u201d, as well as evaluations on working conditions and livelihood rights of workers,233 it remains unclear how often such inspections will be carried out and what the punishment might be for not adhering to these requirements. Given that the significant majority of workers departing Cambodia do so through irregular processes, it is also important to note that such workers do not receive any of the welfare-based preparations envisioned under this prakas. Lack of health protections and cases of abuse may also continue during deployment, given the fact that responsibility for facilitating access to health care, and in many cases covering health care costs, for migrant workers once abroad shifts to local, private, employers under the relevant national 229 Sub-decree 190, article 21. 230 CARAM Cambodia, 2011, Analysis of Sub-decree 190 on Management of the Sending of Cambodian workers to work abroad through private recruitment agencies. 231 They Deceived us at Every Step, op. cit., p. 11. 232 Prakas 108 on Education of HIV/AIDS, Safe Migration, and Labor Rights for Cambodian Workers Abroad, article 1. 233 Ibid., article 5. 77 The Right to Health Section III legislation of the destination country. Given that 95 percent of workers migrate without proper documentation, this translates an inability to access even those limited health rights afforded to documented workers. For example, while the MoU between Cambodia and key destination country Thailand exists, it mainly focuses on legalizing irregular workers already working in Thailand and developing a formal system for the ongoing recruitment of documented workers. Although in theory such regularization indirectly leads to improved rights in terms of health access in Thailand, health is not specifically mentioned in the document. The complex, time consuming, and relatively expensive process of obtaining cards for health care access also hinders workers participation in such schemes, as is further discussed in the Thailand country profile of this report. Migrant-sensitive health systems Given the difficulties of achieving universal health care in a relatively resource-poor environment, contributions of non-governmental donors play a significant role in most aspects of health care in Cambodia. There are 20 multilateral and bilateral donors in country, and more than 100 health- related international and national non-governmental organizations.234 While there are relatively few donor-funded health programmes focused specifically on migrant workers, it is important to note that such individuals are included with local workers in many programmes, both prior to departure and on return. Migrant workers from Cambodia travelling to Thailand may have access to non-government funded initiatives in which Cambodia migrant worker volunteers and migrant health assistants have been installed as volunteers in provincial hospitals in Thailand to bridge linguistic and cultural gaps. However, a number of these initiatives are in the pilot stage and are hindered by government restrictions on the type of work migrants are able to carry out, which prevents the formal hiring of qualified Cambodian migrants to work to provide ongoing translation services.235 Partnerships, networks, and multi-country frameworks Participants in multi-stakeholder discussions on migrant workers\u2019 right to health in the ASEAN region have noted a clear lack of capacity of the Cambodian Embassy staff in receiving countries to support migrant workers who are experiencing difficulties in terms of health access, noting that while civil society organizations may be able to refer to legal support services in country, very little government assistance is available to migrant workers.236 While Cambodian authorities have set up an office of its Ministry of Labour in Bangkok to reach migrant workers, this office is primarily concerned with the implementation of regularization processes related to the MoU between these two countries.

While cross- border migration, particularly into Malaysia, has a very long tradition, formal government-run migration programmes for migrant workers are relatively recent, having been first instituted in 1969.238 During the 1980s the Indonesian Government\u2019s Department of Manpower began to promote and regulate the export of migrant workers, in particular female domestic workers, and establish more formal ties with major migrant receiving states.239 Generally speaking, in both key ASEAN destination countries, Malaysia and Singapore, the increasing participation of middle-class women in the labour force coupled with overall low unemployment and labour shortages in low-wage sectors sustains the continuing demand for Indonesian workers \u2014 particularly female domestic workers.240 In the case of Malaysia, cultural, ethnic, and linguistic affinity combined with geographical proximity are key drivers of migration. While these factors facilitate easier communication between employers and workers in Malaysia, in other destination countries, such as Singapore, Indonesian workers are also preferred and thus more prominent, apparently due to both low cost and their \u201cperceived docility\u201d in comparison to Filipino domestic workers.241 238 Labour Migration from Indonesia, op. cit., p. 15. 239 Silvey, R., 2007, \u201cUnequal Borders: Indonesian Transnational Migrants at Immigration Control\u201d, Geopolitics, vol. 12, pp. 265\u2013279. 240 Ibid. 241 Van Hear, N., Bakewell, O., and Long, K., 2012, \u201cDrivers of Migration\u201d, Migrating Out of Poverty Research Consortium, Working Paper 1, March 2012. 82 Country profile: Indonesia Other factors driving Indonesian migrants to take up low-skilled employment in the ASEAN region and such other destination countries as Saudi Arabia and Hong Kong include unemployment at home and wage differentials abroad. Labour surplus in Indonesia is an ongoing problem, with a current unemployment rate of approximately 7 percent, and a youth unemployment rate five- times the national average.242 Recent research suggests that the majority of workers migrate with the intention of saving and remitting money to fund daily expenses, buy or build a house, educate children or relatives, and buy consumer goods. Many migrants are motivated to go abroad again once their saved money has run out.243 The latest available data show remittances from Indonesian workers amounted to approximately $6.6 billion in 2009,244 which ranks labour migration as the third-largest contributor to Indonesian foreign exchange after energy (oil and gas) and tourism.245 Out-migration overview Recent estimates from government sources suggest that approximately 6 million Indonesians are working abroad.246 While this estimate includes 4.2 million registered workers and approximately 2 million irregular workers in a variety of occupations, estimates from other sources suggest that there may be as many as 6 million Indonesian foreign domestic workers (FDWs) alone.247 In 2011, the total number of documented workers placed overseas was approximately 580,000, with the largest number of placements in Saudi Arabia (approximately 138,000) and Malaysia (134,000). Other top destinations within South-East Asia were Singapore (48,000) and Brunei (11,000), while Taiwan (51,000), United Arab Emirates (28,000), Kuwait (26,000), and Hong Kong (30,000)248 were the key destination countries in East Asia and the Arab States, after Saudi Arabia. While it is worth noting that annual new placement numbers for documented workers have been declining in very recent times, down from approximately 645,000 in 2008, this decline can be at least partially attributed to the Indonesian Government-enforced moratoria on the supply of Indonesian FDWs to both Saudi Arabia and Malaysia,249 rather than a signifier of a general 242 Christie, S., 2012, \u201cHigh Rate of Youth Unemployment Presents Big Challenge: World Bank\u201d, Jakarta Globe, 27 March 2011. 243 Labour Migration from Indonesia, op. cit., p. 22. 244 World Bank, 2011, Migration and Remittances Factbook 2011. 245 Prasetyohadi (Institute for Ecosoc Rights), 2011, \u201cSignificance of the Amendment of Law no. 39/2004 on Overseas Placement and Protection for Indonesian Migrant Workers\u201d, presentation delivered 14 July 2011 at UNESCO Workshop, Migrant Workers in Asia: Policies and Practices in Social Sciences.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ddf596e-bcc2-41fe-97dd-e5fc5874e00a": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ddf596e-bcc2-41fe-97dd-e5fc5874e00a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f487ee49bfcca3430aa1838b3ffeafb75ad629f9178d5fc485e08a793150bc20"}, "2": {"node_id": "6479cca3-049e-41ed-990c-3e24702522d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3e61493570fb9afe20878cd55f27eb1087c4d28dc236d31812c246ea950033ef"}}, "hash": "318c7c60cd2f14de5b28165c1e5c89a353b1956825504b42a8ebd308be031071", "text": "246 Sunityo, E., 2012, \u201cPolicy and strategy of Indonesian Government in promoting migrant labor health\u201d, presentation delivered 9 March 2012 at ASEF Research Exchange Workshop on Social Determinants of Migrant Health across Asia & Europe. 247 Global Network and Labor Education and Research Network, 2010, \u201cBaseline research on Domestic workers in Asia and the Middle East, Center for Migrant Advocacy, Second Draft\u201d, cited in Domestic Workers Count: Global Data on an Often Invisible Sector, 2011, Schwenken, H. and Heimeshoff, E.

It is likely that some workers are still going to these countries, but through irregular channels. 83 The Right to Health Section III declining trend in placement of Indonesian workers abroad. Commentary suggests that a decline in documented workers in such cases is also mirrored by an increase in undocumented workers. Low-skilled or semi-skilled labourers constitute the majority of Indonesian migrant workers. For the three years from 2008 to 2010, an average of 74 percent of placements were in the informal sector, with 26 percent in the formal sector.250 Again, although the percentage of documented informal workers dropped to 54 percent in 2011, this was likely due to government intervention. As is the case for other major labour-sending countries in the ASEAN region, the majority of the Indonesian migrant workforce is female, at 64 percent in 2011. While the majority of men work in agriculture, construction, or manufacturing, the majority of women are domestic workers or caregivers.251 In the past, prior to the moratoria noted above, the ratio of female to male workers was considerably higher, at 84 percent in 2009 and 78 percent in 2010.252 Irregular Indonesian migrants \u2014 that is, those workers who leave Indonesia without following official procedures; who depart from Indonesia through official channels but allow their stay permits to lapse; and who work beyond their official documentation \u2014 can be found in all destination countries.253 While recent data or reliable estimates of numbers of irregular migrants is difficult to access, it has been suggested that they are most commonly found in Malaysia,254 where they constitute more than half the estimated 900,000 irregular migrants in that country.255 The Indonesian Institute for Ecosoc Rights cites five main factors influencing the irregular status of Indonesian migrant workers. While some migrants make a conscious choice to migrate through irregular channels, given the complexity or cost of taking the documented route, others will initially depart Indonesia as documented workers and subsequently terminate their employment with a particular employer as a result of abuse, withheld wages, or misrepresentation of working conditions, thus losing their legal status.256 Commentary from the International Organization for Migration suggests that irregular migration is likely to continue, given weak law enforcement and continued profitability for involved parties.257 250 The Indonesian Central Body of Statistics (BPS) bases its definition of \u201cinformal\u201d and \u201cformal\u201d sectors on employment status. Seven categories of employment status are detailed, two of which are formal : (i) employer assisted by permanent/paid workers, and (ii) employee working permanently for institution, office, company, or individual; and five of which are informal : (i) casual agricultural employee, (ii) casual employee not in agriculture, (iii) unpaid worker, (iv) self-employed worker without paid employees, and (v) employer assisted by temporary or unpaid workers.

The establishment of more effective mechanisms for the protection of workers has been hindered by problems in coordination, confusion, and conflicts of interest among the various stakeholders involved.258 To supplement the regulations of Act 39/2004, Indonesia has also signed a MoU with a number of recipient countries, including Jordan (2009), South Korea (2010), United Arab Emirates (2010), and Qatar (2011),259 although the major focus of these MoU has generally been on improving the migration processes rather than the protection of workers.

Following the establishment of this team, and the government\u2019s ratification of the ICMW, amendments to Act 39/2004 are currently under discussion in Parliament. Act 39/2004 In line with this act, the placement of Indonesian overseas workers is managed by the National Board for the Placement and Protection of Indonesian Overseas Workers (BNP2TKI), which was established in 2006. The board is a non-ministerial government authority, consisting of 13 members/departments, currently chaired by a representative from the NGO sector. Prior to the establishment of the BNP2TKI, migrant workers came under the control of the Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration (MoM). Under Act 39/2004 private recruitment agencies are essentially responsible for management of the entire migration process \u2014 from recruitment, document management, education and training, temporary accommodation, departure preparations, and departure to the destination country to repatriation back to Indonesia. Recruitment agencies are also now required to register all Indonesian workers arriving overseas at the embassy or consulate in the destination country. 258 Raharto, op. cit.; Tirtosudarmo, op. cit.; and Labour Migration from Indonesia, op. cit. 259 IOM, 2012, Labour Migration from Colombo Process Countries: Good practices, challenges, and the way forward, p. 37. 85 The Right to Health Section III The Indonesian Embassy in the host country will then, in theory, hold a copy of the workers\u2019 contract and log the address of the employer. While this could be an important avenue towards improved protection for Indonesia overseas workers, reports suggest that many recruitment agencies are still failing to register migrant workers with the embassy or consulate upon arrival.260 Generally speaking, this act focuses more on administrative and practical aspects of the placement of Indonesian workers overseas, with only 8 out of 109 articles within 1 of 16 chapters of the act focusing directly on the issue of protection.261 Further, specific protection issues include a certain level of ambiguity about what is meant by \u2018government\u2019 at certain points \u2014 that is, the MoM or BNP2TKI \u2014 and this ambiguity compromises the ability of either agency to act with full authority. This type of ambiguity is not limited to Act 39/2004, but also extends to other presidential regulations. For example, Presidential Regulation 81/2006 decreed that all activities related to placement and protection of Indonesian migrant workers overseas should be handed over from the MoM to BNP2TKI. However, in contradiction to this decree, the subsequent MoM Regulation 22/2008 decreed that BNP2TKI authority lies only with government-to-government recruitment and placement.262 Disjuncture in the management of migrant workers occurs not only as a result of ambiguity between BNP2TKI and MoM but also with regard to other stakeholders, such as private recruitment agencies, of which there are approximately 1,300 operating in Indonesia and receiving countries.263 More specific issues continue to hinder attempts at improving protection for Indonesian foreign workers, including insufficient punishments for recruitment agencies that violate Act 39/2004. For example, if any agency is reported for a violation to MoM, the agency can lose its license. However, there are no regulations preventing an agency from reapplying immediately.264 In addition, there are no clear processes for the monitoring and evaluation of recruitment agencies, and no clear procedures for reporting abuses.265 A number of organizations have documented the deceit and abuse of overseas domestic workers by private recruitment agencies.266 A key area of concern relates to the conditions in temporary lodgings provided for migrant workers by private recruitment agencies prior to deployment from Indonesia. Recent commentary suggests that although ministerial regulations on standard conditions for these lodgings have been issued, conditions often do not meet these minimum standards. In some cases, migrant workers are housed in overcrowded lodgings, are restricted from leaving their lodging centres, and are kept in these lodgings beyond the maximum periods of three months for workers being deployed to the Middle East and four months for those deployed to the Asia-Pacific region.267 260 Ibid., p. 111. 261 Raharto, op. cit. 262 Ibid. 263 Sunityo, op. cit. 264 Raharto, op. cit. 265 Ibid.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e93e318e-5191-4c4c-9d4a-1e999694fad0": {"__data__": {"id_": "e93e318e-5191-4c4c-9d4a-1e999694fad0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "857829c46c40481f5098a41901c3b0f0154497344cc11a2bff019ad1236c3122"}, "2": {"node_id": "dacd74f3-9398-43f1-aa38-fe2b2a25d16a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca9bb75d7ad96ab102398c28ba1e4269b9c5d3800c770679a488fcd290abd829"}}, "hash": "63f8edfa053177db6351da0689a6c68e5c734e5d18a2a4665cdb8879454a9a69", "text": "cit. 264 Raharto, op. cit. 265 Ibid. 266 Human Rights Watch, 2011, \u201cProtecting Indonesia\u2019s Vulnerable Migrant Domestic Workers\u201d, 31 October 2011, at http://www.hrw.org/ news/2011/10/31/protecting-indonesia-s-vulnerable-migrant-domestic-workers. 267 Kuncoro, A., Damayanti, A., and Isfandiarni, I., 2013, \u201cIndonesian Cross-Border Labour Migration: Structure, Institutions and Governance\u201d, Working Papers in Economics and Business, vol. 3 (6). 86 Country profile: Indonesia In most destination countries for Indonesians, workers are also generally not protected by labour laws and are thus particularly vulnerable to extreme exploitation as well as physical and psychological abuse, including violence, harassment, intimidation, and various forms of exploitation at every step of the migration process.268 Memoranda of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "743595a5-cf5c-474e-864f-1575474b579b": {"__data__": {"id_": "743595a5-cf5c-474e-864f-1575474b579b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d6a012dbfbca8565224ce37cb18a8d1eef4ba93eecf8a9e4dc30e93cb39c3d1a"}}, "hash": "d6a012dbfbca8565224ce37cb18a8d1eef4ba93eecf8a9e4dc30e93cb39c3d1a", "text": "understanding between Indonesia and Malaysia Bilateral MoU between the Indonesian and Malaysia governments on labour migration include: on the recruitment of workers (2004); on the recruitment and placement of workers (2006); and on domestic workers (2011), which essentially replaces the 2006 MoU. The 2011 agreement grants Indonesian domestic helpers in Malaysia one day off per week (or extra pay if they work seven consecutive days) and the right to keep their passports. It also caps recruitment fees at $1,500, allowing Malaysian employers the right to deduct up to $600 from domestic helpers for recruitment fees, provided the helper receives at least half of her promised wages after any deductions. Although these MoU exist, the relationship between Indonesia and Malaysia has encountered difficulties in recent times. Prior to the signing of the most recent MoU, in 2009 the Indonesian Government declared a moratorium on the placement of domestic workers in Malaysia, following publicity surrounding cases of abuse by Malaysian employers. Although the 2011 MoU essentially ended this moratorium, commentary from human rights groups has suggested that protections in the 2011 MoU require strengthening. In particular, Malaysia has not agreed to Indonesia\u2019s demand for a minimum monthly wage, while the provision enabling employers to pay a worker to forgo the day of rest could be easily abused, given the workers lack of bargaining power and fear of termination of employment.269 LABOUR MIGRATION AND THE RIGHT TO HEALTH In terms of international standards on the right to health for all, Indonesia has ratified the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which provides the most comprehensive provisions for protections of right to health. Like all other ASEAN Member States, it has also ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which provides for the right to access health-care services on a basis of gender equality (theoretically including migrant workers beyond national citizens). It should be noted, however, that the protective provisions may have limited application for Indonesian migrant workers, 268 Labour Migration from Indonesia, op. cit., p. xi. 269 Slow Reform, op. cit., p. 14. 87 The Right to Health Section III given that none of the primary host countries have signed or ratified the ICESCR, and workers are subject to the laws of these countries throughout the majority of the migration cycle.270 As a WHO Member State, Indonesia is committed to the WHO Resolution on the Health of Migrants, adopted at the 61st World Health Assembly in 2008. This resolution recognizes increased health risks for groups of migrants, and calls for the promotion of migrant-sensitive health policies and equitable access to health promotion, disease prevention, and care.271 Monitoring migrants\u2019 health The Indonesian Ministry of Health maintains a web-based data collection system \u2014 the Indonesian Health Information System \u2014 that includes migrant workers, although data is disaggregated only by employment sector, with no differentiation between workers in Indonesia and overseas foreign workers. The progressive establishment of a computerized database system for Indonesian migrant workers and the issuance of identity cards goes in some way to address the need for a centralized national database on migrant workers, which may in turn assist in monitoring and health protection. Indonesian participants in regional multi-stakeholder discussions on this topic have noted that continuing challenges related to the effective monitoring of migrants\u2019 health include issues of stigma discrimination and negative use of data; a lack of official data disaggregated by migrant worker status (rather than disaggregated only by employment sector); and a lack of commitment of stakeholders to maintain data collection, aggregation, and analysis.272 Policies and legal frameworks affecting migrant health The estimated total expenditure on health per capita in Indonesia in 2009 was $99.273 Insurance for Indonesian workers is currently limited to formal sector employees; and according to recent data, 64 percent of spending on health is private, the majority of which consists of out-of-pocket payments.274 Although the National Social Security System Law was passed in 2004 \u2014 essentially establishing four social security systems for private sector employers, civil servants, armed forces, and pensioners and veterans275 \u2014 membership is not compulsory for informal sector workers, nor workers in organizations of fewer than 10 people. In 2005 a non-contributory insurance scheme for poor households was also introduced,276 yet according to a recent case study prepared for Migrant Forum in Asia, only 17 percent of all workers in Indonesia (both formal and informal) are currently covered under social security and insurance schemes. 270 Chan, \u201cReview of labour migration management\u201d, op. cit., p. 11. 271 WHA 61.17, Resolution on Health of Migrants. 272 Report of Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue, op. cit., p. 53. 273", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8773621c-b962-4fb7-a4a2-95eb00c467c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "8773621c-b962-4fb7-a4a2-95eb00c467c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c24f429b496f7a4a9bc9c4d16d8861cec7f60fef071c0328d931856bc9b7ffcb"}, "3": {"node_id": "e166a45c-8b58-4455-836c-8076cf3479ca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "46efa40ab2f7386ea163be1abaaa56e7b3dfd50e848f5a197f12b0277d3781cd"}}, "hash": "4ebd53c879da3307455756c24b34753c936be8610d8dbaf4bb63df2f772437a2", "text": "WHO Indonesia, Statistics, at www.who.int/countries/idn/en/.

Insurance will cover some illnesses, unpaid wage, and death of migrants. HIV-related health services cannot be claimed, but other sexual and reproductive health issues may potentially be covered. Workers are expected to pay a part of insurance premium before they depart and the remainder following their return to Indonesia. Insurance coverage includes (i) the pre-departure period between home village and recruitment agency boarding house for such things as sickness, injury, failure to go abroad, and death; (ii) while abroad for such things as sickness, injury, and death; and (iii) the return period from location abroad to home village.278 While the availability of such portable insurance coverage could signal improvements in health access for migrant workers, previous reviews of past implementation of insurance processes suggest that 70 percent of all claims were stalled in the claim lodgement system as of 2009. At the time, this situation led the Indonesian Migrant Workers\u2019 Union to protest, demanding that the MoM take action to address these stalled claims.279 Focus group discussions with migrant workers in 2011 also noted their difficulties with claiming on insurance, although insurance companies also noted in interviews that reasons for declining claims included lack of proper medical records and receipts.280 Aside from the establishment of such insurance measures, national legislation mandates a range of other measures to help promote and protect Indonesian migrant workers\u2019 right to health throughout the migration cycle. Prior to departure, workers receive two types of pre-departure orientations, each of which is required by legislation 39/2004 and includes a small health components. These are: (i) labour training and orientation, with focus on skill and competencies, approximately 20 hours in total and including two hours on health; and (ii) pre-flight orientation, eight hours in total, during which approximately 15 minutes is spent on HIV/AIDS.281 While such initiatives are an important step, commentary notes that resources to monitor the effective delivery of such pre-departure training are limited, often with materials delivered at the last minute in the days prior to departure to too large an audience.282 Other health-related protections for migrant workers prior to departure include legislation developed by the Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration and the Ministry of Health prohibiting HIV status being used in recruitment processes. While such concerns are particularly important, they are nevertheless difficult to fully implement in practice, given that in many cases destination countries for Indonesian migrant workers require HIV testing as part of the recruitment process. Although Indonesia does not place any HIV-related travel restrictions on entry, stay, or residence, such restrictions exist in a number of key ASEAN destination countries for Indonesian workers, including Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei. Destination countries in the Arab States also have 277 Decree of the Minister of Manpower and Transmigration on Insurance for Indonesian Workers. 278 Trimayuni, P., 2011, \u201cPre-departure Information Programmes for Indonesian Migrant Workers\u201d (draft, 30/9/2011). 279 Labour Migration from Indonesia, p. 26. 280 Trimayuni, op. cit. 281 Sadik, H., 2010, National AIDS Commission Indonesia Presentation, delivered at 2010 JUNIMA Indonesia/Malaysia round table on Migrant Workers\u2019 Access to Health and HIV Services. 282 Report of Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue, op. cit. 89 The Right to Health Section III legislation in place to enforce the deportation of non-citizens found to be HIV-positive.

The strategy also focuses on the improvement of a database system and further research on migrant workers\u2019 biological and behaviour status.283 Recent research suggests, however, that this strategy is not yet operational.284. Migrant-sensitive health systems Once migrant workers are deployed in country, their access to health systems and services is essentially in the hands of private recruitment agencies and employers in destination countries. Despite the existence of health insurance for Indonesian foreign workers, or memoranda of understanding detailing health-related provisions to be provided by employers in host countries, there remains an ineffective guarantee on the implementation of health services for Indonesian workers during placement periods. Not one of the top 10 destination countries for Indonesian migrant workers has ratified the ICMW, while the primary countries in which Indonesian domestic workers are placed do not recognize domestic work under their employment act. Thus, domestic workers are particularly vulnerable to extreme exploitation and abuse.285 Given that overseas deployment of Indonesian workers predominantly involves women who work in the informal sector, particularly domestic workers, this raises a range of specific health concerns. In order to address such negative outcomes in the migrant process for domestic workers, there are reports that the government is currently working on a new policy called the \u2018live-out\u2019 system for migrant domestic workers whereby they would be housed in dormitories instead of living with their employers.286 In addition, the Indonesian Government\u2019s Domestic Worker Roadmap 2017 has 283 Silfanus, Dr. F, 2011, \u201cIndonesia: National HIV/AIDS Action Plan for Migrant Workers, presentation delivered during the Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue on Migrant Workers\u2019 Access to Health and HIV Services in the ASEAN Region\u201d, Bangkok, 29\u201330 November 2011. 284 \u201cAssessment of Mandatory Screening Practices in Cambodia, Indonesia and the Philippines and the Impact on Migrant Workers\u201d, op. cit. 285 Labour Migration from Indonesia, op. cit., p. xi. 286 Tan, Amanda, 2012, \u201cExpect longer wait for Indonesian maids\u201d, The Strait Times, 1 March 2012, at http://www.menafn.com/menafn/qn_news_ story.aspx?storyid={6b8e9186-28fb-4a21-95c5-c19b329c3129. 90 Country profile: Indonesia put forward a plan to stop sending domestic workers abroad after 2017 unless receiving countries recognize them as formal workers and grant them all the necessary rights, including health rights.287 Currently, in order to support the assessment of returning Indonesian migrant workers upon arrival home, the MoM and BNP2TKI co-manage a supplementary terminal at Soeharto International Airport. Returning migrants are questioned upon arrival; but despite the existence of this disembarkation centre, a number of issues remain, including insufficient staff and inadequate knowledge of both procedures and referral systems available for health issues.288 Recent data suggests that approximately 14 percent of workers returning in 2011 were reported as \u2018troubled\u2019. While the number one source of \u2018trouble\u2019 was one-sided termination, several health-related issues were also reported, including sickness due to work, sexual abuse, work accident, and pregnancy. Partnerships, networks, and multi-country frameworks The Indonesian Government has been proactive in partnering with stakeholders in destination countries to establish initiatives that might better protect its workers against potential negative health outcomes in the migration cycle. Established initiatives include: (i) the placement of labour attach\u00e9s in countries with a large number of Indonesians, with the ability to respond to migrant workers\u2019 challenges in access to health systems and services; (ii) the provision of shelters for workers experiencing abuse; (iii) the provision of orientation programmes for new migrants arriving in destination countries such as Malaysia; 289 and (iv) a hotline service, with anecdotal reports suggesting that 30 percent of workers are making use of this service.290 Nevertheless, Indonesian participants in regional discussions on this issue have noted a distinct lack of clarity on the role of government, both central and local, in supporting access to health services for returned workers,291 as well as a lack of involvement of civil society organizations and migrant workers themselves in existing networks. For example, during bilateral negotiations between Indonesia and Malaysia on the recruitment of domestic workers, no mechanism existed for the involvement of civil society.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e72fac69-16d0-44c5-a697-db82115f90ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "e72fac69-16d0-44c5-a697-db82115f90ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1af32f2a3398fbace83aff73a95c635a76d9312e2b9cef2eba3adbc90ade7f10"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f10b27f-36ca-4d9c-9f8e-91d6cca7857d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "211c9403406b9e7de9e723ac149a7a66e90b0dee61696045b9859e65e24cefbf"}}, "hash": "7743d24b43188f8a60ace52c37ff4425cf1aa3e175e5fa7db2cc645171a8a2da", "text": "Similarly, it has also been noted that when high-level multi- stakeholder dialogues do take place, recommendations and other outputs are not shared with stakeholders at other levels \u2013regional, provincial, or local.292 For further information on health access for Indonesian migrant workers deployed to ASEAN countries, particularly Malaysia, please see respective country profiles in this report. 287 Soeriaatmadja, Wahyudi, 2012, \u201cJakarta plans to stop sending maids by 2017\u201d, The Straits Times, 5 January 2012, at http://www.asianewsnet.net/ home/news.php?id=25885&sec=1. 288 Sunityo, op. cit. 289 Hall, A., 2012, Migrant Workers\u2019 Right to Social Protection in ASEAN: Case Studies of Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, at http:// oppenheimer.mcgill.ca/IMG/pdf/Myanmar_and_Migrant_Workers_-_Briefing_and_Recommendations.pdf. 290 Report of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42b79eb3-cee3-4738-ad42-149434b2407f": {"__data__": {"id_": "42b79eb3-cee3-4738-ad42-149434b2407f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1488898ec093d1f209ab31ac9a2a8eef530de54385a28d41b3a412e072dc1c9"}, "3": {"node_id": "fe916cef-f1d6-4944-b6a4-42585df83fbf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c0ba842f1441fb182e60a07f2d44392b9cf486aa1ffb035a12a85c41c7b717d8"}}, "hash": "cc85fd4103455f3b167583026e19c63125f2f493e68ba6e603ee969be5e60f4f", "text": "Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue, op. cit. 291 Ibid. 292 Ibid., p. 56. 91 The Right to Health Section III RECOMMENDATIONS Monitoring migrants\u2019 health 1 Develop and agree on standard migrant health indicators (access, quality, cost). 2 Advocate for the improvement of existing web-based data collection systems, including the collection, analysis, and dissemination of data disaggregated by status as migrant worker. 3 Improve multi-stakeholder collaboration in data collection processes. 4 Ensure the confidentiality and safeguarding against harmful use of data.

While Lao PDR has a rapidly growing young labour force, with 55 percent of the population under 20 years of age, there are critical unemployment levels in the 15 to 24-year-old range.293 In 2005 it was estimated that approximately 8.4 percent of the total workforce, equivalent to about 40 percent of the total workers outside family farms, were working in Thailand.294 In the specific case of movement into Thailand, a range of factors have played a strong role in encouraging migration, including: the ease with which people can cross the border; the social, cultural, and linguistic kinships295; and the networks formed by pioneering migrants who embody the potential for vertical job mobility and skill improvement.296 In terms of value of remittances to Lao PDR, estimates suggest that these amounted to more than 7 percent of GDP in 2009,297 although more exact calculations are complicated by the fact that a significant proportion of migrants are undocumented and that money also flows in informal ways. 293 Lao PDR Ministry of Planning and Investment/UNDP, 2009, Employment and Livelihoods: The 4th National Human Development Report. 294 Ibid., p.156 295 Molland, S., 2011, \u201cSafe Migration, Dilettante brokers, and the Appropriation of Legality: Lao-Thai \u2018Trafficking in the Context of Regulating Labour Migration\u2019\u201d, Pacific Affairs, vol. 85(1), pp. 17 136. 296 Phenthongsawat, C., 2011, \u201cLabour Migration in Lao PDR\u201d, presentation delivered at ADBI-OECD Round table on Labour Migration in Asia: Recent Trends and Prospects in the Post-crisis context, 18\u201320 January 2011, at http://www.adbi.org/files/2011.01.20.cpp. sess5.4.phengthongsawat.labour.migration.lao.pdr.pdf. 297 Ibid., p.156. 95 The Right to Health Section III Out-migration overview Many low-skilled migrant workers departing from Lao PDR do so via undocumented means, primarily due both to the cost and time required to engage in formal documented migration processes.298 Further, as many workers move to Thailand for crop cutting, seasonal agricultural work, or construction activities for relatively short periods, formal channels are inconvenient. Nevertheless, it is important to note that while a very large proportion of migrant workers leave Lao PDR through undocumented channels, half of those that arrive in Thailand will complete some form of registration with Thai authorities.299 For documented workers, the majority of formal requests for Laotian workers come from Thailand (57 percent), followed by Malaysia (28.6 percent), with the remaining coming from other Asian countries.300 Thailand is the primary destination for undocumented workers as well, many of whom may enter legally with border passes by land or illegally by boat.301 Exact numbers of undocumented workers in Thailand are difficult to ascertain, given the ease with which potential migrant workers may cross the border into Thailand and remain there. In 2009 the ILO and the Thailand Development Research Institute estimate there to be approximately 300,000 Lao workers in Thailand at any one time, including 110,000 documented workers.302 Migrant workers from Lao PDR in Thailand generally work initially in the Thai border provinces as labourers, agricultural workers, service workers, and sex workers.303 Generally speaking, the majority of female workers are in the household sector, while the majority of male workers are in the agriculture sector.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11aa7c21-0f84-447c-83fc-c75745390ea5": {"__data__": {"id_": "11aa7c21-0f84-447c-83fc-c75745390ea5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e7ccea7405ce92b3897b45f07c90315f7695ced43e01dded9428442c692051c"}, "2": {"node_id": "618b9b2c-ebfc-4958-b32e-63c7066925f4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a98865e0ba1fa895db29088e1870c586bf2dca16d59b9fc89c479a2eb56cb804"}}, "hash": "a194b3fae2765f52c5ac2eeebe25e330a34f5e8b0259f3896660eb4c659339c0", "text": "304 According to government statistics, of the 110,000 documented workers in Thailand, just under 20 percent were engaged in the household sector, followed by 16 percent in agriculture, and approximately 12 percent in \u2018food sales\u2019 and construction alike.

Additional relevant guidelines include Ministerial Decree No. 3824/LSW, which prohibits Lao migrants from working in unskilled professions, such as cleaners, domestic workers, and porters, as well as vocations that are inappropriate and incompatible with Lao tradition, culture, and law, such as work in the sex sector.306 In 2013 the ministries of Labour and Social Welfare, Foreign Affairs, and Public Security jointly designed and published an Operations Manual on the Protection and Management of Migrant Workers. This manual outlines the procedures and stakeholder roles and responsibilities in sending Laotian workers abroad and receiving foreign workers in Lao PDR.307 General legislation and procedures described above are also supported by a 2003 Memorandum of Understanding on Employment Cooperation with the Thai Government, which provides a regulatory framework for the migration of low-skilled labour migrants to Thailand. Its primary aims are to regularize those workers already in Thailand and establish a regulated process for recruitment of all new workers from Lao PDR. Lao PDR has not ratified either the International Convention on the Protection of Rights of All Migrant Workers or the ILO\u2019s Migration for Employment Convention (No. 97) or Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention (No. 143). Nor has it ratified the recent Domestic Workers Convention (No. 189). Generally speaking, protections for Laotian migrant workers before and during movement abroad are limited by two main factors: (i) the number of workers who migrate without proper documentation, leading to almost no access to limited rights protections that may exist for documented workers under legislation in host countries; and (ii) the strong involvement of recruitment agencies throughout the migration cycle coupled with the lack of government resources for monitoring their practices. 306 Chantanavich, The Mekong Challenge, op. cit. It should be noted that despite this decree a considerable number of migrant workers from Lao PDR are nevertheless engaged in these positions in host countries. 307 For an English translation of the text, see http://apmagnet.ilo.org/resources/lao-pdr-operations-manual-on-the-protection-and- management-of-migrant-workers. 97 The Right to Health Section III Prime Minister Decree 68/2002 on Export of Lao Workers Abroad and Guidelines 2417/ MOLSW on Implementation of the Decree on Export of Lao Workers Abroad This decree lays out the duties and responsibilities of both recruitment agencies and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in managing the migration of Laotian workers abroad. According to the decree, the government aims to utilize migration of workers abroad to upgrade the skills, knowledge, and expertise of Laotian nationals. Potential workers must have completed primary school education and be in good health.308 Those planning to work abroad are also required to register with one of the nine state-recognized agencies, seven of which are private recruitment agencies.309 Recruitment agencies are responsible for administration of three separate contracts of services for migrant workers, including: (i) a contract between the prospective workers and the recruitment agency; (ii) a contract between the recruitment agency and the employer in the destination country; and (iii) a contract between the prospective worker and the prospective employer. Protective guidelines included in the implementing decree for this legislation include capping of recruitment fees at 15 percent of a worker\u2019s monthly wages. Despite this cap, however, no guidelines are given as to how many months these deductions may continue to occur.310 Despite the existence of this range of contracts, research among Laotian migrant workers suggests conditions contained in contracts are rarely adhered to.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8fc017fd-8b46-4bfe-8fd6-b81bcb7eda31": {"__data__": {"id_": "8fc017fd-8b46-4bfe-8fd6-b81bcb7eda31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b05d7b8a0111bef0e0f652622e8c567bb7640c38983ab6da6a81704d95643aa9"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb31b59b-fa2d-4af9-9879-cad0a888d9b6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04e5d1f7aada3ec5e92237ccfe1fa0acfa2772caa03b56aaf15e72e28f238fd2"}}, "hash": "ebcdd5e737b726539c30711241f8194f1b580a152c2e655cfd0a972a52feb58f", "text": "For example, despite regulations on working hours in Thailand, approximately 40 percent of migrants from Lao PDR work more than 10 hours a day, for 6\u20137 days per week, amounting to 60\u201370 hours/week.311 Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and the Government of the Kingdom of Thailand on Employment Cooperation, 2003 This MoU focuses on government-to-government recruitment of migrant workers for a specific period of employment in Thailand.

To date, however, relatively few workers from Lao PDR have entered the MoU recruitment process, with only 25,000 Laotians coming to Thailand through these means as of December 2010.312 It has been noted that key reasons for the relatively small numbers entering Thailand in this way is a result of high fees and the number of steps and amount of time required.313 As is the case in other sending countries within the ASEAN region and beyond, commentators have suggested that efforts need to be made by the Lao PDR Government to reduce the cost and complexity of the recruitment process, if migrant workers are to be more likely to use documented processes and thus have increased access to legislated protection of their rights throughout the migration cycle. Research has also suggested that the government must do more to monitor and regulate the privatized recruitment process. The 2009 Lao PDR Human Development Report also summarizes the practices of illegal recruitment agencies as follows: \u2018Recruitment agents\u2019 on the Lao side contact those who wish to migrate to work, after which workers are smuggled to Thailand and handed over to Thai counterparts, who in turn deliver them to their employers. The employers then pay a fee to the agents for the service, which will be deducted from workers\u2019 salaries, in addition to the cost for transportation.314 A point to note is that past research among both documented and undocumented migrant workers and NGOs working with migrant workers has suggested that migrant workers from Lao PDR believe they can protect themselves more effectively when undocumented. For example, while formal migrants can incur a large debt to enter the recruitment process, they are also contractually bound to employers who may force them to endure harsh working conditions. Undocumented migrants, on the other hand, may believe they have some level of autonomy and flexibility in this regard, with the ability to quit and shift employers if conditions are particularly harsh.315 LABOUR MIGRATION AND THE RIGHT TO HEALTH In terms of international standards on right to health for all, Lao PDR is not a signatory to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which provides the most comprehensive provisions for protections of right to health; and it is not a party to most of the core United Nations conventions that provide for the right of access to health care and medical treatment for all. Along with all other countries in the South-East Asian region, it has ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which provides for the 312 IOM, 2011, Thailand Migration Report 2011. 313 Ibid.

Importantly, as a WHO Member State, Lao PDR is committed to the WHO Resolution on the Health of Migrants, adopted at the 61st World Health Assembly in 2008, which recognizes increased health risks for groups of migrants and calls for the promotion of migrant-sensitive health policies and equitable access to health promotion, disease prevention, and care.316 In this regard, the Lao PDR Ministry of Health supports a pooling of resources and improved bilateral and multilateral cooperation among Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Myanmar to improve health access for migrant workers in this subregion.317 Monitoring migrants\u2019 health Although a national health information system was first established in 1983, data is scattered, with very little information collected.318 Discussions with government representatives suggest that lack of funding, capacity, and human resources for managing data collection and monitoring systems hinders the development of effective surveillance.

Policies and legal frameworks affecting migrant health The Ministry of Health is the primary provider of health services in Lao PDR, with a heavy reliance on the support of international non-governmental organizations.321 Generally speaking, health service provision is strained by a lack of qualified, adequately distributed staff, adequate infrastructure, and affordable drug supply and for the general population. The supply of health services is unable to meet the health care demand, leading to insufficient outreach, monitoring, and supervision.322 Social security systems for both public and private sector employees exist in Lao PDR, currently covering approximately 12.5 percent of the population.

Under the government\u2019s decree on the export of Lao workers abroad, recruitment agencies are tasked with providing protection for workers in accordance with employment contracts, which may include provisions for employers to cover health access. While recruitment agencies are also responsible for providing training for workers prior to departure from Lao PDR, there are no government regulations regarding the health content of such training, and it is unclear how many workers are being provided with necessary health education and information on their access rights prior to departure. In terms of return and reintegration, there are very few institutions for the reintegration of migrant workers upon return to Lao PDR, with those institutions that do exist focus primarily on trafficking victims.324 For those workers travelling to Thailand, those who have completed the documentation processes have access to health care either via the Compulsory Migrant Health Insurance Scheme or via the Thai Social Security Scheme, alongside Thai workers. The scheme under which a documented worker is eligible to access health care is dependent on the steps they have completed towards full registration in Thailand. Further information on these schemes can be found in the Thailand chapter of this report. Migrant-sensitive health systems Research on quality of life for Laotian migrant workers notes a number of health-related challenges amidst the difficulties workers face when abroad, notably: (i) risk of work-related illnesses, and improperly caring for themselves while working; (ii) dissatisfaction with insufficient financial resources; (iii) abuse by employers, conflict, and competition among workers working illegally in Thailand; (iv) living in crowded dwellings; (v) excessive consumption of alcohol and tobacco; (vi) poor access to official information about working and living in Thailand; and (vii) not being registered as nationals of either Thailand or Lao PDR.325 A specific, health-related study among 70 Laotian migrant workers living in Thailand also found that difficulties faced by workers when in Thailand derived from five key areas: (i) physical well- being; (ii) psychological well-being; (iii) social relationships; (iv) working and living environment; and (v) financial situation.326 A number of workers in this study expressed fear regarding health and safety in the workplace and acquisition of work-related illnesses, with workers noting that they 323 Ibid., p. 12. 324 Ibid. 325 Nilvarangkul, K., McCann, T. et al., 2011, \u201cEnhancing a Health-Related Quality of Life Model for Laotian Migrant Workers in Thailand\u201d, Qualitative Health Research, vol. 21, pp. 312\u2013323. 326 Ibid.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a249c9be-ee97-4695-b479-162c71181f88": {"__data__": {"id_": "a249c9be-ee97-4695-b479-162c71181f88", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba09bbfb56fc90f31248e638b9fdc23cd85c97011168ea23e739e078d512452d"}, "2": {"node_id": "f57b38f0-d7e5-4693-80e4-a781801cec32", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "008c5b0a1ca97f26aff81576c0e132a737ef2fb24019cf41d45debe91d8d8cf2"}}, "hash": "1af53fa3a7a8205e7ff1ffd5eb825a393f82f45fe0c31f153dac6bc1ed9a5a36", "text": "21, pp. 312\u2013323. 326 Ibid. 101 The Right to Health Section III had no access to workplace health and safety information.327 Commentary from other sources also noted that for a number of those who experience poor working and other conditions, particularly undocumented workers, the risk of detention or deportation outweighs such matters.328 Despite this specific set of health vulnerabilities, there are limited examples of the establishment of health systems and services sensitive to the needs of Lao PDR\u2019s migrant", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6cdf7d03-9a1e-4c79-9fec-9167a48526da": {"__data__": {"id_": "6cdf7d03-9a1e-4c79-9fec-9167a48526da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2e8ef2d83b827fa1a1a52f060d70f2cd9596ba52e0e7ba92db0217899804139"}, "3": {"node_id": "ec321296-e37b-4511-aa74-e80e648f2f2b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a489baeb34c1689514390c33280bcf913c68be21cddccd2632614b8c9a16110"}}, "hash": "a7b74cce25a45f033a969bff11e054c7cf1a3496a2118ffa4f4827bfa84d12fc", "text": "workers, whether prior to departure, during deployment, or upon return.

In the plantation sector, where 75 percent of workers are low-skilled migrant workers,333 recent reports have suggested that employers will face increasing shortages, with locals unwilling to take up such work and foreign plantation workers from Indonesia potentially drawn home by booming palm oil sector there.334 In other industries, such as the electronics industry, which contributes 60 percent of total manufactured exports, accounting for 8 percent of the GDP, many employers claim that their business activities will come to a standstill if they are not allowed to use foreign labour because the jobs in those fields are perceived to be dirty, difficult and demeaning to the average Malaysian.335 331 War on Want, 2012, Restricted Rights, 2012, Migrant women workers in Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand. 332 Ibid. 333 Adnan, H, \u201cLabour shortage to get worse with Indonesian palm oil boom\u201d, in The Star Online, 29 May 2012, at http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/ story.asp?file=/2012/5/29/business/11372483&sec=business. 334 Ibid. 335 Penang Institute, 2010, Labour Shortages Issues Forum, at http://penanginstitute.org/v3/resources/articles/event/169-labour-shortage- issues-forum. 105 The Right to Health Section III While current policies allow employers from certain sectors to apply for foreign workers where locals cannot be engaged, the government is also implementing a range of strategies to encourage Malaysian nationals to fill workforce gaps. For example, (i) the automation of industry is intended to reduce demand for low-skilled labour and provide new opportunities for local employment; and (ii) the introduction in the plantation sector of incentives such as minimum wage, housing schemes, childcare and school centres is intended to encourage Malaysian nationals to enter this sector. Broadly speaking, government policy towards migration of foreign low-skilled labour into Malaysia has shifted dramatically over time. While in the past undocumented workers were \u2018silently welcomed\u2019,336 a regulation phase involving legalizing and establishing official channels for foreign labour recruitment and signing bilateral agreements with governments of host countries, was followed by a focus on regularization and the prevention of illegal immigration and eventual freezing of foreign labour importation, prompted by public unease with increasing visibility of Indonesian workers. In its most recent phase, following the recent global economic crisis, the government has shifted between strict measures to control unauthorized migration, strict work permit controls and amnesty programmes allowing undocumented migrants to leave the country.337 In late 2013 it was reported that amnesty programmes were coming to an end, and as of January 2014 undocumented foreign workers are now being deported in accordance with national laws and regulations.338 Malaysian officials also emphasize the government view that sending countries must be responsible for: (i) more tightly regulating their borders and prevent the departure of undocumented workers; and (ii) educating departing workers on the use of proper channels for labour migration to Malaysia.339 While Malaysian Government policy is to provide equal opportunity for documented migrant workers working alongside local workers, public perceptions of migrant workers are diverse. In a recent ILO survey on public attitudes to migrant workers, although more than 70 percent of Malaysian respondents believed that migrant workers were needed to fill labour shortages, more than 60 percent agreed at least to some extent that migrant workers were a drain on the national economy and that they could not expect the same pay for the same job.340 336 Kanapathy, Controlling Irregular Migration: The Malaysian Experience. 337 Kaur, op. cit., pp. 6 19. 338 Ng, J., 2014, \u201cMalaysia gets tough on illegal immigrants as amnesty program expires\u201d, The Wall Street Journal: South East Asia Realtime, at http://blogs.wsj.com/searealtime/2014/01/21/malaysia-gets-tough-on-illegal-immigrants-as-amnesty-program-expires/. 339 Feedback provided during meeting between UNDP HIV, Health and Development team and Representatives from the Malaysian Ministry of Human Resources, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 21 January 2014, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "758e122f-1d52-4304-bbfa-b54536f28637": {"__data__": {"id_": "758e122f-1d52-4304-bbfa-b54536f28637", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f716c9302d2c663c153b8e940947d4b5433cf140c170ac37149a71b5061b43c5"}, "2": {"node_id": "6cddcd7d-60ec-4bcf-ab71-0c480aa5af81", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35979d5a6cee4e6c0b0825a46a802cfc0fd612bedc8ab55268c19a498ee6e8b5"}}, "hash": "4866b1ec42759ee83e1be7c3cb1e3970a5c2632ec3edb4f71067eaa6347fcc7f", "text": "340 ILO, 2011, \u201cPublic attitudes on migrant workers: A four country study\u201d, Prepared by the ILO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific and the ILO Triangle Project, at http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/documents/presentation/wcms_159851.pdf 106 Country profile: Malaysia In-migration overview Malaysia, alongside Thailand, is host to the largest volume of migrant workers in the ASEAN Region.

Similarly, the most common source countries for undocumented workers, after Indonesia, were Bangladesh (approximately 268,000), Myanmar (144,000), India (52,000), and Nepal (33,000). Documented and undocumented migrants work in similar sectors, including manufacturing, construction, oil palm and rubber plantations, domestic work, services, and agriculture. Approximately 54 percent of documented workers work in manufacturing, with a further 20 percent in agriculture, 14 percent in construction, and 12 percent in the service sector.344 While male workers work predominantly in construction and agriculture sectors, including palm oil and rubber plantations, female workers work predominantly in the electronics industry and as domestic workers. Some 70\u201380 percent of the approximately 300,000 workers in the electronic industry are women,345 while the vast majority of 350,000 migrant domestic workers are also women.346 In recent times a series of high-profile abuse cases involving domestic workers has created temporary shifts in traditional source countries, and an increased focus on those countries within both South and South-East Asian regions, with relatively new cross-border labour migration industries. While the Malaysian Government has charged and prosecuted several employers, certain sending countries have nevertheless responded to cases of abuse by enacting bans on the deployment of their workers to Malaysia. For example, in June 2009 Indonesia placed a ban on new recruitment of Indonesian domestic workers for jobs in Malaysia until new protections were put in place, after which Malaysian recruitment agencies turned to Cambodia as a new source of domestic workers.

Employment conditions for those earning under 2000 ringgit (approximately $600) per month and all workers engaged as manual labourers are covered under the Employment Act 1955 (latest amendments effective April 2012). Those engaged as domestic servants face exclusions from a majority of rights protections afforded under this act, and any protections for such workers are essentially transferred to private recruitment agencies and individual employers, guided by the content of bilateral MoU between Malaysia and individual source countries. The government has several such MoU, with countries including Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Enforcement of any protections detailed in MoUs and/or service contracts is overseen by the Department of Labour, in collaboration with other government agencies and foreign embassies. Generally speaking, the Department of Labour is also empowered to conduct statutory inspections at workplaces. In 2013 more than 21,000 inspections were conducted by labour officers and 1,669 compliance notices were issued to employers who had committed various offences under the Employment Act.349 The evolution of the recruitment and employment process for semi-skilled and unskilled workers in recent times has seen that recruitment agencies and labour hire companies now dominate the recruitment process, while the Department of Immigration role has been reduced in some ways to the granting of visas.350 The government has taken steps to bar from further recruitment those Malaysian agencies found to act in contravention of regulations and will continue such enforcement in order to eradicate illegal employment. Nevertheless, academic commentary has described regulation and monitoring as inadequate in the absence of a proper mechanism by which such agencies can be held liable for migrants\u2019 basic welfare, or abuse and exploitation.351 Despite a strict government policy to deport undocumented migrants, research by advocacy groups also suggests that many workers will enter into undocumented and illegal employment because it is cheaper for both employers and migrants.352 347 \u201cRI-Malaysia MoU fails to provide needed safeguards for migrant workers\u201d, op. cit.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3d6e523-a344-476b-83fd-296e3046c291": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3d6e523-a344-476b-83fd-296e3046c291", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "881cc0ba7bb89b79d92c334126b880c2d4d8bd6fade9d2c00895ae268d209696"}, "2": {"node_id": "12b06717-97a8-42f1-a237-e9425a20bb83", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9689f527f56b1a32a8e5d7c2108bac31558d8398ec106b5dee6e2850d7851b0d"}}, "hash": "ce094cb8e1902de8a4d6dc79d4838e509153dbf4502b799ef57214eefb4e4e6d", "text": "cit. 348 Nie, Y, 2011, \u201cMalaysia, Singapore, struggle with maid bans\u201d, 23 December 2011, at http://www.voanews.com/content/malaysia-singapore- struggle-with-maid-bans-132502753/168135.html 349 Statistics provided during meeting between UNDP HIV, Health and Development team and Representatives from the Malaysian", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "538af623-c081-4a47-a237-71e1e8ac15a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "538af623-c081-4a47-a237-71e1e8ac15a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "52013ea25dc14494ce1c5fa8ecb5ffcf3672433878e0862705fdcff69405f7ec"}, "3": {"node_id": "971a346e-76fc-40e0-b3f7-02cc88074bf7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f5b0026be4ecb0549aa5cbc00df95478153528568f4a20859638205e137380f0"}}, "hash": "7f4bd0931c632ae6209c3c0e167d83d91b05646011abbc893f8f4b80a11b3e55", "text": "Ministry of Human Resources, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 21 January 2014, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 350 Kaur, op. cit., p. 13. 351 Kaur, A., 2008, \u201cInternational Migration and Governance in Malaysia: Policy and Performance\u201d. 352 War on Want, 2012, Restricted Rights, 2012, Migrant women workers in Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand. 108 Country profile: Malaysia Malaysia has not ratified either the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers or the ILO\u2019s Migration for Employment Convention (C97) or Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention (C143). Despite strong reliance on migrant workers in key industries, there is no multistakeholder migration management body nor one comprehensive policy on in-migration, and recent commentary describes the government\u2019s migration policy as providing short-term remedies, following a cycle of amnesty, freeze, and crackdown.353 Feedback from Malaysian officials reiterates the fact that the employment of migrant workers is a temporary measure to fill workforce gaps and that labour legislation alone is sufficient for the management of such migrant workers alongside the local workforce.354 Immigration Act 1959/63 and related regulations The Immigration Act mandates that all non-citizen entrants must be in possession of valid entry permits or passes.355 Upon arrival, all foreign nationals seeking to work in Malaysia are issued with a Temporary Employment Visit Pass. In order to be certified as fit for employment and receive this pass, all migrant workers must have passed medical examinations prior to departure from their home country.356 In order to remain in Malaysia, workers must pass regulation medical tests again within one month of arrival in Malaysia, and annually for the first two years of employment. It is important to note that all foreign workers entering Malaysia are broadly classified into two tiers: 1) higher skilled \u2018expatriate personnel\u2019 and foreign skilled professionals; and 2) semi-skilled and unskilled foreign \u2018workers\u2019. Each tier is governed by a different set of regulations and those described below relate to the latter tier. The Department of Immigration permits the employment of semi-skilled and unskilled foreign workers only in approved sectors. Current approved sectors are manufacturing, plantation, agriculture, construction, and services. Foreign workers engaged in the manufacturing, plantation, agriculture, and construction industries must be between 18 and 45 years of age, may not bring dependents, and may only work for a period of five years. They must also pass medical examinations prior to and following entry, as described above. With specific regard to the service industry, the Ministry of Human Resources is the lead agency in determining source countries and terms and contracts for employment for foreign domestic workers (FDWs).357 Current approved source countries are Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam.

Those certified as fit for employment will then be issued with a \u201cVisa with Referral\u201d by the Malaysian Immigration Department prior to departure from the source country. 357 Ministry of Human Resources determination is subject to approval of Cabinet Committee of Foreign Workers. 109 The Right to Health Section III pass medical examinations upon entry at an approved medical centre, as required for all foreign workers (detailed above).

Given the number of unregistered migrants in the country, the government has conducted a number of amnesty exercises during the past decade \u2014 in 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2013 \u2014 while also amending the Immigration Act in 2002 to incorporate stiffer penalties for both unregistered migrants and their employees.358 The harsh crackdown on irregular migrants following the 2004 amnesty had a

under the Immigration Act include: continued presence in the country after the expiration or cancellation of relevant pass or permit;360 harbouring any person having entered in contravention of the

immigration officers, senior police officers, or any other police or immigration officer under their direction.363 In practice, policing of undocumented migrants is carried out by the Immigration Department, Royal Malaysian Police, and a volunteer civil corps called the \u2018RELA\u2019.364 Those workers whose passes are cancelled are prohibited from re-entering Malaysia.365 Research suggests that in certain cases where passports have been held by employers or outsourcing agents, documented workers have been left vulnerable to arrest.366 This is an area of concern for migrant workers despite the fact that policy implemented subsequent to the Passport Act 1967 allows an employer to hold the passport of a migrant worker for safe-keeping, with written consent from the worker. It is possible that this vulnerability to arrest by enforcement officials due to lack of ID will be overcome by the introduction of a Foreign Worker Centralized Management System, which aims to provide biometric personal identification cards to all foreign workers.367 358 Presentation by Minister of Home Affairs Malaysia, International Symposium on International Migration and Development, 28-30 June 2006, http://www.un.org/esa/population/migration/turin/Turin_Statements/AHMAD.pdf. 359 Kanapathy, Controlling Irregular Migration: The Malaysian Experience, p. 3. 360 Immigration Act, article 15. 361 Ibid, article 56 (1) (d). 362 Ibid, article 55b (1). 363 Ibid, article 51 (1). 364 RELA is an abbreviation for Ikatan Relawan Rakyat Malaysia, translated into English as Volunteers of Malaysian People.

Due to the nature of work of FDWs, these workers are excluded from key protections under Malaysia\u2019s Employment Act. As a result, they cannot seek redress for violation of rights except to claim for unpaid wages under the Employment Act.375 Feedback from the government notes, however, that new regulations under the Employment Act pertaining to the employment of domestic workers are currently being drafted.376 In lieu of coverage under the Employment Act, domestic workers are instead covered through individual employment contracts signed between the domestic workers and the employer. Any breach of contract can be reported to the nearest Labour Office for appropriate action.

Lumpur, Malaysia. 377 CARAM Asia, 2011, Reality Check: Rights and Legislation for Migrant Domestic Workers, p.26. 111 The Right to Health Section III Memorandum of understanding between Malaysia and Indonesia on the recruitment and placement of Indonesian domestic workers The recent signing of an MoU between Indonesia and Malaysia on the recruitment and placement of Indonesian domestic workers provides for improved protections for migrant domestic workers. The new agreement includes salary protections such as capping recruitment fees at 4,511 ringgit ($1,500) as well as capping the amount employers can reclaim from domestic workers\u2019 salaries at 1,800 ringgit ($600). It also stipulates that no more than 50 percent of the worker\u2019s salary can be deducted each month. Domestic workers are also allowed to keep their passports instead of having to surrender them to their employers (although employers are entitled to hold them for \u201csafe-keeping\u201d), and guarantees them a weekly day off. However, the agreement does not set a minimum wage, allowing for the determination of wages according to market forces. With regard to wages, Malaysia\u2019s preference for regulating conditions for FDWs through bilateral agreements means that, for example, registered migrant workers coming from particular countries receive different payments. Indonesian and Cambodian domestic workers often work for monthly wages of 400 to 600 ringgit ($133 to $200). Filipina domestic workers in Malaysia earn the highest salary, at $400 a month, because of requirements imposed by the Philippines Government.378 Generally speaking, should a migrant worker seek legal redress against his or her former employer for violation of any of the variety of legislations discussed above, he or she must pay 100 ringgit for a Special Monthly Pass to remain in the country, during which time work is not permitted. Although in a small number of cases exemption from paying monthly pass fees is available for those who seek assistance from NGOs, lack of income to support cost of living and/or legal fees can create a barrier for those seeking legal redress. NGO experience suggests that due process in bringing such matters before court can take more than six months.379 In some cases, where migrant workers file cases against their current employer, an employer may cancel the employees work permit. This may leave workers vulnerable to arrest for immigration offences, with some cases of arrest occurring while migrant workers are attending legal proceedings against their employers.380 In terms of labour dispute cases involving foreign workers, including foreign domestic workers, the practice is to settle cases within one month. However, this timeline is subject to cooperation from parties such as the employer, FDW, and the relevant embassy, as well as logistical issues such as the availability of interpreters during official case proceedings. Reports of a recent investigation in Malaysia by a Cambodian investigative committee of government officials, rights workers, and other agencies found that the process of finding legal aid for abuses is too costly and/or time consuming and migrants returned to Cambodia without 378 Ibid. 379 The Micah Mandate, 2012, \u201cPress Statement: Clearing misconceptions: The truth about migrants in Malaysia\u201d, at http://themicahmandate.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5d81941-0013-4c29-a242-52a8c4f7c665": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5d81941-0013-4c29-a242-52a8c4f7c665", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28e9ac352cf94aab423516c7f75e9dccdf48a0cc91c48600a9706ccf57e3415f"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2a7a5a3-d118-46e6-ab89-9350ad9de79f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54b20b2ec64991682dfe4ca1b2b735f5c5bb3bc393903e53dc692710b5fe74ad"}}, "hash": "e268094a1d4ca22374eea631e625e485a5c1bab9e0b9e376963ea888f89f04a5", "text": "org/2012/05/clearing-misconceptions-the-truth-about-migrants-in-malaysia/. 380 Migration Working Group/Northern Network for Migrants and Refugees, 2009, \u201cJoint Submission for the 4th session of the Universal Periodic Review, February 2009\u201d, at http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/MY/MWG_JUMP_MYS_UPR_S4_2009_ MigrationWorkingGroup_theNorthernNetworkforMigrantsandRefugees_JOINT_upr.pdf. 112 Country profile: Malaysia seeking legal resolution.381 The migrant rights organization Tenaganita also reported that in 2011 it recorded more than 1,500 cases involving undocumented workers and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7887513-a3c0-4f8e-94cf-e296f776913d": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7887513-a3c0-4f8e-94cf-e296f776913d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ccabe6e11f7392cd5735c7da11d62dca8df09b5a662004c2f29a63400d0a736"}, "3": {"node_id": "4871a926-ee43-4413-9329-d27d93264182", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "255cdd653fbf3428bccdbd9f25a85e23acf0be79839da45ef0514820024d4561"}}, "hash": "2819d21db3e6e9fde4780209bcb99a7598d561217fe7af5aab275e21f7374b41", "text": "500 cases on violation of immigration law by employers, noting that most undocumented workers were deported after serving jail sentences while most employers were cleared of charges.382 An important point to note relates to knowledge and perception of laws and regulations from an employer\u2019s point of view. Research carried out by CARAM Asia in 2010, involving interviews with approximately 280 randomly selected employers from Peninsular and East Malaysia, found that the vast majority of employers were not familiar with laws and regulations affecting migrant worker employment, particularly foreign domestic workers, although one in five believed workers were sufficiently protected under national laws.383 In order to address this lack of awareness of laws and regulations, the Department of Labour has introduced initiatives to promote awareness of laws and regulations protecting FDWs, including inspections, dialogues, and publications of guidelines stipulating roles and responsibilities of both employers and workers. A joint submission by the Migration Working Group and the Northern Network for Migrants and Refugees to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights\u2019 (OHCHR) Universal Periodic Review for Malaysia in 2009 also included allegations that the government had \u201cinterfered with the ability of civil society to criticize its migration policies\u201d, as exemplified by the arrest case of a prominent migrant rights activist.384 LABOUR MIGRATION GOVERNANCE In terms of international standards on right to health for all, Malaysia is not a signatory to the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which provides the most comprehensive provisions for protections of right to health. Further, it is also not a party to most core conventions of the UN that provide for the right of access to health care and medical treatment. Nevertheless, Malaysia has ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), which provides for the right to access health care services on a basis of equality of men and women (theoretically, including migrant workers). The country also upholds the right of all individuals to sexual and reproductive health in line with CEDAW and the 381 Voice of America, 2012, \u201cInquiry finds abuse of migrant workers in Malaysia\u201d, 9 January 2012, at http://www.voacambodia.com/content/inquiry- finds-abuse-of-migrants-in-malaysia/1579269.html. 382 \u201cMalaysia not safe for Indonesian migrant workers\u201d, The Jakarta Post, 7 May 2012, at http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/05/07/ malaysia-not-safe-indonesian-migrant-workers.html. 383 CARAM, 2010, Malaysia vs Hong Kong: Employers perceptions and attitudes towards foreign domestic workers. 384 Migration Working Group/Northern Network for Migrants and Refugees, 2009, \u201cJoint Submission for the 4th session of the Universal Periodic Review, February 2009\u201d, at http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/MY/MWG_JUMP_MYS_UPR_S4_2009_ MigrationWorkingGroup_theNorthernNetworkforMigrantsandRefugees_JOINT_upr.pdf. 113 The Right to Health Section III Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), and such services are available to those who seek care, irrespective of citizenship.

According to the Employment Act, medical expenses for migrant workers must be covered by the employer, who must also allow paid sick leave when there is an injury arising from an accident at work. In addition, the Foreign Workers Compensation Scheme, introduced under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act 1952, covers accident and injury claims from foreign workers. Recent research suggests that in practice many workers have not been able to access legally mandated sick leave, and have been unlawfully fined or dismissed for taking leave. In other cases, workers are prevented from going to public hospitals as they are not in possession of their passports, which are required to access services, as they have been unlawfully held by recruitment agencies.392 Other laws contributing to the legislative and policy framework protecting migrant health include the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994 and the subsequent Occupational Safety and Health (Use and Standards of Chemicals Hazardous to Health) Regulations 2000.

The Skim Perlindungan Insurans Kesihatan Pekerja Asing (SPIKPA), also known as the Health Insurance Protection Scheme for Foreign Workers, is a national insurance-based protection scheme under which sits the Hospitalisation and Surgical Scheme for Foreign Workers (SKHPPA). The Malaysian Government began its progressive implementation of SPIKPA in January 2011,393 in order to cover the cost of medical treatment and hospitalization of foreign workers. As of November 2013, 1.7 million foreign workers had been covered under this scheme. Total coverage provided amounts to 10,000 ringgit a year, and the cost of the insurance premium is 120 ringgit per year for a foreign worker. A total of 24 insurance companies have now agreed to join this scheme, and it is compulsory for most foreign workers in Malaysia, with the exception of FDWs in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah and foreign workers working in estates.394 The purchase of the SKHPPA insurance policy is also now a prerequisite for issuance and renewal of permits of foreign workers by the Malaysian Immigration Department. The scheme is implemented in a cashless form, and foreign workers who are protected under SPIKPA are neither required to pay a deposit nor submit a letter of guarantee from their insurance company/employer. The cost of treatment in the hospitals is covered by the insurance company, except in those cases where a foreign worker is seeking treatment for any disease not covered by the policy. In the event of any outstanding bills, the foreign worker\u2019s permit will not be renewed and the employer will be blacklisted by the Malaysian Immigration Department. 393 Progressive implementation began in Peninsular Malaysia on 1 January 2011, followed by Sabah on 1 July 2012 and Sarawak on 1 February 2013. 394 FDWs in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah who are given the option of whether or not they wanted to be covered under this scheme, while FDWs in Sarawak are covered under the compulsory scheme at the request of the State Government. Foreign workers working in estates that are already covered under the Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act 1990. 116 Country profile: Malaysia It is important to note that HIV testing is mandatory for incoming prospective migrant workers, as part of pre-departure medical examinations conducted in approved clinics or hospitals in source countries.395 Such testing is also a component of compulsory medical examinations to be carried out within one month of arrival and annually for the first two years of employment. Migrant workers in Malaysia who are found to be HIV-positive are considered not suitable or fit for employment and will not have their work permits renewed. Provisions for treatment, medical assistance, and post-test counselling have been developed in the case of deportation, but remain difficult to access. There is no referral system in place for migrant workers who are found to be HIV-positive in Malaysia and considered unfit for work, which hinders potential follow-up, care, and treatment in the migrant\u2019s country of origin.396 Migrant-sensitive health systems Regional multi-stakeholder discussions on this issue have brought up a number of examples of initiatives to increase migrant sensitivity of health systems. These include: (i) training of longer- term migrant workers to provide outreach with workers from rural clinics; (ii) the provision of signage and information on workplace safety to workers in their native language in industries such as plantations with a large percentage of foreign workers; and (iii) the availability of one-stop crisis centres in hospitals for migrant workers who experience violence and sexual harassment. With regard to in-language information, migrant workers are able to access information, health promotion, and disease prevention programmes in a range of languages at health facilities. Workers are advised to visit facilities with a companion who is able to communicate in Bahasa Malaysia and/or English. However, most health materials are also available in various languages at health facilities, such as Malay, English, Chinese, and Tamil. The Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994, enforced by the Department of Occupational Safety and Health within the Ministry of Human Resources, requires employers to provide information, instruction, training, and supervision to ensure the safety and health of employees at work, including migrant workers. Among recommendations provided to improve the occupational safety and health standards in sectors largely employing documented migrant workers is the installation of signage and provision of information in workers\u2019 native languages. For services responding to violence and sexual harassment, 130 one-stop crisis centres have been established in emergency departments of Ministry of Health hospitals, providing special services for the management of violence cases, including sexual harassment and counselling without discrimination in terms of migrant worker status.

For example, case studies of migrant workers in the Malaysian electronics industry note that if a doctor certifies an employee medically unfit for employment at any time, this is grounds for immediate termination of employment.398 In cases such as these, lack of job security prevents workers from seeking medical care, regardless of the level of awareness, availability, and accessibility of such care. Research also suggests that migrant workers in Malaysia, in particular female domestic workers, can face a range of specific health-related violations, including abuse, sexual and mental violence, denial of rest time, and vulnerability to occupational health hazards, with little or no access to treatment and care.399 The Task Force on ASEAN Migrant Workers has also made a series of recommendations related to the health rights of migrant workers and the establishment of more migrant-sensitive health systems. Recommendations include: (i) the safeguarding of living and housing conditions by ensuring compliance with the Housing and Amenities Act; (ii) strict application and enforcement of the Occupational Health and Safety Act; and (iii) the provision of counselling for migrant workers who experience violence and sexual harassment.400 Partnerships, networks, and multi-country frameworks Malaysian participants in regional discussions on access to health and HIV services for migrant workers have noted a lack of mechanisms to involve civil societies and migrant workers in new and existing networks, or to contribute to the development of bilateral agreements between Malaysia and source countries. For example, when the Malaysian Government negotiated with Indonesia on the establishment of a MoU on labour migration, there was no mechanism for the involvement of civil society. While it is important to recognize that the development and implementation of policy sits under the purview of the Malaysian Government, observers have also noted that while Malaysia participates in global and regional dialogues on this issue, recommendations and results have not necessarily been translated at the country level. Even where they have reached the national level they may not filter down to the regional, provincial, and local level. 401 397 Report of Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue, op. cit., p. 57. 398 Bormann, Krishnan, and Neuner, op. cit. 399 CARAM, 2010, Malaysia vs Hong Kong: Employers perceptions and attitudes towards foreign domestic workers. 400 Task Force on ASEAN Migrant Workers, 2008, \u201cNational Statement, Malaysia National Consultation on the ASEAN Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers\u201d, August 13\u201314, 2008. 401 Report of Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue, op. cit., p. 57. 118 Country profile: Malaysia RECOMMENDATIONS Monitoring migrants\u2019 health 1 Develop and agree on standard migrant health indicators (access, quality, and cost). 2 Improve multi-stakeholder collaboration in data collection processes, involving health, labour, immigration, and security sectors as well as consulates, unions, civil society organizations, and employers. 3 Ensure confidentiality, privacy, and the safeguarding of personal health data.

Marked disparity in the rate of economic growth between Myanmar and Thailand, the fact that Myanmar and Thailand share a border of approximately 2,500 kilometres accessible only by foot, and continuing labour demand from the Thai agricultural and fisheries industries have been key factors driving and facilitating this labour migration flow.

While the unauthorized migration of peoples from Myanmar to Thailand represents one of the three largest migration movements in Asia,410 2010 statistics from the Thailand Ministry of Labour estimate a total of approximately 1 million registered Myanmar migrant workers in Thailand. Some of those seeking work have entered Thailand legally with work permits and stayed beyond the registered period; others enter at legal border crossings on day passes and then do not return.411 In terms of total numbers, males make up a slight majority of registered migrant workers from Myanmar in Thailand, at 54 percent. While men generally work in construction, agriculture, fishery, and rubber plantations, women work predominantly as domestic workers and in garment and electronics factories.412 Of the approximately 1 million registered migrant workers in Thailand in 2010, roughly 17 percent were engaged in the agricultural sector, followed by 16 percent in construction, and 12 percent in seafood processing. Estimates suggest that up to 500,000 unskilled migrant workers from Myanmar have worked illegally in Malaysia, while approximately 250,000 were officially registered as of March 2012.413 In addition, an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 unregistered workers have worked in Singapore.414 406 Law Relating to Overseas Employment 1999, article 3(a), English translation at http://blc-burma.org/html/myanmar%20law/lr_e_ml99_03. html. 407 \u201cBurmese Labour Migration into Thailand\u201d, op. cit. 408 Regional Thematic Working Group on International Migration Including Human Trafficking, 2008, Situation Report on International Migration in East and South-East Asia, p. 60; Wine, op. cit. 409 NLM, 2011, Minister for Labour responds to questions of Dr. Myat Nyana Soe, at http://www.burmalibrary.org/docs12/PYIDH-NLM2011-03- migrant_workers-29.pdf. 410 Ditton and Lehane, \u201cTowards Realizing the Health-related Millennium Development Goals\u201d, op. cit., pp. 37 48. 411 Mon, \u201cBurmese Labour Migration into Thailand\u201d, op. cit. 412 Wine, \u201cFor Greener Pastures\u201d, op. cit. 413 Hall, Myanmar and Migrant Workers, op. cit. 414 Ibid.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a0d368b-b1da-477a-b143-99028a521343": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a0d368b-b1da-477a-b143-99028a521343", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88d823f7f7272658b73e1491a0579b47666d0ff593be98a59c16e3dac9c1dbe8"}, "2": {"node_id": "d7a20387-5670-4618-8123-607cd714ff6e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6ed1b6b6a993f56759e4ae977bf166247d13ba963fbd169f22076a4557a957bd"}}, "hash": "0dae1925555bbecaeb6cbd3cd87194d9bafbb76a6d36bb5578b9162fc8fbd725", "text": "413 Hall, Myanmar and Migrant Workers, op. cit. 414 Ibid. 123 The Right to Health Section III LABOUR MIGRATION GOVERNANCE Myanmar has not ratified either the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers or the ILO\u2019s Migration for Employment Convention (No. 97) or Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention (No. 143). Although the Law Relating to Overseas Employment 1999 theoretically governs the overseas employment of all workers, aside from seafarers and government assignments, in reality a significant percentage of movement across the border is undocumented, thus taking place outside the provisions of this legislation. In the specific case of movement from Myanmar to Thailand, labour migration processes are guided by a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding on Employment Cooperation between the two governments on the employment of low-skilled workers.

The law provides no guidance or capping of recruitment fees that licensed service agents may charge. Reports suggest that agencies charge applicants 1.2 million kyat ($960) to arrange jobs and flights to Malaysia; 3.2 million kyat ($2,560) to Singapore; 1.2 million kyat ($960) to the United Arab Emirates; and as much as $11,000 to Japan.422 Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of the Kingdom of Thailand the Government of the Union of Myanmar on Cooperation in the Employment of Workers The governments of Thailand and Myanmar signed this MoU covering low-skilled labour migration in 2003. The focus is to provide a framework for government-to-government recruitment of migrant workers for a specific period of employment in Thailand, providing (i) incentives to motivate workers to return home after the completion of employment, (ii) labour protection and dispute settlement, and (iii) measures against illegal employment.423 Migrant workers under this MoU were eligible for visas for temporary stay in Thailand, plus work permits for a period of two years. These work permits were then renewable for another four years, after which it would be necessary to leave Thailand for a period of three years before re-registering. Despite the fact that this agreement originated in 2003, preparations for implementation did not begin properly until 2008. As at end January 2010, only approximately 1,500 workers had been recruited directly from Myanmar via MoU processes. Owing to the lack of initial success of this MoU in filtering the continuing flow of undocumented workers from Myanmar into Thailand, the MoU processes were opened up to those semi-documented workers already living in Thailand.424 As part of this additional MoU registration process, migrant workers already in Thailand were required to go through an identification process known as \u2018nationality verification\u2019.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "783a1449-8f09-4057-8076-d85e4fc9a030": {"__data__": {"id_": "783a1449-8f09-4057-8076-d85e4fc9a030", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "397e774277a46e93621da3659457441e62a11b94c38c50060bafb71452dd3e47"}, "2": {"node_id": "b228d81d-f993-4694-adb9-0c5716bcf6b5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3e07a98d5f674988c0bd7645d8744d766dca2c9e2ad0aa5a5f60f2de5f7ec8a5"}}, "hash": "fc40717cdd145cede807d8a8e713de05db443ee8ee92c93aef66f68cc53165a7", "text": "This provided complications for a number of reasons, in particular: (i) a significant number of migrants had no official identification documents as the government did not recognize a number of ethnic minority groups as Burmese citizens; and (ii) unlike other neighbouring countries within the Greater Mekong Subregion, the Myanmar Government was originally unwilling to establish identification centres inside Thailand, instead requiring any migrant workers already in Thailand and seeking MoU registration to return home.

In 2006, the governments of Thailand and Myanmar agreed to establish a temporary processing centre for migrant worker registration in Mae Sot, Thailand, followed by additional centres in other border crossing points, with the aim of processing applications for approximately 10,000 migrant workers from Myanmar who had been offered jobs in Thailand.425 Subsequently, in 2008 three passport registration of\ufb01ces were planned in locations along the Thai\u2013Myanmar border, which would allow migrants to apply for relevant identification documents and register for work permits. A Myanmar labour attach\u00e9 is now also based in Bangkok to assist migrants to resolve disputes with employers and approve contracts.426 Estimates suggest that since the inception of MoU registration for workers already in Thailand, via nationality verification processes, approximately 350,000 workers from Myanmar had completed all required steps as at end January 2011.427 Following the expiration of a Thai Government deadline for all migrant workers to complete the required steps, all migrant workers in Thailand who have not met the deadline are theoretically classified as \u2018illegal, pending deportation\u2019. However, some confusion continues regarding implementation of the deportation processes, with Myanmar Government officials continuing to negotiate with Thai Government officials, and migrant rights\u2019 groups calling for policy clarity in the absence of official statements from Thailand.428 LABOUR MIGRATION AND THE RIGHT TO HEALTH In terms of international standards on the right to health for all, Myanmar is not a signatory to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which provides the most comprehensive provisions for protections of right to health. Further, it is also not a party state to most core United Nations conventions that provide for the right of access to health care and medical treatment. Nevertheless it has ratified CEDAW, which provides for the right to access health-care services on a basis of gender equality (theoretically including migrant workers beyond national citizens); and as a WHO Member State the country is committed to the WHO Resolution on the Health of Migrants, adopted at the 61st World Health Assembly in 2008, which recognizes increased health risks for groups of migrants and calls for the promotion of migrant-sensitive health policies and equitable access to health promotion, disease prevention, and care.429 425 Mon, \u201cBurmese Labour Migration into Thailand\u201d, op. cit. 426 Joint United Nations Initiative on Migration, Health and HIV in Asia (JUNIMA), 2013, Policy Brief: HIV and Labour Migration in the GMS: Myanmar. 427 IOM, 2011, Thailand Migration Report 2011. 428 O\u2019Toole, B., 2012, \u201cConfusion stalls Thai policy for Myanmar migrant workers\u201d, The Myanmar Times, 24 December 2012, at http://www. mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/3648-confusion-stalls-thai-policy-for-myanmar-migrant-workers.html. 429 WHA 61.17, Resolution on Health of Migrants. 126 Country profile: Myanmar Monitoring migrants\u2019 health Research completed in 2010 on the health status of migrant workers in the Sangklabhuri district of Thailand, near the border with Myanmar, found that migrant health, once in the host country, was characterized by poverty and social exclusion.430 Additional barriers preventing migrants from seeking adequate care included language, transportation, costs, and lack of knowledge about important health issues.431 Further research also notes that after arrival in Thailand many migrants see their health deteriorating due to heavy work, poor living conditions, and lack of access to care,432 with many employees living in dormitories on the factory grounds, where conditions are often overcrowded and unsanitary.433 Comprehensive information regarding health service provision, access, and utilization for migrant workers from Myanmar is very difficult to obtain for a variety of reasons, including: (i) the number of parties \u2014 government, non-government, and private \u2014 involved in data collection; and (ii) the inaccessibility of some areas within the country; and (iii) the internal and cross-border movement of the population.434 As a significant majority of workers depart via undocumented means, there is no consolidated available data on migrant health status prior to departure.

The scheme under which a documented worker is eligible to access health care is dependent on the steps they have completed towards full registration in Thailand. Further information on these schemes can be found in the Thailand chapter of this report. Most recently, in 2013 ministers from Thailand and Myanmar signed a memorandum of understanding for strengthening border health collaboration between the two countries.438 Migrant-sensitive health systems Information provided by the non-government organization M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res notes that migrant workers in factories, on construction sites, and in agriculture report more health problems than those in other industries. This increased pressure on health as a result of conditions in the workplace results mainly from poorly maintained equipment and the lack of adequate safety measures. Health problems include injuries from accidents, exhaustion, sleep deprivation, and even cases of malnutrition.439 While national and international NGOs provide health programmes and services predominantly in border areas, undocumented workers have no access to government-supported health care, although they can pay for medical treatment at government or private hospitals, and under special conditions, decided by service providers, they can benefit from free treatment. A point of note here, as detailed in relatively recent research, is that the staff of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res have reportedly witnessed the police setting up road blocks in front of the main hospital and arresting migrants on their way out after they had attended medical services.440 Migrant workers from Myanmar travelling to Thailand may have access to non-government- funded initiatives whereby migrant worker volunteers and migrant health assistants have been installed as in provincial hospitals in Thailand to bridge linguistic and cultural gaps. However, a number of these initiatives are still in the pilot stage and are hindered by government restrictions on the type of work migrants are able to carry out, which prevents the formal hiring of qualified Burmese migrants to provide ongoing translation services.441 438 Policy Brief: HIV and Labour Migration in the GMS: Myanmar, op. cit. 439 Myat and Theingi, 2010, The Potential Contribution of Return Migrants in Burma\u2019s Trade and Investment Liberalization Strategy, at http://asaa. asn.au/ASAA2010/reviewed_papers/Theingi-Hla_and_Myat_Mon.pdf. 440 Ibid. 441 Good Practices to Protect and Promote Migrant Workers\u2019 Rights in Thailand, op. cit., p. 8. 128 Country profile: Myanmar Partnerships, networks, and multi-country frameworks Participants in multi-stakeholder discussions on migrant workers\u2019 right to health in the ASEAN region have noted that the majority of health-related funding for migrant workers is earmarked for HIV.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a290917-47e4-4443-bd47-4d897a928ead": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a290917-47e4-4443-bd47-4d897a928ead", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd26c6c836eb11a4d93912f65b9a48df1fd80672fbbad564d4ca3972a3c6b57f"}, "2": {"node_id": "02513759-6039-42fa-8a22-558c2e9760d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cace9158729e01df0b83caba2a15ab570fdbc9162043714696a698bf4c469114"}}, "hash": "bd73a9c3940d22e43d9c2abcc518be23644c64369d8bc9eb2e16a0af68a88531", "text": "Although non-government organizations are heavily involved in the provision of health- related services to workers, particularly in border regions, discussion participants noted the need for such organizations to be more involved in migration and development partnerships.442 Within the subregional grouping of Myanmar, Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Thailand a number of consultations have already been held to look at cross-border partnerships, particularly with regard to improving access to antiretroviral treatment along the migration continuum for migrant workers living with HIV.443 Regional-level strategies involving Thailand are also in place, as in Mon State, including informal local networking systems to care for migrants.444 For further information on health care access for migrant workers from Myanmar working in Thailand, please see the Thailand country profile in this report. 442 Report of Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue, op. cit., p. 57. 443 For example, (i) Consultation on Migrants\u2019 Access to Anti-Retroviral Treatment Along the Migration Continuum in Four Greater Mekong Subregion Countries, see www.junima.org;

In terms of economics, national employment growth has been unable to keep up with population growth, and consequently unemployment levels are increasing.447 In particular, those aged 15\u201324 years currently experience an unemployment rate more than twice the national average,448 leading many to seek opportunities abroad.

Of the more than 8 million Filipinos residing abroad in 2010, almost 47 percent were temporary migrants and approximately 7 percent were undocumented or irregular workers. Since 2006 the annual new deployment rate of documented OFWs has been greater than 1 million,457 and total overseas Filipino worker deployments of almost 1.69 million in 2011 represented the highest level to date.458 OFWs are officially deployed in 192 countries, with significant numbers of low-skilled or semi-skilled labour migrants, primarily in the household services sector, heading to the Middle East and East and South-East Asia. Of the registered OFWs deployed in 2011, approximately 1.32 million were land-based and 370,000 sea-based (fisherman, seafarers, etc.). Of these total deployments, approximately 26 percent, or 437,000, were new hires for 2011. In addition to documented deployments, estimates from the Commission on Filipinos Overseas suggest there were more than 700,000 irregular Filipino migrants worldwide as of December 2010, up from approximately 650,000 as at the end of 2009.

This slip has been attributed to a variety of reasons, including the Philippine Government\u2019s moratoria on the sending of female domestic workers to certain countries, as well as restrictions on the fielding of entertainers, predominantly female, in Asian destination countries.464 For low-skilled female OFWs by far the largest numbers of new hires in 2010 were categorized as household service workers,465 who travelled predominantly, in order of volume, to Hong Kong, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Singapore. LABOUR MIGRATION GOVERNANCE The key piece of legislation guiding the deployment of Filipino OFWs is the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act 1995 (RA 8042), as amended most recently by the Republic Act (RA) No. 10022.

Generally speaking, Philippine labour migration laws and policies have a strong focus on worker protection. The government is known for advocating for protections for its OFWs through high- level missions to address migrant welfare, the enforcing of model contracts for migrant protection, and the regulation of private recruitment agencies.468 To date, the Philippines has the most responsive formal record of all ASEAN countries with regards to migrant rights\u2019 protection, having ratified both the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and the ILO\u2019s Migration for Employment Convention (No. 97) and Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention (No.143). In 2012 it also became only the second country in the world to ratify the ILO\u2019s Convention Concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers (No. 189), which came into force mid-2013. Recent sector-specific national policies to increase protection of OFWs also includes The Household Services Reform Package, aiming to improve protections for service sector workers abroad. Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995, as amended by Republic Act No. 10022 This act lays out the varied responsibilities of the range of government agencies that are involved in managing various aspects of the migration process for OFWs, including: the Department of Foreign Affairs; the Department of Labor and Employment; and DOLE subsidiary bodies \u2014 the Philippines Overseas Employment Administration and Overseas Workers Welfare Administration. POEA, in particular, is mandated to take responsibility for the \u201cregulation and management of overseas employment from the pre-employment stage, securing the best possible employment terms and conditions for overseas Filipino workers, and taking into consideration the needs of vulnerable sectors and the peculiarities of sea-based and land-based workers.\u201d The Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for negotiation of bilateral and multilateral agreements for the protection of migrant workers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4dfebe25-2058-4480-b86a-180e06fc6d5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "4dfebe25-2058-4480-b86a-180e06fc6d5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9defdebc3e5966ec5ff1a8c1d0073ec0167003629008336e5da6afc5cf2d843e"}, "2": {"node_id": "86da2338-1fef-4104-be5c-7bd6fd5de629", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39abc39b339e88174ce32b85a32266e0b75c643eb78e789cb786d2efeb31a641"}}, "hash": "491b49d548ed03204663550cf468396c5e8a20fb288baf90fc6718e9e58e4a5a", "text": "Republic Act 10022 reiterates the importance of government agencies, specifically POEA, in licensing and monitoring recruitment agencies.

In this regard, the Department of Foreign Affairs is mandated to issue \u2018certifications\u2019 for destination countries to POEA, either facilitating continued labour export or imposing a ban on the deployment of migrant workers.472 Criteria for such certifications include: \u2022 having existing labour and social laws protecting the rights of migrants; or \u2022 being a signatory to multilateral conventions, declarations, or resolutions relating to the protection of migrant workers; or \u2022 have concluded a bilateral agreement with the Philippines on such matters; or, \u2022 taking positive, concrete measures to protect the rights of migrant workers.473 In 2011, only 76 of the 192 countries to which Filipino OFWs are deployed had been certified.474 For OFWs themselves, legislated protections include pre-employment orientation seminars, pre-departure training, and mandatory contract templates. According to the implementing rules and regulations of RA10022, POEA will also provide free legal services to OFWs who are victims of illegal recruitment processes.475 A national reintegration centre for OFWs is also mandated to be established, to serve as a \u201cmechanism for their reintegration into the Philippine society\u201d and \u201ctap their skills and potentials for national development.\u201d476 In support of this latter goal, the reintegration of OFWs is also a policy principle of DOLE\u2019s Labor and Employment Strategy for 2011\u20132016.477 The regulation of the costs incurred by OFWs moving abroad is also included in RA10022.

A key problem noted by the Philippines, in addition to other source countries, was that although the country may have established its own law against mandatory HIV testing, unfortunately the testing regulations of a number of the countries to which the Philippines sends significant numbers of workers must be complied with.481 Policies and legal frameworks affecting migrant health Protection of the right to health is a focus in both domestic policy and practice. Multi-sectoral cooperation within government and between government and civil society is also stronger in the Philippines than in other ASEAN Member States, and a number of practices related to improving health access for impending, currently deployed, and returned migrant workers have been cited as best practice examples in a range of forums. Particular initiatives of note, as will be discussed below, include: the extension of portable health insurance to migrant workers; the implementation of multisectoral training schemes to enhance the capacity of overseas labour officers dealing with migrant health issues; and the creation of procedural guides for overseas welfare officers in managing HIV-positive overseas foreign workers deported from those host countries with travel-related restrictions. For the general population in the Philippines, universal health coverage and mandatory health insurance through the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, or PhilHealth, was originally mandated by the National Health Insurance Act of 1995. However, commentary notes that the levels of protection afforded through PhilHealth have been limited by difficulties in accessing benefits, failure to understand and comply with administrative requirements, and the inability to afford necessary co-payments.482 More recently, in December 2010 the government endorsed the Aquino Health Agenda: Achieving Universal Health Care for All Filipinos, with the goals of ensuring sustained health financing and equitable access to affordable health care.483 In terms of data and monitoring to inform health care services and financing, while a more extensive national health information system exists than in many other ASEAN Member States, the effectiveness of this system, for both national and impending or returned migrant workers, is fragmented by a decentralized health system, whereby responsibility for health services and budgets has shifted to local government authorities.484 For migrant workers in particular, RA10022 prescribes a range of health-related protections, including the responsibility of recruitment and manning agencies to shoulder the insurance coverage of each migrant worker deployed,485 the establishment of a re-placement and monitoring 481 Report of Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue, op. cit., p. 54. 482 WHO, 2011, Country Strategy Philippines, 2011 2016, at http://www.who.int/countryfocus/cooperation_strategy/ccs_phl_en.pdf, p. 23. 483 Ibid., p. 24. 484 Ibid. 485 Orbeta and Abrigo, op. cit. 138 Country profile: Philippines centre for returning Filipinos,486 and an Overseas Filipinos Resource Centre in countries where there are large concentrations of Filipino migrant workers.487 The key government agency responsible for implementation of a number of the above mentioned health-related protections for deployed migrant workers is the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA).

work with the Department of Foreign Affairs to \u201ctransform Philippine embassies, consular offices and Philippines Overseas Labor Offices into centres of care and service for OFWs by assigning more foreign service officers to posts where there are many OFWs and train them in the needs of the communities they serve.\u201d491 DOLE\u2019s strategy also specifically recommends a focus on expanding welfare and protection measures for OFWs, as well as a growing need for work-force-specific occupational safety and health programmes, which include OFWs\u2019 vulnerability to mental health problems such as depression, psychosis, anxieties, and phobias, as well as addressing increased incidence of HIV/AIDS.492 At the same time, recent commentary notes that sexual and reproductive health problems in particular, including HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, continue to fall between the cracks of policy and legal frameworks affecting migrant health because of a policy focus on \u201cwork-related illnesses\u201d and a lack of research illustrating the link between work conditions and sexual and reproductive health problems.493 Key gaps in health access for OFW\u2019s while abroad continue to occur as a result of a lack of sensitivity of health and medical care providers abroad and policies in destination countries that prevent certain interventions by host countries.

Migrant-sensitive health systems A particular area where the Philippines\u2019 work on health access for its OFWs has been used as a good practice for other sending countries relates to its work on repatriation and reintegration of OFWs deported from host countries after having been found to be HIV-positive. As discussed in other country profiles, three countries in the region \u2014 Brunei, Singapore, and Malaysia \u2014 maintain legislated restriction on travel, entry, and stay of people living with HIV, as do countries in the Arab States, which are host to increasing numbers of low-skilled and semi-skilled OFWs. Relevant health-specific legislation and policies that aim to protect OFWs in this regard include the Republic Act 8504: Philippine AIDS Prevention and Control Act, Department Order 01-04 s. 2006 (Guidelines on the Referral System of Repatriated OFWs Diagnosed with HIV Abroad) and Memorandum circular on implementation of RA10022 with respect to referral/decking system being implemented by OFW clinics. A national strategic plan and programmes also exist to address migrant workers\u2019 access to HIV services, although discussions suggest that there are a number of challenges to implementation, including: (i) gaps in relationships between the Department of Labor and embassies in countries receiving Filipino workers; and (ii) where issues related to undocumented workers are handled by the Department of Foreign Affairs and those related to documented workers are handled by the Department of Labor, there is no mechanism for referral.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d910f69-7f30-4b73-8292-ceb0f56af065": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d910f69-7f30-4b73-8292-ceb0f56af065", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0aa545655d9fce422ce17d03a023ab419302adc6c8cb7dc95b77589d368d5625"}, "2": {"node_id": "acceefc9-abaf-481c-9e99-df0b54fca80c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c07f4e822bc829d2f87eaa8e21b2f18c209bb0fdf3cc6b75ea3c876b563cceef"}}, "hash": "c8f6abe751aa5f308d939dff801d0b40a51a6918af64441efe9dc9913f4849df", "text": "HIV-specific issues include: (i) the inability to influence receiving countries, and a need to better understand what the constraints are that prevent receiving countries from moving forward on this issue, e.g., financial limitations and myths regarding HIV; (ii) migrant workers\u2019 fear or negative perception of the embassies and consulates, leading to a lack of confidence regarding approaching these resources when in need.495 There are also no arrangements between authorities in destination countries and Philippine embassies, consulates, and labour offices abroad regarding the confidential referral of HIV-positive OFWs.

In the past the Singapore Government\u2019s approach to foreign labour has been mixed. Academic commentary identifies four policy stages in recent history: (i) a period of very strict controls on the admission of low-skilled labour migrants immediately following political independence, as a result of high domestic unemployment; (ii) the subsequent introduction in the 1980s of a \u2018no foreign labour\u2019 policy outside the sectors of construction, shipbuilding, and domestic services; (ii) a period of strong economic growth leading to an immediate increase in demand for foreign labour and a subsequent reduction in restrictions on import of foreign labour; and (iv) the reintroduction of stricter policies in response to the global financial crisis beginning in 2009.504 501 Ministry of Manpower, \u201cForeign Workforce Numbers\u201d, at http://www.mom.gov.sg/statistics-publications/others/statistics/Pages/ ForeignWorkforceNumbers.aspx. 502 Ministry of Manpower, \u201cLabour Force\u201d, at http://www.mom.gov.sg/statistics-publications/national-labour-market-information/statistics/ Pages/labourforce.aspx. 503 Teng, Y.

For example, it is estimated that one in five households in Singapore employ a live-in domestic worker, with demand increasing. Anecdotal reports in early 2012 also suggested that the current low and semi-skilled workforce would require tens of thousands more than its current total of 240,000 construction workers to execute planned public housing programmes alone.505 In-migration overview The majority of migrant workers coming to Singapore from within the ASEAN region are semi- skilled or unskilled workers, employed in labour-intensive jobs such as construction, manufacturing, maritime, and service industries, which include domestic work, health care, retail, entertainment, and hospitality.506 Exact data on the number of foreign workers from particular source countries is not available in the public domain as it is considered by the government to be sensitive.

In its report to the Universal Periodic Review513 in 2011, Singapore noted that the exclusion of domestic workers from protections under the Employment Act are necessary as certain aspects of their work make it impractical to regulate under this act.514 As a result, FDWs are governed under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Chapter 91A). The Employment Agencies Act 2011 also specifically governs the practices of recruitment agencies providing foreign workers in Singapore. The Ministry of Manpower is responsible for the enforcement of each of three laws noted above, as well as their related regulations. In addition, the Ministerial Steering Committee on Foreign Workers Management was established in 2009 to coordinate government strategy on foreign migrant workers in Singapore. Unlike a number of other countries in the ASEAN region, Singapore does not generally supplement management of labour migration with bilateral agreements with source countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b72c889f-d2a3-47d5-841b-9c3dcbd4317c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b72c889f-d2a3-47d5-841b-9c3dcbd4317c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6fc21006ba28a38d4113fac7501609c5d21cf4c8b2dae19955b96cf3254c3832"}, "2": {"node_id": "7030c3eb-ff37-450d-bb58-a661ded647f1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3786c00696cfd202cac8445e70a27accd864fbcbd1ac136d80125e32df1939e4"}}, "hash": "e8f1c79fe17f9e300766096ea311376a3f2284ff65f7e020d77f52854043c2db", "text": "To date, for example, the Philippines is the only country to have pushed for its own standard contract for its migrant workers in Singapore, although Indonesia may also follow Philippines in this regard.515 Singapore has not ratified either the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers or the ILO\u2019s Migration for Employment Convention (No. 97) or Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention (No. 143).

It includes provisions for contracts of service; payments of salary, including fixed salary periods and authorized deductions; rest days, including the provision of one day of rest per week and maximum hours per working week; and holiday and sick leave entitlements, including entitlement to paid sick leave. Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Chapter 91A) This act prescribes the responsibilities and obligations pertaining to the employment of foreign workers, focusing primarily on the provision of work permits and passes. The act states that all foreign employees working in Singapore must be in possession of a valid work pass, which is only valid under one employer518 and may not be held by anyone other than the employee.519 The act binds all employers to take responsibility for the well-being of their foreign workers, including purchasing and maintaining medical insurance and providing personal safety, proper accommodation, adequate food and rest, and prompt salary payment. Recent amendments to this legislation also include: (i) for domestic workers, the granting of one day off per week or compensation in lieu of, in effect for all work passes issued or renewed as of 1 January 2013; and (ii) increased penalties \u2014 including financial penalties and debarment from hiring foreign workers \u2014 to employers guilty of infringements against the act, in effect as of end 2012. Under related regulations MoM also requires employers to pay a monthly levy for employees holding work permits, ranging from S$50 to S$470,520 plus a security bond of S$5,000 for each migrant worker, including FDWs. The security bond is only repaid once the contract is completed and the worker is repatriated, at no cost to the worker. Conditions of the security bond include an employer\u2019s responsibility to: (i) ensure prompt payment of salary; (ii) cover costs of upkeep and maintenance, including medical treatment; (iii) provide acceptable accommodation; and (iv) cover the full cost of repatriation.521 The government reports that it conducts interviews with randomly-selected first-time FDWs during their initial months of employment in order to help determine their adjustment to Singapore\u2019s work environment and to reiterate the importance of safe working conditions and their rights and responsibilities. In addition, first-time employers and employers who frequently change FDWs are required to attend a compulsory employer orientation programme covering good employment practices and obligations. Some are required to attend an interview with government officials before their application for a new FDW is approved. 518 Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, article 12. 519 Ibid., article 13. 520 \u201cLow-Income Migration: When the marginalised move across borders\u201d, op. cit. 521 Ministry of Manpower, Work Permit \u2014 before you apply, at http://www.mom.gov.sg/foreign-manpower/passes-visas/work-permit-fw/before- you-apply/Pages/security-bond.aspx. 147 The Right to Health Section III Employment Agencies Act 2011 This act regulates the practices of employment agencies serving as intermediaries between employers and foreign workers. It limits the service fees that agencies can charge foreign workers, including FDWs, to no more than one month\u2019s salary per year of employment contract, subject to a maximum of two month\u2019s salary.522 The government also requires a refund of at least 50 percent of the fees collected from workers who are prematurely terminated within the first six months of employment. In April 2011 the government made changes to the Employment Agencies (EA) regulatory framework to raise the standard of recruitment practices in Singapore and deter malpractices associated with unlicensed agency activities. Changes include mandatory certification and/ or registration for all EA personnel, enhancing the maximum penalty for operating an unlicensed EA, and penalizing employers who engage with unlicensed EAs. The Ministry of Manpower administers a demerit point system for employment agencies, and the accumulation of a certain number of points means the agency will be placed on a surveillance list and have their Work Permit Online and Employment Pass Online accounts suspended.

For example, some employers have been found to withhold records such as contracts, salary slips, and time cards, preventing workers from substantiating claims of employment-related abuse. Even where workers were successful in lodging claims, complaints can take a number of months to be resolved, during which time workers are unable to work. Given the employers ability to either immediately cancel work permits or even refuse to cancel work permits to prevent workers from seeking a new employer, migrant workers may take a significant risk in lodging complaints.529 Research has also found that migrant workers travelling to Singapore have experienced contract substitution, despite a government initiative to deliver approval letters to migrant workers prior to departure from home country to inform them of their salaries. Allegations of contract substitution refer to a process whereby workers are offered favourable terms early on during the recruitment process, only to be presented with new contracts with less favourable terms immediately prior to departing for the host country, leaving the worker with little choice but to sign.530 In response to this, countries such as the Philippines are pushing for their workers to sign standard contracts that stipulate minimum working conditions and salaries better than those provided by the host government\u2019s employment laws, although it is unclear how effective this initiative has been. Commentary suggests that such a push can potentially have the side-effect of creating precarious situations \u2014 politically for the governments involved, and economically for the sending country and workers who may be passed up by employers in favour of workers from a country that does not try to enforce such protections. From the perspective of the workers, concern for job security can prevent them from seeking to invoke legislated protections. For example, Filipina domestic workers are required to submit contracts and evidence of enforcement when renewing passports or contracts in Singapore, yet it is known that some will submit contracts that are not real in order to ensure continuation of employment, while in reality they have accepted contracts offering much lower pay.531 With specific regard to the protection of domestic workers\u2019 rights in Singapore, the fact that migrant domestic workers are not covered under national employment legislation raises additional concerns. In its concluding comments about Singapore, the CEDAW Committee raised concerns regarding the rights of foreign domestic workers,532 and in April 2010 the UN Special Rapporteur on Racism/Xenophobia raised concerns on his visit to Singapore about the living and working conditions of migrant workers, including domestic workers.

It is also not a party state to most of core United Nations conventions that provide for right of access to health care and medical treatment. However, Singapore has ratified CEDAW, which provides for the right to access health- care services on a basis of gender equality (theoretically including migrant workers beyond national citizens). As a WHO Member State, Singapore is also committed to the WHO Resolution on the Health of Migrants, adopted at the 61st World Health Assembly, which recognizes increased health risks for groups of migrants and calls for the promotion of migrant-sensitive health policies and equitable access to health promotion, disease prevention, and care.534 Monitoring migrants\u2019 health The World Health Organization ranks Singapore\u2019s health system the best in Asia and the sixth best in the world. The Singaporean Government also formally recognizes the importance of public health and sanitation, and adheres to the principal that good and affordable medical services should be available to all citizens.535 All working Singaporeans make compulsory salary contributions to medical insurance schemes, such as Medishield, while some citizens also take out private medical insurance policies.536 In terms of data collection specifically on health systems and service provision and utilization by migrant workers in Singapore, the majority of data that is collected is used for exclusionary purposes, for example HIV and pregnancy testing. Reporting of accidents and deaths of migrant workers is also kept confidential, and cannot be consolidated.537 533 Hartung, R., 2012, \u201cLure better workers here\u201d, Singapore Today, 9 January 2013, at http://www.todayonline.com/CommentaryandAnalysis/ Commentary/EDC130109-0000005/Lure-better-workers-here 534 WHA 61.17, Resolution on Health of Migrants. 535 \u201cA joint submission by members of Solidarity for Migrant Workers for the 11th Session of the Universal Periodic Review\u201d, op. cit. 536 National Report for Singapore\u2019s Universal Periodic Review, op. cit. 537 Report of Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue, op. cit., p. 54. 150 Country profile: Philippines The Singaporean non-government organization Transient Workers Count Too reported that in the first 10 months of 2010 it saw 685 injury cases for migrant workers,538 while the Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics (HOME) reported that in 2009 it provided shelter housing for 1,388 migrant domestic workers. The most common violations experienced by these workers included inadequate food or accommodation (43 percent) and psychological abuse (30 percent).539 Policies and legal frameworks affecting migrant health For all migrant workers, access to health services is dependent upon employers, who are legislated under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act to take out compulsory medical insurance for foreign workers, including FDWs, to ensure basic coverage for medical expenses, including hospital bills and day surgery. For migrant workers, the government has also appointed NGOs such as HOME to provide such services as health promotion and awareness on its behalf.540 The Employment of Foreign Manpower Act stipulates health-related conditions to which employers of foreign workers, including FDWs, must adhere, including: (i) provision of adequate food as well as medical treatment; (ii) provision of safe working conditions; (iii) ensuring safety and health of the foreign employee at work; (iv) provision of medical insurance with coverage of at least S$15,000 for a 12-month period of employment for inpatient care and day surgery; and (v) provision of a minimum of S$40,000 in personal accident insurance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15b39b89-b86c-4712-882d-fb1b2487ab77": {"__data__": {"id_": "15b39b89-b86c-4712-882d-fb1b2487ab77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Right to Health: Right to Health for Low-Skilled Labour Migrants in ASEAN Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3eb668edc648a1c797e2526299a1d6231e310edd511c0153650c4f1301d6ea19"}, "2": {"node_id": "d54a1159-c475-4102-a226-413fd2e786ac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/right-health-right-health-low-skilled-labour-migrants-asean-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce03cc75f212810268d00577c81e610af8f8d7329383bd5e635dcf7fad9fa30f"}}, "hash": "cff55cb97f9df67df34636b978f6b91ada4a8c88a15aa7d1c884a497f26da327", "text": "Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some employers who found out about illnesses would then terminate the employee.541 While some migrant workers, excluding FDWs, are covered under the provisions of the Employment Act, it has been noted that both this act and the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act do not provide protections against denial of medical leave.542 Provisions for medical insurance and care for domestic workers have also been criticized by some commentators as being too vague, in particular the absence of reference to working hours, access to public holidays, medical and annual leave, and definition of safe working conditions.543 In recent times, Singapore has taken a number of positive steps in the protection of migrant workers\u2019 right to health.

According to work permit regulations, all migrant workers must undergo a biannual medical examination by a Singapore registered doctor. In accordance with the Immigration Act, detection of HIV is grounds for immediate deportation. Reports on HIV testing suggest that they often disregard established best practices of consent, confidentiality, counselling, and referral to treatment and support services.545 With specific regard to domestic workers, recent research by the CEDAW Committee notes that these workers do not have access to health education and screening programmes as a result of restrictive working conditions and lack of time off. Inconsistent enforcement of laws mandating employers to take out medical and hospital insurance has also lead to migrant women domestic workers going without medical treatment for long periods of time or being deported without access to medical treatment. At the same time, the psychosocial health of such workers is negatively affected due to such factors as work pressures, poor working conditions, abuse, and harassment. One psychiatrist at a state hospital reported seeing an average of five migrant women domestic workers per month suffering from mental disorders.

Generally speaking, NGOs play a key role in the protection of migrant workers\u2019 right to access health care in Singapore. Attempts have been made to enhance the quality of care by setting up, for example, a 24-hour hotline for migrant workers, providing outreach materials in native languages, and engaging volunteer nurses from the Philippines in order to help with health outreach.546 Partnerships, networks, and multi-country frameworks The government-run Health Promotion Board has partnered with HOME to carry out health and HIV-related seminars and outreach to migrant workers, including work with cross-border partners and a specific contract for outreach for sex workers, conducting surveys and research.547 545 Ibid. 546 Report of Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue, op. cit. 547 Ibid., p. 58. 152 Country profile: Philippines RECOMMENDATIONS Monitoring migrants\u2019 health 1 Design and implement systems for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of disaggregated data on migrant workers, examining health care needs and health-seeking behaviour in order to inform health-related interventions and programming.

It is also a sending country for a relatively small numbers of low-skilled labour migrants to countries across Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Low-skilled labour migrants, predominantly from Myanmar, first began to work in Thailand\u2019s border areas in greater numbers in the early 1990s, initially employed in the fishing and agriculture industries.548 Since then, the demand for migrant workers has continued to grow, and low-skilled labour migrants are seen by some employers as providing relatively cheaper sources of labour across sectors increasingly avoided by Thai workers, with demand greatest in the fishing, seafood processing, agriculture, construction, and domestic employment industries.549 For example migrant workers account for 25 percent or more of the total number of employees in the \ufb01shing, \ufb01sh-processing, and domestic service sectors. Continuing demand for migrant workers is driven by multiple factors. The combination of demographic transition and the upgrading of the skills of the Thai workforce have left certain sectors facing a shortage of unskilled labour. Recent projections suggest that new Thai entrants to the labour market satisfied only 33 percent of the country\u2019s demand for unskilled workers at end 2012.550 On the other hand, positive growth rates in the 15\u201339-year age group in Myanmar, 548 \u201cImmigration to Thailand\u201d, op. cit., p. 304. 549 IMO, 2011, Thailand Migration Report 2011. 550 Vasuprasat, P., 2010, Agenda for Labour Migration Policy in Thailand: Towards long-term competitiveness, (ILO). 155 The Right to Health Section III Cambodia, and Lao PDR 551 help to ensure a steady flow of migrants willing to fill labour supply gaps in Thailand.552 Documented migrants from Myanmar contribute an estimated $11 billion (6.2 percent of the gross domestic product) to the Thai economy and make up 5 percent of the workforce.553 Yet, despite the fact that they are an essential part of the Thai economy, these workers remain a marginalized group.554 Government policy is not always supportive of labour demand, and academic commentary suggests that many threats against the basic rights of migrants have stemmed from the state\u2019s view of them as security threats.555 Public perception of migrant workers in Thailand
