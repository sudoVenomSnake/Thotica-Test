Only government data from Bangladesh and Malaysia were supplied. The governments in India, Thailand, Myanmar, Bhutan and Lao PDR had previously supplied data to TRAFFIC for prior Tiger trade analyses (Verheij et al, 2010, Stoner and Pervushina, 2013). However, the majority of this dataset comprises Tiger seizures that were reported in the media or from openly available sources, such as Tigernet in India. Any duplicate incidents were removed. Online research was also conducted to document internet trading. This report analyses Tiger seizures reported between 2000 and 2015 to assess both the long-term and current trade picture. Previous TRAFFIC reports (Verheij et al, 2010, Stoner and Pervushina, 2013) are also referred to, as a comparison through time. To this end, temporal analysis was also categorized into quarterly periods: (1) 2000-2003; (2) 2004-2007; (3) 2008-2011, and (4) 2012-2015 to allow for the identification of persistent, chronic problems, as well those emerging in trade during the most recent quarter (2012-2015). To identify changes in the trade of Tiger commodities over time, commodity types were consolidated into five categories for analysis (Table 3). Table 3: Broader categories of Tiger commodity types used in analysis Abbreviation Category Commodity Type PAR Body Parts Body part NES (not elsewhere specified), paw, claw, tail, head BON Bones Skull, skeleton, bone SKI Skins Skin, skin pieces, wallets MIS Miscellaneous Wine, whiskers, teeth, genitalia, gall bladder, canine, meat, meat/part pieces, unknown WHO Whole Specimen Body, dead specimen, live specimen, whole specimen, carcass 21 2.2 Analysis To ensure consistency, and to render seizure data comparable with earlier TRAFFIC reports (Verheij et al, 2010, Stoner and Pervushina, 2013), the same counting method was used to estimate the number of individuals found in trade. Records of seized items were tallied as units that could be used to calculate the number of Tigers involved in each seizure. Quantities of body parts equivalent to one or more Tigers: counted in seizures involving claws, canine teeth, heads, ribs, legs, penises, skulls and jaw bones. When seizure records were identified as involving \u201cteeth\u201d, these records were assumed to represent canine teeth, as these are the most common Tiger teeth observed in trade. For each seizure, the minimum number of whole Tigers that could yield the items present was calculated. For example, between one and 18 claws in a seizure were deemed to equate to a single Tiger because Tigers have 18 claws. Likewise, four claws, one head, and two ribs were also deemed to equate to a single Tiger because the parts involved amounted to no more than those present in one animal. To avoid disproportionate reporting of Tiger numbers in trade, the minimum and maximum calculation were considered the same for weight specifications or \u201cpieces\u201d. Theoretically, 33 skin pieces could originate from one Tiger (minimum) or from 33 (maximum), and a kilogramme of parts could be derived from one Tiger to an unknown number of Tigers. The same methodology to estimate minimum numbers was also applied in the case of item amounts given in kilogrammes or as numbers of \u201cpieces\u201d. Hence in the example of the 33 skin pieces, both calculations would yield one Tiger. Table 4: Examples of calculation used to determine the number of individuals based on Tiger body parts found in trade Complete pieces that represented whole Tigers: counted in seizures involving tanned skins, full skeletons, complete carcasses, taxidermy mounts and live animals. Such instances required no minimum or maximum as the pieces, for example a skull or a whole skin could not have represented anything but a single Tiger. Quantities of Tiger parts and derivatives: counted in seizures of meat and processed products, like medicines, or wine are the most difficult to quantify. The calculation is based on the general premise that 10 kg of bones are determined to Tiger Body Part Number / Weight Minimum Maximum Bone 2 / 10kg 1 2 Canine 8 2 8 Claw 10 1 10 Paw 5 2 5 Meat 22kg 3 3 Piece of Skin 11 1 11 Bottle of Wine 40 1 1 Total Number of Tigers 11 40 22 be equivalent to one Tiger.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b7cc5fd-3c36-4a46-9725-8013c70dc829": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b7cc5fd-3c36-4a46-9725-8013c70dc829", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reduced to skin and bones re-examined : full analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "493de2248b5450ca478f620a5b3d196e532991ddc6a70da8cc52966bfa4f308c"}, "2": {"node_id": "f960853d-ef08-489e-b3a7-8716dfd88978", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57f333978cbac8931b34f5b49901bf5867c775d5e2fc75c8e94ca1df9b188aad"}}, "hash": "fcc5f58a93f25c5e31c9988de1ad0b23e1e4dcaf16c2d6b3c1e83a0e81ecf68c", "text": "This extrapolation is based on interviews with representatives of the Chinese medicine industry who noted that the annual removal of Tigers from the wild peaked in the 1960s at approximately 300 animals, yielding approximately three metric tonnes of Tiger bone (Jenkins, 2006; Nowell and Xu, 2007).

Hence, seizures containing several skin or bone pieces (with or without other parts) were conservatively considered to represent one Tiger. 2.3 Geographical Analysis Two different methods were used to analyse location data, where this information was available for reported Tiger seizures. The density estimation mapping technique in ArcGIS was applied to determine any statistically significant clustering in the spatial pattern of the specific location of Tiger seizures. Conversely, the origin, transit and destination points at a country level of Tiger seizures (where available) were analysed using Trademapper.2 This allows for the identification of countries that play prominent roles in the overall Tiger trade chain. 2.4 Statistical Analysis Multinomial logit regression models were used to model the categorical response of the nominal outcome variables (countries and commodities) through time (using R package \u2018nnet\u2019; Venables and Ripley, 2002). Bootstrapped predictions (B = 1000) of temporal trends were calculated for each response category and were used to calculate 95% confidence intervals for the predictions (based on temporal block bootstrap resampling; block length = 3 years). Generalised linear regression models were fitted to test for a change (e.g., increase) in the estimated maximum and minimum number of tigers seized through time (Poisson variance), and the number of incidents through time. A linear regression model was used to test for a change in the number of live specimens traded through time. All data analyses were conducted in the R software environment (version 3.3.1) for statistical and graphical computing (R Core Team, 2016). 2.5 Data Limitations As noted earlier, only seven of the 13 TRC governments responded with information on Tiger seizures, therefore limiting any comprehensive analysis of scenarios occurring at a national level. While supplementary information (peer-reviewed research, for example) has been used to contextualize the reported illegal Tiger trade picture, the analysis is derived from reported seizures. Given the inconsistent manner in which seizures are recorded and reported across each range country, the data is unlikely to be a complete set. Underwood et al (2013) found that the analysis of seizure data alone can be limited due to biases in the seizure and reporting rates. More effort should be made to address this ongoing caveat, in light of the rapidly declining wild Tiger population. This could be remedied by regular and consistent reporting at a Tiger range level and improvements in law enforcement effectiveness. It will be discussed further in this report. Law enforcement and reporting efforts also differ greatly across each range country and therefore, results should be interpreted with caution. Their respective efforts are greatly influenced by different designated crime priorities and 2 TradeMapper is an interactive tool originally developed by TRAFFIC and WWF to visualize trade data: https://trademapper.aptivate.org/ 23 strategies within each TRC, consequently this determines the level of resources dedicated to a given problem. To overcome this, this report examines the problem based on (i) the current picture and known information, (ii) contributing factors at a national level for each range country, and seeks to formulate realistic solutions based on these identified findings. Moreover, while TRAFFIC endeavours to adopt a consistent counting method as used in previous years (Verheij et al, 2010, Stoner and Pervushina, 2013) to determine the number of Tigers found in trade, it should be noted that this count only represents an estimation. 24 3.0 RESULTS 3.1 Statistical Analysis at a Tiger range level During the 16-year period under review from January 1, 2000 to December 2015, a total of 801 Tiger seizures incidents were reported across 13 TRCs. On average, this represents 50 seizures annually. The greatest number of seizures were reported during quarter three (2008-2011), and decreased by 30% (83 seizures) in the most recent quarter (2012-2015) (Table 5).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efc56808-8e35-423c-bb2a-4ca3c270f1f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "efc56808-8e35-423c-bb2a-4ca3c270f1f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reduced to skin and bones re-examined : full analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85c215ad31a03486f6d37e0b490bf8915e8c5c9f7c22a6c35946969441e4df0d"}, "2": {"node_id": "f30d6726-70e4-4686-ab70-c707d58e7142", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f4972ee5825cb1abea4ab2031c544e29a7f34c582c233979482bae4e317d672"}}, "hash": "4ee9c2455c9a983bbc78a4550c392929196f2bb53baa9a455c05d779c6e5dbcf", "text": "Table 5: Total Number of Seizures Reported by TRC Broken into Four Quarters (2000-2015) Country Q1 2000 - 2003 Q2 2004 - 2007 Q3 2008 \u2013 2011 Q4 2012 \u2013 2015 Total Bangladesh 2 1% 1 1% 6 2% 11 6% 20 2% Bhutan 1 1% 1 1% 1 0% 3 2% 6 1% Cambodia 3 2% 0 0% 0 0% 1 1% 4 0% China 11 7% 19 11% 22 8% 26 13% 78 10% India 116 75% 89 50% 110 40% 40 21% 355 44% Indonesia 0 0% 13 7% 21 8% 36 18% 70 9% Lao PDR 0 0% 4 2% 4 1% 1 1% 9 1% Malaysia 7 5% 5 3% 21 8% 7 4% 40 5% Myanmar 0 0% 0 0% 1 0% 2 1% 3 0% Nepal 9 6% 25 14% 36 13% 14 7% 84 10% Russia 4 3% 6", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eed74225-823a-46d1-aaed-c6175f77457b": {"__data__": {"id_": "eed74225-823a-46d1-aaed-c6175f77457b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reduced to skin and bones re-examined : full analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2ff073fc6226c035b328cdeffd103b35c1285fde652b6a1fd0008649750fd77"}, "3": {"node_id": "60fc5dc4-8abe-4227-89aa-2530fa8d3558", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9e6eefe56e34177feb0d765f0d0b9f19b1beacd5d8410138fdf23f69eda4e22"}}, "hash": "584872d72db4854c11da4645059f834638d8dfeb9d0b9e15ed9d0a9c7bee9550", "text": "3% 8 3% 12 6% 30 4% Thailand 1 1% 6 3% 17 6% 17 9% 41 5% Viet Nam 0 0% 8 5% 29 11% 24 12% 61 8% Total 154 100% 177 100% 277 100% 194 100% 801 100% Overall, the highest number of seizures was reported by India, accounting for 44% (355) of all reported seizures. Statistically, the relative proportion of seizure incidents that occurred in India significantly declined through time (slope = -0.04, 95% CI = -0.05, -0.02). There was no statistically significant change in the relative proportion of seizure incidents for any of the other countries through time (Figure 1). Figure 1: The relative proportion of seizures reported by each TRC through time (average proportion \u00b1 95% CI) from bootstrapped multinomial logit models 25 Figure 2 illustrates the proportion of seizures by TRCs across all four quarters. The reduction in India\u2019s seizure figures by quarterly period, from 76% (116) of all seizures between 2000 and 2003, to only 21% (40) during quarter four (2012- 2015) is evident here. China, Indonesia and Russia, on the other hand, have experienced increases in the number of seizures reported between quarters. Malaysia, Nepal and Viet Nam have not reported a consistent number of seizures and therefore, it is difficult to identify any trends in their data. Figure 2 The proportion of seizures in each TRC, by quarter During the period under review, a minimum of 1 755 and maximum of 2 011 Tigers were estimated to have been seized based upon the 801 reported seizures. On average, a minimum of 110 Tigers were seized annually. From this point forward, only the minimum number of Tigers seized will be discussed. As is consistent with the number of reported seizures, the highest number of Tigers were seized during the third quarter (2008-2011), as shown in Table 6.

For example, some countries with the lowest number of seizures may contribute quite a high percentage towards the number of Tigers seized for a particular quarter. In quarter four, 26 Thailand reported 9% (17) of the seizures, yet accounted for 33% (166) of the Tigers seized. The number of Tigers seized in Thailand and Indonesia had increased through the quarters, but declined significantly in India (Figure 3).

To understand whether geographical clusters of activity have shifted over time, a density estimation technique has been applied to each quarterly period to illustrate persistent as well as emerging hotspots (Map 2). Given that almost half of all seizures have been reported in India, inevitably a greater prevalence of hotspots is present there, as demonstrated by hotspots throughout each quarter. The situation in India is examined in closer detail in the India country profile below. Map 2: (a) Quarter One (2000-2003); (b) Quarter Two (2004-2007); (c) Quarter Three (2008-2011); (d) Quarter Four (2012-2015) 29 Map 3: Tiger seizures across TRCs (2000-2015) Map 3 illustrates all known seizures and has been color-coded according to the quarterly period in which they occurred. At a TRC level, there are prominent clusters on the India-Nepal border and the India-Bangladesh border for all four quarters, which further identifies these areas as targets for law enforcement and investigations. Other clusters of seizures are also identified in Viet Nam (in the north around Ha Noi) and to a lesser extent, in Malaysia, concentrated on Kuala Lumpur and the surrounding area. 30 3.3 Trade Routes In addition to plotting the locations of reported seizures, analysis had also been conducted on the routes that Tiger shipments take, from origin to point of final destination, using Trademapper3. While route information is not comprehensive and does not comprise a complete dataset, it does highlight some interesting findings, particularly in reference to the seizures occurring in Asia and those that had originated from Africa (Map 4). Tiger farming in Africa is explored in closer detail in the Discussion section. Information on the destination of seizures was available for 99 seizures (13% of the total). Of these, China was identified as the most commonly occurring destination of seizures, or where Chinese suspects were implicated, and accounted for 57% of this total. Map 4: Extended routes of Tiger seizures by origin, transit and destination points 3 Trademapper is an interactive tool originally developed by TRAFFIC and WWF to visualize trade data: https://trademapper.aptivate.org/ 31 3.4 Tiger Trade by Commodity Type The variety of Tiger specimen types and their parts found in trade was examined across the four quarterly periods (Table 7). For complete parts, there has been a marked increase in the seizure of live Tigers in the last two quarters, while the number of whole skins and skin pieces has decreased. More Tiger canines were seized during the last quarter than the three previous quarters combined. Bone, claws, and meat have been recorded in high numbers across all quarters. During the most recent quarter, six gall bladders were seized, compared to none during all the other quarters. Conversely, Tiger genitalia was only observed during the first quarter and not since.

Figure 10 and 11 demonstrates the rate of increase based on the number of incidents and number of live specimens. The generalized linear regression (estimate \u00b1 SE = 0.97 \u00b1 1.05, t = 0.93, P = 0.37) for total seizures during the period under review (Figure 10), and the linear regression (estimate \u00b1 SE = 0.23 \u00b1 0.14, t = 1.67, P = 0.12) for the number of live specimens (Figure 11) is provided below. Figure 10: Total Number of Seizures (2000-2015) Figure 11: Total Number of Live Tigers Seized (2000-2015) 34 The total number of live Tigers seized by TRCs is provided in Table 8. During the first half of the period under review, from 2000 to 2007, only 17 (6%) live Tigers were seized. This increased to 64 (24%) between 2008 and 2011. During the final quarter, a further 186 (50%) Tigers were seized, but this result is greatly skewed by one incident at the Tiger Temple in Thailand in 2015 when 100 Tigers were impounded. This is examined in closer detail in the Thailand country profile (page 74). Of the 13 TRCs, 10 have reported seizures of live Tigers, while seven of those have reported only single figures, ranging from two to seven live Tigers seized. The countries which have reported a significant number are Thailand and Viet Nam, as illustrated by Figure 12. The analysis of the data highlights a steep increase in the occurrence of live Tiger seizures during the most recent quarter (2012-2015).

Such challenges are likely to impede the success of realistic solutions towards combating trade unless these complications are fully addressed. Some of the key challenges are discussed in more detail below. 4.1 Lack of Cross-Border Co-ordination In Nepal, concerted efforts to protect native wildlife have achieved two consecutive years of zero Rhino poaching of rhinos. Clearly this achievement at a national level is recognized as a best practice. Despite this achievement, Tiger poaching continues, particularly in areas close to the border with India which has seen an increase of seizures during 2015. This is deemed to be partially caused by stronger law enforcement efforts in India which has displaced the problem over the border into Nepal (The Kathmandu Post, 2016). Closer collaboration with India in the form of contingency planning may have prevented this displacement. Better co-ordination and information exchange concerning the movements of known poachers as well as alerts when poaching takes place should have been in operation. The South Asian Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN) was established in 2011 as a central mechanism to redress cross-border wildlife trade across its eight member States5. However, following its formation, governments have failed to engage in the network and formally ratify the statute, resulting in little cross-border action (SAWEN, 2015). By September 2016, only two Tiger range countries have ratified the statute - India and Nepal, with the total membership standing at four countries (including Sri Lanka and Pakistan), half of the desired eight. More countries must participate in order for the network to be effective.

In Southeast Asia, a previously identified trade route Thailand-Lao PDR-Viet Nam is suspected to be as relevant today as per previous TRAFFIC findings (Stoner and Pervushina, 2013). Some of the seizures reported in Thailand and Viet Nam cite Lao PDR as the source or transit of Tigers. Reports from Viet Nam claimed the Tigers seized had originated from Lao PDR, while some within Thailand state that the Tigers were on route to Lao PDR. For example, in 2013, 16 Tiger cubs were seized at the Thai-Lao border. Incidentally, no seizures were reported within Lao PDR during the most recent quarter (2012-2015), and is likely to be due to low enforcement effort. The 65th meeting of the CITES Standing committee adopted a recommendation requesting these three countries (and Myanmar) review their implementation of Resolution Conf. 12.5 (Rev. CoP16), and in particular to \u201cintroduce innovative enforcement methods and, as a matter of priority, strengthen enforcement efforts in key border regions, and develop or improve implementation of regional enforcement networks\u201d (CITES, 2016b). 5 Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka 36 4.2 The Impact of Corruption The UNODC World Wildlife Crime Report (2016) discusses the influence of corruption on many facets of international wildlife trade and states that \u201ccorruption is essential to many contraband flows, and seizures are not made where the relevant officials are complicit\u201d. Given the nature of corruption, and the difficulty in illustrating its tangible impact on illegal trade, corruption should remain on the agenda, along with meaningful solutions to address its ongoing presence. Transparency International (TI) publishes the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) on an annual basis, ranking countries \"by their perceived levels of corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys\" and provides each country with a score. A total 168 countries are ranked, with number one being the most corrupt6. Six TRCs fall within the top 30 of the most corrupt countries in 2015 (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Nepal and Russia) (Transparency International, 2016). While some improvements have been made in the scores of TRCs in 2012, most notably in Myanmar whose score has moved from 15 to 22 (meaning a reducing perception of corruption), other countries have seen a worsening score during the same period. Cambodia, China, Bangladesh, and Lao PDR\u2019s CPI Index score had worsened in 2015 from their score in 2012 (meaning a rising perception of corruption) (Table 9). In this regard, it is also encouraging that for the first time, the issue of corruption has been raised at a CITES CoP17 (CITES CoP17 Doc.28)7 Table 9: TRCs Corruption Perception Index Scores (2012 and 2015) 6 http://www.transparency.org 7 https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/cop/17/WorkingDocs/E-CoP17-28.pdf Score Rank Score in 2012 Trend 1 Cambodia 21 150/168 22 DOWN 2 Myanmar 22 147/168 15 UP 3 Bangladesh 25 139/168 26 DOWN 3 Lao PDR 25 139/168 31 DOWN 4 Nepal 27 130/168 27 NO MOVEMENT 5 Russia 29 119/168 28 UP 6 Viet Nam 31 112/168 31 NO MOVEMENT 7 Indonesia 36 88/168 32 UP 8 China 37 83/168 39 DOWN 9 India 38 83/168 36 UP 9 Thailand 38 76/168 37 UP 10 Malaysia 50 54/168 49 UP 11 Bhutan 65 27/168 63 UP 37 4.3 Poor Data Management According to country reports submitted to CITES following SC65 request, many TRCs still lack a national system or database to centrally manage Tiger crime data (CITES, 2016a; CITES, 2016b). Table 10 below provides an overview of feedback from TRCs in pursuant to SC65 Doc. 38 regarding the recording of information on illegal trade in Asian big cats (CITES, 2014a). Only five of the 13 TRCs provided some information, with only nominal details however, making it extremely challenging to a) determine if current efforts are adequate and b) determine the type of guidance, support or need in that TRC.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3fd65ffa-a340-4be4-92de-7121373b03d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "3fd65ffa-a340-4be4-92de-7121373b03d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reduced to skin and bones re-examined : full analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aeef0af92428a2f9308837ef254889a498926cb9b6c614b021a0d04479626375"}, "2": {"node_id": "e6076b70-507d-4a94-96be-a0e88b3f77ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8be87be21250070bd1deee4b294f58d63875ab6459bece9f6ee7eefa781e9eba"}}, "hash": "f7a0cf1c8f1ce5a0e97d9c1f1b16f861d88046069374e7497f7b4bb474943a01", "text": "Tigernet in India, a publicly accessible system run by the government (www.tigernet.com), is not yet a comprehensive platform capturing all Indian seizures. This is discussed further in the India country profile. The poor collection of such crucial data across all range countries in a standardized and systematic manner is inconsistent with good recording and reporting practices, and will continue to significantly impede any meaningful analysis aimed at understanding the true level of poaching and trafficking. Systematic recording of incidents and supporting information is essential to establish baselines of data which in turn, will facilitate the development of practical solutions to target problems identified. The analysis of such information will enable intelligence-led planning to ensure that limited resources are deployed effectively.

The seizure consisted 1 241 units of parts claimed to be from Tigers, including five skins, 471 claws, 17 paws, 25 teeth and 309 pieces of skin, as well as elephant tails (The Star, 2015; TRAFFIC, 2015). This incident appeared to point to the presence of a highly organized operation. The suspects were Indian nationals, and the original report claimed that the parts were from Tigers in India and had been smuggled into Malaysia primarily to service local consumption for such products, such as jewellery and curios. Subsequently, the Tiger skins were reportedly found to be dog skins that were painted and imported into Malaysia from India. The use of dog skins purporting to be Tiger skins had been detected previously in India and is not a new trend (Sinha, 2008; The Hindu, 2015). Open source research and seizure data points to a greater tendency of fake products, particularly skins, in India although there is suspicion that the problem may be more widespread. Table 11 provides an example of some of these types of seizures during 2007-2016, with most cases reported in India, and one in Malaysia. Little evidence of fake products was detected in other TRCs, but it could be more prevalent than indicated by the reported information.

These centres of varying size, spread across China, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam, jointly house between 7 000-8 000 captive Tigers, far more than the estimated 3 900 Tigers left in the wild (WWF, 2016). Tiger farms in the lower Mekong countries of mainland Southeast Asia \u2013 particularly Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam \u2013 are the most controversial with regard to illegal trade. In its report to the 65th meeting of the CITES Standing Committee, the CITES Secretariat reported that 74% of Tiger specimens seized in Southeast Asia occurred in three countries, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam, which raised concerns about the source of Tigers for illegal trade due to the presence of breeding facilities there (CITES, 2016a). Analysis of the reported seizures highlights the prevalence of live Tiger trade in Thailand and Viet Nam. Furthermore, the number of Tigers in captivity in Southeast Asia is increasing. In Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam alone (the top three countries with the estimated highest volume of captive Tigers in Asia, after China), it is estimated that there are up to 1 300 captive Tigers housed in various facilities; 289 in Laos PDR (EIA, 2015, Target, 2009), 830 in Thailand (News.com.au, 2016) and 180 in Viet Nam (EIA, 2016). In Thailand, this figure has risen by 49% since 2007 (Asian Correspondent Staff, 2016), while in Viet Nam, it has increased by 122% since 2010 (EIA, 2016). Moreover, it is estimated that 54% of the Tigers seized in China, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam originate from captive sources (EIA, 2016). Indeed, 40% of seizures reported in Thailand for 2012-2015 was from a single seizure at the Tiger Temple, also known as Wat Pa Luang Ta Bua, in Kanchanaburi Province. This generated a great deal of attention following the initial seizure of 100 live Tigers in February 2015 (Rahman, 2015; Reuters, 2015). Subsequent to this, follow-up investigations by Thai authorities resulted in the removal of another 137 live Tigers in May 2016 (Olan and Gigova, 2016; Vidal, 2016). The first raid occurred following claims of animal abuse and suspected illegal activity which were later proven to be true, along with the revelation of the involvement of the Temple in illegal Tiger trade. This is examined in closer detail in the Thailand country profile in this report. Accusations that Tigers from the Temple had been loaned to a facility in Lao PDR were reported in the media, and suggest a network of captive Tiger facilities in the region. This one case serves to confirm fears about the tourism industry\u2019s participation in illegal trade, and that these establishments are a front to conceal the true business assets. Thailand has since announced plans to inspect a further 30 premises nationally. In early June, the Hua Hin Zoo was raided and 100 protected animals (including two Tigers) were removed over allegations that these removed animals had been acquired illegally (The Nation, 2016). This proactive enforcement approach is to be applauded, given the likelihood that these establishments have already contributed to keeping demand afloat by supplying parts for trade. It is also suspected that Tigers bred at some of these facilities are being used as starting stock for others in the region (Sinha, 2012). 41 The reported seizure data allowed TRAFFIC to further examine those that were reportedly from captive sources, with a total minimum of 297 Tigers over the assessed period (Table 12).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de770d6a-4d14-4e33-b330-35cfd4892b17": {"__data__": {"id_": "de770d6a-4d14-4e33-b330-35cfd4892b17", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reduced to skin and bones re-examined : full analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d207806a3e22ecc86f15b1e585b1ac7a751457bdb71f119721eb0275c275a68"}, "2": {"node_id": "48764b62-5b6e-40be-9586-058f7b0da423", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dafa8113137d4450fc78daa1151bf57b5fc69d4dfa514c15e2e6cd2dbcd29460"}}, "hash": "03bb58d659b89a0e83b0765fb2340966549a3ccab939dcddb5334226a571f70b", "text": "Data shows an increase in the presence of whole Tigers (both live and dead/frozen) being seized from these facilities.

Although not assessed to be a statistically significant rise, these seizures are most pronounced in Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam, and are mostly linked to Tigers coming from captive facilities.

Currently, 10 such facilities (government and privately owned) are registered (Associated Press, 2012; Ives, 2012), with Tiger numbers being held at such captive facilities reportedly increasing in recent years (EIA, 2016). Education for Nature Viet Nam (ENV), a non-government organization based in Viet Nam, conducts bi-annual inspections at these facilities on behalf of the government and has done so since 2007. In May 2016, ENV documented an increase in numbers, stating there were then about 180 Tigers in private farms and zoos, and suggested that most of these facilities were engaged in illegal activities, including the selling of cubs and laundering of Tigers through farms into the trade (EIA, 2016). ENV has openly expressed concern over the need for the government to exert greater control over captive Tiger numbers while they are still low. In Viet Nam\u2019s report to the CITES Secretariat on the Notification to the Parties No. 2013/037 on the Implementation of Resolution 12.5 (Rev. CoP 16), regarding whether there were any captive breeding of Asian big cats in Viet Nam, its answer was \u201cno\u201d without any further elaboration (CITES, 2014b). This requires clarification from the government of Viet Nam. 42 RECOMMENDATION The CITES Decision 14.69 on Asian big cats (Felidae spp.) directs Parties with intensive operations breeding on a commercial scale to implement measures to restrict captive populations, and for Tigers, parts and derivatives not to be meant for trade. Given the involvement of, and reported allegations against, captive facilities as well as suspicions on the true motives behind such operations, affected countries, particularly TRCs, should investigate all breeding centres for involvement in illegal activity, and close facilities where there is evidence of such occurrence. Viet Nam is also encouraged to expedite the enactment and enforcement of its Penal Code, to better equip the judicial system to tackle this problem. To monitor the numbers of Tigers being bred in such facilities, and to prevent more Tigers from being leaked into trade, DNA profiles should be taken from all Tigers held in captivity. These samples should be recorded and managed in a centralized database. Samples from seized Tigers can then be taken and cross-referenced with the database, to corroborate or refute claims that Tiger breeding in such facilities is supplying trade. 43 5.1 Tiger Farming in Africa A 2015 TRAFFIC report, Bones of Contention, explored the growth in the Lion Panthera leo bone trade (Williams et al, 2015). The findings highlighted an exponential growth in the export of Lion bones out of South Africa. Between 2008 and 2011, a total of 1 160 skeletons were permitted for trade by the South African government with 987 specimens (85.1%) going to Lao PDR. Other findings in the report point to the use of Lion bones as a substitute for Tiger bones in Asia. This is based on the anatomical similarities between Tiger and Lion bones, and a lack of expertise to differentiate between the two. This subsequently increases the risk of a higher number of Lions bones being smuggled into Asia from Africa. In January 2014, a seizure was made at Viet Nam\u2019s Noi Bai International Airport of 40kg of wild animal bones, initially suspected to be Tiger. These were found hidden inside a box beneath cigarette and sunflower seeds (Haiguan Online, 2014).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c8fdf8e-e16a-4230-b8f4-408ffa0d6c7a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c8fdf8e-e16a-4230-b8f4-408ffa0d6c7a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reduced to skin and bones re-examined : full analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29fc3558181e1f2c4b6c0ad498951a6f05506742cba53ef442ac824a08b63f67"}, "2": {"node_id": "05ad621f-e1d9-412f-b21a-5b6e54208c6b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c57c475a5107bcf5acfecb62244a1daf7094347ba95cc29f31d95d6e061379b2"}}, "hash": "dd01d782ad604547f97d86906524f41d3b70e8bed7f2017b6db9f48eb039c2a2", "text": "The contraband, which had been discovered on board a flight from Moscow, Russia, was later determined to be Lion bones (Thanh Nien, 2014).

In 2015, two Tiger seizures occurred in TRCs where the shipments had originated from Africa, the parts of which could only have originated from captive sources. In the first case, the Customs of China seized in Kunming one Indochinese Tiger Panthera tigris corbetii skin, 7.7 kg of Tiger bone, 9.7 kg of African White Rhino Cerathotherium simum horn and 1.8 kg of ivory products recovered from checked luggage (General Administration of Chinese Customs, 2015; Robin Des Bois, 2015). The two passengers had arrived in China from Johannesburg via Hong Kong. The second incident involved a more convoluted journey after a Vietnamese national was arrested at Siem Reap International Airport, Cambodia, and found to be in possession of 15 Elephant tusks weighing 43 kg, 11 pieces of dried elephant tails weighing 1.9 kg and 0.2 kg of Tiger claws and teeth (Sony, 2015). The journey had begun in Angola and transited through Ethiopia and South Korea before reaching Cambodia. Details of how the Vietnamese national had planned to reach home from there were not available but it is suspected that Cambodia was chosen as the disembarkation point as fewer seizures occur there in comparison to Viet Nam. For example, there were 63 Tiger seizures reported in Viet Nam between 2000 and 2015, and only four reported in Cambodia in the same period. RECOMMENDATIONS Investigate the Tiger trade in South Africa, including an assessment of the ex-situ Tiger population, consumptive and non-consumptive utilization, national and provincial legislation with respect to keeping and hunting exotic animals, and the inappropriate use of CITES Appendix II permit to trade products. Since it is not currently possible to determine whether CITES Appendix I Tigers are being illegally shipped as Appendix II Lion bones, spot checks and DNA tests of the exported consignments should be conducted to determine whether a skeleton is that of a Lion or Tiger. The relevant officers could be provided with DNA collecting kits and trained to collect tissue in a manner that would be acceptable to the justice system. The reported Tiger seizure picture provides little insight into the extent of Tiger parts in trade originating from Africa. It may be useful to investigate the use of South African seaports as a gateway for Lion and Tiger product exports. 44 5.2 Online Trade and Social Media as an Enabler Illegal wildlife trade on the -internet has become a persistent challenge over the past few years, particularly because of its ability to change form rapidly, its wide reach and ability to connect people (Nijman and Stoner, 2014). In 2010, a Tiger skin was advertised for sale on a Chinese-language online auction site. The suspect attempted to sell the skin for 2.8 million Taiwanese Dollars (approximately USD 96 400) (Stoner and Pervushina, 2013). A study over a six-week period in 2014 found over 33 000 endangered wildlife, parts and products from CITES Appendix I and II-listed species advertised for sale online in almost 9 500 posts in 16 countries (IFAW, 2014). Another study examining the trade in tortoises and freshwater turtles in Malaysia found that a majority of the trade conducted online had shifted from commercial web portals to social media from the beginning of 2012 (Bouhuys and Van Scherpenzeel, 2015). This research found that all online advertisements within the period of 2005-2008 were on posted on classified ad websites, after which these advertisements would spread out to forums, and pet shelter groups. In 2011 and 2012, however, social media platforms began to emerge, accounting for an approximate 10% to 18% of the online trade. These numbers then shot up to almost 70% in 2013, and continued to increase. A study in China from July 2011 to July 2012 found over 9 000 listings of Tiger products during routine online monitoring from at least 114 websites (IFAW, 2012). Social media trade research carried out by TRAFFIC in China over one month in 2014 found various wildlife parts for sale, including thousands of worked ivory products, at least 77 rhino horn (including entire horns or horn pieces ad worked products) (Yu and Jia, 2015). In 2014, authorities in Jakarta confiscated a 26.5 by 30 cm piece of Tiger skin which a trader had purchased for IDR4 million (USD331) via Facebook and was attempting to re-sell. This case shows that trade online has enabled the sale of smaller items, such as Tiger canines and claws, likely driven by the fact that they can be delivered in the post innocuously.

This study uncovered a significant undercurrent of demand for exotic wildlife as pets, half of which was deemed to be illegal. Although no Tiger parts were found for sale, research conducted on one of the identified traders found that he was also offering to export Tigers out of Malaysia on Facebook (Figure 13). More recently, authorities in Malaysia arrested a man for advertising the sale of a Tiger cub on Facebook (2016). Figure 3: Tiger cubs offered for export from Malaysia 45 Tiger seizure analysis during the most recent quarter (2012-2015) shows that both Tiger canines and paws were more frequently seized, compared to the number of Tigers being seized. From 2012-2015, 252 Tiger canines were seized compared to only 41 between 2008 and 2011, while paws have increased to 31 compared to 18 seized in the same period. There is not enough information available to determine the extent of serious and organized Tiger trade occurring online or on social media such as Facebook or Instagram. Social media platforms lend themselves well to trade in curios and jewellery derived from Tiger products (Stoner, 2014). A cursory search for Tiger products for sale on Facebook in Viet Nam found an advertisement for Tiger claws being openly offered (Figure 14). Social media, especially sites that have restricted access features, facilitate communication between traders in a non-detectable way. In April 2016, WhatsApp (owned by Facebook) reported that the messaging service would be fully encrypted, creating greater challenges for law enforcement agencies to monitor and detect illegal activity (Naughton, 2015). Figure 14: Tiger Claw for Sale on Facebook in Viet Nam 46 5.3 Legislation protecting Tigers in TRCs Effective and deterrent law enforcement can only take place when legislation protecting Tigers are in place. Resolution Conf. 8.4 (Rev. CoP15) on National laws for implementation of the Convention gave basis for the CITES National Legislation Project, an initiative to assess the effectiveness of legislation of the Parties and their capacity in implementing the Convention. National legislation was analyzed by the CITES Secretariat, in consultation with the Party concerned and placed into one of three categories: \uf0d8 Category 1: legislation that is believed generally to meet the requirements for implementation of CITES \uf0d8 Category 2: legislation that is believed generally not to meet all of the requirements for the implementation of CITES \uf0d8 Category 3: legislation that is believed generally not to meet the requirements for the implementation of CITES. The CITES Secretariat noted that more than half of the 28 Asian big cat range States required legislative improvements. More than half of the TRCs\u2019 legislation were assessed to be in Category 1, making that seven countries (Table 13). Table 13: Tiger Range Countries CITES Category Assessment Country CITES Secretariat Category Assessment Bangladesh 2 Bhutan 3 China 1 Indonesia 1 India 2 Cambodia 1 Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic 3 Malaysia 1 Myanmar 3 Nepal 3 Russia 1 Thailand 1 Viet Nam 1 These categorizations reflect a mix of flaws and the need for more affirmative action in mandating countries to amend their legislation in a time-bound manner, in order to be able to comply with the Convention. Indonesia\u2019s law, for example, affords protection for the Sumatran Tiger Panthera tigris sumatrae and the now extinct Javan Tiger Panthera tigris sondaica. However, it is legally crippled if Tiger seizures within the country involve the import or export of wild Tigers originating from other TRCs, or violations by a Zoo or facility holding non-native Tigers. This significant loophole in fact warrants the CITES Category 1 for Indonesia to be replaced with a Category 2 ranking until it is amended to provide full protection to all sub-species of Tigers. Despite such a loophole, its legislation have been recognized by the CITES Secretariat as Category I. In Lao PDR, the maximum fine for any wildlife crime (including those involving Tigers) in Lao PDR\u2019s Wildlife and Aquatic Law 2007 is a maximum of USD25. This clearly serves as no deterrent to prevent crime and in no way, considers the seriousness of organized wildlife criminality. 47 RECOMMENDATIONS A comprehensive re-assessment of the CITES National Legislation Project for Indonesia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam is needed as a matter of priority, including a critique on their adequacy to implement CITES.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41a24d3e-0078-4c1e-8596-6826dcc902cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "41a24d3e-0078-4c1e-8596-6826dcc902cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reduced to skin and bones re-examined : full analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d15da526f4199b4aa66a30acf7021ecc89bc2230bb817b21261833ab3edf9256"}, "2": {"node_id": "5073a9a0-c553-459b-8db6-296d0218a9e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29a3a3f4c3a7961e9ab1b71ac5f2b100841f3a8adc3425b7b251bcaf7cb4a5eb"}}, "hash": "be1b4685c64e42a7700f3a55e8686a51b3c1340a26a606e7eaf692903007cc46", "text": "These countries have been selected on the basis of gaps and weaknesses in their legislative provisions, such as low penalties and deterrents to illegal activity.

To stem the issue of laundering and leakage regarding captive-bred Tigers, countries that have captive breeding facilities or operations should as a matter of urgency revise their legislation to include non-native Tigers (and other Asian big cats). Viet Nam is also encouraged to expedite the enactment and enforcement of its Penal Code to better equip its judicial system to tackle problems relating to illegal tiger trade. 48 6.0 COUNTRY PROFILES Trade dynamics as well as the status of Tigers differ by Tiger range country. The following chapter explores the situation within each TRC. The 16-year period under review allows for an observation of long-term trends in each country as well as emerging problems. Where appropriate, recommendations have been made based on the identified findings. 6.1 Country Profile: Bangladesh Based on 2004 census figures, Bangladesh was reported to have a relatively healthy wild Tiger population, estimated at around 440 individuals. At that time, this represented the third highest Tiger population of all TRCs (Dey, et al., 2015). The most recent census conducted between 2014 and early 2015 used a more robust, spatially explicit and reliable method, and had raised doubts about the accuracy of the earlier census (Agence France-Presse, 2015; Dey, et al., 2015). In 2016, the estimated count sits at 106 individuals, representing just 3% of the global total and placing Bangladesh 7th of all TRC Tiger populations. 49 Year Seizures Min. # Tigers 2001 2 13 2004 1 1 2008 1 1 2009 1 1 2010 1 1 2011 3 6 2012 4 6 2014 1 2 2015 6 10 Total 20 41 Bangladesh reported 20 seizures during 2000 - 2015, accounting for 2.4% of the total number of seizures. The majority of these were for just one commodity type (skin), with only four seizures involving more than one Tiger. Overall, an estimated minimum of 41 Tigers and a maximum of 55 Tigers have been seized in Bangladesh, accounting for 2.2% of the global total. Bangladesh reported the highest number of seizures in 2015, consisting mainly of Tiger skins (Figure 14). This is consistent with overall trends, as skin is the most commonly seized commodity in Bangladesh, making up 46% of the total of items seized. Skin was present in 12 of the 20 seizures that took place (Figure 15). Figure 16: Commodity Type by Year Map 5: Location of seizures (2000-2015) Table 14: Number of seizures and Tigers seized (2000- 2015) Figure 15: Commodity Type (2000-2015) 50 DISCUSSION National demand exists in Bangladesh, with almost all parts of the Tiger used by local communities. This largely centres on the use of bones, canines/teeth, meat and fur for medicinal purposes (Saif and Macmillan, 2016; Saif et al., 2016). A recent study found that 65% of the 139 respondents interviewed used and /or believed in the benefits of Tiger parts, with some 96% of them believing in the medicinal benefits of Tiger parts (Saif et al., 2016). Moreover, the local use and consumption of Tiger parts in the Sundarbans is particularly encouraged by the Kobiraj, or traditional doctor, who acts as advisor to the local people on hand-made medicine from plants or animal parts. In reference to Tiger parts, villagers would obtain and store Tiger parts for a time when someone in the family becomes inflicted with a disease or other conditions, and the Kobiraj would consulted on how to use the Tiger parts to remedy this (Saif et al, 2016). However, this appears to conflict with the reported seizure picture which finds that skins are more commonly traded, which may suggest that the killing of Tigers in Bangladesh is to supply markets outside of the country. However, no seizures have been reported on its border with India in the north of Bangladesh. In addition to the apparent external pressure on Tigers in Bangladesh, there is also the issue of human-wildlife conflict in the Sundarbans where most seizures took place (Map 5).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dec55c5e-4290-428c-9ffb-6d617f72c527": {"__data__": {"id_": "dec55c5e-4290-428c-9ffb-6d617f72c527", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reduced to skin and bones re-examined : full analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54bd34ddb7ea04cb24029d78d10004cab32ecd6e4378f70b64ea5304e975d12c"}, "2": {"node_id": "c6cd6d7b-25e3-4ed3-aa9a-152d752e3337", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b53281f6f380f3fb775566a8a33ae3f504ccb854aba4eb696097748f2f343c8b"}}, "hash": "fc6d863498498512bcb4124d593c24606baf05163081a1ff215d79f96c433857", "text": "About 350 000 people are estimated to live in villages bordering the Sundarbans with some 20-50 people estimated to be killed in Tiger attacks annually (Saif et al. 2016).

In response to this, the Bangladesh Forest Department, in collaboration with WildTeam, and Zoological Society of London (ZSL), had established a community-based volunteer group called Village Response Team (VTRT) in 49 places adjacent to the forest to mitigate human-Tiger conflict in the villages. Bangladesh did not submit a report on its review of the implementation of Resolution Conf 12.5 (Rev. CoP 16), as required, at the 66th Standing Committee meeting (https://cites.org/com/sc/65/index.php), and therefore its progress in implementation cannot be assessed comprehensively. Bangladesh\u2019s Wildlife Preservation and Protection Act 2012 is used to protect Tigers. However, studies show that prosecution of those responsible for killing and trading in Tigers is lacking, as those arrested for illegal trade in Tigers have been acquitted (Saif and Macmillan, 2016). According to the Corruption Perception Index (CPI), compiled by Transparency International, Bangladesh scored 25 in 2015, placing it lower than its CPI score of 26 in 2012. It is ranked 139th most corrupt State of the 168 states assessed. Amongst its peers of 13 Tiger range countries, Bangladesh is ranked the 3rd most corrupt. Tiger skin seizures indicate a lack of any bullet or snare markings, suggesting the use of poison to acquire them (AFP, 2016; Saif et al., 2016). Improved measures to track, investigate and prosecute Tiger criminals is critical in sending a strong deterrent message. Given the apparent demand for Tiger parts in the country, demand reduction initiatives, in collaboration with local communities, may have a positive effect on Tiger conservation efforts, coupled with a strong legal framework that prioritizes prosecution. CONTINUING CHALLENGE Bangladesh has yet to formally ratify SAWEN. The absence of Bangladesh will impede any meaningful progress of the network across South Asia. 51 6.2 Country Profile: Bhutan In July 2015, the Government of Bhutan announced the results of its first ever Tiger population survey. At 103 individuals, this figure represents an increase from the 75 individuals determined from an earlier estimated baseline, placing it 8th of all TRC Tiger populations (Tshering, 2015, WWF, 2015). Seizure rates for Bhutan have remained relatively low during the period under review, with only six seizures reported between 2000 and 2015, accounting for less than 1.0% of the global total (Table 15). These incidents are estimated to equate to a minimum of six Tigers, accounting for less than 1.0% of the global total. Location details were only available for four of the six seizures reported and are shown in Table 11. Two of the seizures in 2012 and 2013 were close to the border of the northeast Indian State of Assam. Table 15: Total Tiger Seizures (2000-2015) Year Seizures Min. # Tigers Location Origin Destination Seized 2003 1 1 Bumdeling Wildlife Sanctuary India China Skin (1) 2006 1 1 India China Skin (1) 2008 1 1 Bone (3) 2012 1 1 Nganglam India Skin (1) 2013 1 1 Gelegphu (Indian suspects) Skin (1) & bone 2015 1 1 Trongsa Bhutan Skin (1) Total 6 6 DISCUSSION There appears to be little evidence of an illegal Tiger trade market or domestic demand for such products in Bhutan. However, its strategic positioning may mean Bhutan is used as a route into China from India. The Royal Government of Bhutan has placed strong emphasis on protecting its wildlife with over one quarter (26%) of the country\u2019s surface area falling under the national protected areas scheme (compared to around 5% in India, for example). Bhutan also has a fairly good ranking on the Corruption Perception Index in 2015, scoring 65, an increase against its 2012 score of 62, placing it 27th of all the 168 states assessed. This is exceptional, given the average score for all TRCs is 34 (out of 168) and compared to its neighbour Bangladesh which scored 26. This ranks Bhutan as the least corrupt among the 13 Tiger range countries. Pressure from surrounding countries in the region will continue to threaten the status of Tigers in Bhutan and hence, it is paramount that cross-border co-ordination is strengthened \u2013 including through the SAWEN network - to combat transnational trade.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3e37d1c-6e2f-469b-a015-9d0c6a127ce9": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3e37d1c-6e2f-469b-a015-9d0c6a127ce9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reduced to skin and bones re-examined : full analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b35c888119fafd63a053544ee2bbedc992c38bbcb1e9b6643693ad319437938f"}, "2": {"node_id": "c56eb99c-3f6e-442b-a760-e80541ee4b5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "908fd6d67317f9a9f97146adc6b2ecceb63a4c888acca66b11fbe4147387ca4b"}}, "hash": "688e0b816f655c096e81765babbeed0cc9607a0834ea3ff218151ea4976f0ae5", "text": "The Bhutanese government has begun to consider the proposal to formally ratify the statute of SAWEN following the government sign-off by India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

During the period under review, Cambodia reported four seizures, representing a minimum of eight Tigers, accounting for less than 1.0% of the global total. Table 16 highlights the temporal gaps in seizures when no Tiger seizures were reported for the period 2001-2014. All the three seizures in 2000 involved live Tigers.

This indicates either a poor reporting rate or low enforcement effort. The latter is likely linked to Cambodia\u2019s wild Tiger population declining to a status of functionally extinct. A pre-feasibility study concerning the reintroduction of Tigers into the Eastern Plains Landscape was undertaken in 2013 by the IUCN and WWF, with the reasons for Tiger extirpation being examined and conditions for successful reintroduction identified. The Mondulkiri Protected Forest is assessed to be suitable for the planned reintroduction, and spans 4300 km\u00b2 across Cambodia (WWF, 2016). Critics of the reintroduction have outlined the need to tackle the very issues (such as poaching and lack of prey base) that had attributed to the decline and eventual extinction of the wild Tigers before any new populations are introduced. The country report Cambodia submitted to the 65th CITES Standing Committee meeting reported a number of enforcement measures aimed at tackling illegal trade. Cambodia now has a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Vietnamese government which aims to facilitate joint law enforcement activities and intelligence sharing between the Cambodian Forestry Administration and its Vietnamese counterpart. This partnership is particularly pertinent as cross- border trade is likely, illustrated most recently when a Vietnamese national was found in possession of elephant and Tiger parts at Siem Reap International Airport in October 2015. The suspect had travelled from Angola, via Ethiopia and South Korea before reaching Cambodia. It is believed that the intention was to land in Cambodia, before travelling overland to Viet Nam. CONTINUING CHALLENGES Unless the Cambodian government addresses the poaching and illegal trade picture, reintroduced Tigers will face the same fate. 53 6.4 Country Profile: China Table 17: The Reporting of Seizures in China (2000-2015) There are estimated to be about seven Tigers left in the wild in northeast China. The South China Tiger Panthera tigris amoyensis has not been observed in the wild for more than 25 years, and is therefore considered by scientists to be \u201cfunctionally extinct\u201d (IUCN, 2016). In the period between 2000 and 2015, 78 seizures were reported in China (Table 17), accounting for 9.7% of the global total. The majority of these were for one commodity type (most commonly skins). It is estimated that a minimum of 175 Tigers and a maximum of 194 Tigers were seized in China during the period under review, the minimum count accounting for 9.8% of the global total. When looking at the trend line, it can be observed that the number of seizures has increased slightly, while the number of Tigers seized has decreased slightly during the period under review (Figure 17).

The results highlight the geographical concentration of activity to be at the eastern part of the country but also that the greater proportion of seizures had taken place close to its border areas.

China has seized a wide range of commodity types. Skin and skin pieces are the most commonly seized items, present in 37 (36%) of the seizures (Figure 18), and followed by the seizures of bones (25%), present in 26 of the 78 seizures. This shows a change from the TRAFFIC analysis in 2013 which found that less than half of China\u2019s seizures were of bones (46%) in comparison to 18% for skin. 55 Figure 18: Commodity Types Seized (2000-2015) To understand whether this picture has changed over the last 16 years, the commodity types seized were examined by year (Figure 19) and further confirms that the seizures of skins have decreased proportionally over time, though a spike can be observed in 2013. An increase in seizures during 2013, can be partially attributed to intelligence-led and proactive enforcement action, such as Operation Cobra, where for example two incidents in January in that year led to the confiscation of 12 Tiger skins and 168 kg of bones, equating to a minimum of 17 Tigers. Figure 19: Commodity Type Seized by Year (2000-2015) 56 DISCUSSION Overall, China was the most commonly reported destination of Tiger seizures (almost half), followed by Viet Nam (20%), as illustrated on the trade route Map 4. During the 16-year period under review, 78 seizures were reported, averaging five per year, which is a marked difference from its neighbouring country, India for example, which reported 22 seizures on average per year in comparison. Within China, research finds that the illegal Tiger trade is a specific type of wildlife trade, and reveals interesting dynamics (Wong, 2015). Certain locations appear to specialize in the sale of particular Tiger parts, with reputations significantly driving the market. For example, Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, was known as the go-to place for skins, as has been documented previously (EIA, 2004). Actors linked to the Tiger trade were predominantly legitimate business owners who would opportunistically trade in Tigers parts when they are available, therefore supply upon order does not exist. Ultimately, the perception was that while Tiger parts are in demand, and buyers are willing to pay, traders will continue to supply (Wong, 2015). The structures of such trade networks hinge on a central node as the supplier of Tiger parts, upon which the entire market is dependent. Due to the limited availability of Tiger parts, it acts as the market force, creating a centralized network structure as opposed to traditional formations of criminal structures where variables such as risk and enforcement are casual factors. This presents an opportunity for law enforcement - the removal of this central facet would create the greatest impact on the market and reduce the threat to Tigers. The presence of online Tiger trade, particularly on social media is a growing threat, compounded by monitoring challenges, due to the privacy options offered by some platforms, particularly commercial business portals. Tiger trade on the internet has been documented as far back as 2012 when the monitoring of e-commence sites in China between July 2012 and May 2013 detected 438 advertisements of products purportedly to be of Tiger origin (Stoner, 2014). The products for sale were mainly smaller items of jewellery and curios, such as Archer\u2019s rings made of bone. No skins were found for sale. 57 Map 7: Seller\u2019s Location by Tiger Product for Sale in China Monitoring of illegal trade on 15 e-commence sites of five key illegal wildlife products (ivory, Rhino horn, Tiger bone, Hawksbill shells and Pangolin scales) has been undertaken by TRAFFIC in China. Between January 2012 and September 2014, a steady decrease in the total number of illegal wildlife product advertisements was noted in the first half of 2013. It fell sharply to fewer than 10,000 advertisements and remained there since, with only slight variance. This drop is remarkable as the scope of monitoring has increased continuously during that time. This documented decrease was partly attributed to close collaboration with each website/platform, allowing them to delete the identified posts (Yu and Wang, 2015). As a result of this feedback, several website/platform managers (as well as enforcement agencies) have blocked certain common code words to prevent them from being used to advertise products. However, while this monitoring and regular reporting of illegal posts has resulted in a decrease in advertisements, it is possible that the trade has been displaced to other forms. At the same time, trade occurring on social media was becoming more apparent. In contrast to posted advertisements on regular websites, which can be seen by all visitors, social media audiences", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00a01b18-35db-47f0-a2a6-d258b639a19e": {"__data__": {"id_": "00a01b18-35db-47f0-a2a6-d258b639a19e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reduced to skin and bones re-examined : full analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be8d05d683826bcdd1fd8d1ba2d6927cb0783c39b1afd1719e1cfd106882dd2e"}}, "hash": "be8d05d683826bcdd1fd8d1ba2d6927cb0783c39b1afd1719e1cfd106882dd2e", "text": "can be selected by dealers and are based on personal introductions. This privacy means that sellers are better protected and hence, monitoring becomes more challenging. While Facebook is not permitted in China, WeChat is now estimated to have over 800 million monthly active user accounts in 2016 in China alone (China Internet Watch, 2016). China should be requested to clarify whether its permitted internal trade in Asian big cat parts and derivatives is for non-commercial purposes, to report the species and trade volume involved, and describe how such trade is monitored and enforced. Recognizing that China has the sovereign right to govern its internal ABC trade, this information would allow a more complete assessment of implementation of the Resolution. Illegal imports of derivatives represent a challenge for other Parties seeking to enforce their own CITES protections, and China should also indicate the measures it is taking to prevent illegal exports. Map 7 illustrates the locations of these online advertisements, and indicates geographical preferences for different product types. Items of traditional medicine were more commonly sold on the east coast, particularly the provinces of Liaoning and Guangdong. Almost all products found for sale in Beijing were pieces of jewellery. This identified geographical propensity for different Tiger parts online is consistent with findings observing physical markets within China (Wong, 2015). 58 China has made significant progress in addressing the growth in illegal online trade in wildlife in the past three years. Some of these progressive steps have included a workshop in 2013 involving Beijing\u2019s Provincial Inter-Agency CITES Enforcement Co-ordination Group (PICE-CG), 13 e-commerce and logistics companies to highlight the role of e-commence sites and to aid relevant departments to strictly regulate online wildlife trade and develop self- management techniques. More recently in November 2015, Tencent, a leading provider of internet services in China, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with TRAFFIC to tackle illegal wildlife trade conducted on WeChat and Tencent\u2019s other online platforms. The MoU focuses on developing public education and messaging to users, dissuading them from engaging in illegal wildlife trade. The messages are disseminated through online ads, apps and social media channels. These formalized partnerships solidify the role of corporations in addressing this issue and emphasizes that the problem cannot be tackled from a law enforcement perspective only. CONTINUING CHALLENGES Controlling illegal trade along national border areas, particularly areas bordering China. Transboundary enforcement collaboration between China and Lao PDR, for example, should be held as means of improving collaboration between the two countries as part of its bilateral co-operation (TRAFFIC, 2016b) CITES requests China and Viet Nam to take note of the information about the alleged illegal trade across the Ka Long River at the border between near Mong Cai, Viet Nam. 59 6.5 Country Profile: India India remains the stronghold of the global wild Tiger population, accounting for around 57% (2 226) of the total. This represents an increase of 30% from its estimate of 1 706 individuals in 2010 (WPSI, 2016). This success is largely attributed to the prioritization of maintaining core habitats for breeding, habitat connectivity and protection from poaching. During the 16-year period under review, India had recorded the greatest number of seizures of all TRCs, accounting for 44% of the total. It reported the seizure of a minimum of 540 Tigers and a maximum of 622 Tigers, the minimum accounting for 30% of the total.

The highest number of seizures was recorded in 2009 and the lowest number in 2013. The overall trend line indicates a statistically significant decrease in the number of seizures being reported (Figure 20). 60 Although India records a large variety of commodity types, the most prominent is skins which were seized far more commonly than any other commodity type, accounting for 62% of seized Tiger parts. While the overall number of Tigers seized has decreased, the proportion of skins seized remains a high proportion of the seizures but to a lesser degree (Figure 21).

Figure 21: Commodity Type by Year (2000-2015) Map 8 shows the location of all reported seizures with location details throughout the period under review by quarterly period, and does not appear to highlight any geographical concentrations of activity. Map 9 illustrates three hotspots, the greatest comprising the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Map 9: Hotspots of seizures (2000-2015) Map 8: Seizures denoted by quarterly period (2000-2015) 61 Map 10: Tiger Seizures (2012-2015) Map 10 shows the location of all reported seizures in the most recent quarter only (2012-2015). It demonstrates that while the southern hotspot is still present, there also appears to have been a greater number of seizures reported in the central zone in and around the state of Madhya Pradesh. A smaller cluster of seizures can also be observed along the border of Nepal in the state of Uttar Pradesh. DISCUSSION Other than a few exceptional cases, there is very little evidence of demand for Tiger parts in India (Seidensticker et al, 2001), yet overall during the period under review, India accounts for the greatest number of seizures at 44% across all TRCs. An in-depth study of the dynamics of Tiger crime in India over the four decades reveals patterns of Tiger crime that can go some way in aiding better informed decision making in crime prevention (Sharma, et al., 2013). There is a greater probability that Tiger seizures will occur in areas where Tigers exist and therefore, there is a crucial need to strengthen site-based enforcement efforts. An interesting finding of the research was the use of the national rail network of India as the preferred method of transporting Tigers and their parts. This is greatly due to the fact that many train lines traverse through many protected areas across India, in contrast to the national bus service for example. India is the only TRC to have prioritized the management of data on Tiger poaching and seizures \u2013 it established Tigernet8 in 2009, at which point its recording practices changed. All verified seizures since 2010 are now made available to the public via Tigernet. However, as Figure 18 illustrates, there has been a significant decline in the number of seizures being reported in India. The number of unverified reports in the media on the other hand, indicate that there are seizures not captured by Tigernet. As a centralized data management system, Tigernet has the potential 8 http://www.tigernet.nic.in/ 62 to be exemplary but there are concerns that the infrastructure may not be functioning as it should. Examples of these gaps are as described: \uf0b7 In September 2013 following a major operation, Delhi Police claimed to have busted the\u201d biggest gang of poachers and smugglers\u201d evading arrest for more than 20 years. Over 18 kg of Tiger skulls, bones, nails and teeth were recovered from three persons arrested for the illegal sale and supply of derivatives of endangered animals under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972. INFORMATION SOURCE: Delhi Police Press Release Reported on Tigernet: No \uf0b7 In August 2015, an intelligence-led investigation resulted in the arrest of three suspects and seizure of four pairs of Tiger claws. The gang had been investigated as part of a six-month operation. The seized parts were reported to have been sent to the State Forensic Sciences Laboratory for further confirmation. Cases have been filed under 10 different sections of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972. INFORMATION SOURCE: Times of India Reported on Tigernet: No CONTINUING CHALLENGES There appears to be a disparity between the occurrence of Tiger seizures in India and the recording of these incidents on Tigernet. The result of this may mean that there is some under-reporting on Tigernet. Tigernet is the first government-led central reporting mechanism for Tiger mortality and seizures of Tigers. It is currently the benchmark for other countries to emulate to aid transparency on Tiger crimes occurring within national jurisdictions. In order for it to be used as a reliable, accurate and up-to-date platform, it is paramount that such information is complete and made available in a timely manner, and that it sets a good model for other Tiger range countries where such systems do not exist. Indeed, if Tigernet is perfected, it would serve as a practical and exemplary tool to push for other TRCs to mirror in order to achieve more accurate reporting where this currently does not exist. 63 6.6 Country Profile: Indonesia Table 19: Total Reported Seizures (2000-2015) The latest Sumatran Tiger Panthera tigris sumatrae population sits at an estimated 371 individuals, representing 10% of the global wild Tiger population, placing Indonesia with the third highest", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c783417a-52d5-418b-a8c1-fb71fee5a8d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "c783417a-52d5-418b-a8c1-fb71fee5a8d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reduced to skin and bones re-examined : full analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "96bd1ae11f2d853dbc5316df1e4d45851aef27246a087d24a2a512df0575025f"}}, "hash": "96bd1ae11f2d853dbc5316df1e4d45851aef27246a087d24a2a512df0575025f", "text": "Tiger population of all the TRCs. (WWF, 2016c). This is an increase from the previous national estimate of 325 individuals. Indonesia has reported 70 seizures over the 16-year period and accounts for 8.7% of the global total. However, the first reported seizure did not take place until 2004 (Table 19). Indonesia has seized a minimum of 136 Tigers and a maximum of 182 Tigers, the minimum accounting for 7.5% of the global total. In 2015, the number of seizures was at its highest with 17 being reported, an increase of more than 100% over any of the previous years. The number of Tigers involved is also correspondingly the highest for any given year. In 2012, although the number of seizures was fairly similar to previous years, the number of Tigers seized was significantly higher (26). The trend lines (Figure 22) show a consistent increase in both the number of seizures, and the number of Tigers seized, and is more pronounced in relation to the number of Tigers being seized.

Skin and skin pieces was the most prevalent commodity type, by far the largest proportion at 43%, followed by dead specimens which account for 15%. Figure 23 illustrates that skin and skin pieces have been present every year throughout the period under review. It also shows that dead specimens were seized in nine of the 11 active years. Other commodity types were spread throughout the years with no particular pattern identified. Figure 23: Commodity Type by Year (2000-2015) Map 11: Reported seizures in Indonesia (2000-2015) 65 DISCUSSION During the most recent quarter (2012-2015), Indonesia seized the greatest number of Tigers (79) after Thailand9. The number of seizures reported in 2015 (17) was the highest number of seizures reported throughout the period under review and indicated a113% rise (n = 11) compared to the number of seizures reported in 2014 (8). The reported increase in seizures in 2015 may have been attributed to the concerted efforts of law enforcement agencies, including increased investigation of suspects and their links to the transnational Tiger trade. In February 2015, the South Sumatra Military Police, South Sumatra Provincial Natural Resource Conservation Office (BKSDA), and Wildlife Conservation Society\u2019s Wildlife Crimes Unit announced the arrest of a major wildlife trafficker illegally trading in Tiger parts and other protected wildlife. The suspect allegedly sold more than 100 stuffed Tigers over a 10-year period and traded in the illegal goods to buyers in southern Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and to a Tiger \u201cmiddleman\u201d trader in Jakarta. The suspect had since confessed that he purchased Tiger skins and stuffed Tigers in Lampung, Bengkulu, Jambi, and North Sumatra to supply demand in Jakarta and Java. This case serves to illustrate two points \u2013 first, the effectiveness of joint partnerships (including the contributing role of NGOs) and secondly, the domestic taxidermy Tiger trade in Indonesia. This seizure emphasizes a national trend involving the trade in taxidermy Tigers. Between 2012 and 2016, at least 15 seizures had taken place that involved stuffed whole Tigers or their parts, at least four of which were found to have been traded online. While there does not appear to be any geographical specificity in the seizures, most appear to occur across Sumatra (a source site) and the conurbation surrounding Jakarta (possibly the main target trade market for this product type). In 2013, a military court in the Aceh province sentenced two soldiers to prison and a fine of IDR5 million (USD454) for illegal possession of two stuffed Sumatran Tigers, among other wildlife (Parker, 2013). When the Indonesian government enacted its wildlife legislation in 1990, Act Number 5, it included a requirement for anyone in possession of protected species and their parts and products to obtain a permit by registering them with the government. A total of 1 081 stuffed and mounted Tigers skins were registered, including 100 stuffed Sumatran Tigers held by government officials and businessmen in South Sumatra. This was in addition to at least 500 stuffed Tigers registered in privately-held stocks in Palembang and Lampung (Shepherd and Magnus, 2004). Surveys in 2007 found the presence of a strong domestic market that exists in pockets across Indonesia (Ng and Nemora, 2007).

This lack of protection for non-native species is a significant gap, and one that serves to highlight the inability of the country to implement CITES. Despite some of these fundamental gaps, the CITES National Legislation Project has assessed Indonesia\u2019s legislation as being Category I, meaning it generally meets the requirement of CITES. Little is known about the number of convictions achieved in Indonesia for wildlife crimes. The lengthening of custodial sentences and significant increases in fines to serve as a deterrent is critically needed, and should be considered by Indonesia at a time when its Critically Endangered native Tiger population appears to be turning up in high numbers during seizures. CONTINUING CHALLENGES The national demand for taxidermy Tigers as a luxury item among the Indonesian elite is placing additional pressure on the declining Sumatran Tiger population. The inadequacy of its legislation, particularly with regard to the protection of non-native species, i.e. apart from Sumatran Tigers, remains a significant gap in Indonesia\u2019s ability to enforce CITES, and raises questions about its ability to also govern the issue of Tigers held in captivity or in private stocks. 67 6.7 Country Profile: Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic The wild Tiger population in Lao PDR is estimated to consist of only two individuals, and that is considered an ambitious figure (Goodrich et al, 2015), placing Lao PDR second from last after Cambodia for their current Tiger population. During the period under review, Lao PDR reported nine seizures, representing 4.8% of the total, equating to 39 Tigers which accounts for 2.1% of the total number of Tigers seized (Table 20). Only one seizure was reported during the most recent quarter (2012-2015), consisting of an estimated 11 live individuals suspected to be en route to Viet Nam.

Map 13 illustrates the known locations of incidents, as well as the number of Tigers seized during those incidents. The red circle denotes Bokeo Province, where the Golden Triangle is located and highlights its proximity to the Thai and Myanmar borders. Its relevance to illegal Tiger trade is discussed further below. Map 13: Seizures of Dead Tigers (2000-2015) 68 DISCUSSION The Environment Investigation Agency had produced an expose report on Lao PDR and its significant role in illegal wildlife trade, including at the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone in Bokeo Province (Environmental Investigation Agency, 2015). The report highlighted that the wildlife trade within the SEZ caters predominantly to Chinese and Vietnamese clients, with China being specified as the primary driver. This is evident from the fact that all signs in the SEZ were written in Chinese and prices quoted in RMB. The Bokeo province itself borders both Myanmar and Thailand (Map 13), and has been pinpointed as a historic trade hub for other forms of serious and organized crime such as opium trading (UNODC, 2008). In July 2016, TRAFFIC visited the Golden Triangle. A very small amount of Tiger parts were observed for sale in the Chinatown section of the area. Tiger canines and claws were observed. Traders there were all observed to be ethnic Chinese, and conversations with a few traders revealed that they originated from mainland China. A vast majority of the ethnic Chinese traders there were however not interested in engaging in any conversation with the TRAFFIC", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9978dcbf-5a2a-4ad7-8067-fcde56673d14": {"__data__": {"id_": "9978dcbf-5a2a-4ad7-8067-fcde56673d14", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reduced to skin and bones re-examined : full analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc6f848b439ed616c5616c85e9baa9aeb4f03ff2a4f6c176cd1f6d202b58706a"}, "3": {"node_id": "c497f28e-da7d-4f32-8fad-fa21fe1be98e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f67efa1ebdc07dc6e776b1fd84ce2ac097ef73cb6938a0236bfb1deb68641963"}}, "hash": "cd5029383cc0510bd661dfeccf48f5a89e6bd17e22f4bf4521d09e2969b8e246", "text": "team. The Treasure Hall outlet was abandoned but an old Tiger skin (among other items) was visible from the outside. This appears to be the result of a raid conducted in March 2015 with four restaurants reportedly being shut down.11 To the right of this Treasure Hall, on the outer premise which is concealed, a couple of cages were visible on two sides, and at least one adult live Tiger was observed here. No further information on this Tiger was forthcoming. On the other side of the Lao PDR border with China, in the Boten Special Economic Zone, at least eight bottles of Tiger wine were observed for sale in April 2016 in a shop that catered to wines for \u201cgood health\u201d (Or and Krishnasamy, in prep). Restaurants were also found to be selling Tiger bone wine. As in the Golden Triangle, every trader here was observed to be ethnic Chinese and believed t to have originated from mainland China. The clocks were observed to be set to Beijing time. The main issue of concern in Lao PDR is the unregulated growth of Tiger farms, and the increasing opportunity for open and unregulated illegal trade to be conducted in the country\u2019s Special Economic Zones, two of which are described above. The country\u2019s Economic Zones have become notorious as locations facilitating illegal wildlife trade, including Bear bile, Tiger parts and ivory, with a clear link between the country and its neighbouring China being established as source and consumer country (Krishnasamy and Or, in prep; Krishnasamy et al., 2016; Nijman and Shepherd, 2014; Ghosh, 2010). Any effort to eliminate illegal Tiger trafficking lies in the effective control and monitoring of these zones, which at present are hugely influenced by Chinese investment, both government and from the private sector (Lao National Committee for Special Economic Zone Secretariat Office, 2012). 11 https://eia-international.org/wp-content/uploads/EIA_Table-of-Tiger-Crime-Incidents_July-2015_updated-July-2016.pdf 69 Lao PDR also did not submit a report on its review of the implementation of Resolution Conf 12.5 (Rev. CoP 16) as required at the 66th Standing Committee meeting (https://cites.org/com/sc/65/index.php). Like other countries that failed to submit such a report, a comprehensive assessment of its progress in addressing Tiger trade is difficult to ascertain. Law enforcement efforts are considered to be low in Lao PDR, particularly given evidence of open illegal wildlife trade in the country. However, in July 2016, the first meeting of Lao PDR\u2019s Wildlife Enforcement Network (WEN) took place, which included the attendance of national CITES authorities. This is a sign of co-ordinated law enforcement effort across different agencies with a vested interest, crucial to building a national-level co-ordination structure. Ensuring that this national WEN is fit for purpose in Lao PDR is essential to making the regional ASEAN- WEN effective against transboundary trafficking. Most recently at the 17th CITES CoP, Lao PDR\u2019s Minister of Natural Resources and Environment announced a commitment to shut down its commercial Tiger farms (Dasgupta, 2016). This move, if realized, will be a crucial step forward in ensuring that Tigers from captive facilities do not leak into the illegal trade chain. CONTINUING CHALLENGES Lao PDR\u2019s first national-level Wildlife Enforcement Network did not take place until July 2016. The mushrooming of Lao PDR\u2019s Special and Specific Economic Zones, a significant proportion of which receives Chinese investment, is cause for concern. These zones, if not controlled, can function as hubs for Tiger (and other wildlife) trafficking, to an even greater extent than current operations. Pursuant to the CITES mission to Lao PDR in July 2016, the country has been asked to put into place a series of measures to facilitate its implementation of CITES. The mission also concluded that there are no clear guidelines on the operation of these Economic Zones in relation to trade in CITES-listed species, and that measures must be taken to address this. Further, the mission also called on Lao PDR to revise its legislation, given the major loopholes that obstruct the implementation of CITES and to prevent illegal wildlife trade.

This announcement further highlights that the number of mature individuals is likely to be fewer than 340 animals, and has declined by around 25% in one generation. This places the estimated Tiger population figures at around half of what was previously thought. This raises concerns about the country\u2019s ability to double its population by 2020, as envisaged by its National Tiger Conservation Action Plan. Malaysia\u2019s wild Tiger population currently places them at fourth among TRCs. In total, Malaysia has reported 40 seizures, representing 4.9% of the total (Table 21). There were no reported seizures during 2014. These seizures equate to a minimum 103 Tigers with the minimum representing 5.8% of the global total.

The seizure in 2012 remains the country\u2019s largest ever Tiger seizure of 22 Tigers, based on the number of skins and bones discovered (Shepherd et al., 2013). A vast majority (n = 22) of the 2008 case involved animals seized from a zoo, including 19 Tiger cubs found in the refrigerator of a zoo. Seizures in these two years had led to the increase in the number of Tigers seized across the whole data period. All other seizures involved much lower numbers of Tigers. The trend lines (Figure 25) show that the number of seizures reported has increased very slightly throughout the period under review. The trend line highlighting the number of Tigers seized however, has increased significantly during the period and can be attributed to seizures in 2008 and 2012. 71 Malaysia, unlike most TRCs, has not seized any one commodity significantly over others. The most common commodity types seized were skin and skin pieces, claws, and canines and teeth. When looking at the breakdown of commodity types across the 16-year period, there are no particular trends in relation to time as they are sporadically spread out through the years. Up until 2009, Tiger skins were not reported as being seized in Malaysia. Every year since then however, skins have been seized, with the greatest number in 2012 (Figure 26). Figure 26: Number of seizures and commodity types seized by year Map 13: Reported Seizures by Quarterly Period (2000-2015) Map 14 shows the known locations of seizures during 2000-2015 broken into four quarterly periods, and denoted by different coloured circles. The most recent quarter (2012-2015) appears to indicate a greater prevalence of seizures close to the border of Thailand, suggesting a trade route for Tiger parts being trafficked towards the Lower Mekong countries and beyond. 72 DISCUSSION Tiger seizures in the country appear inconsistent and sporadic. In the most recent quarterly period (2012-2015), the number of seizures remained relatively low in Malaysia (n=7) and no seizures were reported to have occurred in 2014. In the most recent quarter, more seizures had taken place close to the Malaysian-Thai border and therefore, it can be inferred that the shipments were bound for the international market. In the first two months of 2016, authorities made two more Tiger seizures (Or and Krishnasamy, 2016). In August 2016, over a five-day period, authorities again seized at least two Tiger skins, along with over 200 wildlife parts and derivatives, as well as arrested 12 suspects; seven of whom were Vietnamese nationals who were caught with the two Tiger skins (PERHILITAN, 2016; TRAFFIC, 2016). TRAFFIC\u2019s analysis of seizures and subsequent prosecution shows that about 30% of the cases resulted in conviction.

Collectively, thisis legislation provide more than adequate legal basis to prosecute offenders to the full extent of the law. But while the possibility of creating an effective deterrent to poachers and illegal traders 73 exists, it has not achieved the intended outcome. The highest fine meted out so far was in connection to the large seizures in 2012 involving 22 Tigers (as well as nine Elephant Loxodonta africana tusks). The offender, who was reported to be storing the parts for a Thai national, was fined a total of MYR200 000 (valued at USD66,700 at the time) and a jail term of 24 months which ran concurrently for all the offences, effective from the date of his arrest (Shepherd et al., 2013). This particular case could have seen the accused serving a 13-year maximum jail term, or fines exceeding millions of Ringgit, and indicates the crucial need to tackle the investigations and prosecution aspect, particularly in relation to judiciary engagement. Comprehensive investigations into individuals connected with illegal hunting and trade of Tigers remain one of the most crucial aspects for the Malaysian government to invest in, coupled with the need for the judiciary to recognize the seriousness of such crimes. 74 6.9 Country Profile: Myanmar Currently, there is no official estimate for the number of wild Tigers in Myanmar. The government of Myanmar estimated in 2010 that some 86 Tigers were thought to exist. However, no formal national survey has been undertaken in recent times (WWF, 2016c). Hope remains though, because of the abundance of suitable forests for two sub-species of Tigers known to exist there; the Bengal and Indochinese Tigers. The best hope for the Indochinese sub-species is in the Dawna Tennaserim landscape on the Thailand-Myanmar border where an estimated 250 Tigers remain. Table 22: Total Reported Seizures in Myanmar (2000-2015) Year Count Max. # Tigers Commodity Type 2009 1 1 Canines 2014 1 1 Bone 2015 1 1 Skin Total 3 3 3 During the period under review, Myanmar had reported three seizures, representing less than 1.0% of the global total. Map 14 shows the locations of the three reported seizures in Myanmar. In addition to this, at least 10 seizures were known to have occurred in China where the Tigers had originated from Myanmar, although this is considered to be an underestimated figure. The locations of two important open wildlife markets are also plotted, Mong La on the border with China and Tachilek on the border with Thailand. Map 14: Reported Seizures in Myanmar and Key Open Markets (2000-2015) 75 DISCUSSION Myanmar largely presents an information gap when attempting to assess the country\u2019s Tiger population and level of illegal Tiger trade. Little can be interpreted from the reported seizure picture as only three incidents have been reported during the 16-year period under review, representing a total of three Tigers (Table 22). The situation in Myanmar supports the rationale that analysing seizure data alone can often present very limited findings. Comparing the number of Tiger seizures in Myanmar with neighbouring countries such as India or Thailand implies that Tiger trade occurs largely unchallenged. It is suggested that its strategic positioning and weak governance in the past, have likely contributed to the hazy picture presented here today. The Special Development Zone of Mong La, Shan State, Myanmar, sits on the border with China and is under the de facto control of the National Democratic Alliance Army (NDAA). Under the NDAA\u2019s control, Mong La has gained a notorious reputation as a hub for prostitution, gambling and drug trafficking, in addition to the sale and trafficking of animal body parts (Oswell, 2010; Nijman and Shepherd, 2014). Due to its close proximity with China, it now represents a Chinese \u201cenclave\u201d, predominantly catering to the Chinese market and holds parallels with the SEZ in Lao PDR in that perspective. Observations of the wild cat trade at the markets of Tachilek (on the Thailand-Myanmar border) and Mong La (on the China border) between 2000 and 2014 found substantial differences in the level of trade at the two locations. In Tachilek, wild cat parts including Tiger and Leopard Panthera pardus skins and skulls reduced from 35 in 2000 to only six for 2013 (Nijman and Shepherd, 2014). At the same time, the incidence of trade trebled in Mong La from six parts observed in 2006 to 21 in 2014.

This reaffirms its status as a significant hub for illegal trade (Nijman et al, 2016) as well as the important enabling role that it plays at a regional level. Despite these identified instances of illegal Tiger trade at those key markets, there is yet to be any seizures reported there. 76 In June 2016, a Myanmar news outlet reported that the authorities were planning to close down the Mong La marketplace, following a statement by President U Htin Kyaw at a World Environment Day event that illegal wildlife trafficking would no longer be tolerated in Myanmar. U Win Naing Zaw (a director of the Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation Ministry) was quoted as saying that government departments were collaborating with respective local administrations to implement this plan (Frontier, 2016). There are vulnerabilities at border points. At present it is only possible to travel freely over land between Myanmar and Thailand.

Nepal had reported 84 seizures during the period under review and accounted for 10.4% of the total across all TRCs (Table 23). The minimum number of Tigers seized was 186 and accounts for 10.3% of the global total. Nepal reported its highest number of seizures during 2009 and 2010 where there were 12 seizures in each year. Since then, the number of seizures have slowly reduced (Figure 27).

All the other commodity types had been seized in very small quantities, in comparison. The seizure of Tiger skins were common in Nepal throughout the period under review, but has reduced since 2010 while the seizure of bones have increased in the same period (Figure 29). Figure 29: Number of Seizures and Commodity Types Seized by Year 79 DISCUSSION At the same time as the increase in Nepal\u2019s wild Tiger population, the Nepalese government also announced in May 2016 that the country has achieved two consecutive years of zero Rhino poaching, attributed to the combination of strong political will alongside the active involvement of park authorities. In 2014, Nepal celebrated a year of zero Tiger, Rhino and Elephant poaching but this security for Tigers was short lived.

The current figure is an increase from the 2005 census. In Russia, the number of seizures reported per year is relatively low across the period under review, with just 30 reported, accounting for 3.7% of the total across all TRCs (Table 24). However, the number of Tigers seized is high in comparison, equating to a minimum 102 individuals and accounting for 5.6% of the global total.

At the same time, the number of Tigers being seized is on the decrease, illustrated by both the trend line and median number of Tigers being seized each time. The overall average median of Tigers seized per seizure sits at one across all TRCs. The median number of Tigers seized in Russia was above average across for the first six years and then again between 2010 and 2013, highlighting again the low number of seizures versus the high number of Tigers seized. In the most recent quarter (2012-2015), the median number of Tigers dropped from five in 2012 to one in 2013 where it has remained. 81 The commodity type found to be most prevalent in all seizures was skin and skin pieces, followed by bone, skeleton and dead specimens. Tigers parts in Russia appear to consist of a wide variety of commodities and do not present any trends across the years under examination, only that Tiger bone was not present in any seizures until 2007. Whole Tiger skeletons were present in eight of the 14 years, with only one seizure of a skeleton in 2013. Figure 31: Tiger Commodity Type Seized by Year (2000-2015) DISCUSSION While the number of Tigers found in trade in Russia is one of the highest across all TRCs during the period under review, this has decreased since 2012. The number of seizures being reported is, in contrast, on the increase which may suggest enhanced law enforcement efforts. Equally, the number of wild Tigers now estimated to exist in Russia has increased and may indicate better protection in the wild. It is suspected that a major driver of Tiger poaching in Russia is to service demand in China. It was reported in 2007 that Chinese customers and / or traders were recruiting Russian nationals to function as couriers, as the probability of their being stopped and questioned at border points was lower (Burgess et al., 2015). However, in the most recent quarter, there appears to be an emerging threat in the form of Vietnamese demand for Siberian Tigers (Stoner and Nguyen, 2016). In 2015, there were two separate incidents involving Vietnamese nationals found in possession of Tiger parts. One such incident concerned a restaurant in Moscow which was found to be catering in rare animal parts to formulate medicines and exotic wild meat for consumption. The restaurant was not open to the general public and served only Vietnamese nationals. 82 6.12 Country Profile: Thailand Thailand\u2019s current wild Tiger population sits at an estimated 189 individuals, a decrease from its estimated 200 individuals, and accounting for 5% of the global total. Specifically, there has been encouraging estimates from the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary as camera traps confirms its population of Indochinese Tigers Panthera tigris corbetti has increased from a low of about 35 to 90, largely attributed to anti-poaching efforts. Thailand has reported 41 seizures although the first was not reported until 2003, and accounts for 5.1% of the global total seizures for all TRCs (Table 25). During the period under review, a minimum of 254 Tigers were seized and represents 14.1% of the total. This number is relatively high for the number of seizures being reported, however, this is largely skewed due to the impoundment of 100 Tigers from the Tiger Temple in 2015.

The number of Tigers seized however has increased significantly, by the three peaks in 2009, 2012, and 2015 where the seizures of many Tigers took place. The median average for the number of Tigers seized was above that of the overall average in 10 of the 12 years. This highlights that the number of Tigers seized was higher than would be expected in the majority of seizures. Furthermore, 30 of the 41 seizures equated to more than one Tiger.

The findings also highlight the prevalence of seizures of live specimens from 2010 onwards. Map 15: Seizures by quarterly period (2000-2015) Figure 33: Commodity Type Seized by Year (2000-2015) Map 15 provides some insight into the routes being used taking Tigers to trade, particularly in the most recent quarter (2012-2015). While there may be an expectation of a concentration of seizures in the capital of Bangkok, given its position as an illegal trade hub as well as an infrastructure node, there appears to be a prevalence of seizures on key arterial routes. This is apparent on the highway connecting the south (from the border with Malaysia) to central Thailand and the road leading towards Vientiane, Lao PDR. 84 DISCUSSION The issue of Tiger farming in Thailand has been a controversial subject in the context of illegal trade in the past 18 months due to the activities and focus on the Wat Pa Luang Ta Bua, also known as the Tiger Temple in the western Kanchanaburi province. The temple was well known for the practice of allowing tourists to pet, and have their photo taken with a Tiger. Rumours about the facility and its involvement in wildlife trafficking were confirmed in 2016 when leakages of their Tigers into trade were confirmed (see Threat Assessment in page 36). While the story generated a great deal of media attention internationally, judicial action has not been taken against the Abbott or any individual connected to the case. The case is still ongoing. Seizure locations as indicated in Map 20 point to a route leading to Lao PDR. This requires further investigation, and indeed, should be the focus of any law enforcement efforts. According to anecdotal information, the method of killing the Tigers involve drowning them in cages, something they call \u201csua damnam\u201d (\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e49\u0e33\u0e19 \u0e49\u0e33) or diving tigers. The Tigers are placed in small metal moving cages and then completely submerged into small water tanks drowning them slowly (Wiek, 2016). This method is quiet, cheap and effective as no gunshots are needed, which could be used as forensic evidence in any legal case. It also serves to minimize damage to the skin. The earlier used method of electrocution left burn marks not only on the external skin and fur of the Tigers but also on the internal muscles and organs, which decreased their value. Some suppliers in farms are reportedly drowning the Tigers themselves and removing organs with no value before handing over the partly processed Tiger to traders, while others deliver live Tigers to slaughterhouses elsewhere to be processed by \u201cprofessionals\u201d (Wiek, 2016). The trade in Tigers would be more efficient if the suppliers and dealers completely process the Tiger bodies in Thailand, but the Chinese and Vietnamese buyers do not trust their Thai and Laotian suppliers enough to have the Tigers completely processed into bone powder etc. thus, they will only accept the Tigers in one piece or cut in half. This may explain why seizures in whole specimens are more common in Thailand compared to other TRC. 85 6.13 Country Profile: Viet Nam The status of wild Tigers in Viet Nam is bleak in 2015, with fewer than an estimated five individuals believed to exist, representing less than 1% of the global Tiger population. Like neighbouring Lao PDR and China, more captive Tigers inhabit Viet Nam than wild individuals.

The median average of the number of Tigers seized within Viet Nam rose above its average of one for a 5-year period (2006-2011), where it is above the overall average of one, with the highest being three Tigers seized on average in 2007. The overall average for Viet Nam, however, is in line with the overall mean across all TRC. Figure 34: Number of Seizures and Tiger Seized by Year (2000-2015) Viet Nam has reported 61 seizures in 12 years (the first reported seizure was not until 2004), and represents 7.7% of the global total. It has seized a minimum of 164 Tigers and a maximum of 166, accounting for 9.1% of all Tigers seized throughout the period under review (Table 26). In 2008, there was a steep increase in the number of seizures made in Viet Nam and the number of Tigers seized, but this is largely attributed to a seizure of 42 live Tigers from Duong Tiger Farm. 86 Dead Tigers have been the most common commodity type present in the seizures, followed by live specimens. There has been a wide range of commodity types seized throughout the period (Figure 35). Live specimens have been present in only 11 seizures, yet they account for a disproportionate number of Tigers seized in Viet Nam (65 /40%). Figure 35: Number of seizures and commodity types seized by year Map 16 & 17: Seizures in Viet Nam by Quarterly Period (2000-2015) Maps 16 and 17 plot locations of seizures across Viet Nam which appear to be more distributed in the north. During the most recent quarter (denoted by the blue circles), seizures have been more concentrated around Ha Noi compared to previous years. Map 17 illustrates the abundance of seizures just in Ho Chi Minh City during quarters three and four. Seizures in the south outside of Ho Chi Minh City were rare, particularly in comparison to the north of Viet Nam. 87 DISCUSSION Two main threats exist in Viet Nam, the first being the growth in the number of captive Tigers in farms. Viet Nam seized the greatest number of live Tigers after Thailand during the 16-year period under review. The Vietnamese government published the official number of captive Tigers as at 107 individuals across 10 facilities in 201212. This is now known to have increased to 180 individuals with no obvious relationship to the conservation of wild Tigers. At the same time, there has been an increased in unregulated breeding at unregistered private facilities. In 2012, an undercover report stated that over the past decade, several villages in Do Thanh commune in Vietnam\u2019s Nghe An Province have become markets for trading Tiger parts. It also documented the presence of illegal Tiger farms where the animals are kept in captivity in small, unsanitary cages similar to pig farms13. This is somewhat corroborated by the reported seizure picture, after at least nine seizures (seven of which occurred in the most recent quarter) were reported in Nghe An Province, comprising a minimum of 11 whole Tigers (both live and dead). The likely source is a captive one. The news reports also state that Tigers had been discovered at people\u2019s homes. The second key threat is a perceived domestic market for Tiger bones for medicinal purposes. This is popular among an emerging sub-culture of consumers in Viet Nam (Akella and Allan, 2012). Bones are often boiled down until they form a glue-like substance, known as cao. This is then dried, grounded into a fine powder and consumed with alcohol. Tigers found in incidents reported over the last two years suggest that Tiger bones are being sourced from Russia for the Vietnamese market (Stoner and Nguyen, in prep). However, at least 50% (12) of the seizures reported in the last quarter were reported to be related to the production of Tiger bone paste and at least two incidents also involved the presence of Lion bones. The information does not appear to suggest that these products were intended for the Chinese market, with one report claiming that Tiger bones are used in Vietnam to make a traditional pain killer for around USD 1 000 for 100 grams. 12 SC65 Country report 13 http://tuoitrenews.vn/cmlink/tuoitrenews/features/ 88 7.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The data presented here reinforces earlier findings on the persistent threats faced by Tigers from poaching and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aec0e25f-e003-44b0-83a6-ddf55820a507": {"__data__": {"id_": "aec0e25f-e003-44b0-83a6-ddf55820a507", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reduced to skin and bones re-examined : full analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fbba1a47e2de919f148926c6418bb8f703e96bbf5280e5640595b7139da59e2b"}}, "hash": "fbba1a47e2de919f148926c6418bb8f703e96bbf5280e5640595b7139da59e2b", "text": "trafficking. An overall assessment of the 16-year period shows that an average of 110 Tigers had been seized annually for 16 years. The analysis also outlined the key issues that require improvement - both from an overall global perspective as well as country-specific insights and needs - particularly regarding TRC commitments and responsibilities with respect to CITES implementation, and securing wild Tiger populations. The primary issue involves elements of law enforcement. Many of the seizures successfully recorded by TRCs, including some described in the report, point to high levels of organized criminality to acquire parts of Tigers. Poaching and trafficking networks involving individuals and businesses operating at a local level also have regional and international implications, particularly where their operations involve cross-border and international trade or where foreign nationals are involved. These chronic problems undermine national and international governance systems, and require dedicated and calculated law enforcement interventions to disrupt and dismantle trafficking networks, and ultimately prevent poaching from taking place. 89 The seizure analysis reinforces the reality that current collective efforts at the global level are insufficient to stem the threats posed by trade, especially as seizures very often represent only a proportion of detected illegal trade, meaning that actual trade levels are suspected to be much higher. This assessment identifies the critical elements in national- level trade dynamics across some key Tiger range countries, such as the demand for skins and taxidermy purposes (trophy) and bones (traditional medicinal purposes). Each of the problems and issues described highlights the urgent need to address the enabling conditions that allow Tiger trade to continue at such high levels. To this end, the application of seizure data analysis contextualized with up-to-date information on trade, allows for the development of recommendations designed to solve this problem. There are several common themes that exist across most, if not all, TRCs that need to be tackled strategically to achieve a meaningful impact. Each of these themes had been highlighted in the past as requiring specific intervention by Parties to the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), particularly TRCs. However, implementation of these measures have yet to achieve sufficient results in stemming the poaching of and trade in Tigers. Addressing these issues require countries, particularly TRCs, to make substantial efforts aimed at: 1) improving law enforcement effectiveness, legislation and regulation; 2) regulating captive breeding; and 3) reducing demand and consumption. 1. LAW ENFORCEMENT, LEGISLATION AND REGULATION The persistently high number of seizures, involving an equally high number of whole Tigers in trade, is rooted in the lack of intelligence-led law enforcement efforts that can lead to successful convictions. TRAFFIC urges TRCs to share information and intelligence on seizures and poaching incidences. Parties can also utilize results from seizure analysis and mapping, such as those done by TRAFFIC, to guide law enforcement interventions, along with their own intelligence and inter-agency efforts. Parties should also share information on Tiger skin seizures to enable the determination of Tiger provenance, and better understand the criminal networks and trade patterns that they employ, including for example, the routes used for Tiger trafficking. This is closely associated with the need for countries to establish a systematic and standardized database to store forensic markers and photographic information, at minimum, to aid investigations and law enforcement efforts, as endorsed by the 17th Conference of Parties (CoP) to CITES in October 2016. Collaboration at a regional level is needed, particularly at hotspots and border areas identified in this report. The role of bilateral co- operation, and multilateral law enforcement networks such as the South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN) and Association of Southeast Asian Nations Wildlife Enforcement Network (ASEAN-WEN), becomes extremely pertinent. Collaboration with partners at the international level, including INTERPOL through the National Central Bureaus (NCBs), in co-ordinating and supporting investigations, could strengthen efforts on this front, particularly in pursuing nominal information on perpetrators. Where information on criminal activity involves businesses and / or 90 corporations, investigations by TRCs and other CITES Parties should consider potential money-laundering operations, and prosecutorial actions should be pursued under relevant legislation. The 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES also saw the adoption of CITES\u2019 first resolution on anti-corruption. Corruption is inherently difficult to quantify, monitor and prevent, and thus, direct links between this seizure analysis and corruption cannot be made. However, any effort to eliminate poaching and Tiger trafficking must consider implementing anti-corruption measures to accompany intelligence-led investigations, prosecution and successful convictions. While many TRCs have laws to address corruption, they are seldom used in tackling wildlife crime. Such efforts must be considered as necessary in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6b8a2a8-0118-4048-a86b-8ebb98fada24": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6b8a2a8-0118-4048-a86b-8ebb98fada24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reduced to skin and bones re-examined : full analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "761ce8f5a491ee706268d7952a4eb277d731502de265b1074bcb83b20efd4a1e"}, "3": {"node_id": "00fce34b-d9bf-416a-8649-58ff566531f7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29d14e7b36c21714086a5fc75d71ba02368d28a4e991b91e650d687ca4702ecf"}}, "hash": "cd47790751fd0617b76f58eea83ef7505d78174bf208547928c3ddb2235d497b", "text": "any law enforcement effort, perhaps in tandem with anti-money laundering investigations where such cases are present, without which organized criminal networks perpetuating this problem will not be eradicated. While analysis of seizure information provides valuable insights into the occurrences at a global level, efforts to evaluate progress being made by TRCs are hampered by the non-systematic manner in which seizures are reported to CITES, compounded by the overall low rates of reporting. Pursuant to CITES CoP Decisions 16.68 to 16.70 on Asian big cats (Felidae spp.), all TRCs were required to \u201cprovide information on incidents of poaching of and illegal trade in all Asian big cat species, including their parts and derivatives, which will enable the compilation of a report for the law enforcement community\u201d as well as \u201cgather information on incidents of poaching of and illegal trade in all Asian big cats since the beginning of 2010, undertake an analysis of the information, and prepare a report for the law enforcement community to be circulated in a restricted fashion to relevant enforcement agencies and range States\u201d. This has clearly not yet taken place in full, as evidenced by the paucity of feedback from TRCs to the CITES Secretariat based on Notification to the Parties No. 2013/037 regarding Implementation of Resolution 12.5 (Rev. CoP 16). The notification sent to Parties in 2016 regarding a New Annual Illegal Trade Report (No. 2016/007) provides a simple template that enables Parties to report all information regarding illegal trade. Such action by TRCs in a timely manner would aid efforts to better understand the levels of trade across TRCs, especially when assessed using a standard reporting template. This can also be useful in assessing their progress at the national, regional and international levels, including the identification of additional support for law enforcement efforts. Law enforcement can only be effective if the legal tools are in place to regulate and control trade in Tigers. When the legislation is weak or have gaps, for example when they do not protect non-native species, CITES becomes ineffective. Of all TRCs, seven \u2013 China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Russia, Thailand and Viet Nam - have Category I listing, meaning their national legislation is deemed to meet CITES requirements. However, the legislation of some of the seven have significant gaps, such as those concerning the regulation of captive facilities, and the lack of protection on the use and trade in non-native species within the country. TRAFFIC therefore proposes a comprehensive re-assessment of the effectiveness of CITES-implementing legislation for Indonesia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam as a matter of priority, including a re-examination of categorization under the CITES National Legislation Project. These countries have been selected on the basis of gaps and weaknesses in their legislative provisions, such as low penalties and deterrents to illegal activity. This re-assessment should include elements of the law that consider at minimum, the following areas: 1) protection against the hunting, use of and trade in all Tigers (including all sub-species) which effectively affords protection for wild Tigers across all TRCs and allows 91 TRCs to fully and adequately implement CITES, 2) adequacy of penalties provided by law, 3) captive breeding regulation ( for all Tiger species including at the sub-species level), 4) registration of privately-held stocks and the prevention of leakage into the market, and 5) control of products and medicines containing or claiming to contain Tigers. To stem the issue of laundering and leakage regarding captive-bred Tigers, countries that have captive breeding facilities or operations should as a matter of urgency revise their legislation to include non-native Tigers (and other Asian big cats). It is also worth considering that the application of laws is as paramount as the legislation itself. The lengthening of custodial sentences and increased penalties will not be enough on its own, as extensive and thorough investigations also need to happen in order for the legislation to be fully implemented. Cybercrime involving Tigers is becoming more prevalent, as evidenced by seizures analysed in this dataset where sellers had attempted to offer items for sale on the internet. Social media and phone applications, especially those with restricted-access features, facilitate communication between traders in a non-detectable way. In April 2016, WhatsApp (owned by Facebook) reported the messaging service would be fully encrypted, creating greater challenges for law enforcement agencies to monitor and detect illegal activity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00fce34b-d9bf-416a-8649-58ff566531f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "00fce34b-d9bf-416a-8649-58ff566531f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reduced to skin and bones re-examined : full analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "761ce8f5a491ee706268d7952a4eb277d731502de265b1074bcb83b20efd4a1e"}, "2": {"node_id": "e6b8a2a8-0118-4048-a86b-8ebb98fada24", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd47790751fd0617b76f58eea83ef7505d78174bf208547928c3ddb2235d497b"}}, "hash": "29d14e7b36c21714086a5fc75d71ba02368d28a4e991b91e650d687ca4702ecf", "text": "TRAFFIC urges commercial trading sites and social media enterprises to work closely with national governments to shut down businesses and individuals found to be facilitating the illegal trade in Tigers (and other endangered species) online.

Viable options for self-policing by internet service providers and social media networks combined with mechanisms for reporting illegal trade, should be considered including the establishment of systems to prohibit or suspend accounts of repeat offenders. Parties are also encouraged to adopt approaches similar to China\u2019s \u201cZero Tolerance\u201d of online advertising of Tigers which involves joint work between service providers, governments and non-governmental organizations. TRAFFIC also urges members of the public who suspect any illegal activity to report the suspected crime directly to local law enforcement agencies. Options for reporting to TRAFFIC can also be made via the Wildlife Witness App, which can be downloaded from the App Store or Google Play for free. If illegal activity is suspected to be taking place on Facebook, a direct report to Facebook itself is encouraged. Facebook\u2019s Community Standards are a strong affirmation of its policy against any illegal activity, including wildlife crime, and provides a procedure for direct reports to Facebook (https://www. facebook.com/help/181495968648557?ref=communi%20ty_standards) 2. CAPTIVE BREEDING 92 The rise in unregulated breeding farms and facilities and its relation to illegal Tiger trade needs to be closely monitored. Seizures of suspected captive origin Tigers (both live and carcasses) had risen in three Southeast Asian countries \u2013 Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam, in parallel with the growing number of captive Tigers in these countries. Years of requests from Parties on efforts to regulate and control the leakage of Tigers from captive facilities have not made any meaningful progress on this matter. Reports are also being submitted in a non-standardized manner with varying levels of information that lack the level of detail required to understand the full breadth and implications to wild Tigers. These require further investigation, given the involvement of, and allegations against, captive facilities, the true motives behind such operations and the cloud of uncertainty surrounding the management, regulation and control of such facilities. This analysis has shown that Tigers from these facilities have indeed leaked into and become part of the illegal trade chain. Based on this, TRAFFIC recommends that the following be implemented as immediate priorities by the CITES Secretariat, as contained in CITES CoP 17 Doc. 60.1, and the draft Decision on Asian big cats CoP17 Com. II. 10 that was accepted at the CoP17: \uf0b7 Conduct a review on the number of Tiger breeding facilities maintained by Parties and the number of Tigers kept in these facilities; \uf0b7 Request Parties with facilities where large numbers of Tigers are bred in captivity to welcome a mission from the Secretariat to visit such facilities with the purpose of gaining a better understanding of the operations and activities undertaken by them. In addition, and given the involvement of and reported allegations against captive facilities as well as suspicions on the true motives behind such operations, affected countries, particularly TRCs should investigate all breeding centres for involvement in illegal activity, and close such facilities if there\u2019s evidence of such. Further analysis is also encouraged to better understand the implications of Tiger seizures from captive facilities on wild Tiger populations. For Lao PDR, the recommendation from the CITES Secretariat\u2019s mission in July 2016 points to some key priorities: \u201cThere is an urgent need for the adoption of clear guidelines regarding the operation of Special Free Economic Zones in relation to farming, consumption and trade in CITES-listed species, as well as clear guidance on how to proceed in cases of alleged illicit trafficking occurring in these zones. No standard procedure seems to be in place to act upon such information\u201d. Lao PDR\u2019s announcement at the 67th meeting of the CITES Standing Committee (SC67) regarding its intention to discuss ways of phasing out its Tiger farms is relevant in this context, including the development of regulations on wildlife trade in its Special Economic Zones. DNA profiles and other markings (such as photographic evidence) should be taken from all Tigers held in captivity to monitor the numbers of Tigers being bred in captive facilities, and to prevent more Tigers from being leaked into trade. These samples should be recorded and managed in a centralized database. Samples from seized Tigers can then be taken and cross-referenced with the database, to corroborate or refute claims that Tiger breeding in such facilities is supplying trade. 93 REFERENCES AFP.

Few of the participating countries recognize and include definitions such as \u201cForests of Local Importance\u201d, communal forest management or ownership within their national forest legislation. But, also where forests are under exclusive state ownership, \u201clocal forests\u201d can be managed by different levels and types of institutions. The quality of governance often determines whether forest resources are used ef\ufb01ciently, sustainably and equitably, and whether countries achieve forest-related development goals. One of the important criteria, when assessing the quality of forest governance, is to analyse how local populations are involved in the management of forests in their vicinity. In the past decades some of the ENPI-FLEG II countries reviewed existing forest governance patterns and introduced new forms of forest management based on bottom-up approaches. However, with few exceptions, local communal authorities neither own forests nor possess management rights for them. At the same time many rural communities in the ENPI-FLEG II countries depend on their surrounding forests and the natural resources and on locally important ecosystem services they provide. In order to study the differentiated patterns, this Regional Study on the governance of local forest in ENPI-FLEG II countries has been initiated as part of the Programme\u2019s regional level activities. The main purpose of this Study is to serve as contribution to policy review and reforms by documenting and analysing the existing schemes of governance of local forests in the region. Further, the methodology applied in this Regional Study and the experiences made are expected to contribute to the further development of the IUCN Nature Resource Governance Framework by providing vi practical test cases from a specific region. This Regional Study largely builds on Case Studies from five out of the seven countries that participate in ENPI-FLEG. The full Case Studies are presented in the Annex 2 to this Regional Study. This Executive Summary presents the key aspects of methods, historic context and findings of the Regional Study in a concise and generalized form. More detailed and country specific facts can be accessed via the references to the Regional Study and the Case Studies. Methods Key for the determination of the scope of this Study is the definition of the key terms \u201cgovernance\u201d or \u201cnatural resource governance\u201d, \u201cforests\u201d, \u201clocal forests\u201d and some others. In this Study we apply the definition of NATURAL RESOURCE GOVERNANCE as \u201cthe interactions among structures, processes and traditions that determine how power and responsibilities are exercised, how decisions are taken, and how citizens or other stakeholders have their say in the management of natural resources - including biodiversity conservation\u201d. The definitions of \u201cforest\u201d in the legislation of the countries show differences to the FAO definition as well as between the countries. While forest lands can include lands temporarily or permanently without tree cover, there can as well be lands, the vegetation cover of which qualifies as forest, that are not considered as forest lands. These differences have been considered in a flexible way in the determination of the scope of the Regional Study and the Case Studies as well as in the assessment and analysis of governance. The Consultant in several cases considered areas as \u201cforest\u201d that qualify technically as such but do legally not belong to this category. Table i.

Forest code of the RF Ukraine Forest lands include lands with forest plots as well as land not covered by forests, but assigned and used for the needs of forestry. Land plots are assigned to forest lands in accordance to the legislation on land-use. Forest plots are areas with defined borders, allocated for forestry without alienation from the land-user or landowner. Forest Code No generally accepted definition exists for the term \u201clocal forests\u201d. The review of the national legislation of the ENPI-FLEG II countries showed that the term and understanding of \u201cforests of local importance\u201d exist only in the legislation of Georgia and is poorly defined even there. In countries where no such special definition is in place, policies, laws and regulations consider at least some involvement in various forest management aspects of local public bodies, such as the councils and administrations at local levels (sub-district, commune or municipality) and villages, and of local legal entities, households or individuals. The findings of this Study showed that, while in most Case Study areas forests formerly in the possession of agricultural units \u2013 such as kolkhoz or sovkhoz \u2013 form the majority of \u201clocal forests\u201d, a broader and flexible understanding of the term is necessary. In the practice the Consultant and the interviewed stakeholders were not always able to draw a clear line between the governance of \u201clocal\u201d and of other forests. The Consultant and the Country Program Coordinators (CPCs) applied the following definition: \u201cLocal forests\u201d are forests, which are located in close distance to rural and urban settlements and are of special importance for the wellbeing of the respective local people in terms of provision of forest resources and ecosystem services. The term \u201cNon-wood forest products\u201d (NWFP) includes all forest products which are not wood, i.e. it excludes timber, fuel-wood and other wood materials. In contrast, the definition of the term \u201cNon-timber forest products\u201d (NTFP) would include fuel-wood as well. The assessment and analysis of governance of local forests at a regional scale will require the use of several terms, like \u201ccommunity\u201d, terms for administrative territorial levels and forestry organizations. Despite the common history of the ENPI-FLEG II countries these terms are not always understood in the same way, especially if used in English. Also sometimes different terms are used in these countries for comparable units, organizations, institutions and other aspects. The scope of this Study does include forests in accordance to the FAO and national definitions, focusing on forests in a stricter sense, which are functional and self-sustaining ecosystems with some extent of management intervention. Less attention is paid to artificial and often short living plantations of cultivated and exotic species, entirely depending on management interventions for their short- and mid-term existence, and to wind breaks on agricultural lands. The Study as well considers spontaneously growing forest vegetation on abandoned or extensively grazed agricultural lands. The scope of this Study does not include shelterbelts protecting settlements, industrial sites, roads, railways etc., fruit tree plantations and parks in urban areas. The absence of a common definition in the ENPI-FLEG II countries and in the context of the programme makes it difficult to determine the scope of this Study by distinguishing between \u201clocal forests\u201d and other forests. The forests\u2019 history as former property of agricultural units cannot exclusively determine the scope of this Study because more than twenty years have passed since the beginning of economic and political transformation. The determination of the scope of this Study by applying criteria of actual or potential future ownership or management responsibility turned out viii being practical only in those countries that have in some extent developed communal management and ownership of forests (Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine). Restricting the scope of the study by predetermining a type of ownership or management arrangement qualifying forests as \u201clocal\u201d would have excluded typical situations from this Study and hindered the comparative analyses of different organizational settings between the countries.

The methodology of this Study included elements of various frameworks, in particular of the frameworks of the Governance of Forests Initiative, of PROFOR/FAO and of The World Bank\u2019s, and has been adapted and simplified, taking into considerations the key issues faced in the governance of local forests in the ENPI-FLEG II countries.

The Consultant additionally communicated directly with national consultants in those countries where national consultants had worked on governance and related topics. As sources of information the Consultant used the available and relevant national documents as primary sources, like: - Policy documents; - National and \u2013 where existing \u2013 sub-national laws, and relevant bylaws. The consultant referred to secondary sources of information including: - Reports prepared in the frame of ENPI-FLEG; - Reports and publications prepared in the frame of other projects. The Consultant visited six of the seven ENPI-FLEG II countries (except Russian Federation), conducted Case Studies (13 areas in five countries) and met with representatives of: - Government agencies (in particular those in charge of forestry); - Forest inventory and management planning organizations; - Non-governmental organizations; - Local administrations at different levels; - Community representatives; - Local forestry enterprises. The Consultant interviewed stakeholders in most cases in Russian or English and relied only in few cases on translation from the official language. The stakeholder interviews followed the framework without necessarily covering all of its components entirely and with each stakeholder. The Consultant encouraged the interview partners to explain their own perspective on the governance of local forests and to highlight those aspects they considered most relevant. The Consultant as much as possible verified the reliability of gathered information by cross-checking, assessing the plausibility and comparing with information from other stakeholders in the Case Study areas. This Study is focussed more on assessing the quality of governance as processes, rather than on measuring their impacts. Quality of governance of forests is, however, best assessed by its outcomes or impacts in terms of conditions and sustainability of the resource and by the direct and indirect benefits the society as a whole and the local households get from the use of the resource as well as the way economic benefits enable the sustainable management of the local forests. IUCN has determined a set of principles of good governance, which were taken into consideration for assessing the governance of local forests in the Annex 1 of this Regional Study. Historic Background The history of forests belonging to local peasants and rural communities has its beginnings long ago in pre-soviet times. In Tsarist Russia the legislation on peasant forests origins in 1766 in the General Land Survey. Similarly in other regions, which became part of the Soviet Union, peasants owned forests either as individuals or as common property of the community.

All products harvested from these forests and all incomes generated belonged to the collective farms. The total area covered by these kolkhoz forests in 1962 was 39.2 Mio ha or 6- 7% of the overall forest cover of the Soviet Union. Until the 1960s and 1970s most kolkhozes used the forests in their possession for the fulfilment of immediate needs without implementing a systematic silvicultural management. Because of the lack of forestry capacity in the kolkhozes, inter- farm forestry enterprises were established. On the other hand, agricultural farms also contributed to an increase of the forest cover by establishing artificial plantations and shelterbelts. The formal status as forests of shelterbelts on agricultural lands was subject of debate already in Soviet times. These shelterbelts were largely seen as not belonging to the forest fund as nowadays still reflected in some national legislation, while in other countries shelterbelts are explicitly included in the forests. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the independence of its Republics, the status and governance of forests, formerly possessed by agricultural farms, developed in different ways in each country. The origin of many local forests in overused and unsustainably managed forests and poorly adapted exotic tree plantations challenge the development of stable forest ecosystems that can provide environmental services and be sustainably managed in an economically viable way. These inherent difficulties and the heritage of unclear legal status, ownership and/or management authority still affect their current governance. Table iii.

New afforestation areas mainly artificial plantations. Belarus During early 2000s entirely integrated into the state forest fund managed by the local state forestry enterprises. Some succession areas on abandoned agricultural lands still being handed over to the state forest fund. Georgia Integrated into the central forest management after transformation of agricultural units. Planned hand- over to municipalities (2007) did not take place.

The forestry policy documents of Russia recognize access of the rural population to forests and forest products and the special interests of local communities and indigenous people. In the practice of some programme countries the implemented policy can substantially deviate from the adopted policy, especially where concerning local forests and the involvement of local communities and subnational territorial administrative units in forestry. For instance, in Armenia community forestry programs are officially stated in the policy, while Hayantar in the practice does not see potential in the active involvement of local communities in forest management. In contrast, in Moldova the officially adopted policy was oriented towards central level forest management, while the applied policy recognizes the potentials of communal forest ownership and supports its development. Similarly, in Ukraine \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises are de-facto recognized by the political decision makers. In Russia the policy of assigning forest use and management rights based on lease to large and often non-local forestry companies contradicts policy provisions on access for local people and involvement of local communities and indigenous people. In some countries the policy on forests shows inner contradictions. For instance, in Azerbaijan and Moldova the policy of assigning all forests to the protected category contradicts the principles of sustainable forest management and creates disincentives for local people to comply with regulations and to support the expansion and reforestation of forests and their maintenance. xii Table iv.

The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Protection (MENRP) has established a special Forest Policy Service.

The Concept calls for a case by case identification of the best form of ownership and mentions \u201ccommunity ownership\u201d, without getting more specific.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44a67f6c-f1c7-4d19-a775-ebbc298eba1a": {"__data__": {"id_": "44a67f6c-f1c7-4d19-a775-ebbc298eba1a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f6dbc2432d81331e9051a593ff092c73d6983d4a01ba9fa55979d0f308aa5ec3"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc8565e5-d672-40bb-a7f8-68586731c6f2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "98a169de4f14e68294086308649fac8eacca011d468d978b5fd22e0857bea131"}}, "hash": "895ccf6224906851616460566dd7b400f13956b11a38b3e998f1e47755fb05d5", "text": "The Concept falls short to provide a clear policy direction on \u201clocal forests\u201d and the role of municipalities as forest managers and/or owners and does not describe the future role of the private sector, in particular of long term concessions.

Nevertheless, there exist high expectations towards the capacity and financing abilities of municipalities, but concepts how to achieve these are still to be elaborated. Further country-specific findings are presented in the Regional Study section on this component. Component 1.2: Legal and regulatory frameworks All programme countries except of the Russian Federation have ratified the UNECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (Aarhus Convention) and all programme countries are party to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Relevant national legislation has incorporated the provisions of these conventions at least in form of general recognition and framework regulations. The national legal and regulatory frameworks are generally structured in a very similar way in all programme countries. The basic laws or constitutions of the countries contain very general provisions on the protection and use of natural resources and the environment, in some cases providing for state or public ownership on natural resources. The key sector laws of all programme countries are the respective forest codes, which after independence were developed on the basis of the Forest Code of the Soviet Union and thus shared many similarities in structure and content. The Forest Codes are generally framework legislation, many regulations of which refer to specific bylaws or to other legislation. The systems of bylaws vary between the countries. Bylaws (statutes or regulations) define the structures, mandates and functioning of state agencies and forestry enterprises, the procedures of forest inventory and management planning, the procedures of decision making on logging and other forest management activities, on allocation of user rights, lease of forests, concessions and permits, and many other subjects. Further, instructions regulate in detail the technical aspects of forestry works. In some countries the detailed legal and regulatory frameworks may lead to overregulation and too many restrictions on the decision making by immediate forest users and forestry administrations, thus hampering adaptive management of forests. Legal and regulatory frameworks in some of the programme countries specifically address forests of \u201clocal importance\u201d and/or provide opportunities for community forestry, private forests and involvement of the local administrations and self- governance bodies and other stakeholders in decision making. The environmental legislation determines the legal basis for the protection of the environment as well as for natural resources use and conservation of biodiversity. These regulations are applied on aspects of forestry where the forestry legislation does not provide specific norms. xiv The designation of categories of land use, the use of lands of different categories, procedures for changes of designations as well as ownership, land-use rights and lease of lands are regulated in the Land Codes. Forest lands are defined as a category, distinct from categories like lands of protected areas, agricultural lands, lands of water objects and lands of urban areas. Forests and other tree and shrub vegetation can be found on lands of all these categories. This situation bears the potential of legal duplications, contradictions and gaps. Ownership and use-rights on lands and on the forests growing on these lands can potentially belong to different entities. Other adjacent legislation is generally in place, e.g. on criminal acts, on administrative legal violations, on local self-governance bodies and their competencies on forests and other resources as well as on tender procedures for the provision of goods and services to the state or for the allocation of leases and concessions. But inconsistencies, gaps and regulations, which hinder effective governance and management of forests, do exist. Table v.

Case ii: Belarus \u2013 Detailed forestry legislation The acting Forest Code has been adopted in 2000 and was amended several times since then. The Ministry of Forestry has prepared a new draft Forest Code. It is currently in the process of review and adoption. Presidential Decrees and bylaws adopted by the Council of Ministers define most details of the use and protection of forests. The Presidential Decree #214/7 May 2007 \u201cOn several measures for the improvement of activities in the sphere of forestry\u201d adopted a number of bylaws that in detail regulate key issues of use and protection of forests. The aforementioned legislation on forestry is completed by a number of technical instructions adopted by the Ministry of Forestry, which determine all practical aspects of the methods and technologies applied in forest management planning, forest regeneration, forest fire protection, determination and assessment of cutting areas and amounts, cutting, inspection of forest sections where forestry works are carried out. The acting legislation is very comprehensive and provides together with the technical rules a rather narrowly determined framework for the implementation of all elements of forestry on the ground. These detailed bylaws bear the risk of overregulation and may sometimes hinder adaptive management. Further country-specific findings are presented in the Regional Study section on this component. Component 1.3: Ownership and user right systems Ownership in the context of this Study concerns the ownership of land, on which the forest is located, of the forest and the user-rights related to both, and the ownership of the forestry enterprise. These objects can be owned or managed by different subjects. In most programme countries forests can be in central state ownership and the government assigns management and user rights to a state forestry enterprise or communal body. In some countries the local self- governance bodies (municipalities) can be owners of forests. Ownership can have limits in terms of actual rights of the owners. In the programme countries state or communal owned forests and the lands, on which they grow, cannot be sold or privatized. Transfer of state owned forest into communal ownership is hardly possible. Limits of ownership rights also concern the opportunity to transform forests into other forms of land and vice versa, which are both legally restricted. Even the harvest of trees on privately owned lands and in forest stands established by the landowner can be substantially restricted. Permanent land-use right is a concept inherited from the Soviet Union and still widely applied in the programme countries. Usually forests managed by state forestry enterprises are under permanent land-use rights by these entities. These entities are formally not the owner of these lands and forests, and are accordingly not allowed to sell them. All other rights and obligations can be similar to those of an owner, with certain restrictions and some decision making authority kept at higher levels in the state forest administration and/or the different levels of territorial administrations. xvi Temporary user rights can be assigned for several years as concession or lease. They are usually restricted in terms of allowable resource use. The same forest area can be assigned to different users at the same time for different purposes. Belarus, Georgia, and Russia assign concessions or leases for logging for timber, while other countries allow leases only for non-extractive use. Access of citizens to forests outside of protected areas and the collection of NWFP for personal use do not require any permit and can sometimes even not be restricted by leaseholders. The harvest for commercial purposes requires permits, but individual households collecting for small-scale sale \u2013 the majority of NWFP users \u2013 are in the practice usually not required to obtain permits. The resulting open-access situation has caused concerns about overuse in heavily frequented areas. Access to timber is comparably restricted.

In none of the programme countries individuals are permitted to harvest timber for commercial use, but are forced to buy it from forestry enterprises, via auctions or otherwise on the free market. Harvest of timber for personal needs is either very restricted or prohibited. With the exception of Moldova and Ukraine, local households can obtain permits to collect standing or lying wood as fuel wood. Amounts of fuel wood per household can be limited and access can be restricted to local villages only. The ownership and/or user rights on forest resources on forest fund lands are more or less defined. Unresolved issues concern the \u201cforests of local importance\u201d in Georgia, which have not yet been handed over from the National Forestry Agency to the municipalities. The ownership of tree and shrub vegetation on lands not belonging to the forest fund is in many cases less clear. Although the land owner might be recognized, his rights to use the trees on his land might not be well defined or even be formally restricted, presenting disincentives to afforestation and sustainable forest management and can even encourage illegal clearing.

These regulations limit the interest in leasing of forests for forest rehabilitation and sustainable us of forest products. Further country-specific findings are presented in the Regional Study section on this component. Component 1.4: Mandates of forestry organizations and territorial decision making bodies and administrations The programme countries have either a forestry agency under or within a ministry or directly under the government, in Belarus a specialized ministry. The mandates of these national level forestry agencies include the development of policies and legislation, regulation, planning, supervision and control of forest management. Forest management can be carried out by branches of the national level forestry agency, by subordinated state forestry enterprises, municipalities and \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises and/or leaseholders/concessionaires. The forestry enterprises or branches of national agencies usually consist of local forestry units, which either are in charge of all silvicultural and harvest activities or they control their implementation by contractors, concessionaires, leaseholders and/or other forest users. The forestry enterprises have also law enforcement and forest protection mandates. Forestry organizations at region level exist in most countries, either with substantial mandates or fulfilling intermediary administrative functions. Forest inventory and management planning are in the mandate of the national level forestry agencies, which have either an internal specialized department or a subordinated organization. Ministries in charge of environmental protection or independent State Inspections can have mandates related to the control of the forest sector as well as direct forest protection and law enforcement mandates. The mandate of district authorities in most programme countries is limited and includes participation in the development and implementation of forest related programmes and activities. Only in Belarus the district authorities have a substantial mandate providing a formal basis for their participation in decision making on local forests. The communal authorities have very limited mandates, except of municipalities in Georgia and Moldova owning or managing forests. The mandates related to local forests of national forest agencies and their subordinated forestry enterprises are in most cases clear and mutually supportive. Where local forests are in communal ownership, the mandates of the national forestry agencies may interfere with the mandates of the communal owners/managers. The separation of different mandates between agencies and organizations is a common principle of administrative and economic reform, expected to reduce the risks of mismanagement, overuse of forest resources and corruption. Such division of mandates has proven efficient in some cases. Too much division of mandates can have unintended negative consequences due to the separation of inextricably connected elements of forestry and the removal of incentives for sustainable forest management. So far only in Moldova the local municipalities keep the mandates related to local forests. In Georgia local forests are neither defined nor transferred to the municipalities and the respective mandates are kept by the central level forestry agency NFA. In Belarus mandates are divided between the xix various levels of the forestry agencies and the district authorities. This assignment of mandates in the practice leads to sustainable forest management, satisfaction of the needs of local people and opportunities for local authorities to participate in decision making. In Ukraine the mandates on \u201ccommunal\u201d forests are with the forestry enterprises at region and district level and with the region state forest administrations, but not with the local level.

The state forestry enterprises are subordinated to the respective region units of the Ministry of Forestry and at the same time to the local district administrations. State forestry enterprises have the mandate to manage the forests that are assigned to them for permanent use. The mandates of forest protection and of control of forest use and management are assigned to the Ministry of Forestry and its subordinated structures. The state forestry enterprises fulfil the role of control and oversight in relation to their forestry units and to other forest users. Stakeholders and experts have criticized the combination of functions of state control and forest use within one organization as potentially leading to abuse and unauthorized harvest of forest resources. However, the State Inspection for the Protection of Animal and Plant World under the President has a strong independent mandate of control of all activities of the state forestry enterprises and of any other forest users to prevent and prosecute of any illegal harvest of forest products. Despite the proven high effectiveness of this existing independent inspection in preventing illegal forest use, policy makers now consider changes in the structure and mandate of forestry organizations. By establishing separate units for timber harvest and processing, these functions would be separated from silvicultural activities of state forestry enterprises and from their control functions. Such a separation would disconnect the links between harvest and forest management or between profitable and costly operations. This can have unintended negative consequences due to the separation of genuinely connected functions and the removal of incentives for sustainable forest management and ecosystem friendly harvest practices. In the result it may lead to a higher dominance of clear cuts, more even aged forests, less natural rejuvenation and a more industrial forest structure as well as the reduction of material benefits for local people and districts. Further, xxi such systems can create additional opportunities for corruption and not transparent assignment of use contracts. Further country-specific findings are presented in the Regional Study section on this component. Component 1.5: Financial arrangements, economic instruments and benefit sharing In all programme countries state forestry organizations from the national level through the sub- national level to the local state forestry enterprises and forestry units receive in varying extent state budget funding. This is often complemented by incomes from forestry activities, mainly from various fees paid by users for the use of forest resources and from the sale of forest products by the state forestry enterprises. Stakeholders in all programme countries, except in Belarus, consider the budget available for the forest sector as insufficient. In several programme countries the official policy is to make the forestry sector economically efficient and to reduce subsidies. State forestry enterprises are legal entities and create own incomes. These enterprises can be largely self-financing if they manage productive forests and are able to sell forest products, which are in demand at the market. But also state forestry enterprises with highly productive forests can receive substantial transfers from the state budget. The state forestry enterprises pay taxes and provide contributions to the higher level forestry agencies.

Restrictions on forest resource use can negatively affect the financial situation of the state forestry enterprises. The fees for the use of forest resources and services seem to be largely adequate. Many state forestry enterprises do not collect fees or have to transfer these revenues to other bodies. Fees for concessions and leases include larger one-time payments to central budgets while annual lower payments can be allocated to local budgets or the forestry enterprises themselves. Stumpage fees for cutting of fuel wood and timber can be shared between the state forestry enterprises and public budgets or between local and national budgets. Use of NWFP for personal use, and in the practice also small scale commercial collection, are possible without payment of fees. Local budgets benefit from forestry through lease fees, stumpage fees and locally payable taxes. These contributions to local budgets can be lower than the costs imposed on these budgets by the forest use, e.g. due to the destruction of roads by the transport of logged timber. Local people benefit from forests materially in various ways. Employment in the state forestry enterprises can be substantial for rural areas with limited employment opportunities. The level of employment varies, with state forestry enterprises in Belarus having several hundred employees per district and the forestry sector in Georgia and Russia having experienced severe cuts of stuff to few dozen employees per former state forestry enterprise. Commercial concessions often employ workers from outside of the local villages and process the harvested wood centrally. The forest dependency studies of ENPI-FLEG II and the Case Studies showed that local people can in different extent depend on the subsistence and commercial use of forest products. NWFP are the dominating source of income from forest products because fuel wood and timber can rarely be legally harvested and sold. Access to \u2013 compared to market prices \u2013 cheaper fuel wood and timber provides additional benefits to rural households. Local forests managed by \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises or municipalities can provide fuel wood to local households and social objects at cheaper prices than the state forestry enterprises. Representatives of municipalities in Georgia expect improved satisfaction of the local population\u2019s needs in fuel wood and timber from the take- over of local forests. The access of forest dependent communities to forest products and related benefits are severely affected where large scale lease or concessions are assigned to external xxii companies, especially in areas in the vicinity of villages. Where the local forests are integrated in the state forest fund, the financial arrangements in relation to local forests are the same as for any other state forest. Where local forests are managed by separate institutions, financial transfers from the national state budgets are not available for the management of these local forests. If at all, the management of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forests is only supported from the local or region budget. Further \u2013 compared to the state forests \u2013 poorer forest conditions allow for less harvest of lower quality, while the management of the smaller and more fragmented forest sections causes higher costs. In the result, the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises are in a financially more difficult situation than the state forestry enterprises in the same regions. Table viii.

All countries fuel wood, timber more restricted; Complicated procedures for access in Georgia and Russia due to concession and leases. Important factor reducing costs; in some cases income source; insufficient legal access connected to illegal use. Case v: Armenia \u2013 Fixed prices, supply-demand misbalance and loss of income for forestry The national forestry organization Hayantar is financed from the state budget (approx. 65-70%) and from income created by the sale of forest products (approx. 30-35%). The Armenian forestry sector suffers from large unaccounted illegal logging and an inflexible pricing xxiii system for fuel wood and wood products sold by the local branches of Hayantar. Prices at which wood is sold by the state forestry units to intermediaries are fixed without adjustment for inflation. They were still the same in 2011 as in 2004, and thus over this period they had effectively fallen by over 39%. The prices charged by intermediaries to end users are determined by the market and are much higher than these fixed prices. The difference between legal supply and estimated demand of fuel wood and timber suggest that unaccounted harvest over years several times exceeded the legal supply. The profit from this unaccounted harvest and from the difference between officially set prices and market prices is captured outside of the forest sector \u2013 one of the main reasons for the financial problems of Hayantar. Access to forest resources and to informal income is an important driver for those seeking employment in the sector, and for this reason personal connections and mutual informal benefits instead of skills influence the selection of staff. Attempts to assign management responsibility on local forests to communities were not successful due to the lack of economic viability. The allowable cut was too low to cover the costs of running communal forestry enterprises. Underlying reasons for the failure of pilot projects on community forest management might be complex and include inflexible requirements, insufficient economic incentives for the communities, possibly inadequate fees and even corruption. Further country-specific findings are presented in the Regional Study section on this component. Pillar 2: Planning and decision-making processes Component 2.1: Stakeholder participation The environmental and forestry legislation of all programme countries makes general provisions for stakeholder participation. At the national level government programmes, laws and bylaws before adoption undergo a consultation process involving ministries and sector agencies as well as scientific institutes and civil society organizations. Sometimes, their comments are not substantially taken into consideration if contradicting the interest of more powerful elites. At local level legislation in all programme countries provides for opportunities of local self- governance bodies, civil society organizations and citizens to participate in the development of forest related decisions. In the practice this participation is often not realized. Representatives of state forestry organizations tend to blame a lack of interest in participation by the local people. Civil society organizations and experts highlight the lack of procedures and mechanisms for participation as provisions in the legislation are only of declarative character. Even where formal mechanisms for participation and challenging of decisions are lacking, public opinion, media and civil society organizations can massively influence on the decision making in forestry, for instance negative public attitude towards cutting of trees. The consideration of the interests of stakeholders and, in particular of forest dependent communities, in decision making processes varies. The certification of forests in accordance to the requirements of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) there has substantially improved local participation. The extent of scientific debate relating to planning and decision making on (local) forests in the programme countries is limited, and largely facilitated by and depending on externally funded projects. Detailed technical regulations on forestry activities provide little opportunities for adaptive decision making and management and thus for the involvement of science. Table ix.

Ukraine Forest Code: right of civil society organizations to participate, access information; but no obligation of participation of other stakeholders. Partly insufficient awareness about participation rights among local people and communal bodies as well as forestry enterprises; increasing demand for information and participation; general improvement, in particular in the context of FSC certification. Case vi: Georgia \u2013 Forestry concessions and limits of participation The environmental legislation and the Forest Code require the provision of access to information and public participation in decision making and planning at any stage. The Forest Code requires public information and participation, for instance, especially on the assignment of long-term use rights on forests (concessions). In the practice these provisions have not entirely been realized. Civil society organizations have exposed the problems of insufficient transparency and public participation, among other issues, in the decisions on the allocation of concessions and have challenged concession allocations in administrative complains and court cases, based on wrong data in the documents, inadequate concession terms and lack of public and, in particular, local community participation. Although these claims were dismissed in lawsuits, finally several concessions were annulled and others were substantially modified. xxv Municipalities have insufficient access to information on concessions and lacked the opportunity to participate in the decision making when the concessions were assigned. Municipality organs had not been provided access to concession contracts and maps with accurate concession boundaries. At best municipalities have received very general information about the concession areas. No mechanisms are in place that would oblige concessionaires to share information or to allow the municipalities to influence on their work. It seems that in the context of the economic reforms the interests of perceived \u201cinvestors\u201d were rated higher than those of the local self-governance bodies. Further country-specific findings are presented in the Regional Study section on this component. Component 2.2: Planning and decision making on conversion of land from forest to non-forest and vice versa The systems of planning and decision making on conversion of land from forest to non-forest and vice versa are similar in all programme countries. The Land Codes establish different designations of land categories, forest(ry) lands being one of these. Their boundaries are defined by the land cadastre and the designation category, but not by the real vegetation. Forestry lands include as well lands that are temporarily or permanently not covered by forests but are needed for forestry. The Land Codes also have the designation category Lands of Protected Areas that can include forests within PA. Forests or other \u201ctree and shrub vegetation\u201d can also be located on lands of other designation, like agricultural lands, infrastructure, water and urban lands. Local forests are often located on lands of agricultural designation. As long as the designation of these lands is not changed to forestry, problems can arise that hinder the sustainable management of such forests. In some countries their legal use is hardly possible, what discourages the protection and development of forest vegetation on such lands. State land use agencies are in charge of the delimitation of lands by land designation category. Changes of the designation category of lands are generally possible. The procedures vary between the countries and depend on the land categories. Conversion of forestry lands into other lands is formally difficult, but has been misused for privatization where forestry lands cannot be privatized. The change of the land designation category from agricultural to forestry is necessary for the inclusion into forests of afforestation sites and succession areas on abandoned agricultural lands. This change can be challenging because the land legislation considers agricultural lands as \u201chigher value\u201d category than forestry lands. Given the often cumbersome procedures, but also insufficient enforcement of the rules on changes of land designation categories, in the practice changes of the real land cover and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c8c5a09-0d7c-486b-ab1f-592cf9772890": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c8c5a09-0d7c-486b-ab1f-592cf9772890", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37e7e3b31a9d5d5d8e5c1cf9b99eefdbc754d8fa7aa3ce05fd47562fcb514c35"}}, "hash": "37e7e3b31a9d5d5d8e5c1cf9b99eefdbc754d8fa7aa3ce05fd47562fcb514c35", "text": "land-use often happen without formal conversion of the land.

Moldova Agency for Land Relations and Cadastre: Land mapping and assignment to categories; Local public authority: changes of agricultural to forest; Government: allocation of forest land for state and public needs. Afforestation only where low fertility or erosion. Russia Federal Government: Changes of category of forest land; Sub-national bodies: all lands in their responsibility, incl. forest on other than forest lands. Land designation of former kolkhoz forests unclear, inclusion in forest lands would cause transfer of ownership to federal level; Conversion of forests for development common. Ukraine Cabinet of Ministers: conversion of forest land into lands of other designation; Territorial Administration of Land Relations at region level: change of designation from agriculture to forest. Changes of land categories difficult and lengthy; conversion of forests also takes place illegally; Abandoned agricultural lands with forests remain in this category, but clearing prohibited, change of designation to forest only after declared \u201cdegraded\u201d. Case vii: Ukraine \u2013 Succession on abandoned lands and the difficult transfer into forest land The delimitation of lands by categories, including lands of agricultural designation and lands for forestry, is done in the frame of the land-use planning. The State Land Agency is in charge of the mapping of the land categories. Rural councils, with participation of district forestry enterprises, prepare general plans (land-use) for their areas that are confirmed by the region councils. After the land privatization large areas of agricultural lands were abandoned. These are lands either of low fertility and/or lands where ownership of specific plots was not defined after the privatization of kolkhoz shares. Abandoned agricultural lands with naturally developing forests remain in the category of agricultural designation. At the same time it is formally prohibited to clear this land from the forest grown there. Uncertainties about land ownership of such lands, reclamation of such lands by owners of shares of former kolkhozes and complicated procedures for changing land designation and possession hinder this process. The land-use agency needs to declare agricultural land as \u201cdegraded\u201d before its designation can be changed to forest by the Territorial Administration of Land Relations at region level. This situation leads to losses of newly developed forests in the course of reclamation of agricultural lands. These stands are further affected by unregulated cutting of wood and by wildfires caused by the burning of crop remnants and dry vegetation on adjacent agricultural lands. Further country specific findings are presented in the Regional Study section on this component. Component 2.3: Decisions on forest inventory and management planning The Forest Codes of all programme countries establish the forest inventory and management planning (FMP) as a mandatory requirement. But where updated FMP are not available, forest use is usually not brought on hold, and the forestry agencies would issue special permissions to carry on with forest use activities, based on outdated FMP or without reference to any FMP. The FMP xxvii activities can be carried out by specialized enterprises under the national forestry agency, which have a monopoly on these works. In Georgia and Russia services are contracted to service providers. In Armenia and Azerbaijan the FMP are supposed to be elaborated by units under ministries. The FMP teams consult local foresters only in an initial meeting but do their work independently. The inventory findings and the proposed management plan are presented to the local foresters, but no approval of the FMP by the local forestry enterprise is required. In all programme countries the legislation on forest inventories and management planning requires stakeholder participation. These requirements are met by one or several meetings at national, regional and/or local levels.

The focus of the FMP is on the determination of harvest; other silvicultural aspects play a secondary role, if any. Most FMP weakly consider and address the interests of local people and other forest users and of the local self- governance bodies as well as conservation needs. Table xi. Key country specific issues related to forest inventory and management planning COUNTRY ORGANIZATION CARRYING OUT FMP KEY ISSUES OF FMP Armenia Hayantar (formerly Forest Research and Experimental Centre under the Bio- resources Management Agency of the Ministry of Nature Protection. FMP reference was for a long time 1991, but before 2011 in some areas updated; results of forest coverage assessment not publicly available. Azerbaijan Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources; FMP team planned to be reinstalled. FMP do not cover tree and shrub vegetation outside of the forest fund. Belarus State enterprise \u201cBELGOSLES\u201d under the Ministry of Forestry; mandatory state environmental expertise and approval by the Ministry of Forestry. FMP available for all state forestry enterprises, updated in 10 years intervals; predetermined rules of forest management leave limited space for silvicultural decision making in the FMP. Georgia Private service providers based on ToR set by the Forest Inventory Department of the NFA; FMP approved by the MENRP. Many forest areas are used that do not have updated FMP; FMP instructions not sufficiently considering modern approaches, local participation not required; FMP formally accessible for communal bodies, but in practice rarely accessed. Moldova \u201cICAS\u201d (Forest Research and Management Institute) under the Agency Moldsilva. FMP in state forests up-to-date; FMP in communal forests only with external funding and partly not timely updated; FMP more oriented on harvest amounts than on silvicultural targets. xxviii Russia FMP includes at least three different documents; FMP in narrow sense elaborated by service provider and approved by Rosleskhoz or by land owner (communal), forest development projects by permanent forest user or leaseholder. Since new Forest Code (2006) FMP system abolished; FMP in narrow sense largely outdated, many former kolkhoz forests no FMP available; FMP for forest on agricultural lands not mandatory; reconstruction of FMP system necessary for sustainable forest management. Ukraine State enterprise \u201cUkrderzhlisproekt\u201d under the State Forest Resources Agency. FMP obligatory, exist for most \u201ccommunal\u201d forests some outdated, no areas outside forest fund covered; focus on harvest amounts, no binding silvicultural objectives; district level more stakeholder participation in FMP for state forest than for \u201ccommunal\u201d forest. Case viii: Moldova \u2013 Forest inventory and management planning in communal forests Forest inventory and management planning (FMP) are mandatory for the entire forest fund regardless of the ownership. All FMP is done by a specialized state organization. While the general methodology is the same for all forests, some simplification has been introduced for the communal forests. The FMP in the state forests is financed by the forest enterprises themselves from their income. The costs of FMP of communal forests are supposed to be funded by the municipality budgets, but these activities in communal forests are funded largely by international projects. Since 2005 forest inventory and management planning of more than 20,000 ha of communal forests were updated, but the larger part of communal forests does not have up-to-date inventories and management plans, while the state forest is entirely covered by up-to-date FMP. The focus in the FMP is more on allowable harvest, and less on the determination of stand specific silvicultural options, definition of development targets, activities and related costs and benefits. The procedure for forest inventory and management planning provides limited opportunity for local stakeholder involvement and for the consideration of needs and capacity at the local level. Where recently FMP of communal forests were elaborated with external project support municipality staff and, where available, local forestry employees as well as interested local inhabitants were involved in the process.

In all programme countries the decision making on harvest is based on the determination of annual allowable cuts (AAC) or at least takes them into consideration. The AAC should be determined in the frame of the FMP for each forestry unit, based on the wood volumes and increments and on the silvicultural development targets for each forest parcel. For planning and reporting purposes these site specific AAC are aggregated to forestry enterprises\u2019, regions\u2019 and country-wide AAC. The xxix determination of AAC can be influenced by political decisions and may not reflect the harvest potential and needs of the local forestry units and forestry enterprises. Most forestry enterprises and leaseholders or concessionaires determine the specific cutting areas and the harvested volumes by themselves. In some programme countries higher level forestry agencies and environmental inspections are formally involved in the approval of wood harvest. The implementation of forestry activities outside of lease or concession areas is done either by workers of the forestry enterprises or by private service providers. The selection of service providers either follows strict tender procedures or can be based on personal connections. Forestry enterprises do hire seasonal workers, possibly informally and with in-kind payments. Leaseholders and concessionaires implement forestry activities with own workforce or with contractors. This can lead to dwindling local employment in forestry. Table xii.

Annual Allowable Cuts much below the harvest potential and demand; high level of unaccounted wood harvest. Azerbaijan Forestry Department of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources; outside of the forest fund: environmental protection authorities of region and district. Only sanitary cutting; outside of the forest fund maintenance activities not permitted, despite legally possible according to Forest Code, but without FMP formal precondition missing. Belarus Local AAC for main use approved by the Ministry of Forestry in agreement with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection; resulting country-wide AAC approved by Government; other decisions by state forestry enterprises and forestry units. Forest maintenance and reforestation decided and implemented by forestry units in accordance to FMP; decision making process on harvest criticized as being potentially prone to abuse, but existing mechanisms ensure effective control and enforcement. Georgia NFA in charge of most decisions, approval of local foresters\u2019 determination of harvest by local people; in Protected Areas decisions require approval by MENRP. Except wood harvest most silvicultural activities on hold; rarely interference of NFA into decisions by concessionaires on harvest activities; Code on Local Self-government provides the municipalities with exclusive authority over forests of local importance, national forestry authorities would stake in decision making, so far only in Tbilisi.

Decisions on forest lease are made by the region council, with agreement by the rural councils or the district councils, the region forestry enterprise and the region state forestry department. The use of NWFP for personal use, and in the practice as well for small-scale commercial purposes, does not require any permits and no formal decisions are made on such forest uses. Further country-specific findings are presented in the Regional Study section on this component. Pillar 3: Implementation, enforcement and compliance Component 3.1: Capacity of forestry organizations and territorial decision making bodies and administrations In all programme countries the capacity of the forest sector has suffered during the transition period. Low salaries caused the loss of experienced staff and reduced the attraction for young, qualified people. The capacity situation varies between the programme countries. The capacity of the national level forestry agencies in Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine is well developed. They are directly involved in the use of forests and accordingly create income from the use of forests. In these countries sufficient harvestable forest resources are available to support the state forestry agencies financially. In Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Russia the capacity of the national level and region level forestry agencies has substantially declined and is now assessed by most experts as insufficient. In Armenia financial shortage is caused by low state budget funding, limited harvest potential and insufficient income from wood harvest. In Azerbaijan among the reasons are a transfixed inherited system and the exclusively protectionist approach, which does not allow for sustainable and multifunctional forestry. In Georgia and Russia in the course of reforms and the delegation of key functions to private companies capacities of national forestry agencies have been xxxi cut down in terms of financial resources, staff and other capacity. The capacity of the local level state forestry organizations largely reflects the situation in the national and region level forestry agencies of the respective countries. For instance, in Belarus state forestry enterprises have large capacity in form of qualified and skilled staff, necessary infrastructure, equipment and technology. In Moldova and Ukraine the state enterprises also have sufficient capacity. In Azerbaijan the state forestry enterprises still exist, but entirely depending on the state budget funding they cannot attract qualified staff. Armenia\u2019s former state forestry enterprises became branches of Hayantar and suffer from the same insufficient financial situation and capacity. The low salaries hardly attract qualified and motivated staff, while substantial informal incomes from unaccounted wood harvest cause recruitment being influenced by connections and informal economic abilities. Georgia and Russia have replaced state forestry enterprises with forestry units of the national or region state forestry agencies. These structures are have minimal staff allocated and lack any capacity for effective forest management and protection. Belarus as well as Moldova and Ukraine have sufficient capacity for forest inventory and management planning in form of specialized organizations with qualified staff, suitable premises, modern technology, equipment and some economic freedom. In Armenia and Azerbaijan limited FMP capacity exists in the national forestry agencies. In Georgia and Russia the inventory and planning works are no longer a state monopoly but are contracted to the private sector, where capacity is developing. In FMP organizations of all programme countries human capacity is not sufficient for involving stakeholders in a participatory way to address their interests in the FMP and also for applying modern silvicultural approaches. These insufficiencies are largely caused by the prevalence of old, narrowly production oriented approaches in the forest sector. The national and regional forest agencies and their local branches or forestry enterprises have not always enough skilled experts to define the FMP tasks, to guide these works and to evaluate and use the results. The \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises in Ukraine have staff, premises and equipment, although they are short of qualified staff and experience economic difficulties caused by their \u2013 in comparison to state forests \u2013 smaller, more fragmented and less productive forests. The capacity of Moldova\u2019s municipalities to manage their communal forests mainly depends on the forest\u2019s productive potential and on the prehistory of community management and support.

The municipality of Akhmeta, which manages the forests in Tusheti Protected Landscape, is in the process of developing capacity and already employs qualified staff and has purchased equipment. The MENRP and NFA of Georgia consider the development of sufficient capacity in the municipalities as a precondition for the handover of responsibility on forests of local importance to them, but currently their local forestry units also lack sufficient forest management capacity. In Belarus the district councils have mandates on the forests within their boundaries, but do not have the technical capacity. They rely on the capacity of local state forestry enterprises for the preparation of their decisions on forest related issues. Table xiii. Overview of capacity of forestry organizations FORESTRY ORGANIZATIONS COUNTRIES CAPACITY ASSESSMENT KEY REASONS/ISSUES National level agencies Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine High capacity National budget support (Belarus), high productive potential of forests used for income generation. Armenia, Azerbaijan Low capacity National budget support insufficient, politically limited use of productive potential of forests, substantial informal capture of income. xxxii Georgia, Russia Low capacity Reforms oriented towards delegation of functions to regions (Russia) and private sector (both countries). FMP organization Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine High capacity with limitations on participation State enterprises with economic opportunities, forestry enterprises pay; Production oriented approaches with limited consideration of local interests. Armenia, Azerbaijan Limited capacity Units within state forestry agencies with limited funding, poor connection of FMP with productive forest use.

State forestry enterprises/local forestry units Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine High capacity Same as national level. Armenia, Azerbaijan Low capacity Same as national level. Georgia, Russia Low capacity Local forestry units of national and region forestry agencies and regions (Russia) without or with limited funding and without substantial own income generation from forest use because of large-scale private management (lease, concessions). Communal forestry enterprises Ukraine Medium capacity No state budget and limited region budget support, lower income, compared to state forestry because of less productive and smaller stands; region forestry enterprises can develop some capacity due to economy of scale. Moldova Not yet existing Developing joint enterprises of several municipalities or multifunctional enterprises expected to allow for capacity development. Local self- governance bodies Belarus Low capacity No specialized staff in district bodies, collaboration with state forestry enterprises in fulfilment of local mandates seems effective. Georgia Low capacity Municipalities not yet in charge of local forests, except Tbilisi and Tusheti; Tbilisi - political and financial considerations; Tusheti \u2013 capacity under development. Moldova Low to high capacity No external budget support, limited financial opportunities of municipalities, capacity depending on productive potential of forests and commitment by local community \u2013 linked to history of forests. xxxiii Ukraine Low capacity Rural and district councils with limited mandate, region councils delegate most mandates to \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises, only limited oversight considered necessary. Case x: Moldova \u2013 Forest conditions and history determine capacity of municipalities The capacity of most municipalities to manage their forests is low. A municipality with four forestry staff employed and seasonal labour to manage its communal forests is rather an exception among the forest owning municipalities in Moldova. The conditions of the forests in communal ownership are a key factor determining capacity for their management. Communes with productive forests are able to employ forestry staff, and forest products motivate community support. Most communal forests are of low area size and the majority of communal forests consist of artificial forest plantations of low productivity. Thus, the incomes from their use are too small for financing an own forest management unit and local households receive limited benefits from the forest. Some municipalities for creating the needed capacity plan establishing a joint forestry enterprise of several municipalities or consider the establishment of communal enterprises for integrating forest management with other communal tasks. The history of the forest governance impacts on the general ownership felt by the community members in the studied municipalities. In municipalities, where the community has been the owner of the forests already since pre-Soviet times, ownership attitude and related informal mechanisms have continued throughout the Soviet and the transitional period. In the result these communities support the development of the forest and prevent illegal use. In areas where nowadays communal forests have been established during kolkhoz land ownership as artificial plantations community members did not develop ownership sense of their communal forests.

The law enforcement by the state forestry authorities can be complemented by state environmental inspections that can also be authorized to implement law enforcement in regard to the state forestry enterprises. In Ukraine the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises have only limited law enforcement authority and therefore have to rely on the State Environmental Inspection. Forest users rely on assistance by authorized state organs in case of encounter of illegal use by third parties. Where users are supposed to protect their forests against illegal use (Georgia, Russia) this protection is insufficient for replacing the law enforcement state forest protection staff. Where local communities develop a sense of ownership of local forests they can actively contribute to law enforcement. Joint public and state monitoring of illegal forest use can force the agencies in charge of law enforcement to persecute more effectively illegal and unaccounted tree cutting. Administrative fines can either be issued by the authorized state forestry staff or by the state environmental inspections. Criminal punishment is issued by courts based on the criminal code of the respective country. Legislation normally distinguishes between the penalty for legal violation and xxxiv the compensation of damage, which is established in the environmental legislation. Law enforcement effectiveness varies between the programme countries and is very high in Belarus, while in Armenia and Moldova unaccounted and illegal harvests make up a high proportion of all cuts. Similarly, in Ukraine unaccounted wood harvest under the disguise of legal harvest happens. Also in Russia law enforcement is of limited effectiveness and large quantities of timber are illegally harvested and largely exported. In Georgia large scale illegal or unaccounted logging does not seem to be an issue. Restrictions on regular cutting of trees can encourage forest users, e.g. in Azerbaijan, to deliberately damage trees for justifying of sanitary cuts. Table xiv. Overview of law enforcement issues in the programme countries COUNTRY MAIN ORGANIZATIONS IN CHARGE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT KEY ISSUES Armenia Forest Control Division of State Environmental Inspection controls forestry enterprises and PA; Hayantar. Substantial illegal and unauthorized harvest (up to 85% of consumed wood), recently established involvement of civil society improved law enforcement. Azerbaijan State Forestry Enterprises; District Departments of ecology (outside of the forest fund). Restrictions on legal harvest and permission of sanitary cuts encourage deliberate damage of trees. Belarus State Forest Protection \u2013 rangers of all levels of forestry organizations; State Inspection under the President controls also forestry enterprises. Very high law enforcement effectiveness, but some cases of overreaching by State inspection under the President on minor violations by forestry workers. Georgia Local forestry units of region forestry services of NFA; concessionaires; Environmental Supervision Department of the MENRP; APA; municipalities in communal forests (Tbilisi \u2013 no staff, Akhmeta/Tusheti \u2013 local forest rangers). Limited illegal harvest of fuel wood; concessionaires of limited law enforcement effectiveness and causing alienation of local communities; Tusheti \u2013 communal law enforcement effective; potential of social control in communal forests after handover to municipalities. Moldova Moldsilva; State Ecological Inspection of the Ministry of Environment controls also forestry enterprises; communal forest owners. Unaccounted harvest substantial; violations of rules of lease common; municipalities - usually weak enforcement, few communities with sense of ownership effectively protect communal forests. Russia Region forestry authorities, forestry units, private leaseholders. Weak legal basis in Forest Code; federal forest protection abolished and insufficiently replaced by regional and private protection; large scale illegal harvest and export. Ukraine State forestry enterprises, State Environmental Inspection. \u201cCommunal\u201d forestry enterprises rely on State Environmental Inspection; decrease of violations in \u201ccommunal\u201d forests because of consolidated user-rights and collaboration. Case xi: Belarus \u2013 Effective law enforcement and the risks of overreaching The prevention of violations and enforcement of the forest legislation is the task of the State Forest Protection which is formed by the rangers and technical staff of all state forestry organizations, including the state forestry enterprises, the six region state production forestry associations and the xxxv Ministry of Forestry. About 13,000 official persons are patrolling the forest areas. An additional and important law enforcement agency is the State Inspection for the Protection of the Plant and Animal World under the President with its local branches, which carries out independent law enforcement and controls the forest users, including the state forestry enterprises.

The level of documented illegal harvest of timber and its impact on the country\u2019s forests must now be considered as insignificant. The number of detected violations is an (at least unofficial) indicator of the effectiveness of the State Inspection. With the success of the law enforcement the inspections cannot meet the expectations of constant or increasing numbers of detected violations. Probably for this reason, the inspection service tends to apply rules in an overly rigid and inappropriate way and tightens the control of the activities of the state forestry enterprises. Even minor technical aberrations from plans and permits are now considered as violations and lead to fines and the imposing of very high compensation payments on the involved workers. State forestry enterprises increasingly face difficulties to attract workers, as people consider the danger high to be heavily fined. Further country-specific findings are presented in the Regional Study section on this component. Component 3.3 Administration of forest and land ownership and user rights The land-use agencies keep the documentation of land-use designations, ownership and permanent land-use rights. Land-use maps are accessible for the public and any stakeholders. These are in most cases still on paper and present simple schemes without topographic reference. Electronic, GIS-based maps in some countries cover the designated forest areas, including forests of \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises and municipalities. The forest enterprises and forestry units have these maps on paper, and where the technical capacity exists they are also electronically available. Reportedly in all programme countries boundaries of lands of state forestry enterprises and forestry units are well documented and ownership or permanent user rights are certified. The ownership and user rights of Moldova\u2019s municipalities on their communal forests are well documented. In Georgia so far the \u201cforests of local importance\u201d that would fall under management and/or ownership of the municipality are not defined. Documentation of former kolkhoz forests is partly outdated and does not cover all \u201cforests of local importance\u201d. In Ukraine the documentation of ownership and permanent user-rights on many \u201ccommunal\u201d forests is still in process. Boundaries of forest sections and their protection and exploitation categories are documented in the FMP and form the basis for the assignment of user rights. Temporary user rights like leases, concessions, contracts of sale of standing stock and area based permits are documented by the forestry agencies, forestry enterprises and/or public administrations. The comprehensiveness and accuracy of these documentations varies and information is not always accessible for stakeholders. Ownership rights on agricultural lands that have been distributed between members of former collective farms are not in all cases properly documented. Where these lands were of low value they were abandoned for decades and forest developed there naturally. The unresolved ownership documentation prevented reclamation of the land by the owner, but also possible changes of the land designation category to forest. xxxvi Table xv. Overview of issues of the administration of land and forest ownership rights COUNTRY KEY ISSUES Belarus Documentation in process of being updated, registration renewed and new certificates issued. Georgia Documentation largely outdated and incomplete; need to re-identify all forest borders, in particular of former kolkhoz forests and other forests of local importance; documentation of concession boundaries not available to municipalities.

Further country-specific findings are presented in the Regional Study section on this component. Component 3.4 Cooperation and coordination Coordination and cooperation on local forest-related activities are necessary between national forest agencies, forest enterprises and local administrations. Further, other government agencies coordinate and cooperate on local forests with forest agencies and local administrations. Law enforcement organs and environmental protection and protected areas agencies cooperate with forestry organizations. Cooperation and coordination can be required by formal procedures, where subordinations between organizations or decision making mechanisms force them to cooperate. Also informal cooperation takes place, often depending on the personal initiative of involved agencies\u2019 staff and other stakeholders. Within the system of state forestry the coordination between national level forestry agencies, their region branches and local state forestry enterprises or local branch offices is determined by internal regulations and procedures. The cooperation and coordination of forestry agencies of different levels with region administrations is formalized where reporting requirements and subordination exist. Where the local forestry enterprises and region offices of the forestry agency are only reporting to their central national level head office, their cooperation and coordination with region and local bodies depend more on the individual initiative of the officials involved. xxxvii Cooperation and coordination of state forestry agencies with forest managing municipalities or with \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises are usually determined by the formal regulations and procedures in place, but also depend on personal initiative. Where state forestry agencies have to be involved in decision making procedures cooperation and coordination are required. Without such formal requirements cooperation between communal forest managers and state forestry agencies is limited and depends on personal initiative. Cooperation and collaboration between forestry enterprises and local administrations and self- governance bodies vary between the countries. Most forestry enterprises \u2013 independent of their ownership type \u2013 have limited coordination with rural councils. Coordination and cooperation is reportedly better where forestry enterprises underwent FSC Certification, which requires at least some coordination. Intensive cooperation only takes place where region or district bodies have some decision making mandates on the forests and their management. Table xvi.

The cooperation and coordination of \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises with the rural councils seem to be insufficiently developed, mainly because of the subordination of all forestry enterprises to a higher administrative level and because of the lack of formal mechanisms of cooperation and coordination of the forestry enterprises with the rural councils. In this situation the determining factor of cooperation and communication is the relationship between the individual heads and staff of the rural councils and of the local district forestry enterprises. Further country-specific findings are presented in the Regional Study section on this component. Component 3.5 Measures to address corruption and ensure transparency The measures to address corruption and ensure transparency are part of the programme countries\u2019 general anti-corruption policy, legislation and action. Rarely anti-corruption is specifically targeted in the forest sector and more specifically in the context of local forests. The general situation in terms of corruption and transparency varies between the programme countries. The scores and rankings of the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) by Transparency International for 2014 were: Georgia \u2013 Scores 52, Rank 50/175; Armenia \u2013 37, 94/175; Moldova \u2013 35, 103/175; Belarus \u2013 31, 119/175; Azerbaijan \u2013 29, 126/175; Russia \u2013 27, 136/175; Ukraine \u2013 26, 142/175. This ranking differs from the Consultant\u2019s impressions by assigning better ranks to Armenia and Moldova and a less favourite rank to Belarus than suggested by his observations. The CPI is an important indicator used in the FSC Controlled Wood system and in the PEFC chain of custody requirements for avoiding controversial sources. These certifications do not provide information on the effectiveness of anti- corruption measures in the certified forestry enterprises. xxxix In the forest sector the existence, effectiveness and independence of governmental oversight mechanisms external to the forest agencies as reflected in their mandates (Component 1.4) can influence on corruption and transparency. Independent oversight is in place in some programme countries in form of the mandate to control the compliance of the forest sector with the legislation being assigned to the ministries in charge of environmental protection and their state environmental inspections. In all programme countries the forest sector is additionally subject to control by the state agencies that control compliance with public procurement rules, public spending and taxes. Concentration within one system or agency of planning, implementation and control and law enforcement increases the risks of manipulation, unsustainable and illegal use tend compared to where these mandates are separated. However, corrupt systems can also evolve across agencies and having more actors involved may not necessarily prevent corrupt practices. Independent oversight can contribute to the reduction of corruption and ensure more transparency, but overly strict separation of functions can also cause risks. The forestry operations on the ground should be controlled by an inspection service that is organizationally and economically not connected to the forestry enterprises. In some of the programme countries, policy makers consider separating the functions of state forestry enterprises in forest regeneration and maintenance from harvest and initial wood processing. Systems that address this through the sale of standing timber, temporary lease for logging and concessions create additional opportunities for corruption and not transparent assignment of use contracts. Further, they disconnect the links between profitable harvest and costly forest management, thus creating disincentives for sustainable forest management. In some programme countries a massive discrepancy between supply of wood and market demand suggests illegal logging in a substantial scale. In such situations it is very likely that first, forestry enterprises and their contractors are directly involved in unaccounted logging, and second, that recruitment into key positions is influenced by corruption and does not comply with transparency requirements. Procurement rules can also increase costs of operations and hamper the use of local workforce and small enterprises, while at the same time increasing the costs for the public. Local forests might be less under risk of corrupt practices because of lower attractiveness for larger logging operations and the possibility of public control by local people, where these identify themselves as forest owners. On the other hand, local people, depending on fuel wood and timber, might be forced to pay informally to local forestry staff for getting access to these resources. Harvest quotas for local people reduce this corruption risk if they are issued in a simple procedure. Table xvii.

Legal access to fallen dead wood for local villagers; joint monitoring of forest use by State Forest Monitoring Centre, Hayantar, civil society and citizens. Belarus Formerly poaching by influential people, illegal logging; combination of planning, silvicultural activities, permitting and wood production in one organization has been criticized. Tight control by State Inspection under the President; legal access to wood for local people; intended separation of silvicultural functions from production functions - possibly unintended impacts. Georgia Generally effective ant-corruption policy; assignments of concessions in the past not entirely transparent. Phasing out of concessions, no new assignments. xl Moldova Discrepancy between legal wood supply and demand \u2013 large amounts of unaccounted harvest and related corruption; misuse of forest lease for private housing and business. No specific measures reported; in communal forests low corruption risk due to low harvest potential and social control. Russia Risks of misuse of federal subsidies for forestry at region level; high illegal harvest and export of timber; conversion of forests for private housing by elites. No specific measures and/ or low effectiveness. Ukraine Reports about conversion of forests for private housing and illegal logging; low local ownership and social control of local/\u201ccommunal\u201d forests; informal employment of forest workers. Ongoing reform process addresses corruption, but effect not yet clear; in some \u201ccommunal\u201d forests development of sense of possessorship and social control facilitated by FSC certification. Case xiv: Armenia \u2013 Reducing illegal and unaccounted harvest and corruption The forests are exploited for the private income of officials and entrepreneurs. Because the annual allowable cut is far below the demand for fuelwood, it is impossible for Hayantar to register the real amounts of wood sold and corruption through under-invoicing is the rule. Hayantar assigns the logging rights to brigades, which would in excess to the permitted amounts harvest large unaccounted volumes of wood. These rights to cut and sell trees are allocated without a fair selection process, and it can be assumed that the brigades share their gains with the officials who grant them access. Police and state environmental inspection collect bribes from the brigades transporting unaccounted fuel wood. The political and economic environment makes the implementation of effective measures to prevent corruption in the forestry sector very difficult. The assignment of limited rights of using fallen dry wood as fuelwood by villages close to forests may have led to a modest reduction of corruption. Additional proposed measures include targeted gas subsidies for forest dependent households and liberation of prices for wood sold by Hayantar. The Armenian Forests Public Monitoring, a joint monitoring by the civil society and the state was recently established with support by ENPI-FLEG II. Communities, civil society organizations, the State Forest Monitoring Centre and Hayantar jointly monitor illegal and unaccounted logging. This substantially counters the corruption risk due to its institutional cooperation and transparency. Engaging the public in the monitoring of its forests can make forest management and activities more transparent and \u2013 if combined with legal access to fuel wood \u2013 generates a direct interest within local communities for protecting the forests. This can reduce the opportunities for illegal forest use tolerated by corrupt officials. The Armenian Forests Public Monitoring is already contributing to a higher effectiveness of law enforcement. Further country-specific findings are presented in the Regional Study section on this component. Conclusions - Impact of Governance of Local Forests The pillars and components of the governance framework finally contribute to the situation in the local forests and in the communities depending on these forests. Impacts of governance of local forests on forest cover and forest conditions Changes in forest cover can either be assessed from official reports or from studies using remote xli sensing. Officially reported changes in forest cover are based on the forest definitions applied in the respective countries, which do not always include trees outside of the borders of the state forest fund. However, such areas can make up substantial parts of \u201clocal forests\u201d. Remote sensing analysis has shown significant changes in the forest cover of some of the programme countries. Remote sensing based assessments are suitable for detecting real changes in forest cover independent of formal definitions, but they cannot distinguish between temporary loss because of logging and permanent loss because of transformation of forests into other land-use types. Also gain of forest cover through regeneration of formerly logged areas cannot be distinguished from new afforestation. For methodical reasons forest gain and forest loss can be difficult to compare.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c5ede90-b6f5-4db5-9f68-f45723fe9020": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c5ede90-b6f5-4db5-9f68-f45723fe9020", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f526cf893edcc5111cac714a6fad6ec772473c8891707af06f362dad5795396a"}, "3": {"node_id": "b5f8cd59-dcf1-4140-a8fd-67f443e59577", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f436af962db63567d5160acda9302832c05d8496538532027eed14b4fe19a46d"}}, "hash": "1c85ec5f684d2f15799fc32a5895a216e0ad13c3015c6301de9be93d99b5e7d4", "text": "The definition of \u201clocal forests\u201d is too vague to allow for measuring the specific trends by clipping the available data on forest cover with the borders of local forests.

Impacts of governance of local forests on economic and other benefits from these forests The governance of forests impacts on the direct economic benefits and their distribution as well as on the indirect and non-material benefits from these forests. The forest dependency studies showed the economic importance of local household income from the harvest of forest products.

The region\u2019s forests belong to several biomes and ecoregions (Olson et al. 2001), from North to South including: \uf0b7 the subarctic, humid boreal forests or taiga o (11 ecoregions); \uf0b7 temperate coniferous forests: o Carpathian montane conifer forests; o Altai montane forest and forest steppe; o Khangai Mountains conifer forests; o Sayan montane conifer forests; \uf0b7 temperate broadleaf and mixed forests: o Central European mixed forests; o Pannonian mixed forests; o Sarmatic mixed forests; o West Siberian broadleaf and mixed forests; o Ussuri broadleaf and mixed forests; o South Sakhalin-Kurile mixed forests; o Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests; o Caucasus mixed forests; o Colchic deciduous forests; o East European forest steppe; \uf0b7 Temperate grasslands, savannahs, and shrub-lands, of which have some forests cover: o Eastern Anatolian montane steppe (very limited forest area); o Daurian forest steppe; o Kazakh forest steppe; o Selenge-Orkhon forest steppe; o South Siberian forest steppe; 2 \uf0b7 Deserts and xeric shrublands: o Azerbaijan shrub desert and steppe. Russia has the by far largest share of boreal and temperate forests in Eurasia. Russia (45%), Georgia (40%) and Belarus (39%) are countries with high forest cover, while Ukraine (16%), Moldova (13%), Armenia (12%), and Azerbaijan (11%) have a low forest cover. The Southern Caucasus region is one of the richest regions in the world for diversity of wild-growing fruits. (Bakkegard, 2014) When regaining independence following the breakdown of the Soviet Union all seven ENPI-FLEG II countries had inherited a similar Soviet style forest management system and governance. During the transition period the countries enacted their national forest legislation and established new institutions. The further development of forest policies, legislation, institutional mandates, economic systems, planning and management was not any longer based on homogenous principles and resulted in diverse and in some cases even contrasting types of governance systems, currently present within the ENPI-FLEG II countries. In all these countries during the Soviet period a part of the forests was assigned to collective or state agricultural enterprises. These forests have been managed separately from the forests belonging to centrally ruled state forest enterprises (Rus. leskhoz - \u043b\u0435\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0437) and were commonly referred to as Rus. \u201ckolkhoz\u201d (\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0445\u043e\u0437) forests. These former \u201ckolkhoz\u201d forests now form a substantial part of the \u201clocal forests\u201d, the governance of which is subject of this Study. However, as explained below in Section 2, for the purpose of this Study \u201clocal forests\u201d may as well include other forests of local importance and the term \u201clocal forests\u201d cannot be sharply defined. The forest governance systems in the programme countries include variations as well as similarities related, among others, to the specific governance of \u201clocal forests\u201d. Few of the participating countries recognize and include definitions such as \u201cForests of Local Importance\u201d or communal forest management or ownership within their national forest legislation. Also where forests are under exclusive state ownership, \u201clocal forests\u201d can be managed by different levels and types of institutions. The right of local community members to access forests and to use forest resources is safeguarded to some extent within the legislative frameworks and local management practices. Also, in varying extent, some rights of communities to participate in decision making related to the management, use and conservation of their local forests are provided. Generally, the quality of governance often determines whether forest resources are used ef\ufb01ciently, sustainably and equitably, and whether countries achieve forest-related development goals. One of the important criteria, when assessing the quality of forest governance, is to analyse how local populations are involved in the management of forests in their vicinity.

Forests also provide locally important ecosystem services like protection of villages from landslides and floods and prevention of erosion of arable lands.

The Objectives of this Regional Study on the Governance of Local Forests in ENPI-FLEG II countries are: \uf0b7 Document patterns of governance of local forests, which are currently in place in the participating countries, by utilizing information from country experts; \uf0b7 Provide a comparison of the existing administrative and social systems, legal background and institutional structures that relate to the governance of local forests in the region; \uf0b7 Present information that can help define and clarify the effectiveness of governance and participation by the local forest dependent population in forest management and decision making processes; \uf0b7 Identify common trends and national differences, as well as hurdles and best practices of local forest governance; \uf0b7 Make concise information on these issues accessible in a structured and systematized form to stakeholders and decision makers for enabling improved governance of local forests in the participating countries. This Regional Study is also intended to contribute to the development of the IUCN Natural Resource Governance Framework, which aims at the provisioning of an independent method to determine the strengths and weaknesses of natural resource decision-making and implementation globally. This Regional Study largely builds on Case Studies from five out of the seven countries that participate in ENPI-FLEG. The full Case Studies are presented in the Annex 2 to this Regional Study. 2. Definition of key terms and of the scope of the Regional Study The ToR for this consultancy tentatively defined the scope of the Regional Study on Governance of Local Forests. In the frame of the Preliminary Study the scope of the Regional Study and the Case Studies has been specified and agreed upon. 2.1 Definition of key terms The determination of the scope of this Study requires the definition of the key terms \u201cgovernance\u201d or \u201cnatural resource governance\u201d, \u201cforests\u201d, \u201clocal forests\u201d and of some other related terms. 2.1.1 Governance For the term \u201cgovernance\u201d no generally accepted definition exists. Moore et al. (2011) state: \u201cAt the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, governments made a commitment to improve governance. The term is often used, however, without specifying what the writer or speaker actually means by it.\u201d Kjaer (2005) defines \u201cgovernance\u201d as \u201c\u2026 the setting of rules, the application of rules, and the enforcement of rules\u201d. At an even broader scale, Rayner et al. (2010) characterise Governance simply as \u201cany effort to coordinate human action in order to achieve certain goals\u201d. (Both quoted in FLEGT, 2013) 4 The World Bank Land Governance Assessment Framework (The World Bank, 2012) defines \u201cgovernance\u201d in general \u201c\u2026 as the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised. This includes (i) the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; (ii) the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies; and (iii) the respect of citizens and the state for the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them (Kaufmann et al., 2002)\u201d; and in the context of land, the term Governance \u201cconcerns the process by which decisions are made regarding access to and use of land, the manner in which those decisions are implemented and the way that conflicting interests in land are reconciled. Key elements of the definition include decision making, implementation and conflict resolution, with dual emphasis on process and outcomes. (GLTN, 2008)\u201d PROFOR/FAO (Cowling et al., 2014) suggest a very broad definition as follows: \u201cForest governance comprises all the social and economic systems that affect how people interact with forests, including bureaucracies, laws, policies, traditional norms and culture, patterns of land tenure, and markets.\u201d Governance \u201cis about representation, style of interaction, authority, and decision rules. It also refers to processes that support governance, such as fostering scientific and public learning; and building civic and political will\u201d (Vasilijevi\u0107 et al., 2015). Often the term Governance is used synonymous with \u201cmanagement\u201d (Moore et al., 2011), as in the ENPI-FLEG context, where in Russian language the same term \u201cupravlenie - \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u201d is applied for both.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "404eca6c-bb72-4b4b-8c8d-eda649507fe3": {"__data__": {"id_": "404eca6c-bb72-4b4b-8c8d-eda649507fe3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6bb89a9e44f323cc050a9b58c6d0f823ab7f3740d9ebdc802f3eb074b960c590"}, "2": {"node_id": "564d7921-f7b4-4288-b491-77e03c15800b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dea0419ba5f7f85b7b77921e2d077fe84506eee48e59c613adae9cd3ac53c460"}}, "hash": "e9fd01bf667b48cad92a7c32eb5822ef2808e1e98acd1327541e3d66b31631ff", "text": "As explained in Table 1 below, governance is more about \u201cthe process of deciding what to do, while management is more about implementing appropriate strategies derived at the governance level to address the substantive issues.

Source: Adapted from Borrini-Feyerabend et al. (2013) 5 In this Study we apply the definition as adopted by the IUCN\u2019s Assembly, which has defined NATURAL RESOURCE GOVERNANCE as \u201cthe interactions among structures, processes and traditions that determine how power and responsibilities are exercised, how decisions are taken, and how citizens or other stakeholders have their say in the management of natural resources - including biodiversity conservation\u201d (WCC, 2004; Graham et al., 2003). The IUCN Nature Resource Governance Framework (NRGF) addresses the set of norms, institutions and processes that frame decision-making and citizens\u2019 engagement in policy development and how its implementation impacts nature and people. This provides a basis for understanding how governance in the \u201creal world\u201d affects livelihoods, food security, climate adaptation, human wellbeing and how natural resource interventions can facilitate and support positive change. Consequently the NRGF takes us beyond an understanding of the \u201cintention and scope\u201d of law and stated policy to real situations. (IUCN, 2013) 2.1.2 Good governance Often the term \u201cGood governance\u201d is applied as a general concept or goal of reform processes. Defining Good governance as a term is even more challenging than defining Governance as such. The Consultant therefore refrains here from the attempt of developing a definition of Good governance, but will assess the findings of the governance analysis in accordance to commonly accepted principles or criteria of Good governance, as applied in various frameworks, e.g. the Governance of Forests Initiative (GFI) Indicator Framework (Davis et al., 2013), the Framework for Assessing Forest Governance (Profor/FAO, 2011) and in particular in the set of principles of good governance that are considered for integration into the Natural Resources Governance Framework currently under development (Walters, IUCN, pers. comm. by Email 24 March 2015). 2.1.3 Forests The definition included in the Terms and Definitions of the Forest Resources Assessment (FRA)of 2015 (FAO, 2015) is commonly used in forest resources assessments allowing for international comparison: FOREST Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use. Explanatory notes 1. Forest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters. 2. Includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected to reach a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters or more. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or natural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years. Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is used. 3. Includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest. 4. Includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares 6 and width of more than 20 meters. 5. Includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of at least 5 meters. 6. Includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether this area is classified as land area or not. 7. Includes rubber-wood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations. 8. Includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover criteria are met. 9.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4c2d07b-41cd-49a6-8bc1-3ffed0024aae": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4c2d07b-41cd-49a6-8bc1-3ffed0024aae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a129853aa11aba3e34be98005fe93abc6812d8aa53dc5072b5435698c4d4080"}, "2": {"node_id": "7d2a4b1d-c795-4ebb-a256-9f013dae4b26", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7989bf9fac8a4dcfa3d3045f8385ba12bac1624832d3e93df63e1d1c239a7c43"}}, "hash": "874a3ba4c21ad779f6b3c914b9d2de9637e74df4a43c8d93b27a3166921bd3ce", "text": "9.

Forest code Azerbaijan Interconnected and mutually influencing lands, water, trees, bushes, grasses, animals and microorganisms and other elements. Not included in the forest fund are: trees, shrubs, shelter belts at agricultural lands, and of transportation and water infrastructure, as well as within urban areas and on household plots. Forest code Belarus Defined by shrub and tree vegetation and other elements forming a forest biocoenosis; and by its multiple use functions. Forest code Georgia Forest - a part of geographical landscape, comprising trees attributed to forest by Georgian legislation, land under these trees, as well as shrubs, grass, animals, and other components biologically linked in the process of their development, affecting each other and the environment. Forest code Moldova Defined as landscape element and functional unit of the biosphere consisting of forest vegetation (dominance of shrubs and trees) and other elements, minimum area size covered by forest vegetation is 0.25 ha. Not included in the forest fund are: shelter belts and parks, but their management is nevertheless regulated by the Forest Code. Forest code Russia Forest is understood as ecological system or as natural resource. Forest code of the RF Ukraine Forest is defined as natural complex, dominated by tree and shrub vegetation, together with its soils and other interrelated natural components.

Usually the national legislation defines these \u201cforest lands\u201d as: Lands with or without forest cover which are used for the purposes of forestry and/or are under the tenure (ownership or permanent land-use) by forestry organizations (forest agencies or forestry enterprises). These lands, in addition to forests and temporary not tree-covered forest areas (logging areas, young growth), can include e.g. forest roads, forest nurseries, areas used for the administrational and technical functions of forestry enterprises, lands under tenure of forestry enterprises used as 8 pasture, haymaking and arable lands as well as not tree-covered areas like rocks, waterbodies and openings in the forests. Forest lands without actual forest cover are sometimes leased out to individual farmers and agricultural enterprises. While forest lands can include lands temporarily or permanently without tree cover, there can as well be lands, the vegetation cover of which qualifies as forest, that are not considered as forest lands. Some ENPI-FLEG II countries provide legal options to formally exclude certain areas covered by trees and shrubs from the land designation of forests even if the technical thresholds of the definition of \u201cforest\u201d are met.

In some countries the administrative boundaries of the sub-districts do not include all lands and substantial forest areas can be located outside the boundaries of the communes, e.g. in Armenia. There, according to official cadastral data, around 33% of the areas of the land designation category \u201cforest lands\u201d are located inside of administrative boundaries of sub- districts (communes). However, the applied classification by the Land Code includes both, areas with and without tree cover. (Gevorgyan, 2009) The findings gathered during the course of the elaboration of this Study showed that while in most Case Study areas forests that were formerly in the possession of agricultural units, such as kolkhoz or sovkhoz, form the majority of \u201clocal forests\u201d but that a broader and flexible understanding of the term is necessary. An unequivocal and generally applicable definition, however, could not be applied and in the practice the Consultant and the interviewed stakeholders were not always able to draw a clear line between the governance of \u201clocal forests\u201d and of other forests.

In contrast, the definition of the term \u201cNon-timber forest products\u201d (NTFP) would include fuel-wood as well.

District \u2013 This term refers to the level usually below the level of the region, in Russian called rayon (\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d); in countries where no regional level exists, it can also be subordinated directly to the national level. Sub-district, Commune and/or Municipality \u2013 These terms will be used as a generic terms for the territorial administrative units below the district, including one or several villages, formerly in rural areas often corresponding to an agricultural production unit like a sovkhoz or kolkhoz and being governed by a rural council (Rus. selsovet \u2013 \u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442); these units are also referred to as \u201ccommune\u201d (adj. \u201ccommunal\u201d) or \u201cmunicipality\u201d (adj. \u201cmunicipal\u201d). In Georgia the district level has been replaced by the municipality, and the former sub-districts do not have own status as administrative units anymore. In Ukraine all levels below the central level can be called \u201ccommunal\u201d, including region, district and sub-district level. If not otherwise specified in this Study the term \u201ccommunal\u201d applies only to the sub-district or municipality level. District Administration and Council \u2013 These terms will be used if reference is made to the respective administrative level. In the legislation of the ENPI-FLEG II countries different terms are applied specifically to this administrative level. This can be misleading, like the commonly used term \u201clocal administration\u201d and similar terms, which actually refer to the district level. Sub-district Administration and Council \u2013 Similarly to the district administration, in the legislation of the ENPI-FLEG II countries different terms are used for this level, not always understandable without specific knowledge.

In some cases the distinction between \u201cforest agencies\u201d, i.e. organizations of rather administrative and controlling character, and \u201cforestry enterprises\u201d, i.e. economic units carrying out the management of forest areas, can be difficult where both types of functions are combined. When referring to specific organizations the term most appropriately describing the functions will be used together with the actual name of the organization. In the context of regional analyses the most appropriate generic term will be applied.

These definitions are not identical between the countries and not entirely consistent with the FAO definition. Generally, the Consultant in the Regional Study and in the Case Studies considered all forests in the sense of the FAO definition and \u2013 where appropriate \u2013 also \u201cother woodlands\u201d. In countries, where the definition of \u201cforest\u201d includes thresholds, these have been considered during the assessment and analysis for the respective country. Differences between the countries in terms of what vegetation or land-cover qualify as forests have been taken into consideration in comparative analyses. While the FAO definition includes artificial tree plantations, with the exception of those in agricultural production systems and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover, some of the programme countries highlight the ecosystem aspects of forests in their definitions. Artificial plantations, entirely dependent on continuous management interventions and not forming self- sustaining forest ecosystems, like tree plantations dependent on irrigation, or plantations of poplar and other cultivated or exotic species, however, in the practice of all ENPI-FLG countries are considered as forest. Such plantations can regularly be found on lands close to rural and urban settlements, may well qualify as \u201cforests of local importance\u201d and were consequently considered in this Study. Similarly, the legislation and forestry practice in some countries do not consider shelterbelts or windbreaks as forests, while in other countries they do. Where tree stands but they Tree stands that qualify as forests by their characteristics, but do formally not belong to the forest fund, will be considered under this Study. Thus the scope of this Study does include forests in accordance to the FAO definitions and to the national definitions, with a focus on forests in a stricter sense, which are functional and self- sustaining ecosystems with some extent of management intervention. Less attention is paid to purely artificial and often short living plantations of cultivated and exotic species (e.g. poplar hybrids), entirely depending on management intervention for their short- and mid-term existence (planting, irrigation), and to wind breaks on agricultural lands. The Study as well considers spontaneously growing forest vegetation on abandoned or extensively grazed agricultural lands. The 13 scope of this Study does not include shelterbelts protecting settlements, industrial sites, roads, railways etc., fruit tree plantations and parks in urban areas. The forests of Tbilisi municipality (Georgia), although formally designated as \u201cgreen plantation\u201d, i.e. parks, have been considered in this Study due to their fulfilment of all criteria of the FAO and national forest definitions and their designation to another land category for purely political reasons. 2.2.2 Scope in terms of status as \u201clocal forests\u201d The determination of the scope of this Study by distinguishing between \u201clocal forests\u201d and other forests is difficult due to the absence of a common definition in the ENPI-FLEG II countries and in the context of the programme. \u201cForests of local importance\u201d are not defined or even mentioned in the legal frameworks of most countries. The forests\u2019 history as former property of agricultural units (kolkhoz and sovkhoz) cannot exclusively determine the scope of this Study because more than twenty years have passed since the beginning of economic and political transformation.

Restricting the scope of the study by predetermining a type of ownership or management arrangement qualifying \u201clocal forests\u201d would have excluded typical situations from this Study and hindered the comparative analyses of different organizational settings between the countries. This Study also considered forests as \u201clocal\u201d where local rural and urban populations are dependent on the use of wood and NWFP as well as ecosystem services from these forests. The Consultant considered the findings of the ENPI-FLEG Regional Study on forest dependency of local communities for specifying the scope of the present study. However, it turned out that the forest dependency is a too vague criterion for the determination of \u201clocal forests\u201d as distance of forests from rural settlement is not always correlated to their importance for local people (often due to access restriction) and in some cases quite remote forests provide essential goods and services. In the course of this Study the Consultant adapted the scope: where history still influenced current governance former \u201ckolkhoz\u201d forests were considered as \u201clocal forests\u201d (Azerbaijan (Case Study area only), Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine), where communal and other sub-national forms of forest management responsibilities or ownership exist or are legally possible (Armenia, Azerbaijan (Case Study area only), Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine) such forests were considered as \u201clocal forests\u201d. Where both was not the case (Belarus, Russian Federation) the Consultant did not attempt to determine \u201clocal forests\u201d but looked into forest governance from the perspective of the involvement of local people and local administrations and their needs and interests. 2.2.3 Geographic scope The geographic scope of this Regional Study corresponds to the scope of the entire ENPI-FELG II programme. The governance of local forests in general was analysed for all ENPI-FLEG II countries, comparing the provisions of policies and legal, regulatory and organizational frameworks with the 14 situation in the practice as far as information was available. This analysis and the regional comparison were be based on information available from reports and publications, provided by the CPCs or obtained from stakeholders through email requests and/or personal or phone interviews. Specific aspects have been assessed in detail in five Case Studies in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. These Case Studies provided the opportunity of a more in-depth analysis and assessment of the governance of local forests in selected areas, of specific aspects of forest governance and of the application of the national or sub-national frameworks in the local practice. The Case Studies\u2019 focus was on specific local situations in selected sites, suggested by the CPC, but in the respective countries the Consultant gathered also more detailed information on their national level frameworks. 3. Methodology 3.1 Existing tools and frameworks Currently a number of different frameworks are available for the assessment of governance of natural resources and of forests in particular (e.g. Cowling et al., 2014; Davis et al., 2013, Moore et al., 2011, PROFOR/FAO 2011, The World Bank, 2012, USAID, 2013, Williams et al, 2013). The most important frameworks reviewed for the identification of a suitable methodology are: \uf0b7 \u201cFramework for Assessing and Monitoring Forest Governance\u201d, developed by FAO (PROFOR/FAO, 2011) and completed by \u201cAssessing Forest Governance - A Practical Guide to Data Collection, Analysis, and Use\u201d (Cowling et al., 2014); \uf0b7 The GFI framework of the World Resources Institute, \u201cAssessing Forest Governance. The Governance of Forests Initiative Indicator Framework\u201d by Davis et al. (2013) with the GFI Guidance Manual (Williams et al., 2013) for the application of this indicator framework; \uf0b7 The World Bank (2012) has developed a \u201cLand Governance Assessment Framework\u201d, which includes Forestry as a thematic module; \uf0b7 USAID (2013) provided a simple set of \u201cGuidelines for Assessing the Strengths and Weaknesses of Natural Resource Governance in Landscapes and Seascapes\u201d that take the groups involved in governance as a starting point.

This Framework will comprise a set of normative principles that are applied through a suite of diagnostic and decision support tools that are context specific. It is planned to develop indicators to assess the state of governance of natural resources in different decision contexts, and to facilitate the identification of concrete approaches and measures for gradual improvements. This process has not yet led to a draft framework and indicators that could be tried and tested in the frame of this 15 Study. The present assessment is expected to contribute practical experience to the development of the NRGF, in particular by providing input from a specific geographical region otherwise not yet covered. Best Practice Guidelines on governance of protected areas have been published by IUCN (Borrini- Feyerabend, 2013) and provide frameworks for assessing and evaluating governance specifically for systems of protected areas and individual areas, including IUCN\u2019s broad principles of good governance of protected areas. While specifically developed for the protected areas context, these assessment frameworks can as well be referred to in the assessment of governance of local forests. Further, in a number of studies different frameworks and methods have been applied for assessing the governance of forests at different scales \u2013 locally, nationally and regionally. The World Bank (2006) summarized the efforts on strengthening global forest law enforcement and governance with a focus on prevention of forest crime and on law enforcement. 3.2 Proposed Methodology The methodology of this Study included elements of the various frameworks and has been adapted to fit to the specific context and cover the issues of special relevance in the ENPI-FLEG II countries. The Consultant applied key elements of the framework of the GFI (Davis et al., 2013) and of the PROFOR/FAO (2011) frameworks. The forestry governance indicators of The World Bank\u2019s (2012) framework cover some additionally considered issues. The reviewed frameworks are very comprehensive, some of them consisting of about one hundred indicators or dimensions to be assessed. The full application of these frameworks or combination of them would have required more resources than available for this Regional Study. All frameworks have been developed as general toolboxes for a wide range of situations. Thus in this Study a specific and simplified framework was applied, taking into considerations the key issues faced in the governance of local forests in the ENPI-FLEG II countries. This framework was followed as much as possible in a flexible manner as information became available and specific aspects turned out being more or less relevant than tentatively expected. 3.2.1 Gathering of Information and Analysis This Regional Study used the wea lth of information available in the Programme team. The Consultant gathered this information mainly via the CPCs, who provided all relevant official documents, reports and personal knowledge. The Consultant additionally communicated directly with national consultants in those countries where national consultants had worked on governance and related topics. As sources of information the Consultant used the available and relevant national documents as primary sources, like: \uf0b7 Policy documents on topics like, e.g.: o forestry and other natural resource management issues; o biodiversity, climate change and other environmental issues; o political, legal and economic reforms and decentralization; \uf0b7 National and, where existing, sub-national laws, and relevant bylaws regulating: o Forestry; o Land-use; 16 o Environmental protection, protected areas, use of natural resources like flora and fauna; o Access to environmental information; o Competencies of decision making bodies and administration at various levels, o Other issues of relevance. The consultant referred to secondary sources of information including: \uf0b7 Reports prepared in the frame of ENPI-FLEG; \uf0b7 Reports and publications prepared in the frame of other projects. The Consultant visited six of the seven ENPI-FLEG II countries (except Russian Federation), conducted Case Studies (13 areas in five countries) and met with representatives of: \uf0b7 Government agencies (in particular those in charge of forestry); \uf0b7 Forest inventory and management planning organizations; \uf0b7 Non-governmental organizations; \uf0b7 Local administrations at different levels; \uf0b7 Community representatives; \uf0b7 Local forestry enterprises. The Consultant interviewed stakeholders in most cases in Russian or English. Only in few cases in Moldova and Ukraine the Consultant had to rely on translation from the official language that was provided by the CPC or other participants of meetings. The stakeholder interviews followed the framework without necessarily covering all of its pillars and components entirely and with each stakeholder. Instead of schematically going through the framework, the Consultant encouraged the interview partners to explain their own perspective on the governance of local forests and to highlight those aspects they considered most relevant.

The Consultant as much as possible verified the quality and reliability of gathered information by cross- checking, assessing the plausibility and comparing with information from other stakeholders in the Case Study areas. 3.2.2 Framework for assessing the governance of local forests under this Study The Consultant applied the elements of the framework to local forests. In many cases provisions for local forests are not different from those for any other forests. Wherever specific provisions on local forests are in place or the situation of local forests and their governance differs from other forests the Consultant analysed these specifics. The following table provides a brief overview of the topics covered in the governance assessment framework applied: Table 4. Framework for the assessment of governance of local forests PILLAR 1: POLICY, LEGAL, INSTITUTIONAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS PILLAR 2: PLANNING AND DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES PILLAR 3: IMPLEMENTATION, ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE Component 1.1: Policies Component 2.1: Stakeholder participation Component 3.1: Capacity of forestry organizations and territorial decision making bodies and administrations 17 Component 1.2: Legal and regulatory frameworks Component 2.2: Planning and decision making on conversion of land from forest to non-forest and vice versa Component 3.2: Forest law enforcement Component 1.3: Ownership and user right systems Component 2.3: Decisions on forest inventory and management planning Component 3.3 Administration of forest and land ownership and user rights Component 1.4: Mandates of forestry organizations and territorial decision making bodies and administrations Component 2.4: Decisions on implementation of forest management activities Component 3.4 Cooperation and coordination Component 1.5: Financial arrangements, economic instruments and benefit sharing Component 3.5 Measures to address corruption and ensure transparency Assessment of impact of governance of local forests Governance is largely about process; and this Study is focussed more on assessing the quality of processes rather than on measuring their impacts. The Pillars and Components however address issues that will finally contribute to the situation in the local forests and in the communities depending on those forests. The Consultant as much as possible therefore considered these impacts of governance on forest cover, forest conditions and economic benefits and services from forests. Quality of governance (of natural resources like forests) is best assessed by its outcomes or impacts in terms of quality and sustainability of the resource and by the direct and indirect benefits the human society as a whole, and the local households get from the use of the resource as well as the way economic benefits enable the sustainable management of the local forests. Both can be difficult to measure. The quality of the resource and its sustainability can be hard to assess as benchmarks are difficult to define and setting of benchmarks can be subjective. For example one stakeholder may see the species composition of a forest in accordance to the Potential Natural Vegetation and undisturbed ecosystem dynamics as the benchmark, while others may see as a benchmark a forest, partly or entirely composed of exotic tree species, providing the optimal and most efficient economic production potential at given site conditions and market demands. Also in terms of benefits for the society, expectations between stakeholders usually differ largely and the assessment of different benefits like ecosystem functions, recreation opportunities, water regulation, NWFP and wood production etc. as well as of the access to these benefits are rarely uniformly valued. The Consultant in the Conclusions section (6.) of this Regional Study provides some findings on the impact of governance on forest cover, forest conditions and economic and other benefits. Assessment of findings by criteria of \u201cgood governance\u201d As \u201cGood governance of local forests\u201d is difficult to be defined in strict terms of its outcomes, attempts are made to evaluate its characteristics allowing for decision making processes that optimally balance different interests. IUCN has determined a set of principles of good governance (Walters, IUCN, pers. comm. by Email 24 March 2015), which the Consultant used in assessing the governance of local forests as presented in Annex 1 of this Regional Study: 1. Democracy (inclusion and deliberative democracy, participation and voice, respect and trust, empowerment, meaningful and respectful dialogue, political equality); 2. Respect, Dignity and Reciprocity (respect for diverse perspectives, respect for difference, 18 appreciation of others, freedom to dissent, valuing the human-nature relationship, diversity of institutional arrangements, non-interference, recognition and support for indigenous knowledge); 3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "538095f5-a32f-4d0e-aba4-3533671e2f62": {"__data__": {"id_": "538095f5-a32f-4d0e-aba4-3533671e2f62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b6b2bf3c53d7d71e6351cc9ebb8ef2ba9f431af1eee4dff1aacd8b1f144d9b8"}, "2": {"node_id": "7f7bb4d9-4a61-45f2-9787-a5f519d785a8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "805fa6da7be4a05ba2653857484a52dd6d25a548d019326a03ac6a6786849406"}}, "hash": "24b897b5a429966fe19826f53f06b078959054a20749438f5f547345e2fc617c", "text": "Sustainability and Valuing Nature (managing ecosystems and landscapes, valuing nature, balancing interconnectedness, promoting good conservation practice); 4.

The framework of PROFOR/FAO (2011) suggests the assigning of scores for indicators on different \u201csubcomponents\u201d of governance. These scores would allow for the measuring of governance quality and its change over time. The Consultant carefully considered the application of scores on governance indicators in this Study. Various reasons listed in the Preliminary Study would have made the assigning of scores for indicators of governance in the context of this Study very challenging and likely misleading. Therefore the Consultant refrained from assigning scores when assessing and analysing the various elements of governance in the ENPI-FLEG II countries and in the Case Studies. Given the difficulties associated with the assigning of scores, the Consultant evaluated the quality of governance without attempting to apply scores as quantitative measurement of indicators by its impacts on forests and benefits from these forests (section 6) and as far as possible by compliance with the above mentioned general principles of good governance (Annex 1). 3.2.3 Case Studies for assessing specific aspects in selected countries with focus on selected sites Azerbaijan In Azerbaijan the Case Study described the governance of the forests in the sub-district Ivanovka of Ismayilli district. This is a very special case as it represents the only collective farm (kolkhoz) continuously being functional since Soviet times. This collective farm as well manages the forests on its lands. In this Case Study the specifics of the governance of Ivanovka\u2019s forests have been studied in the context of the entire district, where other local forests and their management have been integrated in the local state forest enterprise. Belarus The Consultant visited the state forestry enterprise managing the state forest area in Logoysk district of Minsk region and the government institutions in charge of forests at republic and region level. As in Belarus all forests are managed by state forestry enterprises under centralized management by the Ministry of Forestry and its territorial units, this case is typical for the governance of forests at local level and the interactions between the state forestry enterprises and the sub-district and district 19 authorities. Based on advice by the CPC explaining the homogeneity of governance of forests in the country, the Consultant refrained from assessing additionally the situation in the communes studied for the Regional Study on forest dependency. Georgia In Georgia since 2005 legislation stipulated the transfer of the management of forests of \u201clocal importance\u201d into the ownership and exclusive authority of the municipalities. This legislation has so far not been implemented. A KfW funded project in 2007/2008 had supported an unsuccessful attempt to develop \u201ccommunal forestry\u201d in the municipality of Kharagauli. The municipality of Tbilisi in 2010 took over the Tskhneti Forestry Unit with 8,600 ha forests and thus became the first communal possessor of forests in a significant scale. The Tusheti Protected Landscape in Akhmeta municipality is the first communally managed protected area in Georgia, and since 2014 the administration of the protected area is in charge of about 3,700 ha of forests. Thus Akhmeta is the first rural municipality in Georgia taking over the management responsibility over substantial forest areas. The consultant visited as Case Study areas the municipality of Tbilisi, Akhmeta municipality with Tusheti Protected Landscape, which has been model area of ENPI-FLEG, Kharagauli municipality where the unsuccessful communal forestry pilot project had taken place, the municipality Baghdati, where the Head of the municipality had expressed his interest in taking over forests of local importance, and Tianeti municipality, which represents another typical case of a rural municipality with significant forest cover. Moldova In Moldova former \u201ckolkhoz\u201d forests have been handed over to the local administrations and are managed as communal forests. In the frame of the Case Study the consultant visited three typical municipalities: Mereni, Mile\u015fti and Boghenii-Noi.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f649681b-cb01-49fc-920b-5409e2aa9a21": {"__data__": {"id_": "f649681b-cb01-49fc-920b-5409e2aa9a21", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aab6f3c8be516bae77bc9ee27ea82dda28ff6de1ad3a13bda1fe9c776e6af73e"}, "2": {"node_id": "6650e540-d5fb-4bbb-95b4-3c9d81377011", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "013fdb1ed63afb120dc1a06f884968c39670890fe54661ae84d6e756e23d18df"}}, "hash": "e17451bd6d632f3c2213913ff42c18777ca6458678f43bf3b399a8c522c3a310", "text": "These three municipalities represent diverse conditions of forests (varying dominance of low productivity artificial plantations and productive natural forests), different quality of actual governance and accordingly a variety of views of stakeholders on future governance options.

Additionally the Consultant in Transcarpathia region of western Ukraine met forest experts that provided valuable information on the history and governance of local forests in this region and beyond. 20 4. History of Local Forests in the ENPI-FLEG II countries 4.1 Pre-soviet Period The history of forests belonging to local peasants and rural communities has its beginnings long ago in pre-soviet times. In the Tsarist Russia the beginnings of legislation on peasant forests origins in 1766 in the General Land Survey. Systematic management of peasant forests is connected to the land reform of 1861. In pre-revolutionary Russia 11.258 Mio ha forests were in the possession of peasants. (\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0446\u0435\u0432, 2003) Similarly in other regions, which became part of the Soviet Union, peasants owned forests either as individuals or as common property of the community. In some cases, like in the municipality of Boghenii-Noi in Moldova, this pre-soviet history impacts on the governance of local forests until nowadays (Case Study Moldova). 4.2 Soviet Period After the revolution the forests of Russia were nationalized by the \u201cDecree on Forests\u201d. But already in 1923 the forests of the Soviet Union were divided into forests of \u201clocal importance\u201d and of \u201cgeneral state importance\u201d. With the collectivization of agriculture the \u201clocal forests\u201d became the basis for the establishment of forest of agricultural cooperatives and state farms, called \u201ckolkhoz and sovkhoz forests\u201d. With the passing of the \u201cOrder on Kolkhoz Forests\u201d (\u041f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0445\u043e\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u0430\u0445) in 1948 these forests became finally recognized as a separate forest category and forest covered areas were assigned to the kolkhozes as permanent land-use. The collective farms were recognized as users of these forests with all user rights and responsibilities. All products harvested from these forests and all incomes generated belonged to the collective farms. (\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0446\u0435\u0432, 2003) In Moldova already in 1918-1924 in the context of the land reform all forests were nationalized. With the establishment of kolkhozes some of them established tree plantations, but few also got ownership of natural forests. After World War II many natural forests were handed over from the kolkhozes to the state forest fund. (Case Study Moldova) In Ukraine with the establishment of Soviet power in the 1920s and in the western part of the country in 1939, most forests were nationalized and included into state forestry enterprises. However, during the collectivization as well substantial forest areas were together with arable lands and pastures incorporated into the collective farms. E.g. in 1982 in Transcarpathia, out of approximately 650,000 ha of forest lands, 140,000 ha of forests were in the possession of kolkhozes. (Case Study Ukraine) The total area covered by these kolkhoz forests in 1962 was 39.2 Mio ha or 6-7% of the overall forest cover of the Soviet Union. Already this time the management of many kolkhoz forests was not satisfactory and accordingly these forests did not sufficiently fulfil their protective and productive functions. At the same time the status of these forests was subject to legal discussions. Key issue was the question if these forests are part of the state forest fund of the Soviet Union or if they form an independent forest category. It seems that although being located on lands in the permanent land-use of the collective farms, these forests were seen as part of the state forest fund and should therefore be subject to the same control by state forestry organs and other state agencies as any other forest, thus in some extent limiting the authority of the collective farms.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbb59c7d-1ab8-4675-bf3d-3b31244c44f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbb59c7d-1ab8-4675-bf3d-3b31244c44f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5e52f5d89823f8cb0b376c84493b4cfe9963431ea344da4d567acedfc40c207"}, "2": {"node_id": "06afb1f1-e44b-4a61-9487-56625bb29565", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c3c4e632abcb5882f9b8bbdea2a517ad6bc2cea087e072a9d648005ef2f7d89"}}, "hash": "c903c02e81381d412e1fd4934ee273af4d80bf9b1f7b8a275b48c0504bf443b9", "text": "(\u0417\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f, 1962) Until the 1960s and 1970s (\u0417\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f 1962, \u0422\u043e\u0440\u0446\u0435\u0432 2003, Case Study Ukraine, Case Study 21 Belarus) most kolkhozes used the forests in their possession for the fulfilment of immediate needs without implementing a systematic silvicultural management, and these kolkhoz forests already in Soviet times were in worse conditions than the state forests managed by state forestry enterprises. The reason for this situation was seen in the priority of the kolkhozes on exploitation only and the lack of forestry capacity in the kolkhozes.

These inter-farm forestry enterprises were united under a joint administration, the Production Association Mezhsovkhozles. (\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0446\u0435\u0432 2003) Similarly in other parts of the Soviet Union, namely in Ukraine, during the mid-1970s inter-farm forestry enterprises were established in some areas. These forestry enterprises were governed by a council with representatives of each agricultural farm. (Case Study Ukraine) In Transcarpathia reportedly (Case Study Ukraine) the kolkhozes maintained the existing situation, i.e. the use of forests without significant investment into reforestation and silvicultural activities. The forestry enterprise did not fully function because the kolkhozes remained permanent land-users of the forest lands, while the forestry enterprises were only technical implementers that had to supply the needs of the kolkhozes. Despite at least some experts were employed by the inter-kolkhoz forestry enterprises, in most kolkhoz forests still until 1982 real forest management did not happen. (Case Study Ukraine) While the management of existing forests in the possession of agricultural farms in the Soviet period was often considered unsatisfactory and not sustainable, these agricultural farms also contributed to an increase of the forest cover on their lands by establishing artificial plantations and shelterbelts. In Moldova the majority of nowadays communal forests, i.e. former kolkhoz forests, have their origin in such plantations, mostly of exotic black locust Robinia pseudoacacia (Case Study Moldova). Agricultural farms all over the Soviet Union established such plantations, often of non-native tree species (mainly black locust, poplar cultivars Populus spec. and pine Pinus spec.) and on agricultural lands of poor fertility or of relief unfavourable for agriculture. The formal status of shelterbelts on agricultural lands and their belonging to forests was subject of debate already in Soviet times. Due to their specific functions to improve the conditions for agricultural production and the land-use rights and authority of agricultural farms, these shelterbelts were largely seen as not belonging to the forest fund. (\u0417\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f, 1962) This position is nowadays still reflected in some national legislation, e.g. in the Forest Codes of Azerbaijan and Moldova, while e.g. in Ukraine shelterbelts are explicitly included in the forests. 4.3 Post-Soviet Period After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the independence of its Republics the status and governance of forests formerly possessed by agricultural farms developed in different ways in each country. Frequent changes in the legislation and in the structure and naming of government and forest management authorities make it difficult to understand the full picture in every country in detail. For this reason this Study presents only the general developments and some typical situations. In Armenia already in 1991 the Government integrated 56,000 ha of kolkhoz forests into the forest fund managed by the State Forestry Organization \u201cHayantar\u201d. The already in Soviet time degraded kolkhoz forests have been heavily logged in the 1990s. The FMP indicate the origin of these forests as former kolkhoz forests, but their management does not differ from the management of other 22 forests. (Petrosyan, Hayantar, pers. comm., 2015) In Azerbaijan at the time of the dissolution of the Soviet Union agricultural farms had permanent land-use rights over 125,000 ha of forests, i.e. roughly 10% of the current forest area. Although during Soviet times the state forestry enterprises twice a year conducted control visits on kolkhoz forests, these forests when Azerbaijan\u2019s gained its independence were largely heavily degraded. Between 1993 and 1998 these forests were step by step handed over to the state forestry enterprises. As the legislation in Azerbaijan defines the forest fund by the delimitation of its land-use borders, and consequently explicitly excludes \u201ctrees, shrubs, shelter belts on agricultural lands, and of transportation and water infrastructure, as well as within urban areas and on household plots\u201d, some areas with tree and shrub vegetation remained outside of the forests managed by the state forestry enterprises. (Case Study Azerbaijan) In Belarus, after the transformation of the kolkhozes in 1998-1999, during the early 2000s all kolkhoz forests were handed over to the Ministry of Forestry and integrated into the state forest fund managed by the local state forestry enterprises.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "681fdb5e-3f45-4482-a648-d718a887c6bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "681fdb5e-3f45-4482-a648-d718a887c6bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76c3e0cd371b51e5e0f3da9784c7e37c29c7d0451c8bafdcddcf3f50fc109b60"}, "2": {"node_id": "023dc630-3b32-42b6-aea5-c8b8f3bcc788", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b4e4a3f8a1f6337bbaf37343d197c090dfac9263c42578c9f3873bd4a31203fa"}}, "hash": "089743a162f44c98ed003be0bcd8218ad5740592a7527a51f4be903d6ac2d3b1", "text": "Some smaller areas with tree and shrub vegetation, in particular succession areas on abandoned agricultural lands, are still to be handed over to the state forest fund.

However, the legislation was vague what forests actually belong to the category of \u201clocal importance\u201d, but the broad perception was that this category would include all former kolkhoz forests as well as substantial other forest areas. By September 2007 it had been planned to hand over to municipalities 850,000 ha of forests, out of which 530,000 ha were former kolkhoz forest. But, until nowadays the transfer of forests of \u201clocal importance\u201d to the municipalities did not take place anywhere in Georgia with few exceptions that present special cases (Tbilisi \u2013 designated as \u201cgreen plantations\u201d, Akhmeta \u2013 the forests of a protected landscape managed by the municipality). The legislation still stipulates the issue of transfer of management authority of forests of \u201clocal importance\u201d, policy makers consider this issue and municipality representatives clearly expressed their interest in the handover of authority over local forests. (Case Study Georgia) In Moldova after independence 30,000 ha of former kolkhoz forests of different condition were included into the State Forest Fund, managed by Moldsilva. The remaining former kolkhoz forests, together with pastures and other commonly used areas, were handed over to the Local Public Authorities or municipalities (the prim\u0103ria). The former kolkhoz forests were subject to heavy illegal use during the years of transition. After the transfer of these forests to the municipalities Moldsilva assisted in their protection and planting of additional new communal forests on lands managed by municipalities. Most of these forests are now officially managed by municipalities. In 2009 these communally owned forests made up a share in the forest fund of 10.7% while 82% of the forests were in state ownership and managed by State Forestry Agency Moldsilva; with a very small share of private ownership (and 6.4% belonging to the forest fund of the self-proclaimed region of Transnistria). Some tree covered areas on communal lands may not belong to the forest fund (e.g. shelter belts, tree and shrub vegetation on pastures) but nevertheless are supposed to be managed in accordance to the Forest Code. (Case Study Moldova) In the Russian Federation the former kolkhoz forests, now called \u201cagrarian forests\u201d (selskie lesa \u2013 \u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u0430), have been included into the system of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian 23 Federation (\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0446\u0435\u0432, 2003). In 2003 these forests made up 44.5 Mio ha managed under the territorial administrations of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation in 45 Federal Subjects by more than 900 agrarian forestry enterprises, comprising of more than 22,000 forestry units. In Leningrad region only 10 agrarian forestry enterprises existed, managing almost 0.9 Mio ha of forest and employing 945 staff. The soviet-time Production Enterprise \u201cMezhsovkhozles\u201d in Leningrad Region in 1992 had been restructured into the Association of Production Enterprises \u201cLenagropromles\u201d. In 1998 in accordance to the Forest Code of 1997 a new administration system of agrarian forests was set up in form of the Federal State Agency Agrarian Forest Administration of Leningrad Region. (\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0446\u0435\u0432, 2003) The mandate of this organization is not described. Tortsev (\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0446\u0435\u0432, 2003) reports that in 2003 in Leningrad Region 198 agricultural farms possessed 838,900 ha of forests and produced 374,500 m\u00b3 of wood in 2002. Thus the number of forest users, area size and wood production together with the NWFP and environmental services provided by these local forests are substantial. However, in the new Forest Code of the Russian Federation (December 2006) the category of agrarian forests was not mentioned and Tortsev (\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0446\u0435\u0432, 2008) quoted the Head of the Natural Resources Committee of the State Duma, N.

Further, during the last 25 years large areas of agricultural lands were abandoned and natural succession led to the development of forests on these lands. The future of these forests is so far not determined and as long as these lands are not formally considered forest lands no effective governance of these forests is in place. (Case Study Ukraine) The history and origin of the local forests in mainly overused and unsustainably managed forests and artificial plantations of exotic trees, which are poorly adapted to local site conditions, make it now difficult to develop stable forest ecosystems that can provide environmental services and be sustainably managed in an economically viable way. These inherent difficulties and the heritage of often unclear legal status, ownership and management authority still affect the current governance and the perspective of its development. 1http://forestforum.ru/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=11860 24 Table 5.

Also in the Russian Federation and Moldova reforms took place, in particular aimed at the introduction of market principles in so far government dominated sectors like forestry. Policies on reforms in Armenia, Azerbaijan and in particular in Belarus have prioritized stability, the maintenance of a substantial role of the state in the economy as well as centralized systems of public administration and a careful transition towards a market economy. In all programme countries policies on reforming the government and public administration have been aimed at separating policy making from implementing functions and a division of the responsible departments and organizations in the sectors of natural resources management and forestry. The implementation of reform policies in some countries, e.g. Georgia, Ukraine and Russia, has led to frequent legal and institutional changes, which affected the governance of forests. Decentralization can be a factor positively contributing to good governance, because it can improve the participation of those people living close and being dependent on a resource like local forests. In the Soviet Union, although formally a being a federal system with councils of representatives at different levels from the Union down to the village, the political, administrative and economic systems had been very centralized. Decisions were made at the central level and executed locally. With independence and transformation in all programme countries decentralization in some extent took place. The institutional structure of public administrations and the division of authority between the different administrative levels has remained more or less stable in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Belarus where the administrative territorial levels, their decision making authorities and the nomination of heads of administrations as well as the centralized management in certain sectors through territorial divisions of central level ministries and state agencies remained largely unchanged since independence. The political developments in Moldova are oriented towards institutional reforms at all levels of the public administration. One element of these reforms is the development of the municipalities as self- governance bodies of the communes, with certain autonomy and own decision making structures. In the Russian Federation devolution of authority to the Federal Subjects has taken place in the 1990s, but substantial decision making authority remained at federal level and was in some cases even transferred back from the Federal Subjects to the federal level. Some programme countries have adopted National Environmental Action Programs (NEAP) and all have Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAP)2. Forest sector policies exist in varying extent from virtual absence in Ukraine via narrow technical afforestation programs like in Azerbaijan 2https://www.cbd.int/nbsap/search/default.shtml 26 and framework policy documents like in Georgia to elaborated and comprehensive policies and state programs like in the Russian Federation. The ENPI-FLEG II countries differ much in terms of existence and being up-to-date of their policies on forests and forestry as well as the compliance of the forestry practice with these policies. In Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova and Ukraine the respective government adopted key policy documents more than ten years ago. In Azerbaijan the policy document is of mainly technical character focussing on expansion of the forest cover, while a broader forestry policy document so far has not been adopted. In Belarus, Georgia and Russia the governments or parliaments more recently adopted new or updated forestry policy documents. The forestry policies of the countries barely consider local forests. The National Forest Concept of Georgia explicitly refers to local forests and to communities as forest owners and managers, but remains vague, especially if considering the existing legal provisions on \u201cforests of local importance\u201d and in comparison to more elaborated policy objectives on the state forestry management. The forestry policy documents of the Russian Federation recognize access of the rural population to forests and forest products and the special interests of local communities and indigenous people. In the practice of some programme countries the implemented policy, as visible in legislation, institutions and forestry practice, can substantially deviate from the adopted policy, especially where concerning local forests and the involvement of local communities and subnational territorial administrative units in forestry. For instance, in Armenia community forestry programs are officially stated in the policy, while Hayantar in the practice does not see potential in the active involvement of local communities in form of joint or community forest management. In contrast, in Moldova the officially adopted policy was oriented towards central level forest management, while the policy applied recognizes the important potentials of communal forest ownership and supports its development. Similarly in Ukraine, the role of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises is de-facto recognized by the political decision makers.

The quoted policy priorities and components do not show real consideration of an active role of local communities and communal institutions in sustainable forest management. According to Petrosyan (Hayantar, Chief Forester, pers. comm. 2015) pilot projects on community forestry that were implemented with donor support have been unsustainable and failed finally. Since 2004 a World Bank project on poverty alleviation has attempted to development community based forest management in up to 13 villages. Hayantar has been supportive, but the approach was not successful due to lack of community sense, insufficient forest resources for economically viable management and interest in immediately harvestable timber and fuel wood. These negative experiences have influenced the current policy, and despite being legally still possibly Hayantar considers the approach of community forestry and forest governance by local communal administrations or community-based organizations not feasible. The current policy thus prioritizes centralized governance and management of all forests by Hayantar, improved law enforcement, reforestation and forest management with external donor support and supply of fuel wood to rural households by Hayantar. 5Action Plan for Mitigating Actions to help Address the Problems Associated with Illegal Logging, Governmental Resolution #38/30 Sep, 2004 29 Azerbaijan The state policy of Azerbaijan is directed toward forest conservation and sustainable forest management, which includes the efficient and rational utilization of land and forest resources. The priority strategic objectives of the country\u2019s forest sector are reforestation, increase of the forest cover, and forest conservation and protection. All forests of Azerbaijan are designated as so-called first group forests according to the Soviet classification of protection and exploitation forests and are thus not subject to logging for main use. (ENPI-FLEG 2014) This classification in the practice has led to a de-facto ban on legal harvest of wood from forests, even in the context of forest maintenance and silvicultural activities. The \u201cForest Policy Statement and Action Plan\u201d had been prepared in 2012-2013 with FAO support as a National Forest Programme for 2015-2030. This document is available only as draft6. The National Programme \u201cOn restoration and expansion of forests in the Azerbaijan Republic\u201d was adopted in 2003 by the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources as official policy document. This document is mainly an action programme focussed on technical aspects of expansion of the forest coverage, in a significant extent by planting non-native to the afforested sites species, sometimes depending on irrigation. Aspects of sustainable use of forests for fuel wood and timber production as well as of governance and management of forests and forestry are not subject of this document. The state policy on forests and forestry does not refer to tree and shrub vegetation outside of the state forest fund, with the exception of tree belts along highways, railways, canals and the seashore. Belarus Belarus has a governmental policy of sustainable use of forests underlined by respective statements by the country\u2019s President. The draft \u201cNational Strategy for the Sustainable Social-Economic Development of Belarus until 2030\u201d7 contains a chapter on the development of forestry, hereby showing the recognition of this sector by the Government. In this document as objectives of forestry are highlighted: economic effectiveness, ecological responsibility and social orientation, based on the principles of balanced and sustainable use and continuity. Indicators for the achievement are the increase of the forest cover to 40.3% by 2030 (i.e. plus 1% of the country\u2019s surface area) and the increase of the possible logging volume under main use (Rus. \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043a\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f) by 100% during this time, the improvement of the age structure of the forests and the increase of the share of mature and over-mature stands from 11.6% (2013) to 16% in 2030.

A \u201cStrategic Plan for the Development of Forestry of Belarus for the years 2015-2030\u201d is currently elaborated in the frame of the ongoing ENPI-FLEG II Programme. As far as documented in publicly accessible sources this new strategic document is not yet adopted and published. In his message in April 2014 the President of Belarus mentioned the planned separation of production functions from management and control functions in the forestry sector. This would have implications that will lead to changes in the structure and mandate of forestry organizations. This Presidential statement corresponds with changes already in 2010 made in the legislation on privatization of state owned objects, which now would allow for the privatization of state owned enterprises in the forestry sector. The sub-units established in some forestry enterprises for production activities might thus in the future become not only independent entities but even private companies. Georgia Forestry is an integral part of the National Environmental Action Programme 2012-20169, establishing the \u201cimprovement of the overall condition and ecological functions of forests through development and implementation of a full-scale sustainable forest management system\u201d as long term goal. The NEAP does not mention forests of \u201clocal importance\u201d and any role of local communal bodies or communities. The Government of Georgia in its Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Protection (MENRP) has established a special unit for the development of the country\u2019s forestry policy - the Forest Policy Service. The MENRP together with the National Forestry Agency (NFA) has prepared the National Forest Concept of Georgia10, which is the basis for the further development of the forestry policy and the ongoing revisions of the legal and regulatory frameworks. The goal of the National Forest Concept and of the country\u2019s policy is \u201c\u2026 to establish a system of sustainable forest management that will ensure: improvement of the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of Georgian forests, protection of biological diversity, effective use of the economic 9 Approved by the Resolution of the Government of Georgia #127/24 January 2012 10Decree of Georgian Parliament \u201cOn adoption of National Forest Concept\u201d #1742-Is/December 26, 2013 31 potential of forests taking into account their ecological value, public participation in forest management related issues, and fair distribution of derived benefits. \u2026\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1469d6ec-8e75-4a72-8ce2-a6e0390bb5be": {"__data__": {"id_": "1469d6ec-8e75-4a72-8ce2-a6e0390bb5be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e82f963d376da51859896750f456d6ea6f2e79625ff007f53c468e88b1129578"}, "2": {"node_id": "63c7dfaa-66b8-42bf-a1c8-32d62b0f4b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "abd8fbb070971564586f828e4197fe1b860c4098becf551efee8152e47d4431d"}}, "hash": "d810391765dcb60e276e209f0e3731329b5abde572274c964e5e539eb2cd2a67", "text": "\u2026\u201d.

The National Forest Concept falls short to provide a clear policy direction in terms of \u201clocal forests\u201d and the role of municipalities as forest managers and/or forest owners and does not describe the intended future role of the private sector, in particular of long term concessions. The intended development of (currently not existing) \u201cState bodies\u201d for local on-the-ground forest management activities indicates a priority of state ownership and management of forests, and the intention of rather limited if any transfer of forests to the municipalities. The MENRP, despite the legal provision of transfer of forests of \u201clocal importance\u201d to municipalities, prioritizes the rehabilitation of central state governance of forests. This impression has been confirmed by statements of the head of the Forest Policy Service of the MENRP (Amirgulashvili, MENRP, pers. comm. 2015). He explained that the development of \u201ccommunity forestry\u201d is politically intended, without specifying any respective concepts. In fact, the transfer of forests to the municipalities is not fully elaborated as element of the forestry policy. However, the draft new Forest Code is said to provide specific regulations for communal forestry and requirements for the transfer of forests into communal management and possibly later into communal ownership. The transfer of productive forests to the municipalities is not intended, thus hampering future self-financing of communal forestry. Nevertheless, there exist high expectations towards communal bodies in terms of capacity development and self-financing abilities, but without clear concepts how to achieve these. In remarkable contrast to the vague conceptual ideas on communal forestry are the much more elaborated and comparably clear concepts on the planned state funding for forestry by state forest management bodies and their capacity development. The state forestry administration, planned as an independent economic entity, would only be in charge of own areas, i.e. of state forest in the narrow sense, and implement forest management. All supervisory (sovereign) functions would be held in the MENRP, for all types of forest ownership and management. The approach of commercial forestry concessions was considered not successful by the MENRP and will be phased out. Private forest ownership is thinkable for forests established through natural succession or afforestation of lands without forest cover. No privatization of existing forest is envisaged. 32 Moldova The national policy on forests was formulated in the Strategy for Sustainable Development of the Forest Sector of the Republic of Moldova till 2020 (Parliament Decision #350/2001). This policy document has not been updated since then and accordingly does not reflect the newer developments. This strategy emphasized the importance of restructuring the forestry sector and had the clear direction of handing over all communal forests to Moldsilva, including all newly afforested stands. In contrast, the current de-facto national forest policy is oriented on the strengthening of a system of diverse ownership of forests with a significant role of the municipalities. This policy change is realized through a number of projects already implemented or under implementation, including activities on capacity development of communal forest owners by ENPI-FLEG. Private forests cover increasing areas, but so far include only planted forests as privatization of existing forests is not allowed by the Forest Code (1996), and tree vegetation originating from natural succession on private lands is not yet recognized as private forests. The Government of Moldova has established the target of expanding the forest cover from currently 13.7% to 15% by 2020, thus effectively increasing the share of communally and privately owned forests. The element of sustainable use of forest products and the assignment of secure user rights on these products as key incentive to establish and maintain forests is weakly developed in the current policy. The government retains the right on harvest of trees and would not assign such rights to private owners and leaseholders of state or communally owned forests. In previous and current national policies the protective and environmental functions of forests are clearly prescribed as primary forest functions. This policy is reflected in the acting Forest Code that assigns (Art. 14) all forests of the Republic of Moldova to the \u201cfirst group as (forests) having exclusively an environmental protection function\u201d. This approach is only partly reflected in other regulations of the Forest Code and in the bylaws that nevertheless allow for certain forest uses, including extractive uses.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "639a2301-fe8a-432d-8ec0-156c7b6aee4b": {"__data__": {"id_": "639a2301-fe8a-432d-8ec0-156c7b6aee4b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "123c795ca7853faf730d105e78798b7fe7c55f681da30b06dd22a727a8defdd9"}, "3": {"node_id": "0b3e3955-1c80-473a-a7b9-ec5cba435793", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e48064cfe3dc3d40d52d8a2d89bce5fe84289b985d28b7c15db9f56130340a51"}}, "hash": "f8b000339fe499a09783dfc2ec1671866749ea64d833a036d5de225a0c2813e0", "text": "However, the \u201cexclusive environmental protection function\u201d is often interpreted in ways that hinder sustainable forest management, provide disincentives for reforestation and forest maintenance and perverse incentives for use of forests for not forestry related purposes (\u201crecreational use\u201d, i.e. construction of cottages, restaurants and similar structures on leased forest lands). The policy as expressed in the legislation is thus contradictory and does not achieve the stated objective of forest conservation for achieving environmental benefits. Russian Federation The Russian Federation has adopted several documents defining the policy of federal government on forests and forestry: \uf0b7 Basics of the State Policy on the Sphere of Use, Conservation, Protection and Reproduction of Forests in the Russian Federation for the Period until 2030 (2013); \uf0b7 Forest Policy of the Russian Federation (2013); \uf0b7 State Programme of the Russian Federation \u201cDevelopment of Forestry 2013 \u2013 2020\u201d. The \u201cBasics of the State Policy\u201d among other principles include: \uf0b7 \u201cKeeping forests in federal ownership while strengthening the role of private investments in the sector\u201d; and \uf0b7 \u201cPublic participation in the planning and implementation of activities in the forests\u201d. The \u201cBasics of the State Policy\u201d list the following \u201cgoals, to be achieved for the realization of the state policy in the sphere of use, conservation, protection and reproduction of forests: a) In the economic sphere \u2013 effective management of the forest sector and increase of the GDP 33 in the forest sector based on market demand; b) In the environmental sphere \u2013 favourable environment for the citizens and conservation of the biosphere role of Russia\u2019s forests; c) In the social sphere \u2013 raise of the living standard of citizens connected to forest and sustainable social-economic development of forest territories.\u201d For the achievement of these objectives the \u201cBasics of the State Policy\u201d list a number of objectives or tasks to be fulfilled. These are focusing on: \u201cthe increase of the management effectiveness in the forests sector; intensification of use and reproduction of forests, domestic market development for wood and cellulose products and formation of a market for forest ecosystem services; improvement of compatibility of the Russian forest industries; increased effectiveness of fire prevention and pest control; increased productivity and improved composition by varieties of forests on lands of various designation categories; conservation of the forest\u2019s ecological potential; scientific-technical, technological and personnel capacity development in the forest sector; development of international cooperation; and formation of conditions for the participation of citizens in the sphere of forest relations.\u201d The document then lists mechanisms for the realization of the goals and objectives of the state policy on forests. These among many others include the following points of special relevance for the governance of local forests: \uf0b7 Improvement of the system of delimitation of mandates of state organs of different levels and local self-governance bodies in the sphere of forest relations; \uf0b7 Improvement of the instruments for control of the implementation by Federal Subjects of their mandates; \uf0b7 Improvement of the federal control and protection of forests; \uf0b7 Modernization of the forest inventory, management planning and monitoring systems; \uf0b7 Development of public (voluntary) forest control; \uf0b7 Development and establishment of incentivizing conditions for small and medium enterprises and farmers at the use of forests; \uf0b7 Various measures for increased public participation, including of scientific and civil society organizations, in the development of legislation and in decision making on forest related issues (including the establishment of public forest councils at state organs of different levels). While the \u201cBasics of the State Policy\u201d do not contain any specific provisions concerning local forests and their governance, the document explicitly mentions the development and legal fixation of mechanisms for the securing of traditional forest use by small indigenous peoples as well as by rural communities in forest areas. According to the \u201cForest Policy\u201d, local self-governance bodies and people should be involved in the management of forests, but the document does not specify which forests this should concern. The state is supposed to ensure the access of the rural population to wood and NWFP, the development of forest related income for the local population and indigenous peoples and the consideration of their interest in the development of territories. Further, the state is supposed to establish conditions that allow for \u201cbroad stakeholder participation, including civil society, in the elaboration and application of legislation and in decision making related to forests\u201d.

The objectives of the Programme focus 34 on the reduction of losses for the forestry sector that are caused by fires, pests and logging, on intensive and rational forest use while conserving their ecological functions and biodiversity, on balancing the loss and rehabilitation of forests and on the improvement of their productivity and quality and on the general increase of the effectiveness of forest management. The Programme does not specifically mention \u201cagrarian\u201d or local forests. The assessment of the implementation of the state policy and the achievement of the stated goals and objectives is not possible in the context of this Regional Study. Various media article11, however, suggest the existing of substantial gaps between the official policy and the reality on the ground. For instance, the forest fires in the Baikal region in summer 2015, destroying millions of hectares of forest12,show that the intended improvement of fire control is by far not yet achieved. Ukraine Currently Ukraine does not have a formulated and officially adopted policy on the development of the forest sector. A national state policy of the forestry sector is missing that would determine the functions of different institutions and ownership types as well as issues of the intended division of management and control functions. So far reforms in the sector seem to be developed and implemented in an ad-hoc and sometimes inconsistent way. Since independence, and in particular with the transformation and privatization of the kolkhozes, the Government of Ukraine rather preferred the central management of all forests, in contrast to the communal management of pastures as common property of villages. Until 2014 the policy was that all forests should be in the hand of a state monopolist organization. This policy was officially changed by a decree of the Cabinet of Ministers when in 2014 Yatsenyuk became the new prime minister. The State Forest Resources Agency (SFRA) still has the official position that it would better if this agency would take over all forests in the country and the currently existing \u201ccommunal\u201d forests would be integrated into the state forest fund managed by this central level agency and its state forestry enterprises. However, no indication of policy development is currently visible towards full centralization of forestry and the integration of local forests into the centrally managed state forest fund. The decentralization policy of the government is expected to impact as well on the governance of \u201ccommunal\u201d forests and may have both positive and negative consequences (Zhyla in lit. 2016). More authority is supposed to be delegated to the basic level. In the result some of the local rural councils may expect to get the management authority on forests handed over, especially where rural communes are merged and thus larger basic level administrative territorial units are created. However, representatives of L\u2019viv regional council interviewed by the Consultant in 2015 intent to keep the existing forest management system, managing the \u201ccommunal\u201d forests in a unified way in larger units. Similar views are likely determining the policy on \u201ccommunal\u201d forests as well in other regions of the country and so far no policy changes are visible towards communalization of local forests to the basic level of sub-districts. However, national experts (Zhyla in lit. 2016) assume that in the areas, where the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises are owned by the district councils (Khmelnytsky and Cherkasy regions) changes will happen and reorganization of districts would fragment the management system of \u201ccommunal\u201d forest territories, but it can potentially contribute to better meeting the needs of local communities. 11E.g. http://www.warandpeace.ru/ru/commentaries/view/105846/; 12http://forest.ru/articles/nemetskiy-uchenyy-frank-edom-o-posledstviyakh-pozharov-v-pribaykale/ 35 Component 1.2: Legal and regulatory frameworks All program countries except of the Russian Federation have ratified the UNECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (Aarhus Convention) and all program countries are party to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).

The basic laws or constitutions of the countries contain very general provisions on the protection and use of natural resources and the environment, in some cases (e.g. Azerbaijan, Moldova) providing for state or public ownership on natural resources or specifically forests. The key sector laws of all programme countries are the respective forest codes. These forest codes after independence were developed on the basis of the Forest Code of the Soviet Union and thus shared many similarities in structure and content. Over the years new national Forest Codes have been developed or the original Forest Codes at least underwent frequent changes. The Forest Codes are generally framework legislation, many regulations of which refer to specific bylaws or to other legislation. The systems of bylaws vary between the countries in terms of the bodies adopting the bylaws and the spheres of regulation. Bylaws (statutes or regulations) define the structures, mandates and functioning of state agencies and forestry enterprises, the procedures of forest inventory and management planning, the procedures of decision making on logging and other forest management activities, on allocation of user rights, lease of forests, concessions and permits, and many other subjects. These bylaws can be enacted by presidential decrees (e.g. in Belarus), government decrees (by the cabinet of ministers), parliament decisions, or by ministerial decrees. Further, the regulative framework in all countries contains technical instructions that as rule are legal documents enacted by the respective ministry or the state agency in charge of forestry. Such technical instructions describe in detail aspects of forestry, like the forest inventory and management planning, determination of amounts and areas of timber harvest, logging operations, marking and accounting for timber, afforestation and reforestation and other forestry works. In some countries the detailed legal and regulatory frameworks may lead to overregulation and too many restrictions on the decision making by immediate forest users and forestry administrations of various levels thus actually hampering the adaptive management of forests.

Forest lands are defined as a distinct category. Other categories of relevance are lands of protected areas, agricultural lands, lands of water objects and lands of urban areas and settlements. Forests by the definition of the Forest Codes as well as other tree and shrub vegetation not falling under the definition of forests can be found on lands of all these categories. This situation bears the potential 37 of legal duplications, contradictions and gaps. Ownership and use-rights on lands and on the forests growing on them can potentially belong to different legal entities or physical persons. Other adjacent legislation is required for the implementation of the forest sector legislation, e.g. legislation on administrative legal violations and the criminal codes, on local self-governance bodies and their competencies on forests and other resources as well as legislation regulating tender procedures for the provision of goods and services to the state or for the allocation of leases and concessions. This legislation is generally in place in all programme countries, but inconsistencies and gaps as well as regulations hindering effective governance and management of forests do exist. Legal and regulatory frameworks in some of the programme countries specifically address forests of \u201clocal importance\u201d and/or provide opportunities for community forestry, private forests and involvement of the local administrations and self-governance bodies and other stakeholders in decision making. In the following paragraphs specific findings of relevance for the governance of local forests in the programme countries are presented. Armenia The Forest Code, adopted in 2005, provides the standard set of regulations. It includes the opportunity to develop communal forest management. Forests can be owned by the municipalities and state owned forest can be handed over into management for periods up to ten years by communes without tender. Azerbaijan The Forest Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan was adopted in 1997 and refers to the forest fund as well as to other tree and shrub vegetation, including trees and shrubs on agricultural and other land, shelterbelts, trees and shrubs in urban areas and on private plots. Several sections and articles of the Forest Code explicitly regulate only issues of the forest fund. The regulation of these aspects in relation to tree and shrub vegetation not included in the forest fund is consequently missing. Several bylaws were adopted before the Forest Code, most bylaws immediately after the Forest Code. The Law of Azerbaijan \u201cOn administration municipal lands\u201d regulates the allocation to users of lands belonging to the municipalities. These can be lands with trees and shrubs not belonging to the forest fund. Belarus The acting Forest Code has been adopted in 2000 and was amended several times since then. The Ministry of Forestry has prepared a new draft Forest Code, which passed the first two readings in the Chamber of the Representatives of the National Assembly of Belarus. Presidential Decrees and bylaws adopted by the Council of Ministers define most details of the use and protection of forests. The Presidential Decree #214/7 May 2007 \u201cOn several measures for the improvement of activities in the sphere of forestry\u201d adopted a number of bylaws that in detail regulate key issues of use and protection of forests, including: \uf0b7 Rules on the release of standing timber (on the roots) and its harvest in the forests of the Republic of Belarus; \uf0b7 Rules for the sale of timber at the domestic market of the Republic of Belarus; 38 \uf0b7 Bylaw on the state forest protection of the Republic of Belarus and list of official persons carrying out the functions of forest protection;13 \uf0b7 Bylaw on the allocation of forest sections for lease by legal entities and (or) for forest use14; \uf0b7 Rules for the designation of forests by groups and categories of protection and the change of these designations as well as the determination of specially protected forest sections15. \uf0b7 Bylaws adopted by the Government of the Republic of Belarus regulating the key issues of: o Forest inventory and management planning, state census and cadastre of forests as well as forest monitoring; o Control of forest conditions, use, protection and regeneration of forests; o Issuing of permitting documents for forest use; and o Age of forests at logging. The aforementioned legislation on forestry is completed by a number of technical instructions adopted by the Ministry of Forestry, which determine all practical aspects of the methods and technologies applied in forest management planning, forest regeneration, forest fire", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0164ea1-7b09-468a-8b2a-eba45078bb99": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0164ea1-7b09-468a-8b2a-eba45078bb99", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d8fcfab1a48a8127be321ddaf8eee709157699b1cfb381b2cb1221f3b86ec5a"}, "3": {"node_id": "2c8779e3-9ec0-4e9b-8a5d-7d94994481cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e6f09cd2ccc2436862b6c71ffd6f44beb4d1f9b27bc44c61c8a5e2e3bf30631"}}, "hash": "09e670cae8c2a08152323a1bd481f1eb4f91185e222e291ead24a962937bbcda", "text": "protection, determination and assessment of cutting areas and amounts, cutting, inspection of forest sections where forestry works are carried out. The acting legislation is very comprehensive and provides together with the technical rules a rather narrowly determined framework for the implementation of all elements of forestry on the ground. These detailed bylaws bear the risk of overregulation and may sometimes hinder adaptive management. Further, national experts of ENPI-FLEG considered the regulations on lease of forests as contradictory and inadequate. Georgia The Forest Code of Georgia enacted in 1999 has been amended in 2009, 2010 (two times), 2011 (six times), and 2013. Some rules and regulations of the acting Forest Code do not fully correspond to the actually intended forest policy. A new Forest Code is under development. During the time of adoption of the acting Forest Code basically all forests of Georgia belonged to the state forest fund in the narrow sense. The Forest Code is vague about what regulations apply to the entire forest fund and what regulations concern only the state forest fund managed by the NFA. The implementation of the regulations of the Forest Code is specified in a number of bylaws. Bylaws of importance for the governance of local forests include: \uf0b7 \u201cRegulation on the order of the determination of forests of local significance\u201d16; \uf0b7 \u201cRules of Forest Inventory, Planning and Monitoring\u201d17; \uf0b7 \u201cOn development and approval of forest use plan\u201d18; \uf0b7 \u201cOn approval of regulations on the rules and terms of issuing licenses (i.e. concessions, the Consultant) for use of forest\u201d19; \uf0b7 \u201cOn establishing boundaries of state forest fund\u201d20; \uf0b7 \u201cOn general care and reforestation\u201d21; 13All adopted by Presidential Decree #214/7 May 2007 \u201cOn several measures for the improvement of activities in the sphere of forestry\u201d 14Presidential Decree from #444/9 September 2009 15Presidential Decree # 364/7 July 2008 16Decree of the Government of Georgia #105/May 23, 2007 17Decree of the Government of Georgia #179/2013 18Order of the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources #277/August 27, 2012 19Government Decree #132/August 11, 2005 20Government Decree #240/August 13, 2010 21Government Decree #241/August 13; 2010 39 \uf0b7 \u201cOn approval of rules of forest use\u201d22; \uf0b7 \u201cOn the exclusion and inclusion of certain plots of the State Forest Fund\u201d23. Bylaws were subject to frequent changes and for instance the Government Decree \u201cOn approval of regulations on the rules and terms of issuing licenses for use of forest\u201d #132/2005 (on the assignment of long-term forest concessions) has been changed sixty times until 2012 and the Government Decree #242/2010 \u201cOn approval of the rules of forest use\u201d 27 times. These changes have not always removed contradictions in the legislation but some have even added inconsistency and have caused instability of the regulatory framework. The Code of Georgia on Local Self-Government (2014) regulates the mandate and rights of local self-governance bodies on natural resources, including forests, within the boundaries of the respective administrative territorial units. Moldova The acting Forest Code24 defines the forest fund and the categories of ownership as well as competencies of local public administration authorities. Local public administration authorities own communal forests as well as lands covered by tree and shrub vegetation but not considered being part of the forest fund. Communal forests are not specifically regulated in the acting Forest Code, but the new edition that is currently under preparation by Moldsilva in cooperation with ENPI FLEG will contain own sections (Chapters) dedicated to private and communal forests and the specifics of their management. The Land Code (1991, amended several times since then, last in 2013) mentions the use of forest lands for agricultural land-use and the expropriation of forest lands. Russia The forest legislation of the Russian Federation has been substantially changed with the adoption of the new Forest Code25, which came into force at January 1, 2007. This Forest Code stipulates forest use and management by private leaseholders and delegates substantial functions from the federal level to the regions and also to the private sector. For instance, forest protection, including forest fire prevention and control, became a task of private leaseholders and, outside of leased forests, of the regions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c8779e3-9ec0-4e9b-8a5d-7d94994481cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c8779e3-9ec0-4e9b-8a5d-7d94994481cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d8fcfab1a48a8127be321ddaf8eee709157699b1cfb381b2cb1221f3b86ec5a"}, "2": {"node_id": "c0164ea1-7b09-468a-8b2a-eba45078bb99", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09e670cae8c2a08152323a1bd481f1eb4f91185e222e291ead24a962937bbcda"}}, "hash": "7e6f09cd2ccc2436862b6c71ffd6f44beb4d1f9b27bc44c61c8a5e2e3bf30631", "text": "The Forest Code immediately after its adoption became subject to substantial criticism by experts and by NGOs, among them those that had been involved in its elaboration, but the majority of whose suggestions had been rejected by the lawmakers26.

In the acting Forest Code the spheres covered by the forest legislation are poorly defined and a clear definition of forests is lacking. This leads to uncertainties about the applicability of the Forest Code and related regional laws and bylaws. The Forest Code mentions as key principle the participation of citizens and civil society organization in the preparation of decisions potentially impacting on forests, but lacks any specific regulation how this principle is to be implemented. The Forest Code poorly regulates selective cuttings, clear cuts in protection forests and the construction of buildings in the frame of so called recreational use of forests thus risking the destruction of valuable forests. These risks are exacerbated by the lack of mandatory environmental assessment of projects related to the use of forests and the forest fund. The abolition of the federal state forest protection and the delegation of its functions to the regions and to private leaseholders or concessionaires seriously hinder the prevention, control and liquidation of large scale forest fires as in European Russia in summer 2010 and in the Baikal region in summer 2015. For this reason also an increase in illegal logging is feared by experts (\u0428\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0446 et al., 2010), especially as the Forest Code does not contain a definition of \u201cillegal logging\u201d and does not stipulate any measures to combat illegal logging. The Forest Code and its implementation gives preference to the use and management of forests by large companies, while establishing serious barriers to the access to forest resources for local people and small and medium enterprises. This is expected to increase the problem of illegal logging outside of the areas leased by large companies (\u0428\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0446 et al., 2010). The legislation of the Russian Federation since 2007 does not any longer include any understanding of \u201clocal forests\u201d or \u201cagrarian forests\u201d. While the Forest Code states that forests can be located at lands of the forest fund as well as lands of other categories it formally applies only to forests on forest fund lands, on protected areas lands, on lands of defence and security as well as urban forests. Thus the Forest Code does not apply to a substantial part of the forests and shelterbelts, in the first place those located on lands of agricultural designation (\u0428\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0446 et al., 2010)28. Most \u201cagrarian\u201d forests, i.e. former kolkhoz forests, are located on such lands. There is a gap in the legislation provided by the Forest Code and by the acting bylaws on forestry, which however seems not to be recognized by the Federal Forestry Agency (Anonymous 201329). Subjects of the Russian Federation adopt their own legislation in accordance to the Forest Code of the Russian Federation on specific aspects of forest management in their competency. For instance the Irkutsk Region has its own laws \u201cOn the order of the harvest and collection by citizens of non- wood forest products for own needs\u201d, \u201cOn the order of collection of food forest resources and harvest of medicinal plants by citizens for own needs\u201d and \u201cOn the order and norms of harvest by citizens of wood for own needs in the Irkutsk Region\u201d and the Republic of Komi has its law \u201cOn the Regulation of forest relations\u201d, defining the mandates of state organs of the Republic of Komi in the sphere of forest relations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da1fd0ed-8db8-4027-8526-9a4510a3d6ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "da1fd0ed-8db8-4027-8526-9a4510a3d6ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8dd43b4edb78c11331b14036531bbb3324c1a9c950189830e5647fafab295de6"}, "2": {"node_id": "9425855d-8af1-4f85-ac10-e9a0994f87da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5d0b035266d08163da9a1c21b603f8496cf193efdc5c8961bef299567d61d2c6"}}, "hash": "9770567afa82f9fc7ce2b1322924514fc75d6dde44c62e82a01afd59ae599cc1", "text": "Similar laws in all Subjects of the Federation specify the provisions of the Forest Code under the local conditions.

The Forest Code, beyond the regulations what forests can be in \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership and the assignment of user-rights on these forests to \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises, does not establish substantial differences between the management and use of \u201ccommunal\u201d and state forests. A large number of bylaws regulate the details of the implementation of the forest code. Some bylaws, like the bylaw \u201cOn the confirmation of values for the calculation of the amount of damage caused to forest\u201d30 were adopted by the government, while a number of bylaws have been adopted at the level of the SFRA. Bylaws issued by the SFRA without registration by the Ministry of Justice have only internally binding character, i.e. their application is not mandatory for \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises and the forests they manage. These bylaws are in the practice taken by \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises as guidance. Representative of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises, of administrations and of rural councils expressed the need to improve and complete the legislation on \u201ccommunal\u201d forests (Zhyla et al. 2014). The definition of designations of the land categories \u201cforest lands\u201d and \u201cagricultural lands\u201d by the Land Code has impact on the inclusion of natural or planted forests on agricultural lands into the forest fund and the application of regular forest management. The Land Code provides the opportunity to change the designation of lands and to transfer state owned land into \u201ccommunally\u201d owned land. Other laws that influence forest management at local level are the law \u201cOn local self-governance in Ukraine\u201d, defining the authorities and functions of local councils and administrations without specific reference to forestry enterprises, and the \u201cCode on administrative legal violations\u201d, defining the authorities of various officials in the context of law enforcement. Component 1.3: Ownership and user right systems Ownership in the context of this Study concerns the ownership of land on which the forest is located, of the forest and the user-rights related to them, and the ownership of the forestry enterprise. These objects can be owned or be under management by different subjects. In the programme countries, as elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, the concept of \u201cownership\u201d is commonly not very sharply defined and its distinction from other form of possession or user rights is not always entirely clear. Forests in most countries can possibly be in state ownership and the government assigns only temporary or permanent management and user rights to, e.g., a state forestry enterprise. This can as well be the case if such user rights are assigned to a communal body. In such situations the state forestry enterprise or the communal body would formally not be the owner of the forest, but its permanent or long-term user. In contrast in some countries, e.g. in Moldova, the concept of public ownership includes state ownership and communal ownership as different ownership types. Thus the communal bodies in form of the Local Public Administrations (municipalities) are the owners of their forests. Ownership can have limits in terms of actual rights of the owners. In the program countries forests and the lands on which they grow that are in state or communal ownership cannot be sold or otherwise privatized. In Moldova a transfer of state owned forest into communal ownership is hardly 30Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers #655 from 23 July 2008 42 possible despite both types are public ownership. Limits of ownership rights as well consider the opportunity to transform forests into other forms of land and vice versa which are both legally restricted and require formal procedures that may involve the highest level of administration. Even the harvest of trees on privately owned lands and in forest stands established by the landowner can be substantially restricted, thus limiting the ownership rights. Permanent land-use right is a concept inherited from the Soviet Union and still widely applied in the programme countries. Usually forests managed by state forest enterprises are under permanent land-use rights by these entities. This means these entities are formally not the owner of these lands and the forests on them, and are accordingly not allowed to sell them. All other rights and obligations can be similar to those of an owner, with certain restrictions and some decision making authority kept at higher levels in the state forest administration and/or the different levels of territorial administrations. Temporary user rights can be assigned for several years as temporary management (e.g. in Armenia), concession (Georgia) or lease (all countries). These temporary user-rights are usually restricted in terms of allowable activities and resource use.

In Georgia logging for timber is in the user-rights of long-term concession and in Russia of long-term leases. Lease of forests in Moldova does not include the right to harvest trees, but is restricted to non-extractive use, i.e. erection of temporary structures for recreational use, while at the same time the leaseholder is not entitled to restrict access of others to NWFP. Short-term use of forests can be possible without special permits or in the basis of required permits. In all programme countries access of citizens to forests outside of protected areas and the collection of NWFP like fruits and mushrooms for personal use do not require any permit and (as the case in Moldova) can sometimes even not be restricted by leaseholders. The harvest of NWFP for commercial purposes requires permits by the entity in whose possession the forest is, but individual households collecting for small-scale sale, which make up the majority of NWFP users, are in the practice usually not required to obtain such permits. The resulting open-access situation has caused concerns about overuse and degradation of certain resources in heavily frequented areas, e.g. in Belarus (Lazarava, 2014). Access to timber is comparably restricted. In Belarus standing timber can be sold at auctions or harvested by the state forestry enterprises and then be auctioned. Some countries, in particular Armenia, Azerbaijan and Moldova, have all their forests assigned to a category that formally prohibits logging as main use and thus restricts the harvest of trees to various forms of maintenance cutting. Access of individuals, including local people, to timber and fuel wood is formally restricted. In none of the countries individuals are permitted to harvest timber for commercial use, but are forced to buy it from forestry enterprises, via auctions or otherwise on the free market. Also harvest of timber for personal needs is either very restricted (Georgia, Russia) or prohibited. Access to fuel wood is easier and in all program countries, except Moldova and Ukraine, local households can obtain permits to collect standing or lying wood as fuel wood, usually from trees or areas marked by the responsible forest rangers. Amounts of fuel wood per household can be limited and access can be restricted to local villages only (e.g. in Armenia and Georgia). In all countries and in most areas the ownership and/or user rights on land and forest resources formally belonging to the forest fund are more or less defined. Most noticeable, unresolved issues concern the \u201cforests of local importance\u201d in Georgia, which should be in the ownership of the municipalities but with few exceptions still remain in the ownership of the central level state and in the possession of the National Forestry Agency. The ownership and user rights situation of tree and 43 shrub vegetation or forests on lands not belonging to the forest fund is in many cases less clear. Although the land owner might be recognized, e.g. a private owner or the municipality, his rights to use the trees on his land might not be well defined or even be formally restricted. This uncertainty about ownership and user rights presents disincentives to afforestation and forest development by natural succession outside of the boundaries of the forest fund and to the sustainable management of such stands and can even encourage illegal clearing. The specific situation in terms of local forests, their ownership and user right systems are in brief explained by countries in the table below and in the following paragraphs. Table 8.

Ownership and management are legally possible, but do exist in very small scale only (officially 0.01% of the forest area). No legal access to wood for harvest by local people, only delivery by forestry unit; NWFP open access without restrictions. Armenia Forests can be in state, communal and private ownership. Local self-administration bodies, i.e. municipalities, in accordance to the Forest Code have the \u201cright of possession, use, disposal and forest management of municipal forests as well as of management of state forests given in municipal management\u201d. State owned forests can be leased or assigned for management to forest users for up to ten years with possible renewal, in the case of municipalities without tender. Despite these legal opportunities, currently neither do communally owned nor do communally managed forests exist in Armenia. All forest areas still are exclusively state-owned, including those lands located inside administrative limits of the communes. According to official cadastral data around 33% of the land designation category \u201cforest areas\u201d are located inside of the administrative boundaries of communes (sub-districts). However, the definition of forest lands applied in the classification by the Land Code contains both forest covered and not forest covered areas. An open issue in this context is the status of shrub-lands that are included in the category of forest lands by the Land Code, but are not mentioned in the Forest Code. The majority of these shrub-lands (82%) are located within the boundaries of rural communes, according to cadastral data from 2007. (Gevorgyan, 2009) In 2004 a World Bank project on poverty alleviation planned pilots on communal forest management in 13 villages, project activities started in seven villages and management was handed over in three or four villages. These communes established communal forest management organizations with project support. The pilots were not sustainable beyond the project lifetime because of lack of economic viability and missing community attitude. (Petrosyan, Hayantar, pers. comm. 2015) Cutting of trees is done only by the workers of Hayantar and by brigades authorized by Hayantar. These are typically brigades, who log the trees themselves and transport logs on trucks. People are not allowed to harvest trees themselves. Surveys showed that in 2003 40% of the households collected fuelwood directly from the forest, dropping to 28% in 2010. The demand for fuelwood by households as well as restaurants and the demand in timber exceed the legal supply several times. It is likely that most demand is met by brigades who cut and extract more trees than permitted, with the explicit or implicit approval and support of persons charged with forest management.

(Balyan, CPC Armenia, in lit. 2016) Citizens have the right to access forests owned by the state and by municipalities and to collect there wild growing plants for their personal needs.In the reality even commercial users do not take permits. It is planned to annul the respective requirement in the Forest Code. (Vardanyan, pers. comm. 2015) Azerbaijan According to the Forest Code the forest fund belongs to the state, is its property and the lands of the forest fund are not subject to privatization. Forests are managed by local units of the central level forest administration. In contrast, tree and shrub vegetation located on not forest fund lands, being in the property of a physical or legal person, belongs to it based on property rights, but use of trees and shrubs has to be carried out by the proprietor according to requirements of the forest and other legislation. Not privatized lands with tree and shrub vegetation outside of the forest fund are in the property of the municipality and can be assigned to permanent or temporary land-users. The acting Forest Code allows for maintenance cutting, sanitary cutting, regeneration cutting as well as other cutting if they support the improvement of the tree and shrub vegetation and the fulfilment of its functions. In the practice, however, the respective state agencies usually do no permit the cutting of trees and shrubs outside of the forest fund by the respective land-users. In the forests of the state forestry enterprise people can obtain permits to harvest trees marked by the forest rangers as fuel wood. The forests and other tree and shrub vegetation can be used by people for recreation, beekeeping and use of NWFP (bee-keeping, collection of fruits, and limited grazing at the edges of tree and shrub areas with not too dense stands) without the need for special permission. Belarus The Constitution of the Republic of Belarus determines that all forests are in the exclusive ownership of the state. But there can also be lands with tree and shrub vegetation outside of the forest fund. The Ministry of Forestry possesses 87.7% of the forest fund area; the remaining belongs to various other state entities. The state possessor of the forest fund lands assigns these for their management to legal entities carrying out forestry, in the case of the Ministry of Forestry to state forestry enterprises. Forest use is partly restricted by the designation of forests to groups and protection categories. 31Adopted by Government Decision in 2011 32 http://www.enpi-fleg.org/news/2015-fleg-roadshow-the-hotline-between-yerevan-and-your-village/ 46 Forests can be leased for up to 15 years, e.g. for the harvest of wild fruits. For logging operations forest can be leased only by especially listed specialized organizations, and for shorter periods. Only legal entities can lease forests for logging and for recreation. Leaseholders have to pay a leasing fee and in addition the fee for the use of the resource use, while users have to pay only the resource use fee, but no lease fee. Forest plots can be assigned at the same time to different users for different types of use. Standing timber for final logging (main use) is partly sold through the timber stock exchange by the Open Joint Stock Company \u201cBelarussian Universal Commodity Exchange\u201d and the remaining standing timber is allocated to the state forestry enterprise for logging and sale as well via the above mentioned stock exchange. In the domestic timber market natural persons and legal entities can purchase logged timber, and natural persons for their personal use as well standing timber (damaged and dead trees) outside of the stock exchange. Timber harvested by private enterprises is mostly processed for the production of furniture and construction materials while most wood harvested by citizens is fuel wood. Self-harvesting of fuel wood by local people is also permitted on the basis of forest permits on plots marked by the forest ranger. The fee for the self-harvest is very low. NWFP are used by individuals for their personal use without the need for a special permit. However, in the practice NWFP like fruits and mushrooms are often sold by these collectors and this practice is tolerated, despite the formal need for a permit in case of commercial collection of NWFP. The assignment of use rights on areas for collection of NWFP is not much developed, more areas are assigned for tourism and hunting.

Private ownership of forests by natural persons or legal entities does not yet play a major role, and this type of ownership is of relevance only for new afforestation areas. It will become formally recognized in the new Forest Code, which is currently under preparation. Communal ownership by municipalities is usually seen as a form of state ownership. Accordingly, the Forest Code treats the \u201cLocal Forest Fund\u201d as part of the \u201cState Forest Fund\u201d. However, the \u201cRegulation on the order of the determination of forests of local significance\u201d33 regulates \u201cforests of local significance\u201d as separate from the \u201cState Forest Fund\u201d and interviewed stakeholders referred to municipality (i.e. communal) ownership as a form of ownership different from state ownership (Case Study Georgia). The Forest Code establishes that the Local Forest Fund is managed (but not owned, the Consultant) by the self-governance units \u201cwithin the scope of the authority granted by the legislation of Georgia and the requirements envisaged by the present Code\u201d. However, no proper legal definition is provided what forests actually belong to the \u201cLocal Forest Fund\u201d because of circular references within the legislation34, and the transfer of forests into communal ownership and management so far did not take place. The provision that forests within the boundaries of the respective self-governing unit \u201con the territories of the former kolkhoz forests and forest lands owned by Soviet Farming Administrations\u201d and \u201con the lands located next to the(se) territories\u201d are considered as forests of local importance would allow for the transfer of substantial forest areas into communal possession. The \u201cCode of Georgia on Local Self-Government\u201d (2014) states that local self-government units own (i.e. not just manage, the Consultant) the forests \u201chaving local importance\u201d on the territory of the self-governing unit and their management is in the \u201cexclusive authorities of the self-governance unit\u201d. The MENRP and the NFA see this exclusiveness as removing any outside control by the state 33Government Decree #105/2007 34\u201cRegulation on the order of the determination of forests of local significance\u201d (Government Decree #105/2007) and Forest Code 1999. 47 on forest management and use by the municipalities, as it happened in the case of the forests handed over to the municipality of Tbilisi. The transfers of forests in Tusheti into the management by the local self-governance body of Akhmeta municipality occurred on the basis of the legislation on the Protected Landscape as a protected area managed by the local municipality. Since the transfer of forests in 2012 their use, which formerly was mainly illegal, occurs in accordance to clear rules35, which provide very restricted use opportunities for local use and only for selective (sanitary) cuttings. State forests under the NFA are allocated for short-term (up to one year, or seasonal) or long-term (up to 49 years, concessions) forest use. Forest use permits for short term use, for instance the harvest of fuel wood, are issued by the local representations (usually located in the municipalities) of the NFA for limited time periods and specific areas. Local people shall be given priority in receiving cutting permits for defined amounts of fuel wood per household. Local stakeholders complain that access to fuel wood is hampered by late allocation of permits and difficult accessible and remote harvest locations assigned (Case Study Georgia). Local household can apply for the allocation of standing timber at their local municipality. The municipality would forward the list of applicants to the region level administration (governor\u2019s office) for submission of the application to the NFA. The NFA decides about allocation of timber and sends the approved list of household names to the bank, where the household representative pays the fee. The local forester assigns the standing the timber and after cutting the forester has issues a special permission for transportation of the timber out of the forest. (Kavtarishvili, CPC Georgia, in lit. 2016) However, municipality representatives complained to the Consultant that local households do not have direct access to construction timber from the forests, neither for personal construction nor for fencing and vineyard poles. It is not clear if local households either do not know about the procedure or find it too complicated or, if despite the existence of the procedure, the access to timber is not approved in the practice.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c1608ddc-41c8-42c6-9c6b-b333feaa47f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "c1608ddc-41c8-42c6-9c6b-b333feaa47f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f29549ef356f8454c37b3c02c616c2be4e9d1400205876254f6d06b24a09f461"}, "2": {"node_id": "c5518436-908a-4123-93d3-3678c530292e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "390f2bddd3e0947456b0c74dea5526e37eaf17ace6373286613bbc1b11e55521"}}, "hash": "6bc6f19d485159244f2898736eed63c3a92b87be60654bc51f199e9eed185f0f", "text": "The lack of direct access to timber has also affected local wood processing businesses.

Local people are not allowed to use the concession areas to collect as fuel wood commercially valueless dead wood and logging remnants. At the other hand concessionaires are blamed for not implementing any forest management except harvest and even for logging outside of the assigned areas. (Case Study Georgia) Moldova In Moldova forests can be in the ownership of the state (managed by Moldsilva), ownership of municipalities and in private ownership. The latter concerns only forests established by private land- users on formerly not forested lands. Communal forests are managed separately from state (i.e. Moldsilva) forests, which can exist alongside communal forests within the administrative boundaries of municipalities. Despite separate 35in accordance to rules for forests of protected areas defined in the Government Decree #242/2010 36 According to Government Decree #132/2005, amended 2006 48 ownership and management, people have access to the state forests too. Moldsilva has assisted in the afforestation or reforestation of some communal forest areas, which for this purpose are in temporary management by this state agency. Responsibility and full ownership are given back to the municipalities after 7 years, when the plantation is considered as established closed forest cover. Some municipalities would like to take back former kolkhoz forests, which had been transferred to Moldsilva in the 1990s; but Moldsilva resists against such a transfer. The transfer of forests from the State Forest Fund (i.e. forests managed by Moldsilva) to the municipalities, even the exchange of forest plots of equal size for realignment boundaries to create larger sections, is considered legally not possible. However, long-term use agreements might provide opportunities to include sections of forests owned by Moldsilva into the management by municipalities. Also municipalities can hand over the use rights on the local forests to Moldsilva on the basis of collaboration agreements. Non-wood forest products (NWFP) can be harvested by the local people without special permit for their own use and independent of lease contracts. Forest areas can be leased by individuals and legal entities. No cutting of trees is allowed for the leaseholders, only light housing (without fundament) can be erected and use of NWFP remains open access. Russia In the Russian Federation forest sections on lands of the forest fund are federally owned and cannot be transferred into communal ownership, while forests on other land categories can be in different ownership as defined by the land legislation. In this context forest stands on lands of the category of agricultural designation are of significance. The extent in which the regulations of the Forest Codes are to be applied to forests on such agricultural lands, to which a substantial area of former kolkhoz forests belongs, is not entirely clear, a problem repeatedly criticized by civil society organizations and other stakeholders (\u0428\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0446 et al., 2010; Anonymous, 2013/201437). Attempts have been made to change the land category designation of areas with \u201cagrarian\u201d forests from agricultural lands to forestry lands, e.g. in Yaroslavl region. These changes affected the lease contracts that had been concluded by the possessors of the agricultural lands and were challenged by them in court cases. In the result the court annulled the respective decisions and designated the land category back to agricultural lands. Some of these forests due to their status have been intensively logged, as the owners considered them not being of different status than any other agricultural crop. (Anonymous 201238) In other cases, e.g. in Rostov region, companies privatized such forests for large scale logging, leading to the alienation from their user rights of leaseholders and local people (Anonymous 2013/201439). These cases illustrate the uncertainty in terms of ownership and user rights on forests on agricultural lands that can make up a significant part of the local and in particular of the former kolkhoz forests in some regions. Forests can be in permanent use, limited use of other possessors\u2019 forest sections (servitude), lease and temporary use without payment.

Civil society organizations have criticized this regulation because the requirement of lease contracts presents a substantial barrier for local people in forest areas, where small scale collection and sale of NWFP provides the main source of income.40 Owners of forests located on private agricultural lands have challenged the free access by people and their right to harvest for personal use (Anonymous 2013/201441). According to ENPI-FLEG (2014) in some regions (e.g. Chelyabinsk Oblast) collecting of mushrooms and berries requires permits, in other regions use of such \u201cminor\u201d products does not. Timber harvest by citizens or legal entities has to be based on lease of forests. Logging by federal state organizations can be based on permanent use rights. Only in exceptional cases for the needs of the state or municipalities cutting of trees can be based on contracts of sale of forest stands. These regulations and requirements significant limit the opportunities of small and medium enterprises to get access to timber and negatively impact on their economic viability.42 Citizens can as well get the right to harvest wood for their personal use as fuel wood or construction timber. This access is based on sale contracts, which are issued in accordance to the regulations and procedures provided by the legislation of the respective Federal Subjects. These regulations are very incoherent between the regions and do not sufficiently take into account the specifics of the local needs and of the forest resources. (\u041f\u0440\u043e\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u043d, \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432, 2010) The procedures for getting permits (contracts of sale) to cut fuel wood (even dead trees) and timber for personal use are time consuming and complicated, but illegal use by local people can be heavily penalized43. Further, in many regions the lease by logging companies of forests close to villages affects this access right of local people. NGOs and forestry experts had suggested that local forests around villages of a size of 5 ha per inhabitant should be exempt from commercial leases in order to provide the local people with the opportunity to realize their right of use of wood for personal use.44 So far this suggestion has not been introduced in the legislation. Ukraine The Land Code of Ukraine (2001) first provided for the opportunity of \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership (i.e. by sub-national territorial administrative units) of forest lands which would be permanently assigned for land use by \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises. This provision contradicted the Forest Code acting this time, which limited ownership on forests exclusively to the state. Only the new Forest Code of 2006 established the existence of state, \u201ccommunal\u201d and private forest ownership in accordance to the acting Land Code. In \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership are primarily the forests within the boundaries of settlements (towns, villages). Also forests outside of settlement boundaries can be in \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership under the condition that lands in state and communal ownership are delimitated. Permanent use by \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises would only be newly assigned for forests on lands in \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership. But user-rights that have been assigned to \u201ccommunal\u201d users earlier on forests on lands in state ownership would stay in force. The issue of delimitation of lands in state and \u201ccommunal\u201d ownership, which is important for the determination of management and user rights on local forests, is discussed under component 3.3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "574cc017-b078-45cf-9422-8e87c87b095b": {"__data__": {"id_": "574cc017-b078-45cf-9422-8e87c87b095b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "01e98e6c1c0c858e34fb15c8402d45f67f356a8110a2cd704df7db28b0fe405d"}, "2": {"node_id": "e6001453-c25b-4c11-a6b4-6c795856b6ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "17972f52cab636579f82748b339c4546cb646ef3abbdce44406d9626f336bcf0"}}, "hash": "1eeb67fcd43ece7b195dcec386e8767edb1ca84e5756cb301dbddf3272562a48", "text": "40http://www.wwf.ru/data/forests/ye_popravki_k_lesnomu_kodeksu_9_oktybry_2009.doc 41http://forestforum.ru/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=11860 42http://www.wwf.ru/data/forests/ye_popravki_k_lesnomu_kodeksu_9_oktybry_2009.doc 43http://forestforum.ru/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=16200 44http://www.wwf.ru/data/forests/ye_popravki_k_lesnomu_kodeksu_9_oktybry_2009.doc 50 A typical ownership and use right scheme of \u201ccommunal\u201d forests looks as follows: \uf0b7 \u201cCommunal\u201d forest lands and the forests growing on these are owned by the commune; \uf0b7 Permanent user-rights on the \u201ccommunal\u201d forest lands are assigned (or in process of being assigned) to the region forestry enterprise; \uf0b7 Management of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forests is delegated by the region forestry enterprise to district forestry enterprises or district forestry units; \uf0b7 Region forestry enterprises are \u201ccommunal\u201d enterprises, owned by the region council, possibly co-owned by region councils; \uf0b7 District forestry enterprises are legal entities, daughter enterprises of and owned by the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2202a77e-0731-4bc5-b826-fbcdb141a7e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "2202a77e-0731-4bc5-b826-fbcdb141a7e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f48388cfb0e6922df47c456da80a8459e511c11d74887533cdd23031413f821"}, "3": {"node_id": "5cd21fcf-9660-40ab-aea5-07efaa225b1f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa590307b3cb4b9623e209c357ef98a1ce254a7670db55eb03b3aef39a9bb904"}}, "hash": "b55654bac31593a141a14f261064e8b6791f894dc0c6b11659e9e40d42428d70", "text": "region forestry enterprises, or alternatively, district forestry units are branches of region forestry enterprises. The situation can vary between regions, e.g. in Khmelnytsky and Cherkasy regions \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises are owned by the district councils (Zhyla in lit. 2016), and this scheme of ownership is not always fully developed. In particular the ownership of lands and the permanent use-rights are not always formally certified. In some regions the Ministry for Agricultural Policy and Food either owns forestry enterprises and/or is in charge of state owned forest not belonging to the SFRA. Forests can also be leased by natural persons and legal entities. Leaseholders have to pay annual lease fees and a one-time fee for \u201ccompensation of damage\u201d caused by the use of the leased forest. There is no limit on the size of leased areas, but usually leaseholders would lease small areas to avoid large compensation payments. The decision making on lease requires agreement from the rural council, the region forestry enterprise and the region state forestry department. This involvement of various parties also illustrates the unclear ownership and user-rights on forests and forest lands. All harvest of wood and timber is done by the forestry enterprises or their contractors. Other legal entities and private persons are not permitted to cut standing trees or even collect logging remnants or dead wood. Local people have access to forests independent of the ownership type and can use NWFP for their personal needs. Military forests are also accessible for people as any other forest, except for temporary restrictions during exercises. In the practice NWFP are harvested by everybody without restrictions, where enough resources are available also for commercial purposes (sold at market). With the open access to NWFP resources no restrictions can be established in the interest of their sustainable use. Livestock grazing in forests is generally prohibited. Component 1.4: Mandates of forestry organizations and territorial decision making bodies and administrations At the national level the programme countries have either a forestry agency under or within a ministry (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Russia) or directly under the government (Moldova, Ukraine). Belarus has a specialized Ministry of Forestry. The mandates of these national level forestry agencies include the development of policies and legislation (to be adopted by the government or parliament), regulation, planning, supervision and control of forest management that can be carried out by branches of the national level forestry agency (Armenia, Georgia), by subordinated state forestry enterprises (all other programme countries), municipalities (Moldova, Georgia) and \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises (Ukraine) and/or leaseholders/concessionaires (Belarus, Georgia, Russia). 51 The forestry enterprises or branches of national agencies usually consist of local forestry units (Rus. lesnichestvo \u2013 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e) without the status of legal entities on their own. These forestry units are in charge of all silvicultural and harvest activities or they control their implementation by contractors, concessionaires, leaseholders and/or other forest users. The forestry enterprises have also law enforcement and forest protection mandates. The law enforcement mandate of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises in Ukraine is limited and does not include the same competencies as are in the mandate of state forestry enterprises. Forestry organizations at sub-national level exist in most countries with substantial mandates in Russia (Federal Subjects), Belarus and Ukraine, while in other countries fulfilling rather intermediary administrative functions. In Ukraine the region state forest administration have decision making authority and control over key aspects of forest use by \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises. Forest inventory and management planning are in the mandate of the national level forestry agencies, which have either an internal specialized department (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia) or a subordinated organization (Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine). Ministries in charge of environmental protection have mandates related to the control of the forest sector as well as direct forest protection and law enforcement mandates in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova and Ukraine. In Belarus this mandate is with the State Inspection for the Protection of Animal and Plant World under the President, which is independent of any ministry. The mandate of district authorities in most programme countries is limited and includes participation in the development and implementation of forest related programmes and activities. Only in Belarus the district authorities have a substantial mandate that includes decision making on a number of forest related issues. In the practice there district authorities do not have sufficient technical capacity to fulfil these mandates and rely on the state forestry enterprises for preparing the necessary decisions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5cd21fcf-9660-40ab-aea5-07efaa225b1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5cd21fcf-9660-40ab-aea5-07efaa225b1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f48388cfb0e6922df47c456da80a8459e511c11d74887533cdd23031413f821"}, "2": {"node_id": "2202a77e-0731-4bc5-b826-fbcdb141a7e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b55654bac31593a141a14f261064e8b6791f894dc0c6b11659e9e40d42428d70"}}, "hash": "aa590307b3cb4b9623e209c357ef98a1ce254a7670db55eb03b3aef39a9bb904", "text": "However, these mandates provide at least a formal basis for substantial participation of the local administrative level in decision making on local forests.

The mandates related to local forests of national forest agencies and their subordinated forestry enterprises are in most cases clear and mutually supportive. Where local forests are in communal (Moldova) or sub-national (Ukraine) ownership or management, the mandates of the national forestry agencies and their branches interfere in some extent with the mandates of the owners/managers of local forests, whose mandates in terms of decision making and/or law enforcement are limited compared to those of the state forestry agencies. In contrast, in Georgia the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Protection (MENRP) and its National Forestry Agency (NFA) would have very limited if any mandate on local forests if these would be, as stipulated by the law, in the exclusive authority of the municipalities. This situation is already experienced in the city of Tbilisi where after the takeover of the forests in the city boundaries and their designation as \u201cgreen plantations\u201d or \u201crecreational zones\u201d the MENRP and NFA do not have any mandate anymore. In the Russian Federation the abolition of the federal state forest protection and the transfer to the regions and leaseholders of its mandate on protection of forests against fire and illegal logging had a negative impact on the forests. After this transfer of the mandate large scale forest fires and illegal logging had a massive negative impact on some of the country\u2019s forests.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7831b3e3-efc9-4baa-b651-c161cb0cb96f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7831b3e3-efc9-4baa-b651-c161cb0cb96f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c982d3cb6cd8b324e7c9cba414611d5b29ece7b8d9121ce2d76778cb17cdb3d"}, "2": {"node_id": "d69e2359-f08c-431d-b827-b54c7ef66fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8196f85071eb1d9b946a516cc8962f1a83ba8c56e4b686954ce233a9180fda5d"}}, "hash": "fb87b2cc2e8c57d5ab34c803c76196d58f78dd609851b50e8f3f994d0c9a991c", "text": "The transfer of the mandate on forest use to leaseholders has affected the access of local households and small and medium enterprises to timber, fuel wood and NWFP.

The intended further division of mandates in Belarus\u2019 forest sector by separating timber harvest and processing from all silvicultural activities can have unintended negative consequences due to the separation of inextricably connected elements of forestry and the removal of incentives for sustainable forest use and management. Similarly, in the other programme countries expected positive and negative effects of possibly planned further separation and allocation of mandates to different agencies and different levels need to be carefully assessed before being implemented. So far only in Moldova the local level, i.e. the municipalities, keeps the mandates related to local forests. This would as well be the case in Georgia, if the acting legislation would be accordingly applied. With few exceptions, local forests in Georgia are neither defined nor transferred to the municipalities and the respective mandates are kept by the central level forestry agency NFA, 54 although being partly executed by its local offices. In particular, local stakeholders perceived as inappropriate the assignment of concessions by the central level. In Belarus mandates are divided between the central, sub-national and local level of the forestry agencies and the district authorities. While at the first glance this assignment of mandates looks rather centralized, in the practice it leads to sustainable forest management, satisfaction of the needs of local people and opportunities for local authorities to participate in decision making. In Ukraine, although \u201ccommunal\u201d forests formally exist, the mandates on these forests are with the forestry enterprises at region and district level and with the region state forest administrations thus being de-facto distant from the local level. Armenia The Ministry of Agriculture has the mandate of development and implementation of the state policies in the areas of preservation, protection, reproduction, and utilization of the forests. The Ministry of Agriculture is the state management body authorized by the Government in the field of guarding, protection, reproduction and use of state forests.45 The functions of development of policies and regulations are fulfilled by the Forestry Development Division under the Ministry\u2019s Department of Crop Production, Forestry and Plant Protection. The Ministry\u2019s State Forest Monitoring Centre has the mandate of forest monitoring and surveying of illegal forest logging. The Ministry has delegated all regulation, planning and supervision functions to its subordinated State Non-commercial Organization \u201cHayantar\u201d, which through its local forestry units is also in charge of all forest management on the ground. The former state forestry enterprises are since 200346 no longer legal entities but became regional branches of Hayantar. (Gevorgyan, 2009) The function of control of forest management is vested to the Ministry of Nature Protection since 2004 and is fulfilled by the Division of Forest Control of this Ministry\u2019s State Environmental Inspection. (Gevorgyan, 2009) The mandate for forest inventory and management planning is according to Gevorgyan (2009) in the Forest Experimental Research Centre under the Bio-resources Management Agency of the Ministry of Nature Protection. According to national experts (pers. comm. 2014/2015) forest inventories and management plans are elaborated by Hayantar. The mandate of territorial bodies of the regions (Arm. Marz) as defined by the Forest Code includes only participation in the development and implementation of forest related programmes and activities, but no decision making authority. By the opinion of Hayantar (Petrosyan, Hayantar, pers. comm. 2015) the rural councils (self- governance bodies at sub-district level), despite having their own administration and account, do not fulfil the institutional requirements for taking over forest management and would need to establish a special legal entity for this purpose. This statement seems to contradict the provisions by the Forest Code that explicitly include in the competencies of local self-government bodies the \u201cmanagement of state forests given for community management\u201d. Azerbaijan The Forestry Department of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources is in charge of regulation, control and oversight of forestry in the country. Its subordinated state forestry enterprises manage the forests locally. 45 Governmental decision #7-N/15 January 2004 46 Government decision #388-N/16 January 2003 55 The state forestry enterprises do not have any mandates in regard to tree and shrub vegetation on non-forest lands. However, in case of violations, the state forestry enterprise would be involved there as well in the assessment of the damage and confiscate the illegally harvested wood products.

For the management of the forests in the Ministry\u2019s possession subordinated structures exist at region and district level. The organizations at region - State Production Forestry Associations (Rus. \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f) - and district level - state forestry enterprises (Rus. leskhozes -\u043b\u0435\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044b) - are legal entities on their own, which are in a hierarchical subordination to the republic level Ministry of Forestry. The Ministry of Forestry establishes rules and procedures to be followed by the forest managers, advises the Government on forestry issues, plans country wide production targets and supervises its territorial (region) units in the six regions of the country. The specific mandate of the region level of the forestry administration, the state production forestry associations, is not defined by the Forest Code, but by the respective bylaws of these organizations. The state production forestry associations are in double subordination, under the Ministry of Forestry and under the respective region administration (Rus. oblispolkom \u2013 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u043c). These region level forestry organizations fulfil planning, control and production functions. The state forestry enterprises are subordinated to the respective region units of the Ministry of Forestry and at the same time to the local district administrations. State forestry enterprises have the mandate to manage the forests that are assigned to them for permanent use, and which are divided into forestry units (Rus. lesnichestva - \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430). The plans of the region level forestry organizations and the FMPs set the frame for the management decisions made by the state forestry enterprises. The state forestry enterprises fulfil the role of control and oversight in relation to their forestry units and to other forest users. The Forest Code states a number of mandates of the district councils and administrations in the sphere of forestry. In the reality the district administrations fulfil only a part of the functions assigned to them in the sphere of forestry, while the majority of these functions are fulfilled by the state forestry enterprises, which would prepare the decision that is then accordingly adopted by the district administration. The state enterprise BELGOSLES is the central unit with the monopoly for forest inventory and management planning. It is subordinated to the Ministry of Forestry. BELGOSLES does all forest inventory and management planning in the state forests of its Ministry as well as in forests in the possession of other entities, like railway and road protection belts for the Ministry of Transportation, as well as contract work in other countries. The potential for private services for forest inventory and management planning is now studied. 56 The mandates of forest protection and of control of forest use and management are assigned to the Ministry of Forestry and its subordinated structures, the state production forestry associations and the state forestry enterprises. Stakeholders and experts have criticized the combination of functions of state control and forest use within one organization as potentially leading to abuse and unauthorized harvest of forest resources. The official policy is now to divide management from economic functions. Independently of the organizations in charge of forestry, a strong mandate of control of all activities of the state forestry enterprises and of any other forest users as well as the prevention and prosecution of any illegal harvest of forest products and game animals is assigned to the State Inspection for the Protection of Animal and Plant World under the President47. Thus an independent external control and protection service is already in place.

Rosleskhoz is in charge of the coordination of organizational actions related to forest use, protection and renewal, including interregional cooperation; supervision over the execution by Federal Subjects of powers to govern forest delegated them; administration of payments and supervision of the use of federal budget 52Gov. Decree #847/2009 58 subventions by Federal Subjects; provision of public services and management of public property in the area of forest relations. Forests within federal PA are under direct jurisdiction of the MNR, which is executed by the Ministry\u2019s protected area administrations. The Federal Oversight Service for Natural Resource Management (Rospirodnadzor) directly or through its territorial bodies hasthe mandate of official inspection and oversight of compliance with the nature conservation legislation within PAs. (ENPI-FLEG 2014) Forests on lands of the Ministry of Defence are managed by this Ministry\u2019s subcontractors and are not controlled by Rosleskhoz. The management of forests within the boundaries of cities and towns is in the mandate of the respective municipalities. Federal mandates in the area of forest relations are implemented at the regional level through forestry departments in eight federal districts and the 83 Federal Subjects of the Russian Federation (FAO 2012). As far as forests are not leased, their management is carried out by local forestry units (lesnichestvo \u2013 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e) or forest parks (lesopark \u2013 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a) that are subordinated to the Federal Subjects. With the adoption of the new Forest Code in 2006 the functions of protection of forests against fire and illegal logging were entirely delegated from the federal level to the regions (Federal Subjects) and to the leaseholders. The previously existing federal state forest protection system was abolished (ENPI-FLEG 2014). At regional level the Ministries of Forestry (and analogous organizations) of Federal Subjects are in charge of the management of forests that are not assigned to leaseholders and of the control of forest management in leased forests. The following powers have been delegated to government authorities of the Federal Subjects: (1) elaboration and validation of forest plans, legal forestry regulations, implementation of state expertise on forest exploitation projects; (2) lease and concession of forest parcels, conclusion of contracts for purchase and sale of wood stock, organization and carrying out of wood auctions; (3) issuance of permits for undertaking geological works on forest land; (4) organization of management, conservation, protection and regeneration of forests; (5) maintenance of state forest register; (6) implementation of federal forest supervision; and (7) establishment of lists of officials authorized to perform federal forest supervision (FAO 2012). At local level the leaseholders are in charge of management of their leased forests. They can contract for this purpose either state forestry enterprises or specialized private companies. Forests that have developed through natural succession on abandoned agricultural lands can be used in an unregulated way by the possessors of these lands. Currently no organization has the mandate of control and management of these forest stands, but Rosleskhoz is making attempts to get such mandate assigned. Similarly the mandate of control and management of forests on agricultural lands that formerly had the status of kolkhoz forests is not properly defined. Ukraine The State Forest Resources Agency (SFRA) is the main state body in the forestry sector. Until 2012 the mandate of the SFRA included the right to bring up suggestions for new legislation. At the same time the SFRA carried the functions of execution of laws and of control of this execution.

Thus for the state forests the SFRA through its subordinated structures still carries the mandates of general supervision, administration, forest management and control. Further, the agency for forest inventory and management planning \u201cUkrderzhlisproekt\u201d is a structure of the SFRA. The territorial structures of the SFRA, i.e. the region state forest administrations and the state forestry enterprises, are not subordinated to any region, district or rural council or the respective local administrations. The State Ecological Inspection in a limited extent executes external control on the management of state forests as well as of \u201ccommunal\u201d and private forests. It has to approve the areas for main use felling (final logging). The mandates of forestry organizations and territorial decision making bodies and administrations in relation to \u201ccommunal\u201d forests are not clearly defined by law. The Consultant therefore relied on the statements by interviewed stakeholders which may in some extent reflect their perceptions but not entirely be in accordance to bylaws that formalize these mandates. The communes, as the basis level of local-self-governance, do not take any decisions about the management of forests, but have a person in charge of land division that may participate in the definition of forest areas boundaries. The mandates on \u201ccommunal\u201d forests are distributed over various institutions, varying from region to region: \uf0b7 The SFRA is mainly determining the overall forest sector policy and strategy of the state and through the development of bylaws directly influences on key aspects of forest management on the ground and on the economic situation of the forestry enterprises, independent of the type of ownership and user-rights of the enterprises and the forests they manage; \uf0b7 The forest inventory and management planning (FMP) is done by the only authorized institution, the agency Ukrderzhlisproekt under the SFRA; \uf0b7 The region state forest administrations issue forest cutting permits for main use felling and certificates of origin for export of timber, and they control all forest users, including the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises; \uf0b7 The State Ecological Inspection approves the size of annually harvested areas and amounts felled and deals with violations of forestry regulations in \u201ccommunal\u201d forests, \uf0b7 In some regions the region forestry enterprises coordinate, monitor and control the management of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forests by district forestry enterprises and make decisions on forest use by them; \uf0b7 The district forestry enterprises fulfil similar functions as the state forest enterprises do: they carry out all forest management activities in the frame of the FMP, propose cutting areas, issue forest cutting permits (except for main use felling), hire and oversee contractors; \uf0b7 The region forestry enterprises are controlled by and report to the region councils, while the district and rural councils do not have full authority over the district forestry enterprises; \uf0b7 District councils make the decisions on lease of forest lands and participate in the appointment of directors of district forestry enterprises; \uf0b7 Rural councils participate in the recruitment of the local forest rangers (Rus. lesnik - \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043a) and in decisions on lease. In contrast to the state forestry enterprises the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises do not possess the authority of issuing protocols and penalties for violations of forest regulations, but have to rely on the State Ecological Inspections to deal with offenders. 60 Overall, in the state forest the fulfilment of functions regarding decision making, management, forest use and control may benefit from a clearer separation of these functions and more control by a body independent from the SFRA. In what extent the State Ecological Inspection has such mandate is not clear. Zhyla et al. (2014) quoted that most stakeholders involved in the management of \u201ccommunal\u201d forests considered as serious insufficiency of the current system the lack of a central state organ in charge of overall oversight of forest management independent of the type of ownership. Component 1.5: Financial arrangements, economic instruments and benefit sharing In all programme countries the state forestry sector is directly connected to the central state budgets. State forestry organizations from the national level through the sub-national level to the local state forestry enterprises and forestry units in varying extent receive state budget funding that is often complemented by incomes from forestry activities, mainly from various fees paid by users for the use of forest resources and from the sale of forest products by the state forestry enterprises.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e778112-7bdf-4188-bace-1f6f440c1f7f": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e778112-7bdf-4188-bace-1f6f440c1f7f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "719c3c4a29b399305424c52a1f4d7d4afa1b974345c4d8631579f2afae0d67d3"}, "2": {"node_id": "a60db152-ffe2-4ccb-ba2d-341e10bb19ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d35cb223b4fb8da3cc5cf3e865e0240eb05e65e58650357e8e81ec05e6c7f85"}}, "hash": "7c8f3301aed383b33405f79b555121cfec0ef9b5a66b25df573e2775ad6d324f", "text": "This Regional Study did not assess the programme countries\u2019 ratio between state budget contributions to the forest sector, the financial contributions of the sector to the public revenues of the states and the net extent in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c761162-c0bf-412c-b2fe-1349d1cf68eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c761162-c0bf-412c-b2fe-1349d1cf68eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "adfc0de096735a6073f4385947995b71537594a63842fcd07a084219c4f5a276"}}, "hash": "adfc0de096735a6073f4385947995b71537594a63842fcd07a084219c4f5a276", "text": "which the state forest sectors are subsidized. There is a high complexity in the financial flows within the forest sector, between the sector and the public budgets of different levels as well as between these public budgets of different levels and gathering data on these financial flows would be very difficult. Stakeholders in all programme countries, except in Belarus, consider the budget available for the forest sector as insufficient. In several programme countries, like e.g. Belarus, Georgia and Russia, the official policy is and efforts are made to make the forestry sector economically efficient and reduce subsidies. In Georgia and Russia the spending on state forestry organizations has been substantially reduced leading to massive cuts of personnel (Georgia) and the abolishment of the federal state forest protection (Russia) while forest management and use were partly transferred to concessionaires and leaseholders. In Armenia, Azerbaijan and Moldova, the programme countries with comparably low forest cover, the state, often with donor support, subsidizes the state forestry organizations in the interest of general benefits expected from the preservation of forests and the increase of the forest cover. The national state forestry agencies in all countries are directly funded from the state budget. The sub-national (regional) agencies are territorial branches of the national forestry agencies and are financed by those. In the Russian Federation the forestry agencies of the Federal Subjects are financed by their respective region budgets. The local level of the state forestry organizations, the state forestry enterprises (Azerbaijan, Belarus, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine) or local branches of the national forestry agencies (Armenia, Georgia) are either in some extent or entirely funded by transfers from the higher level forest sector budgets. State forestry enterprises are legal entities and create own incomes. Where these enterprises manage productive forests and are able to sell forest products that are in demand at the market, they can be largely self-financing, e.g. in Belarus, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine. But even in Belarus, with its highly productive forests, the state forestry enterprises in the average receive 35% of their budget in form of transfers from the state budget. The state forestry enterprises pay taxes and provide contributions to the higher level forestry agencies. For instance, in Belarus the regional forestry organizations, the state production forestry associations, sell the timber produced by the state forestry agencies and keep a share of the revenues. Thus the net subsidies, which the state forestry enterprises receive, are lower than the above mentioned figure suggests. Restrictions on forest use (Azerbaijan) or on the export of timber (Ukraine) can negatively affect the financial situation of the state forestry enterprises. Local branches of the national forestry agencies (Armenia, 61 Azerbaijan) are economically not independent but are entirely funded by the state budget allocated to them and transfer their incomes to the central level. The fees for the use of forest resources and services seem to be largely adequate and neither interviewed stakeholders, CPCs of the programme nor did reports or publications mention any overly high or low fees. The state forestry enterprises in many cases do not collect fees for use of forests and harvest of forest products or have to transfer these revenues to other bodies. Fees for concessions and leases include larger one-time payments that go to central budgets while annual but comparably lower payments can be allocated to local budgets or the forestry enterprises themselves. Lease fees may go to the budgets of the administrative territorial units owning the forest lands, the state forestry enterprise may receive only the one-time \u201cpayment for compensation of damage\u201d (Ukraine). Fees for the allocation of concessions for forest logging in Georgia went to the national budget and did not directly benefit the local forest management. Stumpage fees for cutting of fuel wood and timber can be shared between the state forestry enterprise and public budgets (Belarus) or between local and national budgets (Georgia, Ukraine). Use of NWFP for personal use, and in the practice also small scale commercial collection, are possible without payment of fees. In Belarus and Russia leases of forests for commercial collection of NWFP exist and contribute to the income created by state forestry enterprises. Local budgets benefit from forestry through the above mentioned lease fees, stumpage fees and locally payable taxes. These contributions to local budgets can be lower than the costs imposed on these budgets by the forest use, e.g. due to the destruction of roads by the transport of logged timber. Local people benefit from forests materially in various ways. Employment in the state forestry enterprises can be substantial in rural areas with limited employment opportunities.

In Georgia and Russia reforms of the forestry sector have cut the employment by state forestry enterprises and in some areas where formerly hundreds of jobs existed in the state forest sector now only about a dozen people might be employed. The forest dependency studies of ENPI-FLEG II (Bakkegard, 2014)54 showed that local people can in different extent depend on the subsistence and commercial use of forest products. The forest dependency study was conducted by IUCN in frames of FLEG II Program in 2014 and was based on the over 1,250 households surveys completed in communities close to forest. In the study areas incomes from the harvest and sale of forest products accounted for 4-16% of the incomes of interviewed rural households, with forest income comprising higher shares of total incomes of certain, especially poorer, households. These figures do not include income from employment in the forest sector. NWFP were the dominating source of income from forest products because fuel wood and timber can rarely be legally harvested and sold. The Case Studies and research for this Study showed that access to \u2013 compared to market prices \u2013 cheaper fuel wood (collection by households themselves in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus and Georgia, sale to local households by state forestry enterprises in all programme countries) and timber provides additional benefits to the local population in rural areas located close to forests. The access of local people of forest dependent communities to forest products and the benefits they receive from the forests are severely affected where large scale lease (Russia) or concessions (Georgia) are assigned to external companies, especially in areas in the vicinity of villages. In Russia the adoption of the new Forest Code and the delegation of forest management to leaseholders have affected local people that are no longer allowed to use fuel wood from the forests 54 http://www.enpi-fleg.org/docs/executive-summary-regional-analysis-of-forest-and-environmental-product-use-and- dependence-amongst-rural-households-in-south/ 62 as well as small and medium wood processing enterprises (ENPI-FLEG, 2014, \u0428\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0446 et al., 2010). In Georgia the same problems have been reported being caused by the concessions, which in violation of the law even do not permit for small scale collection of dead wood and logging remnants by local people. The concessionaires employ mostly workers from outside of the local villages, often foreigners (Chinese companies) and process the harvested wood centrally. Local wood processing enterprises have no longer access to local timber and ceased to work. (Case Study Georgia) These factors not only affect the economic situation of the local population but also the local public budgets. Where the local forests are integrated in the state forest fund and are managed in the same way and by the same organizations, the financial arrangements in relation to local forests are the same as for any other state forest. Where local forests are managed by separate institutions (Moldova and Ukraine) the financial transfers and subsidies from the national state budgets, which are enjoyed by the state forestry organizations, are not available for the owners and managers of these local forests. In Moldova the management of communal forests depends entirely on the municipality budgets and the income they create from the use of the forests. These forests are often small and of low productivity, and most municipalities are not able to finance the management of their forests properly. In Ukraine \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises are mostly owned by the regions (possibly co- owned by the districts) with district forestry enterprises being daughter enterprises of region forestry enterprises. Thus, if any, budget support for the management of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forests is only available from the region budget. Further, poorer forest conditions compared to the state forests, allow for less harvest of lower quality, while the management of the smaller and more fragmented forest sections compared to state forests causes higher costs. In the result, according to Zhyla et al. (2014) and the Case Study Ukraine, the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises are in a financially much more difficult situation than the state forestry enterprises in the same regions. In Ukraine and Moldova stakeholders reported that local forests managed by \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises or municipalities provide fuel wood to local households and social objects at cheaper prices than the state forestry enterprises (Case Studies Ukraine and Moldova). In Georgia representatives of municipalities attempting to take over local forests into their possession expect from this change the improved satisfaction of the local population\u2019s needs in fuel wood and timber (Case Study Georgia).

In the following paragraphs some country specific aspects of financial arrangements and other economic aspects are presented. Armenia The national forestry organization Hayantar receives about 65-70% of its financial means from the state budget and the remaining 30-35% from income created by the sale of forest products (Balyan, CPC ENPI-FLEGII Armenia, pers. comm. 2015). Substantial investments from the state budget and a number of international funds were utilized to restore central and regional forestry offices, to update forest management plans, to implement reforestation and afforestation activities etc. (Gevorgyan, 2009).The state budget allocations to the forest sector budget have risen several times between the period 2000 - 2004 and 2005 \u2013 2009 but have fallen again in 2010 and at the same time own income of the forest sector decreased. (Junge, Fripp, 2011) The Armenian forestry sector suffers from large unaccounted illegal logging and an inflexible pricing system for fuel wood and wood products sold by the local branches of Hayantar. Prices at which wood is sold by the state forestry units to intermediaries are fixed by Hayantar and the Ministry of Agriculture without adjustment for inflation. These official prices were in 2011 still the same as in 2004, and thus over this period the real prices had effectively fallen by over 39%. The prices charged by intermediaries to end users (community members, industry, or foreign importers) are determined by the market and are much higher than the fixed prices of Hayantar. Thus intermediaries make substantial profit that is lost for the funding of the forestry sector. Also the illegal timber and fuel wood market can be considered a free market, where prices reflect demand and supply. The difference between legal supply (harvest and import) and estimated demand of fuel wood and timber suggest that unaccounted harvest (both harvest by illegal users as well as harvest above the permitted limit by legal users) over years several times exceeded the legal supply. The profit from this unaccounted harvest and from the difference between officially set prices and market prices is captured outside of the forest sector. This situation where financial benefits from the use of forests are not captured by the official forestry organizations is one of the main reasons for the financial problems of Hayantar. Access to forest resources and to informal income is an important driver for those seeking employment in the forest sector, and for this reason personal connections and mutual informal benefits are criteria for hiring staff not based on qualification. (Junge, Fripp 64 2011) As reported by Petrosyan (Hayantar, pers. comm. 2015) attempts to assign management responsibility on local forests to communities were not successful due to the lack of economic viability. The allowable cut was too low to cover the costs of running communal forestry enterprises and the communities were interested only in immediately harvestable timber and fuel wood but not in maintenance, protection from grazing and other investment in the development of the forest resource. The Consultant was not able to verify the validity of this assessment. The findings of Junge, Fripp (2011) on the institutions and political economy of the forest sector in Armenia and own observations (Michel, 2014) suggest that underlying reasons for the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6122eddd-9145-47c6-bdeb-d90ae1e50c95": {"__data__": {"id_": "6122eddd-9145-47c6-bdeb-d90ae1e50c95", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "969cf2f6779e6ae8316f33b149ff49f885e5adac7085c2a3fbcfc6438d1f3ca0"}}, "hash": "969cf2f6779e6ae8316f33b149ff49f885e5adac7085c2a3fbcfc6438d1f3ca0", "text": "failure of pilot projects on community forest management might be more complex and include inflexible requirements set by Hayantar, insufficient economic incentives for the communities, possibly inadequate fees and even corruption. Azerbaijan In Azerbaijan the state almost entirely funds the forestry sector. In 2015 the state budget allocation to forestry was 12 Million AZN (that time about 12 Mio EUR), less than 0.05% of the state budget expenditures55. The state forestry enterprises receive low incomes from the use of forests due to the official status of all forests as protection forests with only maintenance and sanitary cuttings being permitted (ENPI-FLEG II, 2014a). The state forestry enterprises provide local people with fuel wood by issuing permits for harvest of dead trees and selling fuel wood to local households (Case Study Azerbaijan). The restrictions on cutting of trees in some areas lead to the deliberate damage of trees to allow for their future harvest under sanitary cutting permits (Dieterich, State University Baku, pers. comm. 2015). The supply of gas to many rural villages has reduced the demand for fuel wood (ENPI-FLEG II, 2014a; Case Study Azerbaijan). In the case of tree and shrub vegetation outside of the forest fund, to which parts of the former kolkhoz forests belong, the owner or use of the land does not get any direct monetary benefits from the \u201cforest\u201d, but has to pay full land tax by the rates applicable for pastures. No use of wood is formally possible in such areas, only use of NWFP and grazing of livestock. This presents disincentives to the conservation and development of these \u201cforests\u201d and encourages the conversion of suitable sections into open pastures. (Case Study Azerbaijan) The current financial arrangements, economic instruments and benefit sharing rather discourage effective protection, maintenance and expansion of the forest, both in the forest fund and on other lands. Belarus The state budget contributes to the forestry sector at national, sub-national and local level. The sub- national forestry organizations, the state production forestry associations, channel the state budget allocation to the state forestry enterprises, which depending on the local conditions for self-financing of their operations can receive maximum 40% of their budget as contribution from the state budget. In the average 35% of the general budget of the enterprises is funded by the state, this funding is supposed to support specific activities that are in public interest but do not create substantial income, e.g. protection, pest and fire control, planting, forest roads etc. The state production forestry associations sell the wood and timber, harvested by the state forestry enterprises, and receive a share of the income. 55http://www.maliyye.gov.az/sites/default/files/Budget_law_2015.pdf 65 The sale of harvested timber and fuel wood as well as of other forest products, e.g. hunts and NWFP, create incomes for the state forestry enterprises, which are used for the funding of their forests management activities. The state policy aims at increasing these incomes and by this at reducing the share of state funding of the forest sector. The state forestry enterprises provide significant local economic benefits in form of employment and forest products. The state forestry enterprises with several hundred employees in each district are an important employer in small towns and rural areas. Also small enterprises providing forestry services to the state forestry enterprises are developing. The taxes from the state forestry enterprise go into the budget of the local district. The state forestry enterprises receives the stumpage fees paid for logging by the enterprises that lease forest, in case of main use 50% of the total amount, the remaining 50% go to the central budget. The provision of wood for local needs is an important instrument for the maintenance of good relations between the local communities and the state forestry enterprises, motivating their support of the forestry activities. Fuel wood is allocated for the needs of local people at affordable prices and delivered to public objects. Timber is sold via auctions, but sufficient amounts are available for local people for their personal construction needs, with no resale being permitted. (Case Study Belarus) The current financial arrangements and economic mechanism in Belarus satisfy the needs of the local population and allow for the sustainable management of the forests by the state forestry enterprises. Intended institutional changes, aimed at the separation of harvest and initial wood processing from silvicultural activities, will alter the current system and possibly reduce incentives for sustainable forest management as well as reduce the benefits for local people and districts.

Neither the local offices/forestry units nor the regional forestry services are authorized to carry out own economic activities and reinvest the earned incomes into forestry activities. The incomes created by the use of forest resources are transferred to the budget of the NFA at national level which allocates funding to its regional forestry services and their local offices/forestry units. Thus the economic system of the NFA is highly centralised. The Ecology and Green Spaces Department of Tbilisi does not create any relevant income or revenues from its forests and is entirely dependent on the budget allocation from of the municipality (Giorgobiani, Ecology and Green Spaces Department Tbilisi, pers. comm. 2015). The lack of own workforce and the legal requirements for contracting companies for carrying out forestry works made the pilot operations on thinning in pine monoculture stands not cost efficient (Michel 2014). In Akhmeta municipality the administration of the protected landscape can have own income from forest use, but they are not allowed to harvest wood resources for sale outside of the community. (Case Study Georgia) The financial arrangements on the concessions are not transparent. The concessionaires had to pay a one-time high fee for the assignment of the concession, which went to the central budget. Annually the concessionaires have to pay fees per harvested amount (stumpage fee), which go partly to the communal budget and partly to the central budget. Municipalities complain about having no net benefit from the concessions. Heavy damage to roads, water and forest and the negative impact are said to outweigh by far the limited contribution to the municipality budget from stumpage fees and the benefits of limited employment of local people. In some areas concessions cover easy 66 accessible forests forcing the inhabitants to get fuel wood from remote and difficult accessible forests. (Case Study Georgia) Employment in the forestry sector is very limited. Most local forestry units of the NFA have only 10- 20 employees in one municipality. Concessionaires often hire workers from outside of the local municipalities. Chinese concessionaires just log the assigned concessions and take the logs to a processing facility they run in Kutaisi. With the assignment of concessions to external companies and the sale of timber trough auctions only, the cost of raw materials and related transaction costs became prohibitively expensive for the economic viability of local wood processing industry, e.g. furniture production plants, which in the past provided local incomes. Use of fuel wood is essential for local people in rural areas. The local NFA offices/forestry units allocate fuel wood to local households. People from forest rich areas sell surplus fuel wood, which they harvest based on their forest cutting permits, to households in areas with limited forest cover. The Ecology and Green Spaces Department of Tbilisi gives wood from necessary felling and maintenance of trees for free to public objects and to people in need (Giorgobiani, Ecology and Green Spaces Department Tbilisi, pers. comm. 2015). Timber and fuel wood harvested in 2012 in thinning operations had been sold at auctions, but the earned income barely covered the costs of the works that were carried out by contractors (Michel 2014). In Akhmeta municipality firewood and very small amounts of timber from its communal forests in Tusheti Protected Landscape are sold to households in the local villages. Non-timber forest products used by locals are: mushrooms, berries and herbs. (Case Study Georgia) In Akhmeta the forests protect an important water catchment basin, supplying the Mingechevir Reservoir in Azerbaijan. Payments for ecosystem services would be thinkable as economic mechanism to fund forest protection and management in the area of the municipality but so far no steps are known being taken to achieve such mechanism. Moldova The state forestry agency Moldsilva (as manager of the state owned forests) receives very limited budget funding but is able of self-financing from forestry and 98% of its income is created from harvesting of wood and from other forest use (NWFP, hunting, forest lease). The forests managed by Moldsilva provide a much higher amount of harvestable forest products per area size and per management unit than most communal forests. In contrast to Moldsilva, communal forest owners may need to cross fund forest management from other incomes. The Local Public Authorities have their own budget and can make their own decisions about the use of these budgets. Contributions from the state budget to the financial needs of the communes are restricted to expenses for education (kindergartens, schools) which are fully financed.

No subsidies or other contributions are available from the national or subnational budgets for financing of forest management of communal forests. Several international projects have funded forest inventory and management planning of existing communal forests as well as afforestation activities on communal lands. The municipalities receive very limited income from the communal forests due to their limited size and often low productivity and wood quality. In most cases the incomes received from lease of forest lands and from sale of fuel wood and timber are insufficient for effective forest protection and management. Only in exceptional cases, where municipalities own productive forests of sufficient size they can employ forestry staff and hire workers for carrying out forestry works. Municipalities 67 make attempts to create communal enterprises that would be in charge of communal environmental, cultural and service issues and/or to establish joint forest management enterprises of several municipalities, thus creating units of sufficient size and budget to make the communal forestry activities financially possible. (Case Study Moldova) Where communal forests allow for harvest, a part of the harvested timber and fuel wood is sold by the municipalities to local people, with priority allocation to vulnerable categories of the population, at a lower price than the market price at which Moldsilva sells fuel wood from the state forestry units (Case Study Moldova). Russia According to Muran (2014) the budget of the forest sector has increased from 35.9 billion RUB (2009) to almost 73 billion RUB (2014, planned). Out of the latter 6.95 billion RUB were allocated for the federal forestry agency Rosleskhoz and affiliated organizations, and 24.5 billion RUB subventions to regions, making a total federal budget share of about 43% of the forestry expenses of the regions. Further, 9.9 million RUB (13.5%) were planned to be allocated by budgets of Federal Subjects and 30.7 billion RUB (42%) by leaseholders and from other sources. The new Forest Code provided for the delegation of forest management functions to the Federal Subjects and the private sector and has caused a substantial reduction of the share of direct federal funding for centralized forest management and protection. In particular the abolishment of the federal forest inspection has left forests without control (ENPI-FLEG II, 2014b) and fire protection. The new Forest Code was adopted with the intention to promote private investment in the forestry sector. This did not yet happen in the expected extent. (ENPI-FLEG II, 2014b) The forest dependency study (ENPI-FLEG II, 2014b) found that many people are dependent on forest resources due to the bad economic situation, collecting mainly firewood. The latter is only partly provided by the state, and many people have to collect it illegally. Differences were found between the regions assessed in that study, with wealthy people in the villages often having financial success due to forest products (cranberries in north-western Russia, pine nuts in the Altai and timber in the Russian Far East). Some important forest products are collected by \u201cprofessionals\u201d \u2013 sometimes non-local people. The new Forest Code established new barriers for local people to access forest products due to requirements to conclude lease contracts, stricter rules for local people and increased fines (ENPI- FLEG II, 2014b, \u0428\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0446 et al., 2010). During the Soviet period, the vast majority of logging had been done by the state, and people were employed in this industry having substantial salaries. People were provided with fuelwood and sawn wood in amounts they needed. This system was in some extent in place until the adoption of the new Forest Code. Currently, the vast majority of wood products are illegally harvested and often smuggled, in the Russian Far East by groups of the organized crime that involve mainly Chinese companies. The incomes local people earn from these activities could not be estimated. (ENPI-FLEG II, 2014b; \u041b\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d et al., 2011) Further, Laletin et al. (\u041b\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d et al., 2011) found a sharp decline of legal amounts of round timber harvested and annually exported from Russia after the new Forest Code was adopted.

The share of government support in the total budget of state forestry enterprises varies in accordance to the availability of forest resources. In southern regions of Ukraine with the lowest forest cover the share of state budget is higher, while in the northern part with more forest cover the state forest enterprises receive less state budget support. The state budget allocation is mainly used to fund activities on afforestation, protection of forests against fire, pests and diseases, purchase of forestry equipment and construction of forest roads.56 The financial situation of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises differs from the state forestry enterprises. The region and district forestry enterprises are entirely self-reliant in financial terms and do not get any state support for their regular operations. Limited state budget funding has been allocated for reforestation of communal forest lands. Only 20% of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises receive contributions by the local budgets (Zhyla et al. 2014). The costs of the FMP activities are paid by the region forestry enterprises and contributions from the region budgets. The income taxes of the region and district forestry enterprises go to the region budgets and the profit is used by decision of the respective region or district council. District forestry enterprises contribute a share of their income to the region forestry enterprise. The region forestry enterprise in turn provides certain services to the district enterprises and makes use of the economy of scale. Incomes of the district forestry enterprises are mainly from the sale of fuel wood and timber. For leased areas the district forestry enterprises receive the \u201ccompensation of damage\u201d, which is calculated and paid for the entire lease period, but leaseholders usually take only small plots to avoid large compensation payments. There are no cross-subsidies between wealthier and less wealthy district forestry enterprises. 90% of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises studied by Zhyla et al. (2014) lamented about significant financial shortages, affecting the viability of the forestry enterprises, mainly because of the - compared to state forests - poor composition and amount of available timber for harvest and sale and the higher expenses of forestry operations due to the fragmented patterns and small size of their forest areas. The region and district forestry enterprises and the forests managed by them directly contribute to local livelihoods. The stumpage fees for main use go now entirely to the state budget; for intermediate use the stumpage fee is shared as follows: to the rural council 25%, district 25%, region 50% (formerly shares of the rural councils- main use felling 50%, other cuts (maintenance, sanitary) 100%) independent of the ownership of the forest. The harvest of timber and the transportation of the logs cause damage to local roads and stumpage fees are hardly sufficient to invest in major road repair. The reduction of the share of the stumpage fees received by rural councils is seriously affecting the budget of rural councils in areas with significant forest cover. In the state forests main use felling dominates and thus the rural councils receives little income from stumpage fees, despite compared to \u201ccommunal\u201d forests similar or larger areas covered by state forest. The application of the same (low) shares of stumpage fees for all types of ownership does not support the development of a sense of ownership for \u201ccommunal\u201d forests in rural councils and districts. One of the direct economic benefits for the local populations is employment of local people. Reportedly, many forestry enterprises mainly employ workers informally with payment in-kind in form of wood or in cash from sold wood. Access to forest products is another benefit local people receive from the forests. Fuel wood cutting or collection of lying wood by private persons is not permitted, but sometimes cut remnants are used by local people. State and district forestry enterprises sell fuel wood to local people at similar prices. The region forestry enterprises as well as the district forestry 56http://www.un.org/esa/forests/pdf/cpf-oli/CPF_OLI_20_Sept_WG2_Poliakova.pdf 69 enterprises provide some fuel wood for free or at reduced prices for social institutions and for poor or otherwise eligible families. Everybody harvests NWFP in forests independent of the ownership without restrictions, also for commercial purposes. The economic benefits for local people from forests of all ownership types are similar. 5.2 Pillar 2: Planning and decision-making processes Component 2.1: Stakeholder participation The opportunities of general stakeholder participation in the planning and decision making processes are difficult to assess because formal provisions of the legislation can substantially differ from the practice.

The analysis of this component might therefore be biased by the availability and character of information. Critical public statements by experts and civil society representatives on access to information and participation opportunities indicate in some extent about the existence of participation while the absence of such critical statements may not necessarily show that participation is well developed but in the contrary can indicate a more severe lack of participation opportunities. The environmental and forestry legislation in all programme countries makes general provisions for stakeholder participation. At the national level government programmes, laws and bylaws before adoption undergo a consultation process involving various ministries and sector agencies. Scientific institutes and civil society organizations can get involved in these processes. Sometimes, their comments are not substantially taken into consideration if contradicting the interest of more powerful elites. For instance, various experts and civil society organizations commented on the draft Forest Code of the Russian Federation, and after its adoption made suggestions for amendments. Despite this broad discussion barely any suggestions were reflected in the Forest Code or in its numerous amendments. In Georgia, civil society organizations criticized the way large scale forest concessions were assigned, and initiated lawsuits to challenge concession contracts. Although these lawsuits were not successful, a number of concession contracts were annulled. At local level legislation in all programme countries provides for opportunities of local administrations, self-governance bodies, civil society organizations and citizens to participate in the development of forest related decisions. However, for various reasons in the practice this participation is often not realized. Representatives of state forestry organizations of all levels tend to blame a lack of interest in participation by the local people. Civil society organizations and experts, e.g. in Georgia and Belarus, highlight the lack of procedures and mechanisms for participation as provisions in the legislation are only of purely declarative character. However, even where formal mechanisms for participation and challenging of decisions are lacking, public opinion, media and civil society organizations can massively influence on the decision making in forestry. The Consultant observed that in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia negative public attitudes towards any cutting of trees affected the implementation of silvicultural measures (cuts for transformation of artificial pine monocultures into more natural and better adapted native deciduous forests). The involved international NGO, its country branches, their experts and the national forestry agencies feared negative publicity in such an extent that necessary measures were even not considered (Michel, 2014). Similarly, in Belarus and Ukraine negative public opinion about cutting of trees influences decision making in forestry and forces local foresters to seek dialogue with stakeholders. The consideration of the interests of stakeholders and, in particular of forest dependent 70 communities, in decision making processes varies. In Russia (\u041f\u0440\u043e\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u043d, \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432, 2010) regional legislation insufficiently considered the interests of the local forest dependent population, leading in the practice to an increase in informally tolerated and illegal forest use. In Georgia and Ukraine (Case Studies) representatives of rural communes complained that state forestry organizations of different level insufficiently considered the interests of the local population in their decision making. In Georgia this problem has been highlighted as one of the key reasons why communes insist in the transfer of forests into their possession. In Ukraine the level of participation hardly differs substantially between \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises (owned by the regions) and state forestry enterprises. The certification of forests in accordance to the requirements of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) there has substantially improved participation at the local level. The extent of scientific debate relating to planning and decision making on (local) forests in the programme countries is limited, and largely facilitated by and depending on externally funded projects requiring the involvement of scientific institutes and scientists. In Belarus and Ukraine the Consultant noticed that detailed regulations, e.g. on silvicultural targets, reforestation and maintenance, do provide little opportunities for adaptive decision making and management and thus for the involvement of science.

Partly insufficient awareness about participation rights among local people and communal bodies as well as forestry enterprises; increasing demand for information and participation; general improvement, in particular in the context of FSC certification. In the following paragraphs some country specific findings are presented without attempting to achieve a comprehensive assessment of stakeholder participation in forestry related planning and decision making. Some aspects of this component will be further explained in the other components of this pillar of the governance framework. Armenia According to the Forest Code the local self-governance bodies of municipalities and the local administrations of districts have some general right to participate in the elaboration and implementation of state programmes on forestry concerning their territories but this provision does not concern forest management planning. The participation of citizens and civil society organizations is not regulated in the Forest Code. While the formal participation mechanisms are poorly developed, civil society organizations can in the practice influence decision making. As mentioned above, a generally negative attitude towards any cutting of trees can even prevent the consideration of necessary silvicultural measures. Junge, Fripp (2011) mentioned that NGO would make pressure against an increase of annual allowable cuts and legal logging, although this would reduce illegal and unaccounted cutting and substantially contribute to the sustainability of forest use in the country. Azerbaijan The Forest Code provides for the participation of natural persons and legal entities, civil society organizations in the ensuring of \u201crational use, conservation, protection and reproduction of forests\u201d in a very general form, referring to the \u201clegislation of the Azerbaijan Republic\u201d. Similarly, the law mentions in very general terms the participation of municipalities in forest related issues. Information by stakeholders suggest that all decision making processes are highly centralized and top-down and providing very little opportunities for any participation by citizens, civil society organizations, science and local self-governance bodies in decision making on forests. There is not much room for decision making by the land-users on the management of the tree and shrub vegetation on their lands, being these privately used or communal lands. The local rural councils are elected by the inhabitants of the commune, but these councils have no stake in the decision making on forests and limited decision making authority on tree and shrub vegetation outside of the forest fund. 72 Belarus Article 14 of the Forest Code establishes the right of citizens, NGOs and local self-governance organs to participate in the consideration of forestry issues that concern their interests through discussions, referendums and other forms of direct participation in decision making. This includes issues related to the assignment of forests, their use, protection and regeneration. Further, citizens, NGOs and local self-governance organs are called to educate the broader public about forest conservation and protection needs and to support directly forest protection and other forestry activities. The state organs of forestry have to provide the public with the relevant information. The national experts of ENPI-FLEG (\u041b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f et al., 2011) have criticized the lack of specific mechanisms for implementing in the practice these rights of participation as well as the broader rights of environmental NGOs established in article 15 of the law \u201cOn environmental protection\u201d and by the Aarhus Convention. State forestry enterprises have good relations with the district administrations and with the rural councils. The state forestry enterprises preliminarily inform about planned forestry works at boards in each rural council.

The public opinion is very critical about any logging and open complains are expressed, even in cases where cuttings are necessary for maintenance and silviculture. (Case Study Belarus) The certification of 55% of the total forest area by the FSC system indicates that stakeholder participation in forest related planning and decision making is at least in accordance to the requirements set for the certification. Georgia The environmental legislation (law of Georgia \u201cOn the Environmental Permit\u201d) and the Forest Code of Georgia require the provision of access to information and public participation in decision making and planning at any stage. The Forest Code requires public information and participation, for instance, especially on the assignment of long-term use rights on forests (concessions). The \u201cbodies authorized for managing the State Forest Fund shall consider comments and suggestions made by citizens and representatives of public organizations prior to making respective decisions\u201d. In the practice these provisions have not entirely been realized. Civil society organizations, in particular the NGO \u201cAssociation Green Alternative\u201d, have exposed the problems of insufficient transparency and public participation in the reform of the forest sector, in the development of its legislation and in the decisions on forest use, on the allocation of concessions as well as in the elaboration of forest management plans (Macharashvili, 2012). Green Alternative challenged a number of concession allocations in administrative complains and court cases, based on wrong data in the documents, inadequate concession terms and lack of public and, in particular, local community participation. Although these claims were dismissed in lawsuits, finally four out of 12 concessions were annulled and two were substantially modified. Information and participation at the local level and in particular of municipality organs is week, especially on all issues concerning the forestry concessions. Municipalities have insufficient access to information on concessions and lacked the opportunity to participate in the decision making when the concessions were assigned. Municipality organs had not seen at least basic information on terms and conditions of the concessions. Attempts by municipalities to receive concession contracts and maps with accurate concession boundaries from the NFA or the MNERP generally failed. At best municipalities have received very general information about the concession areas. No mechanisms are in place that would oblige concessionaires to share information or to allow the 73 municipalities to influence on their work. It seems that in the context of the liberal economic reforms in Georgia the interests of perceived \u201cinvestors\u201d were rated much higher than those of the local communities and their self-governance bodies. Some concession contracts might be legally problematic, and hiding them is therefor in the interest of concessionaires and state representatives involved. In contrast to the weak participation on concessions, mass-media campaigns can effectively hamper reasonable and sustainable forest management as broad public perception is very negative towards any forestry works, and there is obviously little opportunity to counter with good arguments. Insufficient information and lack of public participation are major reasons for this negative attitude. (Case Study Georgia) The size of Georgia\u2019s municipalities, which correspond to the former districts, may in the future hamper participation in decision making and forest management at the village level. The sub-units of the municipalities, corresponding to the former lowest level of local self-governance, currently do not have their own status. Establishing some level of public self-governance of the sub-units would allow for more substantial participation of local stakeholders in the communities. Moldova The Forest Code obliges the central forestry organ, i.e. Moldsilva, to ensure the free access to information and the participation of the population in the decision making. The Government of Moldova has adopted a policy of proactive disclosure of information through its Open Data Initiative and established mechanisms for citizen engagement in decision making processes. The establishment of the National Council for Participation, for instance, allows civil society organizations to participate systematically in issues of the public administration. Notwithstanding these efforts, low stakeholder capacity, lack of resources, and low levels of citizen demand for accountability hinder progress. Forestry institutions do provide some information on their websites. However, information on their performance, budget, and spending is largely missing. At a local level, the scarce resources of municipalities, coupled with a lack of demand for accountability, also hinder provision of information on forestry related decisions. The situation with citizen feedback mechanisms is similarly unsatisfactory. Usually, public authorities register and respond to citizen complaints and requests in due time. However, there is no publicly available information about the types of complaints and the quality of the authorities\u2019 responses. Lastly, public participation in forestry related issues is rather weak", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e62b0415-133f-48c1-a0a8-b3ceb055042c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e62b0415-133f-48c1-a0a8-b3ceb055042c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6ce2c1511c3fe287177f6e8f75237bf087fe46190259e493a7df48fd40cc152c"}, "3": {"node_id": "f20bcc44-9e1b-4931-b228-d33e30758558", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "17dd0f2dee29d468423cc1a3f0d9b7851bf7f870a8c69cd3fd30303690c25940"}}, "hash": "dead29d80245259110bc0fb85d3ed35419a0dbad83f3237d537799fecd431d1f", "text": "and the commitment of local authorities to engage citizens is limited. (Mitchell et al., 2015) Russia The development of the new Forest Code was critically observed and commented by a number of civil society organizations and experts. Also after adoption of the law constructive comments and specific suggestions57 were provided to improve the Forest Code in the course of later amendments (\u0428\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0446 et al., 201058, \u041f\u0440\u043e\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u043d, \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432, 2010). Despite a high frequency of amendments these contributions were not incorporated in the law. After the forestry legislation, also the federal legislation on access of citizens to information was changed when January 1, 2010 the Federal law \u201cOn securing the access to information about the 57http://www.wwf.ru/data/forests/ye_popravki_k_lesnomu_kodeksu_9_oktybry_2009.doc 58http://www.wwf.ru/data/publ_period/forest_mag25/01.pdf 74 action of state organs and organs of local self-governance\u201d59 came into force. This law requires regional state organs to provide, among other information, regional legislation in accessible form, including via internet. A Decree of the Federal Government60 further specifies the provisions of this law and lists the information that shall be provided, which includes information on the situation in the forest sector. The regional legislation should thus be available at the websites of the state organs of the Federal Subjects, but a survey in 2010 showed that 78% of these websites do not contain the required information about forests and their use and the related regional legislation. This not only violated the rights of the citizens of these regions on access to information but also practically made impossible their participation in legal forest use. Similarly operational information on disaster situations, like forest fires, is not timely and accurately published by the regional governments of the Federal Subjects. (\u041f\u0440\u043e\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u043d, \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432, 2010) The recently increasing pressure against civil society organizations and independent media makes it unlikely that the situation in terms of stakeholder participation in planning and decision making on forests has improved since 2010, the time of the publication of quoted assessments. Ukraine The Forest Code, without differentiating between types of ownership of forests, provides civil society organizations (nature conservation organizations) with the right to participate in the elaboration of forest related plans and programs, to access information on forest conditions and forestry, to participate in activities of international NGOs, to provide suggestions on legislation and to appeal against rejections of information requests. The Forest Code, however, does not provide for participation of other stakeholders, except the central state forestry organ, in decision making, neither of citizens nor of local administrations or self-governance organs. Information on stakeholder participation in the planning and decision-making process on \u201ccommunal\u201d forests is partly contradictory. Zhyla et al. (2014) that the acting legislation provides the local communes with sufficient authority to decide on a broad range of issues in the activities of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises. However, local people by their opinion are not aware about their rights and do not have the knowledge and skills to realize their rights of participation. Local people are said being convinced that decisions are made at region and state level only. Some of the directors of the forestry enterprises are at the same time members of the respective councils, which might provide opportunities for stakeholder involvement, but as well bears the risks of conflicts of interest. One of the authors of the study commented to the Consultant (Boroska, in lit. 2015) that local rural councils rarely intervene into the work of the \u201ccommunal\u201d forest enterprises, and thus there is little conflict.

(Case Study Ukraine) Component 2.2: Planning and decision making on conversion of land from forest to non-forest and vice versa The systems of planning and decision making on conversion of land from forest to non-forest and vice versa are similar in all programme countries. The Land Codes of the countries establish different designations of land categories (Rus. tselevye naznachenia \u2013 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f). Forest(ry) lands are one of these designation categories. The category of forestry lands includes as well lands that are temporarily or permanently not covered by forests but are needed for forestry or are in the land-use of forestry enterprises. These may include clear cut and reforestation areas, gaps in the forest cover, bare lands in forest areas, forest roads, forest nurseries, compounds of forestry enterprises and so on. The Land Codes also have the designation category Lands of Protected Areas that can include forests within PA. These forests might accordingly be in the responsibility of another government agency. Depending on the legal definition of forest in the respective programme country, forests or other \u201ctree and shrub vegetation\u201d can also be located on lands of other designation categories, like agricultural lands, infrastructure (shelterbelts at roads and railways), water (e.g. shelterbelts and gallery forests at canals and rivers) and towns and settlements. For instance, in Azerbaijan tree and shrub vegetation on agricultural lands is generally not considered as forests. Similarly in Moldova and Ukraine the boundaries of forest lands are defined by the land cadastre and the designation category of the land, but not by the real vegetation. Local forests are often located on lands of agricultural designation. Formerly agricultural enterprises have established forest plantations on agricultural lands, silvo-pastoral areas belonged to them or natural succession on abandoned agricultural lands has led to the development of forests. As long as the designation of these lands is not changed to forestry, problems can arise that hinder the sustainable management of such forests. In some countries, e.g. Azerbaijan, legal use of trees outside of forest lands is hardly possible, what discourages the protection and development of forest vegetation on such lands as it cannot be used. In other situations, the lack of authority of forestry organizations on such lands prevents them from intervening in case of cutting of these forests or even in case of fires (Russia). State land use agencies are in charge of the delimitation of lands by land designation category in all programme countries. These agencies have branch offices at all territorial administrative levels, i.e. regions and districts, and usually at least an officer as representative in each sub-districts. In all programme countries changes of the designation category of lands are generally possible. The procedures vary between the countries and depending on the involved land categories. Conversion of forestry lands into other lands is formally difficult, in particular where forests are in exclusive state 76 or public ownership and are not subject to privatization. The change of land-use designation from forestry to other designation has often been misused for privatization of lands where forests cannot be privatized (e.g. in Georgia, Macharashvili, NGO Green Alternative, pers. comm. 2015). Accordingly in all programme countries legislation set requirements in terms of justification and barriers against the change of forest lands into other categories. Nevertheless, such changes are possible, e.g. in Georgia where the municipality of Tbilisi has changed the status of forests within the city boundaries into \u201cgreen spaces\u201d. In Georgia, in the context of the transfer of \u201cforests of local importance\u201d into the responsibility of municipalities, municipality representatives perceive the issue of long deforested forest lands as problem, because of fearing being blamed of illegal conversion of land cover after these lands have been accepted as forest lands.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51f2722a-ec2a-403a-b3ab-bf2e82fd4cd6": {"__data__": {"id_": "51f2722a-ec2a-403a-b3ab-bf2e82fd4cd6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "555e50bd418b510bb3d38baa6dfbdd7dd5ff8ce0970f271f3b039e3f48b1d5d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "b5af3440-e20b-43d9-90da-caa4a3ed0d16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9af6c7df54fa1bfee6b5868bc91b5e4ca2ad027f5078b66ddc18ab9a05b9d5f8"}}, "hash": "4f75b1e9a5a807a3662aac9bdf2964c52df740c664c6bbc574719d37695d3e5c", "text": "The change of the land designation category from agricultural to forestry is necessary for the inclusion into forests of afforestation sites and succession areas on abandoned agricultural lands.

E.g. in Moldova and Ukraine barriers for the change of designation categories of agricultural lands have so far largely prevented the inclusion into the forest fund of newly established forests (from afforestation and natural succession) located on agricultural lands. In the Russian Federation forests belonging to the lands of the forest fund are in federal ownership, while forests on other lands can be in other forms of ownership. The change of the designation category of agricultural lands to forestry lands would thus legally imply a change of the ownership and is accordingly resisted. Given the often cumbersome procedures but also insufficient enforcement of the rules on changes of land designation categories, in all programme countries in the practice changes of the real land cover and land-use often happen without formal conversion of the land.

Ukraine Cabinet of Ministers: conversion of forest land into lands of other designation; Territorial Administration of Land Relations at region level: change of designation from agriculture to forest. Changes of land categories difficult and lengthy; conversion of forests also takes place illegally; Abandoned agricultural lands with forests remain in this category, but clearing prohibited, change of designation to forest only after declared \u201cdegraded\u201d. The following paragraphs present some country-specific issues of planning and decision making on changes of land categories and conversion of lands. Armenia Changes of land designation categories are reviewed and approved by a commission of all Government structures, including the Ministry of Agriculture. The state forestry agency Hayantar is not involved in this process as it is only a subordinated structure of the Ministry of Agriculture. It would be involved, if Hayantar would be an independent structure directly subordinated to the Government. Generally, changes of land designation from agriculture to forestry are possible and do not present special difficulties. (Nazeli Vardanyan, NGO representative involved in afforestation programmes, pers. comm. 2015) Azerbaijan Changes of land designation categories from forest into other or vice versa rarely take place. The stakeholders met by the Consultant were entirely aware about the actual procedure and considered the issue as not very relevant. It seems the Land-use Committee is in charge of keeping records on land designations and land-use rights and preparing decisions on changes. The Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources and the State Committee for Property (Rus. Goskomimushchestvo - \u0413\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043c\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e) are also to be involved in cases concerning forest lands and the decision has to be approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. The lands of farmers and municipalities that are covered by tree and shrub vegetation are all designated agricultural lands. Change of the land designation to forest land would automatically lead to the handover of the property rights from the municipality to the state and of the user rights from the farmer to the state forestry enterprise. Belarus Forestry lands have been delimitated in the frame of the overall land-use planning. The change of the land category from agricultural to forestry is made by decision of the region administration. Changes of the status of forests of the first group (protection forests) can only be made by Presidential Decree and thus a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0df48151-037e-44fe-b9b1-c382b3c82e1e": {"__data__": {"id_": "0df48151-037e-44fe-b9b1-c382b3c82e1e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "20068b47e285baaf5d6154b8c3bb0312e0d9bc4dba41567751e2e0d7d464967f"}}, "hash": "20068b47e285baaf5d6154b8c3bb0312e0d9bc4dba41567751e2e0d7d464967f", "text": "high barrier is established against the transformation of forests of a higher protection status. Currently the inclusion of areas suitable for forest development is in process, including lands covered by shrub and tree vegetation due to natural succession and agricultural lands suitable for afforestation. Succession areas are not necessarily included into the forest fund, but they can also 78 get other designations, e.g. protected areas. Georgia Generally, the change of the designation of land is not difficult to achieve. Changes of designations had been done via the Ministry of Economy and National Agency of Public Registry under the Ministry of Justice, after formal approval by the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Protection and the National Forestry Agency. In case the new Forest Code with a more technical forest definition will pass, forests like those of Tbilisi would automatically be again designated as forest lands and consequently fall back under the control of the MENRP. Succession areas in some cases have been included into the forest fund by changing the designation of the lands. This change of land designation can be reversed on request by the land- owners. Municipalities as well as the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure consider an inventory and proper determination of forested and deforested lands, and the change of the land designation category of the latter, as a prerequisite for the transfer of local forests to the municipalities (Case Study Georgia). Moldova Land categories are mapped by the Agency for Land Relations and Cadastre of the Republic of Moldova; these maps are publicly accessible. The assignment of lands to the forest fund, including lands that are temporary or permanently without forest cover, is done either in the process of forest inventory and management planning (FMP) or in the frame of the land cadastre. In the practice FMP cover only lands assigned to the forest fund in existing land-use documentation and do not change the designation of lands to categories. So far, areas with succession of tree and shrub vegetation on lands of other designation than forest are not properly mapped. Shelterbelts are usually included in the category of agricultural lands, but remained mostly in communal ownership. The afforestation of agricultural land not covered by forest and its formal designation to the land-use category of forest is possible only in special cases, where the soil fertility or erosion problems justify such a transfer. According to the Land Code a decision by the respective local public authority is required for the transfer of land from one the category of agricultural lands to forest lands. Neither the Forest Code nor the Land Code provides any specific regulations on the change of the land-use category from forest to other land types. The Forest Code defines that the government has the authority of deciding about the \u201callocation of lands of the forest fund for state and public needs\u201d, i.e. the government is authorized to decide about the transfer of forest lands into other land categories. Russia The Government of the Russian Federation has the mandate of change of the designation category of forest lands as of any other lands in federal ownership. Other changes of designation are done by those organs in which responsibility the respective lands are located. This can also concern forests as these can be located on lands of different designation category. The issue of the land designation category of former kolkhoz forests is not entirely solved. These forests can formally be considered agricultural lands with tree and shrub vegetation as well as forests on agricultural lands that have not been transferred into lands of the forest fund. Some of 79 these forests have been subject to forestry inventory and management planning. Stakeholders had made suggestions to establish legislation that would allow for the declaration of such areas as forests, without change of the ownership but with forest management by the owner under the overall control and supervision by the forestry agency. These suggestions were not included in the Forest Code, and in the result the change of the land designation category to forest automatically leads to the transfer of the land into federal ownership. Some areas were included in the state forest fund by decision of the federal forestry agency Rosleskhoz, and such decisions have been challenged in court cases.61 Former kolkhoz forests have received different designations in different documents.

Such conversions received special attention in the context of the construction of the road Moscow-St. Petersburg through the Khiminsk forest62 or of the developments of objects for the Winter Olympics in Sochi 201463. Ukraine The delimitation of lands by categories, including lands of agricultural designation and lands for forestry, is done in the frame of the land-use planning. The State Land Agency is in charge of the mapping of the land categories. Rural councils, with participation of district forestry enterprises, prepare general plans (land-use) for their areas that are confirmed by the region councils. Forest land is not allowed to be sold, but agricultural land can be private. Conversion of forest land into lands of other designation requires a decision by the Cabinet of Ministers. Conversion also takes place illegally, and sometimes lease of forests can be a starting point for such conversion. Especially after the dissolution of the kolkhozes their forests were grabbed and transferred into other lands of other designations. (Case Study Ukraine) After the land privatization large areas of agricultural lands were abandoned. These are lands either of low fertility and/or lands where ownership of specific plots was not defined after the privatization of kolkhoz shares. Abandoned agricultural lands with naturally developing forests remain in the category of agricultural designation. At the same time it is legally prohibited to clear this land from the forest grown there. (Case Study Ukraine) Changes of land categories and designations require a difficult and lengthy procedure. The land-use agency needs to declare agricultural land as \u201cdegraded\u201d before its designation can be changed to forest. The \u201ccommunal\u201d forest enterprise can prepare a project about the change of land category to forest land.

Component 2.3: Decisions on forest inventory and management planning The Forest Codes of all programme countries establish the forest inventory and management planning (FMP; Rus. lesoustroystvo \u2013 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e) as a mandatory requirement for forest use and management. Formally forest use and management without updated FMP is illegal. However, where updated FMP are not available, forest use is usually not brought on hold and the forestry agencies would issue special permissions to carry on with forest use activities, either based on outdated FMP or even without any reference to previous FMP. For instance, in Armenia the main reference are FMP from 1991; in Russia 50% of the state forests are managed on the basis of FMP older than 10 years and 3 Mio ha former kolkhoz forest are without any FMP (\u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, 2010); and in Moldova in communal forests FMP can be formally one year outdated; in Georgia in many areas last FMP were prepared in the 1980s and are not any longer used as reference for decision making on forest use.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d21fc5d1-52e9-48e4-b0db-5b6700321c91": {"__data__": {"id_": "d21fc5d1-52e9-48e4-b0db-5b6700321c91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f957fcd350fb6d2d10d270535f0bdcc15b556d8eb8e673b6ede9a2caeaf083b"}, "2": {"node_id": "b9a1273d-366d-4ae9-8381-5019f76157d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fdaebe4d6f1fcc20c3226bfd03533d1ad758ce4ba1a963fda87315eba1028c0e"}}, "hash": "6bb5dfcdec93ca4a5669effb9282e28ff5d2d7ba73a2f50ae058b0ca8e865c6b", "text": "In all programme countries the organizational responsibility for FMP is in the national level forestry agencies (in Russia delegated to the Federal Subjects).

The local foresters are only consulted in an initial meeting and for clarifying boundaries of forestry units and forest sections. The inventory findings and the proposed management plan are to be presented by the FMP team to the local foresters. None of the programme countries requires approval of the FMP by the local forestry enterprise or by the branch of the national forestry agency. In all programme countries the legislation on forest inventories and management planning includes requirements on stakeholder participation. These requirements usually are met by one or several meetings at national, regional and/or local levels. The lowest participating level of public administration is usually the district. The sub-districts are not involved in the decision making on FMP, with the exception of Moldova, where FMP for communal forests, prepared with foreign assistance, involved the municipalities as the owners and managers of the forests. The FMP includes the determination of boundaries of forestry units and forest sections, the definition of protection and use categories of forest, the inventory of forests (site conditions, species composition, age classes, stand density, volumes, natural rejuvenation, health etc.) and the planning of activities on protection, reproduction and use of forests. In the Russian Federation the Forest Code does not mention the determination of specifics of cutting, harvest volumes and other aspects of use as part of the FMP in the narrow sense (Rus. lesoustroystvo \u2013 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e) but indicates 81 these in an additional planning document - the forestry regulations of the forestry unit (Rus. lesokhozyastvennyy reglament lesnichestva \u2013 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0433\u043b\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430) and they might also be part of the forest development project (Rus. proekt osvoeniya lesov \u2013 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442 \u043e\u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0432) that is to be elaborated by the permanent forest users or leaseholders. In other programme countries the focus of the FMP is on the determination of harvest and other silvicultural aspects play a secondary role, if any. Some FMP, notably in Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, seem to be especially weak in the development of site specific silvicultural targets for the development of forest stands and the determination of maintenance activities for their achievement. Also the interests of local people and other forest users and of the local self-governance bodies as well as conservation needs are weakly considered and addressed in most FMP. Table 13.

According to Junge, Fripp (2011) the Forest Research and Experimental Centre has developed FMPs over the past several years. The Forest Research and Experimental Centre (FREC) had been established in 1998 as State Joint- Stock Company under the MoNP, and since 2002 it has the status of a State Non-commercial Organization (Gevorgyan, 2009) as a unit under the Bio-resources Management Agency of the Ministry of Nature Protection. The FREC deals with the forest resources inventory and planning (Rus. lesoustroystvo\u2013 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e), forestry training, and forest field experiments. However, the Consultant during his mission in 2015 was told (Vardanyan, NGO representative, pers. comm. 2015) that Hayantar prepares the FMP, but not the FREC. Also Annex 8 of Gevorgyan (2009) indicates that the responsibility for FMP had been transferred from the FREC to Hayantar. The German development agency GIZ did an assessment of forest coverage. Based on satellite imagery area extent of deforestation and succession were determined. The results have not been made accessible to the public. NGO suspect that Hayantar put pressure against the publication, to conceal inconsistencies in official forest cover statistics. Azerbaijan Forest inventory and management planning (FMP) are mandatory for the forest fund and are the precondition for the implementation of any forestry activities. Updates are required every ten years. The tree and shrub vegetation outside of the forest fund is not covered by the FMP. The FMP were directly financed by the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources. In the past a FMP team had been working under the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources. A new FMP unit is now planned to be reestablished under the Ministry\u2019s Forestry Department. (Case Study Azerbaijan) Belarus Forest inventory and management planning (FMP) is mandatory for the entire forest fund and is carried out by the state unitary enterprise \u201cBELGOSLES\u201d under the Ministry of Forestry, which has the monopoly for these services. FMP are available for all state forestry enterprises, and these are updated in 10 years intervals. The forest inventory and management planning includes the determination of forest sections of all levels, the verification of the assignment of forests to different groups and protection categories, description of site and stand conditions, assessment of qualitative and quantitative characteristics of forest resources, the determination of necessary silvicultural works, intermediary and final cutting as well as the use of NWFP and other uses of the forests. In accordance the forestry activities for the ten-years planning period are established. Each FMP is mandatorily undergoing a state environmental expertise and approval by the Ministry of Forestry. The FMPs are the binding framework for the forestry activities of each state forestry enterprise and determine their annual planning and implementation. Use of forestry resources in areas without up-to-date FMP or in excess of or deviation from the provisions of the FMPs is prohibited. (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0423\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044f, 2015) 83 During the course of the process of FMP elaboration or update the FMP team holds two so-called technical meetings and two forest inventory and management planning meetings. In case of necessity, additionally intermediary meetings can take place. The meetings involve the respective state forestry enterprise, the district land-use officer as district administration representative and the district environmental department. Usually the rural councils are less involved, but sometimes their representatives participate in the meetings. (BELGOSLES, pers. comm. 2015) Most silvicultural and harvest issues are predetermined by the established applicable norms, and thus there is not much space for disagreement between the FMP team, the state forestry enterprise and the representatives of district and rural councils.

The \u201cRules\u201d provide enough flexibility to elaborate and adopt specific Terms of Reference (TOR) for each planning area. The forest inventory and management planning is conducted by contracted private companies, based on a tender announced by the organization in charge of the respective forest, i.e. in most areas the NFA, in communal forest areas the municipality. The inventory for each smallest homogenous parcel contains data on: species; general stand characteristics; height, average diameter; density; volume; dead wood. The management plan contains a determination of the target stand conditions. The TOR also require the determination of local demand for fuel and timber, but this is difficult to assess as local people would always claim higher needs to get access to surplus wood for sale. Stakeholders from the NFA and private service providers complained that the FMP are partly in old Soviet approach and style; ecological conditions as well as socio-economic aspects are not integrated and considered in the management planning, parts of practical relevance for local people are missing and local needs are inadequately reflected. (Case Study Georgia) While the Forest Code requires full public participation in the forest management planning, neither operationalize the \u201cRules\u201d this requirement nor is there any other established mechanism in place for public participation. In the practice the information about the FMP process is shared via internet; a meeting takes place at central level (but not necessarily at local level); the contractor reacts on comments received with responses and changes to the project. Finally the FMP is to be approved by the MENRP. The interviewed service provider always meets in the process with heads of local municipalities, but this is not required by the \u201cRules\u201d.

It seems that in the practice neither the NFA actively shares the FMP nor do municipalities make requests for access to them. (Case Study Georgia) For the forests of the municipality of Tbilisi an updated FMP does not exist and the status of the city\u2019s forests as formally not belonging to the forest fund should exempt them from the requirement of the FMP. In the communally managed Protected Landscape Tusheti the FMP is from 1986, but the administration does not have these for their forest areas. (Case Study Georgia) Moldova Forest inventory and management planning are mandatory for the entire forest fund regardless of the ownership. All forest inventory and management planning is done by a specialized state organization, the state enterprise \u201cICAS\u201d (Forest Research and Management Institute) under the Agency Moldsilva. While the general methodology is the same for all forests, some simplification has been introduced for the communal forests possessed by the municipality councils. The revision period is ten years. FMP is considered a state task and should be financed by the state, but no funding is allocated by the state for the FMP, neither in communal nor in state forests. The FMP in the state forests is financed by the forest enterprises themselves from their income. The costs of forest inventory and management planning of communal forests are supposed to be funded by the budget of the respective municipality, but these activities in communal forests are funded largely by international projects. Since 2005 forest inventory and management planning of more than 20,000 ha of communal forests were updated, but the larger part of communal forests does not have up-to-date inventories and management plans. In contrary, for the forests managed by Moldsilva the FMP are largely up to date, with no more than one year delay in updating. The forest enterprises of Moldsilva manage more productive forests and are thus able to pay for the FMP services provided by ICAS. As these FMPs are the basis for any forest use, there is as well economic pressure to allocate funds for inventory and planning. The focus in the FMP is more on allowable harvest, and less on the determination of stand specific silvicultural options, definition of development targets, activities and related costs and benefits.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bcac151e-63df-49de-8429-e3f8b898e6a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "bcac151e-63df-49de-8429-e3f8b898e6a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f9bbad4c64713c139b8e2ecc20bff2ea3d9a20234c580e2e370e162353060c0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "d66e8bcd-027e-440d-9cae-5afd7f1288d4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6c7d67f1c85c044d32303fa1692a105fb73d42f0abbfbe8644a3a82da2dd457"}}, "hash": "f454b466b3c2fb1540aca35c206862c86120d4d2a792e6a97f4e5991798ffb98", "text": "The procedure for forest inventory and management planning provides limited opportunity for local stakeholder involvement and for the consideration of needs and capacity at the local level.

The content of these activities and documents as far as determined in the Forest Code is partly overlapping. Their relation to the inventory and management planning in the narrow sense (sense (Rus. lesoustroystvo \u2013 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e) is not clear, in particular in what extent the \u201cforestry regulations of the forestry unit\u201d and the \u201cforest development project\u201d have to be based on the inventory and management planning in the narrow sense. The \u201cforestry regulations of the forestry unit\u201d are the document determining the specifics of forest use as well as protection and reproduction of forests for a period of ten years. They are approved by the federal forestry agency (Rosleskhoz) or (in case of communal ownership of the lands) by the local self-governance bodies. The \u201cforest development project\u201d as well contains information on forestry activities. The \u201cforest development projects\u201d are to be elaborated by the permanent forest user or forest leaseholder, and they are subject to expertise by the state or the municipality depending on the land ownership. The forest inventory and management planning in the narrow sense is carried out by service providers. The state enterprise BELGOSLES under the Ministry of Forestry of Belarus has done inventory and planning works in Russian forests based on contracts. Forest inventory and management planning in the narrow sense in 2010 for about half of Russia\u2019s forests where outdated (i.e. older than 10 years). For more than 3 Mio ha state forests that had been formerly in the possession of kolkhozes it did not exist at all (\u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, 2010). However, Seturidze and Zhelyaskov (\u0421\u0435\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0437\u0435, \u0416\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432, 2012) stated that in the past also in kolkhoz forests forest inventory and management planning had been carried out. While FMP are required on lands of the forest fund, defense and security, towns and settlements as well as protected areas, such requirement does not exist for forests on other lands, including agricultural lands. Forest inventory and management planning on these areas can be considered voluntary as a basis for the elaboration of the \u201cforest development project\u201d that would include the determination of the use of the forest. (Anonymous 201266) The change of the FMP system after the adoption of the new Forest Code caused the rapid decline of the amount of inventory and planning works and the loss of orientation in the forestry and forest use system (\u041b\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e96fd89-ea62-417b-9fc9-d09672aee46c": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e96fd89-ea62-417b-9fc9-d09672aee46c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89dcdfe27ecc90b18de329961ab3051ce23cbf85e74095451203a30fc6d06b17"}, "2": {"node_id": "5458ab37-b424-4f0b-8a3c-096f827de46c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a14cbf228af946e8dae6e958478d357157336955a95bd204deb6dc9f651b90cf"}}, "hash": "7e57018d8a42b6960335c3cbe2f26000c02c868534bf2ea2ba61ddc72b614c5b", "text": "2011).The changes led to the abolishment of the forest inventory and management planning in the narrow sense (Rus. lesoustroystvo) as uniform system.

(\u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432, 2010) The entire system of forest inventory and management planning in Russia seems to require substantial reformation and rehabilitation for becoming an operational tool for sustainable forest management.

Where no up-to-date FMP exists, annual cuts are defined by Ukrderzhlisproekt based on the old FMP. The FMP have to ignore any forests outside the established boundaries of the forest fund. The succession areas on abandoned agricultural lands are in reality forest, but there is no formal mandate to include these areas into the FMP. (Case Study Ukraine) The FMPs contain the determination of the categories of forest areas and general taxation data on stands. Based on this they determine the allowable harvest during the FMP period. The FMP do not contain recommendations or binding requirements on reforestation activities and silvicultural objectives. FMP does not provide flexibility for the determination of intermediary or main use, and the types of cuts are determined only by the age of the stands, applying a silvicultural approach based on clear cutting and age class forests. Local forestry enterprises via free GIS software can access forest inventory and management data, which have been provided by Ukrderzhlisproekt. (Case Study Ukraine) Participation of stakeholders in the process of forest inventory and management planning is realized through advice by the respective forestry enterprise to the FMP team and through the FMP meeting. In case of \u201ccommunal\u201d forests the FMP meeting takes place at region level and involves various stakeholders, including representatives of representatives of SFRA, of the region environmental department, region and district forestry enterprises, the region, council as well as NGOs. Various stakeholders reported that district and rural councils are not represented and do not have a voice in the FMP decision making. No local meetings are held about the FMPs for district forestry enterprises, in contrast to the FMPs for state forestry enterprises. Thus the local participation in decision making about \u201ccommunal\u201d forest is even less than about state forests. As the region forestry enterprises have the overall management and control and organize the FMP activities, they seem to be responsible for the low level of local participation. (Case Study Ukraine) Component 2.4: Decisions on implementation of forest management activities Forest management activities include, e.g., afforestation of non-forested land, reforestation, maintenance of rejuvenation, thinning, prevention and fighting of forest fires, pest control, and harvest. Decisions on where, in what extent and by what means forest management activities are implemented by forestry enterprises are in all programme countries supposed to be based on the FMP and on a set of technical instructions. In the state forests of Azerbaijan (partly), Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine up-to-date FMP are in place. Not all communal forests in Moldova and forests of \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises in Ukraine are covered by recent FMP. Many forest areas in Armenia and Georgia have only outdated FMP. In Russia the new system of \u201cforestry regulations of the forestry unit\u201d and \u201cforest development projects\u201d of leased forests is largely based on outdated inventories. Nevertheless, forestry activities, in particular harvest, take place in all these forests, either with reference to acting FMP, to outdated FMP, or even without any formal reference to FMP. The FMP should set the frame for the implementation by the forestry enterprises and other forest users of all forest management activities during the planning period, which is in all programme countries ten years. In varying extent, depending on the ownership of the forest, the user and the type of forest use, additional procedures are in place for decision making on timber and wood harvest, but often as well for any other forest management activities. These procedures imply the approval or permitting by state forestry enterprises where external users or contractors implement activities, by higher level forestry authorities where state forestry enterprises are implementers, and 87 in communal forests (Moldova, Ukraine) by state or region forestry authorities and additionally by the State Environmental Inspections. In all programme countries the decision making on harvest is based on the determination of annual allowable cuts (AAC) or at least takes them into consideration. The AAC should be determined in the frame of the FMP for each forestry unit, based on the wood volumes and increments and on the silvicultural development targets for each forest parcel. For planning and reporting purposes these site specific AAC are aggregated to forestry enterprises\u2019, regions\u2019 and country-wide AAC.

There are multiple reasons for these decisions, including a deduction because of inaccessible forest areas, the intention to increase the volume in the country\u2019s forests, concerns about negative public opinion in case of higher official harvest and the consideration of illegal cuts. The discrepancy between AAC and demand is one of the main factors causing unauthorized and accordingly unregulated and unsustainable wood harvest. (Junge, Fripp, 2011) In Azerbaijan only sanitary and other maintenance cutting is permitted. In the other programme countries the permitted amounts of harvest seem to correspond largely to the potential and the amounts planned in the FMP, as far as these are available and up-to-date. In Georgia during the last years reportedly in some areas concessionaires harvested significantly lower volumes of timber than permissible, due to low demand. In contrast, fuel wood is allocated to local households rather based on demand than on actual estimates of sustainable harvest volumes. (Case Study Georgia) Most forestry enterprises and leaseholders or concessionaires determine the specific cutting areas and the harvested volumes by themselves. In Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia and Russia the foresters would mark trees or cutting areas for limited self-harvest by local people. The permits for fuel wood collection (and in Russia also timber for personal needs) are issued on the basis of eligibility criteria, like local residency and others. In Armenia, Moldova and Ukraine only workers of the forestry enterprises and contractors can harvest trees, and the state forestry enterprises would indicate the locations and the amounts to be harvested. The communes in Moldova are not authorized to carry out the definition and marking of cutting areas and the determination of the harvest volumes. They therefore have to rely on the local representatives of the state forestry agency Moldsilva. Similarly in Ukraine the \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises have to get their harvest for main use (final logging) approved by the State Environmental Inspection and the felling permits issued by the region state forest administration. In Georgia the Code on Local Self-government, if implemented verbally, would provide the municipalities with exclusive authority over forests of local importance, and the national forestry authorities fear they would lose any stake in decision making on the implementation of forestry activities. This situation already exists in the municipality of Tbilisi. The implementation of forestry activities outside of lease or concession areas is done either by workers of the forestry enterprises or by private service providers. The selection of service providers either follows strict tender procedures (in Georgia) or can be based on personal connections, as it seems to be largely the case in Armenia. In some cases forestry enterprises would hire seasonal workers, in Ukraine often informally and with in-kind payments. Leaseholders and concessionaires implement forestry activities with own workforce or with contractors. This can lead to dwindling local employment in forestry, as reported from Georgia and Russia. Lease agreements and contracts of sale of standing timber in Russia and concessions in Georgia 88 are awarded on the basis of auctions. Also in Belarus standing and logged timber is sold on auctions, with restricted contingents available for the needs of local people. Table 14.

Approval of harvest in \u201ccommunal\u201d forests by State Environmental Inspection and permits by region state forestry administration; no influence on reforestation and silviculture by environmental agencies. The following paragraphs present country-specific aspects of the decision making on the implementation of forestry activities. Armenia In Armenia forest activities are exclusively implemented by Hayantar and the harvest brigades 89 authorized by Hayantar, with the exception of limited collection of fallen dry wood by local households. Most cutting and transportation of fuel wood and timber is done by these brigades. Hayantar issues and allocates via its 18 local branches (former state forestry enterprises) the permits for harvest to these brigades. Brigades carry a permit and operate with the knowledge of authorities, but the permits issued do not correspond with the actually harvested levels. (Junge, Fripp, 2011) The permitted cutting levels are based on the allocations of the AAC to the forestry units, and the AAC is supposed to be based on the FMP, which had been developed over the past several years by the Forest Research Experimental Centre (FREC). As explained above, the government has set nation-wide AAC in recent years even lower than the aggregated amount of local harvest determined by the FMP. For instance, in 2010 the national AAC was only 35,000 m\u00b3 (in 2015 it was only 22,000 m\u00b3, Petrosyan, pers. comm. 2015), compared to an estimated annual forest growth of 393,000 to 686,000 m\u00b3. Hayantar justifies the reduced AAC by the facts that only 63% of the forested area is accessible; lowered AAC allows forests to recover and accumulate volume; concerns over the reaction of environmental NGOs; and the attempt to offset continuing unaccounted and illegal harvest. (Junge, Fripp, 2011) The AAC and the legal collection of fallen wood by villagers can by far not meet the estimated annual demand of at least 475,000 m\u00b3 of fuel wood only. Also imports are insufficient to cover the supply gap. Thus the majority of fuel wood is harvested unaccounted, but almost exclusively by the brigades that are authorized by Hayantar. Junge, Fripp (2011) argue that \u201ca low AAC, which does nothing to address demand, actually guarantees that the vast majority of cutting will be done illegally/informally\u201d and recommend that the nation-wide AAC should be based on accurate data in the FMP and reflect a summation of the local AACs, but should not be artificially changed by the Ministry of Agriculture. Azerbaijan The state forestry enterprises implement their forestry activities with own work force and on the basis of plans decided by the Forestry Department of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources. Decisions on permitting local households to harvest fuel wood for their own needs are taken by the state forestry enterprises, which would issue the necessary permits and their rangers would mark the trees that can be cut. The owners and users of lands covered by tree and shrub vegetation outside of the forest fund do not implement any forest management activities. The Forest Code in theory provides for the opportunity to carry out activities that improve the conditions of the stands and the fulfilment of their functions, including various forms of cutting of trees. In the reality the region and district authorities in charge of environmental protection do not permit any cutting of trees. These stands are not included in the forest inventory and management planning, and for this reason a mandatory formal precondition for any forestry activities is lacking.

Thinning operations are used to regulate the species composition. The FMP defines all thinning for each section, except of the first thinning in newly planted young growth (Rus. osvetlenie \u2013 \u043e\u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435), which is done according to standard instructions. Reforestation is done according to reforestation projects, which are elaborated by the state forestry enterprises. Reforestation is required within three year after logging, where natural rejuvenation is insufficient. (Case Study Belarus) District administrations make decisions on the lease of forests, except about leases for the purpose of logging, which are decided by the region administration in agreement with the state forestry enterprises. Fuel wood and timber is sold by the state forestry enterprises at affordable prices. Local people can as fuel wood also cut trees, marked by forest rangers for selective maintenance cutting, based on permits issued by the local forester. (Case Study Belarus) The decision making process on harvest activities has been criticized as being potentially prone to abuse and corruption. The legal entity that is carrying out the forest management and does the harvest themselves also issues the forest cutting permits, thus possibly allowing for illegal harvest. (\u041b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f et al., 2011) Substantial abuse and violations are very unlikely, because of the existing procedures of decision making, control and oversight within the hierarchical structures of the Ministry of Forestry, the region state production forestry associations and the state forestry enterprises, and the independent elaboration of the FMP by BELGOSLES, in combination with additional external control and law enforcement by the State Inspection for the Protection of the Plant and Animal World under the President. Georgia Decisions on the implementation of forest management activities should be based on the approved and up-to-date FMP, but most FMP are long outdated, and decisions on the implementation of forest management activities are made on an ad-hoc basis. Currently, with the exception of timber (and fuel wood) harvest, all main silvicultural activities are practically on hold. (Case Study Georgia) The local representations or forestry units of the NFA\u2019s region forestry services issue cutting permits for fuel wood (and based on the complicated procedure described under 1.3 for timber) for personal use by the local population. These local foresters would as well determine the specific locations and type of trees to be cut. As the system is centralized, these decisions are made after approval from the NFA67. In protected areas additionally any management and use have to be authorized by the MENRP. Concessionaires make their decisions on forest management activities in the frame of the concession contracts, annual limits and FMPs - if existing - and are responsible for the correct marking of cutting areas68. The NFA rarely interferes in the decision making of concessionaires on their forest management. Moldova Moldsilva in the frame of its own hierarchical structures makes all decisions on the management of the state forests on the basis of the FMP. Forest management activities have to be implemented in accordance to the requirements set by the approved FMPs during their ten-year revision period. Where the revision period of these plans expired without renewal of the plan, in practice decisions 67Government Decree #242/2010 68Government Decree #242/2010 91 on forest management activities are made with reference to the outdated plans and under consideration of the actual situation. Any cuts, including those in communal forests, have to be authorized by the local office (district level) of this State Ecological Inspection (SEI) of the Ministry of Environment. The councils of the municipalities make most decisions concerning their forest, e.g. on the allocation of harvested fuelwood to needy and other families and applicable prices and the allocation of communal forest for lease. Areas of communal forests, in which cuttings are planned, have to be marked and harvest amounts have to be determined by Moldsilva. The municipalities use own work force or hire local workers for most of the forestry works in older stands and for harvest of trees. In many communal forests afforestation and maintenance activities in newly afforested and reforested areas are implemented by Moldsilva.

The forest management has to follow a number of rules that are established for each forest region by Rosleskhoz: age classes for tree stands to be harvested, rules for harvest of timber and other forest resources, rules of fire safety in forests, rules for sanitary safety in forests, rules for reforestation and rules for maintenance of forests. The decision making on forestry activities is connected to the inventory and planning, as described under Component 2.3. The inventory and management planning in the narrow sense (lesoustroystvo \u2013 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e) is the basis for all decisions on forestry management, but most of these inventories are long outdated.

The available information suggests that forest users can implement forest management activities based on these documents \u2013 in the case of state enterprises as permanent forest users based on the \u201cforestry regulations of the forestry unit\u201d and in the case of private leaseholders based on the \u201cforest development project\u201d elaborated by them. The \u201cforestry regulations of the forestry unit\u201d are approved by Rosleskhoz or (in case of communal ownership of the lands) by the local self-governance bodies. The \u201cforest development projects\u201d have to pass a formal expertise by the state or the municipality depending on the land ownership. Forest users have to report annually in a standardized format about their forest use activities in accordance to their \u201cforest development projects\u201d. The violation of the provisions of the \u201cforestry regulations\u201d and \u201cforest development projects\u201d lead to the cancellation of lease contracts or contracts of sale as well as termination of permanent and temporary user rights on forest sections. 69 If not indicated otherwise, based on the Forest Code of the Russian Federation #200-FZ/4 December 2006, last edits 21 July 2014 (\u041b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043e\u0442 4 \u0434\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0431\u0440\u044f 2006 \u0433.

The timber harvest has to be in the frame of the annual allowable cut, determined for the respective forestry unit, and has to be in accordance to the determined age classes for harvest. Timber harvest by citizens and legal entities is permitted on the basis of lease contracts. The leaseholders have the right to build forest roads and other infrastructure for the harvest of timber. Where protection forests, e.g. in managed reserves (zakaznik \u2013 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a), are under lease the opportunities for regular harvest can be very limited. For this reason leaseholders seek to get sanitary cuts, even as clear cuts, permitted despite being technically not justified70. In exceptional cases timber harvest can be permitted for the needs of the state or municipalities on the basis of contracts of sale of forest stands. Citizens can harvest fuel wood and timber for personal needs on the basis of contracts of sale of forest stands, with members of indigenous small peoples being entitled to harvest higher amounts for their personal needs than established by the acting norms. Inconsistencies between established norms and the real needs and forest conditions in different Federal Subjects have been criticized (\u041f\u0440\u043e\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u043d, \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432, 2010).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f7950ce-67f0-4d89-9029-6dd6a45a0a48": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f7950ce-67f0-4d89-9029-6dd6a45a0a48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e919384a4b52240fc2d31dc36b6c00a0df4ba3cfc406c9d151f817686a5f3b0f"}, "2": {"node_id": "7eaef64f-27c0-4f94-a41a-f68c25b780e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72a168e11c7807b53a90f2168d062a70028a8773a2383fb96d2eb1d7c37b4ba5"}}, "hash": "6e7ebc9b5e58e94de29f92e7631353acc768b3af6771f9a92bc9f9f0a949ee57", "text": "The contracts of sale of forest stands contain the decisions on the specific section and parcel where the timber can be harvested and on the amount of harvestable timber.

Temporary structures can be erected in such sections. Also forest sections can be leased for the establishment of forest plantations (tree plantations).

There might be a risk that forest fires are used as pretext, similar to other sanitary cutting, for otherwise not permissible forest use. Forest regeneration has to be done by the leaseholders of forest sections used for harvest. Outside of leased areas the forest regeneration is task of the state organs and municipalities. Forest regeneration can be reforestation or natural regeneration or a combination of both and is to be realized in accordance to the rules established by Rosleskhoz71, to the accepted \u201cforest development projects\u201d and to site specific forest regeneration projects.

The district forestry enterprise prepares the draft document, which is checked and endorsed by the region forestry enterprise. Areas and amounts of felling for main use have to be approved by the State Environmental Inspection. The region state forestry administration then issues all forest cutting permits and the certificates of origin of timber for export. All harvest of wood products is done by the forestry enterprises and their contractors. The forestry enterprises seasonally hire local workers, often informally and for in-kind payment. (Case Study Ukraine) The district forestry enterprises prepare projects of reforestation activities in accordance to the general recommendations in the FMP and/or the forest type species composition that is determined by the stand conditions. These reforestation projects are confirmed by the region forestry enterprise. The State Environmental Inspection does not influence on the implementation of reforestation and silvicultural activities, although these activities have a major impact on the future composition and structure of the forests, determining their biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services. (Case Study Ukraine) Decisions on lease of forest lands are made by the region council, with agreement by the rural councils or the district councils, the region forestry enterprise and the region state forestry department. The use of NWFP for personal use, and in the practice as well for small-scale commercial purposes, does not require any permits and no formal decisions are made on such forest uses. (Case Study Ukraine) 5.3 Pillar 3: Implementation, enforcement and compliance Component 3.1: Capacity of forestry organizations and territorial decision making bodies and administrations In all programme countries the capacity of the forest sector as of any other public sector has suffered in some extent during the transition period. Low salaries in all public sectors and in forestry in particular, caused the loss of experienced staff and reduced the attraction for young qualified people. The capacity situation, however, varies between the programme countries. The capacity of the national level forestry agencies in Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine is comparably well developed.

In the mentioned three countries sufficient harvestable forest resources are available that are in demand by the market to support the state forestry agencies financially. In Armenia, Georgia and the Russian Federation the capacity of the national level and region level forestry agencies has substantially declined since the dissolution of the Soviet Union and is now assessed by most experts as insufficient. In Armenia the state forest agency Hayantar, despite some increase in the budget after 2005, is severely underfunded by the state and the income created from the sale of forest products is insufficient. While Armenia as a rather forest poor country has generally less potential for profitable forestry than e.g. Belarus and Ukraine, the reasons for the low income of the state forestry agency are more in the fixed wood prices not accounting for inflation and for market prices and in the fact that the majority of harvest goes unaccounted and not paid to Hayantar, factors that are explained under pillar 1.5 and 2.4. In Georgia the national and region level forestry agencies have been continuously cut down in terms of financial resources, staff and other capacity in the course of the market oriented reforms. Also the forest research institute has been closed. Only with the recent National Forest Concept74 the insufficient capacity has been officially recognized, and now substantial capacity development is planned. Similarly to Georgia, in Russia with the reform of the forest sector and the delegation of functions from the federal level to the Federal Subjects and to private leaseholders the capacity of the national level forestry agency has been cut back, the federal forest protection was abolished and skilled staff left the agency without being replaced by new qualified staff. In Azerbaijan human and technical capacity is obviously declining in the national level forestry agency, the forestry department of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources. Here the reasons seem to be not in poorly developed reforms, but in contrast, in a rather transfixed inherited system and the exclusively protectionist approach, which does not allow for modern sustainable and multifunctional forestry. The capacity of the local level state forestry organizations largely reflects the situation in the national and region level forestry agencies of the respective countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d3bcc17-ffa9-4768-be70-f966c4dbf8e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d3bcc17-ffa9-4768-be70-f966c4dbf8e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of local forests in ENPI East countries and Russia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7034f559534eecaec4c95ce2ea5eecfdb38f8e2e9b8d174c1f2bfcb43cfad028"}, "2": {"node_id": "ec19c8e9-d28a-4e22-8e5a-69dd6c568c62", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-local-forests-enpi-east-countries-and-russia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0179a70ed3128b86088199475d7f0a5a7fbbb3bc2dbc2310043c6989fd556cac"}}, "hash": "615cc7fc3b1b51c0403711b486d60086fd0d23b37b6418d29694a6fdb8e3970e", "text": "In Belarus state forestry enterprises have large capacity in form of qualified and skilled staff, necessary buildings, other infrastructure, equipment and technology.

The state forestry enterprises in Ukraine are functional, and stakeholders their assessed capacity as sufficient, although the current economic crisis and intended restrictions on the export of round-wood may negatively impact on their economic situation and in the result on their capacity. In Azerbaijan the state forestry enterprises still exist, but due to the prohibition of substantial harvest their incomes are low, and while entirely depending on the state budget funding they cannot develop their capacity and attract qualified, motivated staff. After most of Armenia\u2019s state forestry enterprises went bankrupt and had to sell premises and equipment they have lost their status as legal entities. They are now just branches of the state forestry agency Hayantar, suffering from the same insufficiencies in terms of financial situation and capacity as does the national level. The low salaries hardly attract qualified and motivated staff, while the large unaccounted wood harvest and sale provides for substantial informal incomes, accordingly causing recruitment being more motivated by connections and informal economic abilities than qualification and motivation.

National Forest Concept. Tbilisi 95 Similar to the capacity situation in the state forestry agencies and their local level forestry organizations, the capacity of the institutes or enterprises in charge of forest inventory and management planning varies much between the programme countries. Again, Belarus as well as Moldova and Ukraine have sufficient capacity in form of specialized organizations, which are subordinated to the national level forestry agencies but function as enterprises. These three organizations, BELGOSLES in Belarus, ICAS in Moldova and Ukrderzhlisproekt in Ukraine, have qualified staff, suitable premises, modern technology and equipment and some extent of economic freedom to fulfil their functions. BELGOSLES, for instance, is able to provide inventory and planning services to forest possessors in Russia. However, in all these organizations human capacity is not sufficiently developed to involve local people and other stakeholders in a participatory way to address their interests in the FMP as well as to apply modern silvicultural approaches. These insufficiencies are largely caused by the prevalence of old, narrowly production oriented approaches in the forest sector of these countries and in particular in the national level agencies, which supervise the FMP organizations and develop the technical instructions and terms of reference for the inventory and planning works. These problems also exist in some extent in Georgia and Russia, although organizational structures and approaches of inventory and planning have changed there. In both countries the inventory and planning works are no longer a state monopoly but are contracted to the private sector. Capacity in the private sector is either developing as FMP services are contracted or can be bought from outside of the country. The national and regional forest agencies and their local branches or forestry enterprises have not always enough skilled experts to define the inventory and planning tasks, to guide the works and to evaluate and use the results. The efficiency of state forestry agencies and their local forestry enterprises and branches is hard to assess. In Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine these organizations are in some extent self-financing economic units and thus in their own interest they have to work efficient. On the other hand, some state forestry agencies and their local branches suffer from an overload of paperwork on planning and reporting. For instance, in Russia paperwork is said to occupy three quarters of the working time of staff of forestry units and forest parks. (\u0428\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0446 et al., 2010) The capacities of those forestry enterprises that are managing \u201ccommunal\u201d forests in Ukraine are largely sufficient, despite their, compared to state forestry enterprises, more difficult economic situation. The \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises have adequate staff, premises and equipment, although most of these \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises complain about shortage of qualified staff. The region forestry enterprises provide some technical and administrative services to the district forestry enterprises and thus achieve some economy of scale, compensating in some extent the economic difficulties caused by the, in comparison to state forests, smaller and more fragmented forests of lower productivity managed by \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises. In Moldova the municipalities manage their forests themselves. Multifunctional and/or joint communal enterprises are still in early stages of establishment. Many municipalities lack of almost any capacity to manage their communal forests. Few municipalities have small teams of foresters with technical education and access to the necessary equipment. The level of capacity of communes to manage forests mainly depends on the productive potential of the forest and the income achieved by its use as well as on the prehistory of community management and support. In the capital of Georgia, Tbilisi, the municipality\u2019s capacity to manage its forest is limited to some very basic oversight due to insufficient technical staff, and lack of any workforce and equipment. The municipality does not have a forest protection service and all forestry works have to be contracted to private enterprises through tender procedures. The municipality of Akhmeta which manages the forests in Tusheti Protected Landscape as communal forests is in the process of developing the necessary capacity within the PA administration and already employs qualified staff and has purchased equipment. The MENRP and NFA of Georgia consider the development of sufficient 96 capacity in the municipalities as a precondition for the handover of responsibility on forests of local importance to them. But as long as the handover is not decided, municipalities have little opportunities and justification to develop forestry capacity.

In Ukraine region councils and district councils that own \u201ccommunal\u201d forestry enterprises usually do not have own forestry capacity. The territorial administrations of the other programme countries have only limited authority on forests. Table 15.
