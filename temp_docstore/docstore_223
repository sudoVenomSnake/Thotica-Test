nity is a sign of social prestige and contributes to the establishment and maintenance of social networks (Ibrahima Niang and Quarles van Ufford, 2002). HIV stigma reduces the number of people with whom meals are shared, thus isolating the family and leading to a decline in the family\u2019s social status in the community. Community connectivity is also established through marriage. Individual and family stigma of HIV can interfere with the cultivation of important social relationships, and the \u201cmarriagability\u201d of a family member is restricted due to the presence of an HIV-affected individual in the household (Shreedhar, 2000). Moreover, stigma undermines the ability to depend on social networks in times of economic need. For example, in Viet Nam funeral costs for a person who has died from AIDS are often not mitigated through financial help from family members whose lack of sympathy is driven by HIV-related discrimination (Aus AID and UNDP, 2005). A rise in the rates of AIDS-related deaths increases the number of orphans who need care (Booysen, 2004), and loss of social capital (as a result of stigma) compromises the ability to draw on social networks for care provision. Furthermore, orphans who are brought into the home may be denied opportunities given to other children of the household, such as education, and forced into the informal economy 13 (e.g., sex work) at an early age in order to supplement family income (Ansell and Young, 2004). By thus inhibiting education and occupational opportunities for the individual and family, HIV stigma ultimately limits long-term national economic development (Betchel and Apakupakul, 1999). In presenting barriers to education, employment, economic resources, and the maintenance of social networks, HIV-related stigma compromises the capacity-sets of individuals and families. This could have a bi-directional effect on individual and family socioeconomic development. In a study of communities in China, those with low levels of human development had the highest levels of HIV-related stigma (Chen, Choe, Chen, and Zhang, 2005). Stigma, in turn, may perpetuate the family\u2019s restricted development as individuals are denied access to jobs and participation in the community. The authors suggest that this may also contribute to increased risk-taking behaviours as individuals are forced to obtain income through any means possible, such as transactional sex. It might also lead to further HIV risk in the broader community, if as in some cases documented, HIV contaminated blood is sold to generate revenue. 3.2 Institutional and Structural Stigma Influences on Individual and Family Socioeconomic Development Discriminatory policies driven by antipathy towards people living with HIV compromise the economic well-being and capabilities of individuals and families. Company-wide mandatory testing policies can prevent skilled workers from applying for higher-level positions (Manopaiboon et al., 1998). This practice in conjunction with dismissal of HIV positive employees can put families in economic hardship due to additional loss of earnings (and earning potential) from those attributable to illness. National policies requiring testing of entering migrants or individuals applying for work visas extend the economic impact of HIV discrimination across international borders. In many Asian countries, sending family members abroad is an important means by which families increase household income due to limited economic opportunity or low-wage employment in local communities. In some countries such as the Philippines and Sri Lanka, remittances from overseas migrant workers constitute a vital source of foreign exchange earnings. Families from economically depressed communities rely on remittances as one of their primary sources of income. Refusal of entry or deportation due to one\u2019s HIV status not only denies one\u2019s right to work but also has a negative impact on a family economic well-being. Microfinance institutions are also important in developing countries and are often the only financial sources of small loans to community members. These loans have been an important financial means for individuals and families to fight poverty (Vonderlack and Schreiner, 2001).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe7aa247-ed5e-469f-950f-ac4b9515696d": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe7aa247-ed5e-469f-950f-ac4b9515696d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-related-stigma-and-discrimination-asia-review-human-development-consequences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Related Stigma and Discrimination in Asia: A Review of Human Development Consequences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-related-stigma-and-discrimination-asia-review-human-development-consequences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "91271eb963315e6618d118dd7e336396733db78780238fa9c13d00ab091af0e3"}, "2": {"node_id": "7443f1e4-1351-4584-b555-9b692455f429", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-related-stigma-and-discrimination-asia-review-human-development-consequences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7be9335b6e5f08595184bdd18b8e39d26ae90065ed695ce4e8dd9743a0cb20bc"}}, "hash": "18ca7736db89abdf15e85f5c6786ca6a66f1f0e365c52782e0e21e3f3b39c867", "text": "Microcredit has been particularly successful in helping families in South Asia start up and maintain small businesses (Khandker, 1998; Latif, 2001).

In addition, Parker (2000) has chronicled the greater difficulty of HIV-affected families in repaying these loans, further jeopardizing the role of microfinance as an avenue out of poverty for families affected by HIV. 14 Lack of access to health care or affordable health care services can also have a negative impact on the capability sets of individuals and families affected by HIV. Where health care is not available or affordable, PLHIV have fewer opportunities to effectively manage the disease, such as treating opportunistic infections or receiving antiretroviral therapy regimens. Poorly managed illness can lead to a weakened physical state of the HIV-infected individual. As mentioned previously, this limits the capability sets of the individual by restricting economic activity in the form of absenteeism from work or restructuring of duties, which in turn, affects the capabilities of families who are relied upon for caretaking responsibilities. People living with HIV who are denied access to health care or face significant barriers to receiving adequate care are likely to experience declines in their health status, thereby interfering with their ability to actively participate in economic activities or tasks crucial to household subsistence. For example, restricted access to health care due to stigma among rural women in Africa has resulted in high mortality rates and undercut food production given that women comprise 60-80 percent of the agrarian labour force (ILO 2000 in Gaffeo). Requiring people living with HIV (or their family members) to pay for excessive and unnecessary care such as extra gloves, AIDS kits, and additional testing directly depletes a family\u2019s scare resources. Stigmatization by health professionals reduces contact with the health care system. This behaviour in addition to the denial of necessary procedures can lead to deterioration in one\u2019s health, increasing absenteeism and loss of earnings. Lack of access to health care among people living with HIV can have transgenerational effects as well. Not being able to access health care services can lead to severe malnourishment among women living with HIV. Gaffeo (2003) notes that malnourishment among mothers with HIV leads to iron-deficiency, mental retardation, general sickliness and interrupted growth among their children, thus hindering the children\u2019s health and future work capacity. HIV-related discrimination in the health care system was frequently reported in studies on stigma in Asia (Bharat and Aggleton, 1999; Bharat, 2001; Paxton et al., 2005; Reidpath and Chan, 2005). Institutional stigma also exerts an independent effect on individual and family level development. Sex workers and injecting drug users are at the highest risk of HIV infection in South and South East Asia (ADB 2005) and often the focus of discriminatory policies. Compulsory rehabilitation for injecting drug users and sex workers, such as those in China and Vietnam, restricts individual economic activity. Although it is commonly assumed that injecting drug users are not employed, a 2003 study in Vietnam demonstrated that approximately one-third of this population had some form of employment (UNDP, 2003). These mandatory rehabilitation programs are criticized for not providing individuals with vocational training that would enable them to become economically productive citizens in sanctioned sectors of the economy upon completion of the program. Such practices may be counterproductive and undermine dually stigmatized groups\u2019 ability to maintain a satisfactory standard of living. Social capital can also be limited as a result of institutional or structural level discriminatory policies. Gains in social capital can be made through marriage or occupation. Laws prohibiting marriage of people living with HIV, such as those in India until 2002, have negative impacts on an individual\u2019s ability to create important social networks. Not only do such restrictions carry economic repercussions by preventing legal rights to pensions and property, but also isolate individuals and wear away social safety nets. 15 Prohibitions against people living with HIV entering religious orders have a similar effect. Sending a family member into a religious order is one way in which economic burdens can be alleviated in some rural communities. In addition, having a family member as part of a religious order improves a family\u2019s social status in their communities. By prohibiting entry of people living with HIV into religious orders, community-level stigma is reinforced and its economic impacts exacerbated. Moreover, individuals lose their freedom of self-determination. 4. RESEARCH AGENDA The consequences of HIV stigma and discrimination are complex and multi-dimensional. Stigma has important physical and psychological effects, ranging from diminished social support and depression to inadequate medical care, insufficient treatment and increased mortality. These consequences contribute to and exacerbate pernicious socioeconomic outcomes, such as loss of earnings", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b2d101a-9423-4036-b933-9264480a45a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b2d101a-9423-4036-b933-9264480a45a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-related-stigma-and-discrimination-asia-review-human-development-consequences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Related Stigma and Discrimination in Asia: A Review of Human Development Consequences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-related-stigma-and-discrimination-asia-review-human-development-consequences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "afc3052b4f088804481ece658923f3b4f9aa77ca79920354409bc5f6cb029d51"}}, "hash": "afc3052b4f088804481ece658923f3b4f9aa77ca79920354409bc5f6cb029d51", "text": "and earning potential. Furthermore, the economic effects of stigma feed back into detrimental physical and psychosocial outcomes, creating a complicated interplay of cause and effect. This is only one of many topics that must be addressed in future research. In addition to the physical, psychological and economic challenges presented by infection, PLHIV and their families are faced with a host of additional challenges due to prevailing societal stigmas. This overview of the role of stigma on human development of PLHIV and their families in Asia highlights important areas for future research. We have just commemorated the 25th anniversary of the first cases of HIV, and we now stare into the face of an epidemic that, by all accounts, is expanding in Asia. Lessons learned about HIV prevention and control in one country have failed to inform decisions in other countries (Sepkowitz, 2006); as a result, the epidemic continues to spread throughout the world. Merson (2006) suggests that in the countries hardest hit by the epidemic (or soon to be hardest hit), the foundations of human development, governance and national security are eroding, and that this will have multi-generational implications. Although not exhaustive, listed here are some initial ideas to promote further empirical research in the area of stigma and human development in Asia. Women and Stigma: The prevailing gender inequality and disproportionate vulnerability of women to HIV in the region is reflected in the manifestation of stigma as well. Bearing the burden of blame, shame and lower status in society, women suffer disproportionately from stigma as well. Limited avenues for redress, oppressive societal values and norms and coping mechanisms make the situation much worse for them than men. Impact of Multiple Stigmas: Moreover, there has been limited attention focused on the impact of multiple stigmas; that is, being HIV positive, as well an ethnic/tribal minority, mother, widow, orphan, MSM, unemployed, commercial sex worker, and/or injecting drug user, et cetera. Socioeconomic Impact of Stigma and Discrimination: Stigma and discrimination have an associated socio-economic cost arising out of absenteeism, denial of jobs, denial of education and access to property and wealth, and isolation from economic activities. Stigma induced medical manifestations such as depression and stress accelerate disease progression, 16 while real and perceived discrimination drive people living with HIV to suicides. Research in this direction can help advocacy for specific policies and programmes. Cultural and Religious Beliefs/Practices: One must identify resources that faith- based organizations might bring to stem stigma and discrimination, and consider ways to leverage these organizations to do greatest good. One must also minimize the potential constraints that cultural or religious norms and values might impose. Healthcare Sector: Healthcare providers and institutions are important sources of information, education, prevention and treatment. Individual and family level stigmas result in deleterious health behaviours (e.g., poor medication adherence, testing behaviours, and HIV status disclosure), underlining the importance of strong healthcare resources. At the same time, some of the most profound institutional stigmas have been documented in healthcare settings. More research is needed to determine how best to train healthcare providers to offer non- discriminatory care, and to promote equitable services/policies at the institutional level. This is important because unfounded concerns about disease spread through casual contact have resulted in limited resources being wasted. Stigma and Access to Treatment: The development and distribution of highly active antiretroviral therapy has changed the course of the HIV epidemic. However, stigma poses barriers to accessing treatment because of the fear of disclosure of HIV status and possible discrimination. Enhancing access to treatment and reducing stigma can be mutually beneficial and research into inter-relationship between stigma and treatment can help policy and programme interventions. Impact of Stigma on Prevention Efforts: The stigma of disease and its associated risk behaviours (sex, drugs) have restricted prevention efforts. To truly stem the epidemic, we must consider the best approaches to primary, secondary and tertiary prevention - in light of stigma \u2013 and to protect the social and economic integrity of communities worldwide. This may mean finding ways to challenge norms of discourse regarding \u201cacceptable\u201d behaviours and their consequences for health and disease. Clinical approaches to prevention that must be considered given recent evidence for effectiveness include male circumcision, pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis against sexual transmission in high-risk populations, and microbicidal agents. Vaccine Development: There may also be individual to institutional impacts of vaccine development. On the individual level, stigma and discrimination can impact who elects to enrol in a vaccine trial and/or actually would be willing to take an approved vaccine. The role of dis- inhibition following distribution of an HIV vaccine will also be critical for the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ae94f14-0988-48f4-9417-b7a4cab942cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ae94f14-0988-48f4-9417-b7a4cab942cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-related-stigma-and-discrimination-asia-review-human-development-consequences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Related Stigma and Discrimination in Asia: A Review of Human Development Consequences", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-related-stigma-and-discrimination-asia-review-human-development-consequences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5db37d2314721a1e9e2316afd50ead100640e779fe5629a792b9a4d7a133acd5"}, "3": {"node_id": "7a7a12da-71c8-4c9d-9f00-3d87711f0926", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-related-stigma-and-discrimination-asia-review-human-development-consequences", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "edf9bdd7d774b0d839f238e79738ffa18c0d93d59244a802e0d9ddb175208ff6"}}, "hash": "b2777793cd6bc552480fb9a4cd19313e7f07fb3883f65cba2464d92072114317", "text": "spread of HIV through the region. Of course, should an effective vaccine be approved and distributed - not expected in the next decade - the impacts for stopping the spread of HIV would have profound impacts on human development. Education/Employment: The bi-directional effects of stigma and development in the education and employment sectors are critical as these are the domains with the greatest opportunity for individual and collective growth and development. Restrictions in either sector based on individual, institutional or structural (i.e., policy) related stigma can have devastating long-term impact on children and youth as well as adults of productive age. Critical empirical attention must be focused on the determinant and consequences of stigma in these domains as they are at the heart of human development in a community/country/region. Political Leadership: It would be critically important to identify the role of political leadership in defending against HIV-related stigma, and also in supporting the growth of economies despite constraints of disease. Policy Implementation and Enforcement: The impact of discriminatory policies against persons infected or affected by HIV/AIDS must be evaluated. Rigorous structural-level evaluations are difficult to conduct; however, there may be an opportunity for \u201cnatural experiments\u201d insofar as one can evaluate outcomes (e.g., HIV risk behaviour, disease prevalence, disease progression, economic progress/decline) before versus after policy implementation. Stigma and Disease Spread and Progression: One must determine whether stigma actually has any impact on high-risk behaviour and subsequent spread of disease, and/or whether stigma can directly/indirectly influence viral replication rate. Specifically, with secrecy and lack of disclosure, one could evaluate whether HIV would spread more rapidly through the population. Further, in the absence of HIV, one could evaluate how economic development might be expanded. Impact of Stigma on \u201cCapabilities\u201d: Sen\u2019s approach to human development is based on political freedom, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and protective securities. It will be challenging to investigate the impact of stigma and discrimination on these outcomes. This work will likely have to be conducted by economists, and others (e.g., sociologists, anthropologists, political scientists) who take a broad perspective beyond impact on individuals. In turn, the impact of these aspects of development on stigma in a community must also be evaluated. 17 18 5. REFERENCES ActionAid (2003). Time to Act: HIV/AIDS in Asia.

This report summarises the outcomes and critical elements of the presentations, technical papers and discussions from a High Level Consultation on HIV-sensitive Social Protection for Impact Mitigation in Asia and the Pacific held in Siem Reap, Cambodia from 27 to 29, April 2011. The consultation was organised by UNDP in partnership with UNAIDS, UNICEF, ILO and APN+ with participation from more than 60 HIV and social protection specialists from eight countries (Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Nepal, PNG, Viet Nam and Thailand) in the Asia-Pacific region. While preparing this report, special attention has been paid to the technical and policy aspects of the presentations and discussions with a view to deepening the understanding of HIV-sensitive social protection in the region, as well as to facilitate South-South learning. Key materials produced for or during the consultation are included in the annex. All the background documents, presentations and other materials can be accessed online by clicking here. Foreword Since the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, there has been heightened attention to social protection in Asia and the Pacific to safeguard vulnerable populations from economic and livelihood shocks. The recent global financial crisis and the continuous food and fuel price inflation further underscore the significance of social protection. Social protection reduces people\u2019s vulnerability to socio-economic risks and impoverishment. It protects them from shocks and helps them conserve and accumulate assets so that they can improve their livelihoods and productivity. It also contributes to transforming economic and social relations in ways that strengthen the longer term livelihood prospects of the poor and vulnerable people. People living with HIV are one such vulnerable group that needs social protection support. Studies by UNDP in Asia clearly show that people living with HIV and their households are chronically burdened by illnesses, loss of jobs and income, rising medical expenses, food insecurity and depletion of savings and other resources. The impact is more severe on women. This calls for strategic HIV-sensitive social protection initiatives that can protect affected people from irreversible coping mechanisms and poverty. The key to sustainable HIV-sensitive social protection, as examples in the region and elsewhere show, is not to create parallel systems, but to appropriately integrate HIV into existing social protection initiatives. This report summarises the outcomes and critical elements of the presentations, technical papers and discussions from the \u201cHigh Level Consultation on HIV-sensitive Social Protection for Impact Mitigation in Asia and the Pacific\u201d that UNDP organized in partnership with UNAIDS, UNICEF, ILO and APN+ in Siem Reap, Cambodia from 27 to 29, April 2011. I am glad to note that more than 60 senior representatives from eight national governments, UN agencies and civil society participated in the consultation. While preparing this report, special attention has been paid to the technical and policy aspects with a view to deepening the understanding of HIV-sensitive social protection and facilitating South-South learning.

It\u2019s in this context that UNDP, in partnership with UNICEF, ILO and APN+, organized the High Level Consultation in Siem Reap in April. An encouraging result of the Consultation, among others that are described in this report, has been the increasing acknowledgement of the importance of HIV-sensitive social protection among governments, communities and other stakeholders, and their commitment towards integrating it both within AIDS responses and national social protection strategies. Some countries are ahead of the curve, while some are just beginning to start up, indicating considerable scope for South- South cooperation. I would like to thank my colleagues G. Pramod Kumar, Kazuyuki Uji (UNDP APRC) and Brian Lutz (UNDP New York); Steve Kraus (UNAIDS RST); Robin Jackson (UNAIDS, Geneva); Ketan Chitnis (UNICEF Regional Team); Richard Howard (ILO Regional Team); Lee Nah Hsu (ILO, Geneva); Douglas Broderick (UN RC Cambodia), Elena Tischenko, Sophie Barnes, Rany Pen and Flavia Di Marco (UNDP, Cambodia); Kirenjith Kaur (APN+, Bangkok) and the Government of Cambodia for their support in organising the consultation. I would also like to thank the Governments of Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Vietnam, Thailand and Papua New Guinea for their high level participation. I hope this report will be a useful resource for HIV-sensitive social protection for impact mitigation not only in Asia and the Pacific, but also in other parts of the world.

In the UNAIDS Outcome Framework, social protection for people impacted by HIV is a key priority and a cross-cutting strategy. Recent studies by UNDP in various countries of the region show that the impact of the epidemic on affected households is very severe and often pushes them to irreversible coping mechanisms and poverty although the macro-economic impact is not significant. The burden of HIV at the affected household and per capita levels is significant compared to the non-HIV households across a wide spectrum of indicators ranging from loss of income to education of children. For example, the medical expenditure of HIV-households is considerably higher than that of non-HIV households and the quality of food consumed, despite comparable levels of expenditure, is poorer. HIV reduces households\u2019 ability to borrow and they liquidate assets more frequently than the non-HIV households. HIV also has a serious impact on food security as indicated by the reduced farm activity, reduced area under cultivation as well as non-diversity of crops. It leads to school drop-outs, which is higher among girls, and considerable household burden on women. Discrimination is rampant and has a wide-ranging impact including on loss of income. Despite the acute socio-economic vulnerabilities, the attention to strategically integrate HIV into appropriate social protection schemes (HIV-sensitive social protection) is very limited in the region. The recent financial crisis and the food and fuel price inflation add a more complex dimension to the situation. Already burdened by the severe socio-economic impact of HIV/AIDS, people living with HIV are among the most vulnerable to external shocks. In addition, the possibility of rollback of resources by donors in the wake of the crisis worsens the situation as the AIDS programmes in many countries in the region are largely dependent on donor funds. A World Bank/UNAIDS study2 concludes that a majority of countries will be forced to cut their HIV programmes as they are dependent on external sources of support that will be reduced because of the crisis.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "017c2569-b9dd-4c41-a66d-18d52ce63b18": {"__data__": {"id_": "017c2569-b9dd-4c41-a66d-18d52ce63b18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Sensitive Social Protection for Impact Mitigation in Asia and the Pacific - Report on the High-level Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c537ecfafd0ba3be64680970edca8689ce40ef904816390a996b499ce51fd5e8"}, "2": {"node_id": "7524c9ef-d211-4d82-808d-8f5bff195fca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b563a21a7b78b97a095c22acb2fcc8ba29a904322b0f05fab0662a7d626ad5f"}}, "hash": "7cec4c7df1f0d6e475010e72eb6364a2b00abafcecf9f37674015691d47367e1", "text": "Available examples show that social protection has significant AIDS mitigation impact.

It brought together more than 60 HIV and social protection specialists from Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Thailand and Viet Nam, including representatives from UNDP, UNICEF, UNAIDS, ILO, WB and WFP. Each national government was represented by senior officials from the HIV/AIDS establishment (e.g. NAC, NACO) as well as the appropriate line ministry/department that is responsible for social protection. Through technical papers/presentations and group and plenary discussions, the consultation reviewed the social protection situation in the region and elsewhere, with a specific focus on HIV and impact mitigation. It examined in detail the existing good practices of HIV-sensitive social protection; the most strategic sectors that may be involved; and analysed the strengths/ weaknesses of the most successful social protection schemes and their adaptability in the context of HIV-related impact in relevant settings. The opening remarks of H.E. Ngy Chanpal, Secretary of State, Ministry of Interior and Vice Chairman, Council for Agriculture and Rural Development (CARD), Government of Cambodia, set the tone for the consultation, when he said \u201csocial protection is an investment to a country\u2019s development\u201d. It turned out to be the most repeated quote at the meeting. Mr. Douglas Broderick, UN Resident Coordinator & UNDP Resident Representative, Cambodia, highlighted the wide-ranging impact of HIV on people and their households and the importance of social protection in addressing it. While some countries were ahead of the others (e.g. India) in HIV-sensitive social protection, all the governmen-participants agreed to the need for such efforts so that HIV-affected households are not pushed into irreversible coping mechanisms. Concerns, however, were raised about sustainability, particularly in view of the financial constraints and competing priorities, and making it accessible to vulnerable and marginalised populations. National plans accord increasing priority for social protection and there is considerable scope for integrating HIV into them.

In all countries, key populations include people living with HIV. In most settings, men who have sex with men, transgender persons, people who inject drugs, sex workers and their clients, and seronegative partners in serodiscordant couples who are at higher risk of exposure to HIV than other people. Each country should define the specific populations that are key to their epidemic and response based on the epidemiological and social context: UNAIDS Terminology Guidelines (January 2011) 2 The global economic crisis and HIV prevention and treatment programmes: vulnerabilities and impact, World Bank and UNAIDS, 2009 3 UNICEF, ESARO, 2007 as quoted in \u201cSocial protection in the context of HIV and AIDS\u201d; Ann Nolan, Irish Aid, Promoting Pro-Poor Growth; Social Protection, OECD, 2009 4 Ag\u0171ero et al., 2007 as quoted in quoted in \u201cSocial protection in the context of HIV and AIDS\u201d; Ann Nolan, Irish Aid, Promoting Pro-Poor Growth; Social Protection, OECD, 2009 5 Social protection in the context of the HIV epidemic, State of the Evidence and implications for further action, Dr. Rachel Yetes, UNICEF, 2010 Page 3 policy initiative on social protection \u2013 adopted by the UN in 2009 as one of nine key priorities to confront the global financial crisis, accelerate recovery, and help achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is significant in this regard.

The participants decided that instead of recommendations, the key principles will have more practical value in terms of policies and programmes. The key principles finalised were: 1. Aim for HIV-sensitive social protection rather than HIV-specific social protection6: For reasons of sustainability, coverage, involvement of multiple sectors and the opportunities for mainstreaming HIV into national and decentralised development plans. 2. Involve multiple sectors and partners: HIV-sensitive social protection requires the involvement of different ministries, the private sector, civil society and communities. Their involvement and partnership is required at every stage - from planning to implementation. This is also important for sustainability. 3. Engage affected individuals, networks and communities, especially key populations: Design of HIV-sensitive social protection programs should be inclusive and participatory so as to ensure that the interventions address the specific needs and concerns of the affected people. 4. Protect and enhance human rights: While implementing HIV-sensitive social protection schemes, special attention must be paid to ensure that the human rights of the participants are not violated but rather are enhanced. Issues of concern are mandatory testing, disclosure of beneficiary details, breach of confidentiality and involuntary confinement. 5. Take into account sustainability: As in the case of ART, HIV-sensitive social protection requires long-term political and financial commitment, and hence sustainability should be an integral part of the planning process. Based on the key areas of socio-economic impact that require urgent attention the participants, divided into country groups and formulated strategic steps for HIV-sensitive social protection in their respective countries which should guide all country stakeholders\u2019 work, including the respective UNAIDS cosponsors. The organisers agreed to produce a guidance note on HIV- sensitive social protection (UNAIDS); assessment tools (ILO), and a compendium of good practices (UNDP, UNAIDS). 6 HIV-sensitive social protection denotes integration of HIV into existing social protection policies and programs, while HIV-specific social protection refers to exclusive social protection initiatives targeted solely at people living with and affected by HIV and AIDS.

To reach its mission, the NAA has developed the National Strategic Plan for Comprehensive & Multisectoral Response to HIV/AIDS III (2011\u20132015; NSP III) in 2010, which is based on the current HIV situation and the need to address high-risk behaviours. The global financial and economic crisis has led to broad agreement and understanding that economic growth and social infrastructure are not going to eradicate poverty and protect vulnerable groups on their own: there is an urgent need to develop various measures of social protection. Alongside protecting the poor from shocks, social protection promotes human capital and sustainable growth and improves productivity. Reflecting this view, the Cambodian National Strategic Plan for Development (NSPD) was updated in 2009 and emphasized growth strategies and the relationship between growth and poverty reduction. A National Social Protection Strategy (NSPS) was adopted by the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) in March 2011 with the following objectives: \u2022\ufffd Address the basic needs of the poor and the vulnerable in situations of emergency and crisis. \u2022\ufffd Reduce the poverty and vulnerability of children and mothers and enhance their human development. Page 5 \u2022\ufffd Address seasonal unemployment and underemployment and provide livelihood opportunities for the poor and the vulnerable. \u2022\ufffd Promote affordable health care for the poor and the vulnerable. \u2022\ufffd Improve social protection for special vulnerable groups. The implementation of the NSPS will require scaling-up current interventions, designing institutional arrangements, including health equity funds and subsidy schemes administered by the Ministry of Health and community-based health insurance schemes; and introducing new programs to cover existing social protection gaps. The short- and medium-term priority articulated in the NSPS is to develop social safety nets targeted to the poor and vulnerable, with complementary services for special vulnerable groups, which include PLHIV and their families. The long-term priority is to achieve universal coverage, providing all Cambodians with a basic package of transfers and services \u2013 including social security mechanisms for the formal sector and social safety nets for the informal sector \u2013 commensurate with the economic development of the country. The achievement of this long-term vision requires: \u2022\ufffd A consolidated and comprehensive action plan and interministerial dialogue; \u2022\ufffd A focus on inclusive growth; \u2022\ufffd A mix of programs that cover poverty and hunger, and promote human capital; \u2022\ufffd Prioritising interventions that address major sources of vulnerability; \u2022\ufffd Scaling up and harmonising current interventions; \u2022\ufffd Harmonising processes, ensuring regular financing and reassessing program coverage to better address the concentration of poverty and vulnerability in particular areas; \u2022\ufffd Developing new programs to address social protection gaps for the poor and vulnerable. Cambodia faces many challenges in the area of social protection. Ngy Chanphal identified the following issues as key to increasing the effectiveness of social protection interventions, and reiterated the RGC\u2019s commitment to addressing these: \u2022\ufffd Improving coordination of social protection activities of implementing ministry departments and civil society organisations at all levels, developing appropriate structures and mechanisms; \u2022\ufffd Strengthening monitoring and evaluation, as well as information and knowledge management; \u2022\ufffd Building capacity for program design and implementation; \u2022\ufffd Ensuring effective targeting of interventions; \u2022\ufffd Ensuring re-alignment and harmonisation of social protection programs, also at decentralised levels, and coordinating with development partners to achieve policy cohesion. The Council for Agricultural and Rural Development is responsible for the overall coordination of the NSPS, and the implementation of sectoral social protection programs is the responsibility of respective ministries \u2013 thus the NAA is responsible for social protection programs specific to HIV. While HIV programs face many daunting challenges, there are also opportunities to work together, share experiences, learn from each other, and act responsively, including at this consultation. Hopefully, the future will see more such dialogues, and increased support to social protection, vested as it is in sustainable development and poverty reduction in the Asia-Pacific region, including Cambodia.

They are also affected by food insecurity, discrimination, social exclusion, psychological stress and related morbidity, and often irreversable impoverishment. The impact of HIV is even more severe on women, and often HIV has inter-generational consequences, such as on the education of girls and on liquidation of assets. There is consensus that concrete steps for impact mitigation are needed, in which HIV-sensitive social protection has a significant role. While countries in the Asia-Pacific region are undertaking social protection activities to support HIV affected households, the idea and the operative aspects of HIV-sensitive social protection are still in the initial stages. This calls for broadening the understanding of the concept and of the ways for its operationalisation and implementation, political commitment, appropriate policies and programs, and technical capacity. This consultation presents an opportunity for discussion and learning from the Page 6 considerable knowledge and experience that exists in the countries of the region. The Joint UN team is committed to playing a facilitative role to ensure that optimal social protection is possible and is available for people and households affected by HIV. Ketan Chitnis, Regional HIV Specialist; UNICEF Asia-Pacific Shared Services Centre There is growing recognition and importance attached to social protection as a strategy to address food insecurity, chronic poverty, and the impacts of HIV and AIDS. As part of its global mandate, UNICEF is working towards ensuring that social protection measures are HIV-sensitive, especially in countries where the epidemic is in low and concentrated levels, and that they address the needs of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children. There is a need for social protection that addresses the unique needs of the children of key affected populations (KAPs), and that targets affected households to ensure that they do not fall further into poverty, compromising the future of the children living in these households. Due to their parents\u2019 drug use and sex work, which is often illegal and hidden, identifying children of KAPs is difficult. This increases the vulnerability of these children and potentially contributes to their further marginalisation. Linking social protection with the achievement of Universal Access (UA) outcomes related to prevention, care, support and treatment is critical. There are several ongoing large-scale national social protection programs in the region providing social protection instruments including social assistance, insurance, and social services. The task ahead is to make national programs and policies HIV-sensitive. Evidence supports the view that this will have a lasting effect on achieving the UA outcomes. Further evidence that will make HIV-sensitive social protection attractive is the demonstration of the cost-effectiveness of strengthening ongoing programs, and determining how to develop opportunistic linkages between health, social welfare and social protection sectors. This joint consultation is an important milestone in setting the agenda forward. Considerable strides have been made following the 2006 \u201cHanoi Call to Action\u201d for children and HIV/AIDS, where governments agreed to develop protection, care and support programs and policies as part of the national strategic plans for HIV and AIDS. Several of these plans take into account the most marginalised or vulnerable children so they are not necessarily HIV-exclusive. Needs assessments of affected children conducted over the past 5 years have identified some unique needs and demands that children living with HIV and impacted households face. A regional evidence-informed HIV-sensitive social protection framework that looks to newer, wider definitions of social protection and incorporates a transformative element, would help alleviate the impact of HIV and AIDS in the region and help guide national policies and programs responsive to the needs of families and children impacted by the epidemic. sessIon 1: deFInIng socIAl ProtectIon objective: to provide a conceptual framework for social protection Introducing a general social protection framework and the Social Protection Floor Initiative Celine Felix, consultant for social protection; ILO Decent Work Team, Bangkok Social protection is a key priority in international development, and takes various forms in different national settings.

Page 7 evidence demonstrates that social protection is an important social and economic stabiliser; it is an anti-crisis tool that facilitates recovery; and establishing a basic set of social protection for all is both affordable and feasible. The Social Protection Floor (SPF) \u2013 a global social policy initiative on social protection \u2013 was adopted by the UN in 2009 as one of 9 key priorities to confront the global financial crisis, accelerate recovery, and help achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is led by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the World Health Organisation (WHO), and is organised through national, regional and global task forces, with national SPF taskforces (consisting of national stakeholders from relevant ministries, social partners, NGOs, and UN agencies) supporting the development of in-country SPF work. The SPF works on both the supply and demand sides of social protection. Its aim is to ensure both the availability of essential services such as housing, education, and health care; and creation of demand for them through basic social transfers in cash or in kind. It emphasizes the need to guarantee: 1. All residents have access to essential health care. 2. All children enjoy income security through transfers in cash or in kind, such as school feeding, cash transfers, and access education and care. 3. All those in active age groups who cannot earn sufficient income enjoy a minimum income security through transfers in cash or in kind, and/or employment guarantee schemes. 4. All residents in old age and with disabilities have income security through pensions or transfers in kind. Key characteristics of the SPF include: a rights-based approach; the promotion of nationally defined strategies that protect a minimum level of access to essential services and income security for all across the life cycle, with attention to vulnerable groups; the promotion of policy coherence, involving multi-stakeholder involvement to tackle the multi-dimensional aspects of poverty and vulnerability; universal entitlement to protection through a basic package for all in need; and conceptual flexibility and adaptability reflecting its focus on outcomes. SPF is a first step in the process of improving social security: \u201cit is a floor, not a ceiling.\u201d The social protection landscape in Asia-Pacific: What has been done, what have we learned, and where are we headed? A major challenge facing social protection is the coverage gap of current schemes: only about 20 percent of the world\u2019s working-age population and their families have effective access to comprehensive social protection schemes. Public spending on social protection, particularly in developing countries, is low. In Asia and the Pacific, public expenditure on heath care and social security is 5.3 percent of GDP. However, many Asian countries have developed elements of the SPF. Examples include CARD\u2019s Social Protection Strategy, and Health Equity Funds (Cambodia); the Minimum Living Standard Guarantee Program, the New Rural Corporative Medical Care, Health Insurance for Urban Uninsured Residents, and rural old-age pension (China); the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojna health insurance scheme and the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (India); the Social Security Law (Indonesia); the Universal Healthcare Coverage Scheme (Thailand); and the 10 year Social Protection Strategy (Viet Nam).

The financial and economic crisis provoked recognition and increasing political commitment to implementing social protection measures. There is also growing acknowledgement of the need to extend the coverage of social protection schemes to the informal economy. The costs of financing social protection, and the need for related evidence: Significant financial challenges exist in providing (unconditional) health services and education for all. There is emerging evidence that the universal healthcare coverage scheme introduced in 2001 in Thailand may not be completely sustainable. The scheme, which has relied on patients paying a set fee for healthcare services, has led to healthcare sites having to lay off personnel and reduce the number of services to patients, compromising healthcare standards. It is important to plan how to finance social protection and to generate data on the costs of social protection schemes to ensure they are sustainable, and to advocate on their behalf. There may be an initial need to seek funding from donors, but national budget is central to long-term, sustainable programming. Coordination is the key: National dialogue to identify priorities is the key to developing effective, coordinated and coherent social protection strategies. This requires multi-stakeholder engagement and working across sectors. It is important for also donors to align their programs with national priorities and strategies. The role of leadership: Members of Parliaments need to be involved to push social protection forward, and provincial heads play an important role in community-led social protection. A good example is the High-Level SPF Advisory Group chaired by the former president of Chile, Her Excellency Michelle Bachelet. The role of donors: Donors play a key role in empowering the community, advancing the social protection agenda, and channeling support. SPF and vulnerable populations: The SPF is ingrained in rights-based language, which suggests the need in Asia and the Pacific to develop HIV-sensitive social protection measures that focus on marginalised groups such as MSM, people who use drugs, or sell sex. Addressing the needs of mobile populations: Migrant workers are one of the most affected populations and often face particular barriers to accessing essential healthcare and other services. They may have to pay more for health services, or are not entitled to accessing health services due to lack of health insurance, for instance. There is a need to ensure finances for migrants to access health care and other services. Transformational aspect of social protection: Newer interpretations of social protection present it as a means to transform existing inequalities and power relations. This fits in well with the objective of reducing stigma and discrimination related to HIV. sessIon 2: socIAl ProtectIon And hIv objective: to understand why social protection matters for hIv, especially impact mitigation in the region, and how to plan hIv-sensitive social protection UNAIDS business case for social protection and HIV-sensitive social protection Robin Jackman; UNAIDS, Geneva The UNAIDS business case on enhancing social protection8 was developed in 2010, and it aims to respond to the following questions: \u2022\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdWhy\ufffdis\ufffdsocial\ufffdprotection\ufffdimportant\ufffdfor\ufffdthe\ufffdAIDS\ufffdresponse?\ufffd \u2022\ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffdWhat\ufffd should\ufffd we\ufffd build\ufffd on\ufffd and\ufffd what\ufffd needs\ufffd to\ufffd be\ufffd done\ufffd differently\ufffd to\ufffd ensure\ufffd social\ufffd prtection\ufffd is\ufffd HIV- sensitive? \u2022\ufffd How to ensure accountability and measure progress?

Systems and community strengthening underpins all three pillars. While social protection is for everyone, the aim of applying an HIV lense is to have the biggest impact on the epidemic. The goal, articulated in UNAIDS\u2019 new strategy (2011\u20132015), is that \u201cPLHIV and households affected by HIV are addressed in all national social protection strategies and have access to essential care and support.\u201d Priority actions for Asia and the Pacific identified by the Joint UN Teams on HIV/AIDS (JUTH) include: \u2022\ufffd Ensure legal rights, right to health, education and livelihoods. \u2022\ufffd Ensure social protection measures in high burden countries are informed by data on national impact. \u2022\ufffd Barriers to social protection assessed and addressed; care and support is integrated into GFATM proposals. \u2022\ufffd AIDS coverage in social insurance schemes for formal sector workers is advocated. Key challenges include: \u2022\ufffd Building broader, country-wide linkages, moving away from isolated projects and transfers towards livelihood protection and strengthening. \u2022\ufffd Improving the evidence base, which is patchy and has limited coverage (most evidence is from high burden countries and Sub-Saharan Africa). \u2022\ufffd Ensuring inclusion of PLHIV (particularly PLHIV representing marginalised groups) in planning, designing and implementing social protection. Evidence of the positive impact of social protection for people living with and affected by HIV and AIDS includes: \u2022\ufffd Good evidence on positive impact of social transfers on care and support, including for OVC (mitigating the socio- economic impact of HIV/AIDS). \u2022\ufffd Strong evidence on cash transfers (conditional and non-conditional), particularly for OVC (improving nutrition, health, and possibly health-seeking behavior). \u2022\ufffd Emerging evidence on the contribution of social protection to HIV prevention, treatment uptake and adherence (e.g. vouchers for transport to clinics; food and nutritional support; livelihood support; transfers for girls\u2019 schooling; HIV-sensitive microcredit, e.g. the IMAGE study). \u2022\ufffd Good evidence on importance of free services at point of access for the poorest. \u2022\ufffd Importance of looking at interventions as a \u2018graduated continuum\u2019 from social transfers to livelihoods packages (public works programs, income generation, micro-credit etc); moving from consumption- enhancing to productivity-enhancing interventions. Social protection has a transformational aspect that is particularly relevant to HIV. It contributes to empowering people and guaranteeing human rights, which is relevant to key populations at higher risk of HIV exposure; and it addresses the social and economic vulnerabilities of marginalised populations. An example is the Sonagachi project from India in which sex workers are involved in the design and implementation of activities. The following gaps have been noted in existing evidence on social protection and HIV/AIDS: \u2022\ufffd How far social protection is covering vulnerable AIDS affected households; \u2022\ufffd Qualitative and quantitative studies to better understand barriers to access to all kinds of services; \u2022\ufffd What is the optimal combination of transfers in different epidemic contexts (food, cash, vouchers, agricultural inputs) for HIV impacts; \u2022\ufffd The identification of lessons learned from TB and other chronic diseases on access and adherence; \u2022\ufffd Participatory studies involving PLHIV.

While there is lack of data detailing the burden HIV/AIDS places on children, consequences of HIV/AIDS on children in the region include lower household income; the economic decline of households; loss of either one or both parents (56% of AIDS affected children); reduced access to education; and poor school performance, especially among orphans. Children with parents who inject drugs, and sell or buy sex are most affected by the HIV epidemic. Positive trends regarding social protection for children affected by HIV/AIDS in the region include the development of national strategic plans for HIV/AIDS that include specific components connected to affected children; the move towards addressing the needs of all vulnerable and marginalised children as part of the national response; and the ways in which responding to the needs of affected children has prompted strengthening social protection and social welfare systems. Capacity, insufficient resources, and the lack of size estimations of affected children present challenges to social protection for OVC. The socio-economic outlook and vulnerability in the region can be summarised as follows: \u2022\ufffd The economic outlook is improving, yet there are a lot of equity issues \u2022\ufffd Employment in the formal labour market remains predominantly agricultural, exposing households to climate shocks and the risk of seasonal unemployment \u2022\ufffd The informal labour market plays a substantial role in sustaining the economies, exposing millions to income instability \u2022\ufffd Structural causes of poverty and exclusion shape susceptibility to risk because of limited access to assets, and social exclusion \u2022\ufffd In the context of HIV, strong economic growth has not reduced vulnerability Poverty, while interconnected to the epidemic, is not the sole driver of the HIV epidemic in the region. Drug use and selling sex drive the epidemic in Asia, and underscore the need to address harmful legal environments and weak human rights contexts to prevent new infections. Income inequality is associated with HIV prevalence in the region, with the exception of countries such as China and Nepal, which have relatively high income inequality, but low HIV prevalence rates. Findings from the regional mapping of child and HIV-sensitive social protection: The regional mapping of child and HIV-sensitive social protection \u2013 analysing secondary data and documented evidence on policies and national programs designed to meet the needs of children \u2013 was conducted in 9 countries9 in the Asia and Pacific in 2010/2011 to provide a snapshot of available social protection10 for children, particularly those affected by HIV/AIDS. The methodology included developing a scoring key to establish the level (limited to extensive) of how child-sensitive and HIV- sensitive existing social protection/welfare programs were. Key findings from the regional mapping include: \u2022\ufffd Social assistance: Substantial to extensive progress has been made in most countries in this area. Social assistance is most extensive in areas with robust civil society networks. \u2022\ufffd Social insurance: Social insurance exists particularly in the formal work force sector, and some programs focused on maternal support and access to healthcare exist in the informal sector. Few social insurance schemes are HIV-sensitive, and social insurance is not reaching affected children. \u2022\ufffd Social services: Progress has been made in making ARV widely available, and in ensuring poor households and vulnerable children have access to e.g. healthcare and education. Employment support is weak across the region, and employment schemes are often unsuitable for the chronically ill, and do not take account of the limitations faced by people living with HIV. The psycho-social needs of children affected by HIV are not being consistently addressed. 9 Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, and Viet Nam 10 Social protection was defined in the mapping exercise \u201cas a set of transfers and services to reduce economic and social vulnerability, protect against livelihood risks, and ensure a minimum standard of dignity for excluded and marginalized people.\u201d Page 11 \u2022\ufffd Policies and legislation: The legal environment is relatively advanced in the region. There is a need to strengthen the legal environment related to high risk behaviours, however. \u2022\ufffd National expenditure.

This needs to be informed by evidence on how social protection instruments can mitigate the impact of HIV, and benefit the most vulnerable and at risk children and families. The role of civil society organisations (CSOs) is critical to reaching most affected children, as is the role of governments at national and sub-national levels. Plenary discussion Social insurance, formal and informal work: Some form of social insurance, such as health insurance, is largely available for people in the formal workforce in the region. A particular challenge is that of how to make sure policies and programs address the needs of people in the informal workforce, and marginalised populations such as the poor. Social assistance is a targeted intervention: Social assistance is a targeted form of intervention. Existing packages include cash transfers, food vouchers, and nutritional support, for example. These packages are decided on the basis of certain criteria. Most existing packages target vulnerable and poor households, and are not HIV-specific. HIV-sensitive versus HIV-exclusive programs : While HIV-exclusive pilot programs for children exist, the future direction is to integrate these programs within broader social protection programs that address all vulnerable and marginalised children, (e.g. the Child Friendly Local Governance-program in Nepal). Socio-economic impact of HIV on households in Asia and the Pacific Pramod Kumar, Senior Program Advisor; HIV, Health & Development, UNDP APRC It is widely acknowledged that HIV severely impacts the economic and social spheres of all societies. Over the past several years, governments in the Asia-Pacific region have made important advances in the introduction of new policies and programmes aimed at mitigating the socio-economic impact of HIV on individuals living with HIV and their households. Despite these advances, there have only been limited attempts to measure the specific impact of HIV at the household level and use this information for evidence-based policy interventions. To address this vital gap, UNDP undertook nationwide socio-economic impact studies in Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia and Viet Nam between 2005 and 2010. This regional analysis is based on the data and findings from the country level studies and is meant to support the development of targeted, evidence-informed impact mitigation policies and programs, including HIV-sensitive social protection. Methodology and data The studies involved surveys of HIV-affected households (HIV-HHs) and non-affected households (NA-HHs) and examined critical socio-economic issues: income, employment, revenues, expenditures, coping mechanisms, health, education, food security, family composition, impact on women and girls, and stigma and discrimination. While the survey instruments used in the various studies were adapted to meet the specific needs and circumstances of each country, they followed a broad common methodology developed by UNDP that allowed for inter-country comparisons. The surveys were conducted over a period of six years, starting with India in 2004 and ending with Cambodia in 2010. In total, over 17,000 households were included in the surveys, compiling data on over 72,000 household members. Limitations (i) The national studies occurred in different time periods (ii) Non-probability sampling in Viet Nam, India, Indonesia, and China does not allow for statistical inferences on population parameters or other estimates. (iii) Primary databases from China and India were not accessible for confidentiality reasons, limiting the possibility to include dimensions of analysis that were possible in the other three countries. (iv) Because of the local adaptation of the methodology and questionnaire, there are some limitations on the availability of comparable indicators across all countries. Key findings Living conditions, income and employment Overall, members of HIV-HHs lived in lower living conditions, were more likely to be unemployed, and had lower household incomes than members of NA-HHs. At the most basic level, respondents from NA-HHs in Cambodia, China, India and Viet Nam Page 12 were more likely to live in stable structures than those in HIV-HHs. With regards to employment, male members of HIV-HHs in Cambodia, China and Indonesia had lower employment levels than those in NA-HHs, and PLHIV in Cambodia and Indonesia had were almost twice as likely to be unemployed as NA-HH members. Specifically for PLHIV, their employment levels in Cambodia, China, India and Viet Nam dropped substantially after their diagnosis.

Additionally, in China, India and Indonesia, a greater percentage of HIV-HHs were below the poverty line than NA-HHs. Coping mechanisms: asset liquidation, migration, debt, consumption, and loss of savings In addition to the effects of reduced employment and income, HIV affects individuals through the continual need to outlay high medical expenses, often resulting in the need for coping mechanisms such as asset liquidation or assumption of debt. In all countries, HIV-HHs were less likely to own their house than NA-HHs and were less likely to own most assets included in the surveys. This finding points to a reduction in asset accumulation that has deleterious effects on the economic stability of the HIV-affected households. Additionally, HIV-HHs and PLHIV in Cambodia and Viet Nam more likely to have migrated than NA-HHs, and there were high levels of HIV-HH migration in Indonesia. The reasons for migration varied, but discrimination and seeking medical care were important issues in many countries. Many HIV-HHS reported a loss of savings due to HIV, with Indonesia losing as high as three-fourth of their savings. In addition, HIV-HHs in Cambodia, India, and Viet Nam were more likely to be in debt than NA-HHs, likely due to the need to supplement their lost incomes or the high costs of medical care. In China, HIV-HHs found it difficult to borrow compared to the NA-HHs and liquidated assets twice as much as NA-HHs to cope with the rising economic burden on the households. Liquidation of assets was also widely prevalent among the HIV-HHs in Indonesia. Indeed, HIV-HHs in India, Indonesia and Viet Nam spent three to four times as much on health care as NA-HHs, although it should be noted that in Cambodia, with its universal ART coverage policy, HIV-HHs spent less on health care than NA-HHs. Impact on education The studies showed that HIV has a destructive toll on the human capital accumulation of HIV-HHs through reduced educational opportunities and outcomes. Children in HIV-HHs in China, India, Indonesia and Viet Nam were less likely to attend school than those in NA-HHs, and the most vulnerable, poor children living in HIV-HHs in China and India were much less likely to attend school than those in NA-HHs (71% in the poorest Chinese HIV-HHs compared to 100% in the wealthiest NA-HHs). Additionally, the negative impact of HIV on female household members, as discussed earlier, is much higher than that of males. Girls in HIV-HHs in China, India and Indonesia were substantially less likely to attend school than those in NA-HHs or boys in any household. In China, the difference ranged from 86% attendance for girls in HIV-HHs to 99% for boys in NA-HHs. In addition, children in HIV-HHs in China, India and Indonesia more likely to have dropped out of school, and again, girls were more likely than boys to have dropped out. However, HIV-HHs in Cambodia, Indonesia and Viet Nam more likely to have received education assistance than NA-HHs, pointing to the positive steps that government policies have taken to mitigate the effects of HIV on households. In contrast, children in HIV-HHs faced significant stigma and discrimination, a possible contributor to the negative education results observed, and one that cannot be overcome by financial assistance alone. Impact on health The increased demand for healthcare that results from a diagnosis of HIV has a dual effect. First, the absence from the workplace has an important effect on the household\u2019s productivity. Secondly, the increased cost of medical care which the households are faced with forces them to adjust consumption and savings levels, further exacerbating the impact on income and living conditions. Access to ART clearly mitigates the high health care utilization traditionally associated with HIV, and, can even lead to decreasing levels of expenditure thus constituting a basic pillar of any financial protection strategy targeted to PLHIV. In all countries, members of households were likely to have not sought care when they reported being sick, but PLHIV in China and Indonesia were more likely to have not sought care than NA-HH members when sick due to financial reasons.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d03c0b22-98b4-4ebc-bd5e-f337fcf65eab": {"__data__": {"id_": "d03c0b22-98b4-4ebc-bd5e-f337fcf65eab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Sensitive Social Protection for Impact Mitigation in Asia and the Pacific - Report on the High-level Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a07db5c5f132ff1f49b29e56cb0d8e5655f172192adca8db7b52ec3098e4b3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "77384f21-5418-4f99-92bd-1e1e0e8def39", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca67dd1c0c354a7b4cc806feb9de5ac4fb6076162535c530cfe7077eb01d2cde"}}, "hash": "2e946a8462995b0c8589675ac69adabe919b75755d98451762cae130596c60d8", "text": "With regards to spending patterns, HIV-HHs in China, India, Indonesia and Viet Nam allocated substantially more of household consumption to health care than NA-HHs.

The percentage of health expenditures allocated to HIV-related costs varied by country (data was available for China, Indonesia, and Viet Nam) and ranged from 26% in Viet Nam to 59% in Indonesia. Page 13 Food security In light of increasing world-wide food prices, the relationship between HIV and food expenditures has gained increasing importance. The results from these studies show that HIV has substantially affected food expenditures in Viet Nam and the poorest households in India. Members of HIV-HHs in Cambodia and Viet Nam were more likely to have experienced hunger than members of NA-HHs. Additionally, in all countries, there were differences in how food budgets were spent, as HIV-HHs spent less on protein-rich foods than NA-HHs, indicating that even when quantities were considered sufficient, adequate malnutrition was potentially still an issue. Finally, food support for HIV-HHs varied across the region, but HIV-HHs in Cambodia and Viet Nam were more likely to have received food support than NA-HHs, again indicating well-targeted government policies. Stigma and discrimination The studies reported high levels of internal stigma (shame, low self-esteem, and suicidal thoughts) by PLHIV. In addition, regional differences were seen in PLHIV who immediately reported their status to their spouse; however, in all countries males were less likely to have done so than female PLHIV. There were also differences in spousal reactions to the disclosure, but all countries showed improved support over time. NA-HHs in India and China reported very high levels of bias against PLHIV and their families. In conjunction, PLHIV reported very high levels of stigma and discrimination. Over 50% of PLHIV in China and India reported social isolation and neglect - an average of 20% of PLHIV in all the countries reported being verbally abused because of their status. Perhaps most concerning was the high level of discrimination in health facilities in Indonesia (30%), Viet Nam (17%) and China (13%). This reduces the likelihood of PLHIV disclosing their status and receiving the care they need, as evidenced by the high percentage (over 40%) of pregnant HIV-positive women in Indonesia who had not disclosed their status to their health care provider. Family structures, impact on women and girls and Intimate Partner Transmission In the three analysed countries, Cambodia, China and Indonesia, HIV-HHs were less likely to have a nuclear family structure than NA-HHs, which may reflect the high percentage of widowers in the survey population and indicates the impact on the economic earning potential of the households. Pregnant HIV-positive women are a particularly vulnerable group. While the surveys in Cambodia and Indonesia were being conducted the World Health Organisation changed its recommendations for HIV positive women and their newborns, so the low levels of ART utilisation and breastfeeding reported can serve as baseline data against which to measure future improvements. Another particularly vulnerable group, widows, were analysed with regards to their property inheritance rights. In Cambodia, it was found that widows in HIV-HHs were less likely to have inherited their deceased husband\u2019s property or assets than widows in NA-HHs. In Indonesia and Viet Nam high levels of loss of inheritance rights were reported (71% in Indonesia and 62% in Viet Nam). Social safety nets Insurance and pensions offer HIV-affected households potentially important mechanisms to mitigate the effects of loss of income through elevated morbidity and mortality. However, in most countries, HIV-HHs were less likely to have access to such protective measures, and other than in China, coverage levels were all below 15%. However, in Cambodia, China and Viet Nam, HIV-HHs were more likely to have received financial support from government programs or NGOs than NA-HHs. In addition, the poorest HIV-HHs were the most likely to have received such support, again indicating good targeting by support providers. The data in Cambodia, China and Viet Nam also allowed for analysis of the financial support as a percentage of total household income. In Cambodia and Viet Nam the support had a moderate impact (8% of total income), but support was critical in China, accounting for 18% of household income.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2103959-c415-4224-b71d-30157520b25a": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2103959-c415-4224-b71d-30157520b25a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Sensitive Social Protection for Impact Mitigation in Asia and the Pacific - Report on the High-level Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "61f431721f7fc8a77746dad2216b8a8b7911c574f9bb4b4a60a97eead5a58d31"}, "2": {"node_id": "c7f14433-fd05-42e8-8fe9-b7fee96c27c9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a0494b7aecd9f7e57a336b6c9de43b9fe10b7a92e7273354d4249ad94d3b2cf7"}}, "hash": "37944afc86340935b2d105351b3392630535fe759b2ace522b2fe6c26e7351f5", "text": "Conclusion and policy recommendations As the HIV epidemic matures, it has significant and lasting impact on the ability of households to cope with the loss of family members; the loss of income and assets; HIV-related morbidity and mortality; and the loss of educational opportunities, particularly for girls who are pulled out of school to care for sick and dying family members and social exclusion that prevents them from taking part in the socio-economic growth of the country.

Most importantly, they provide further empirical evidence of the effects of HIV on the household that can be used to better prioritize interventions in the region. While there is some attention to social protection programmes for PLHIV since these studies were completed, continued evolution of those programmes is required to support the people, households and communities that are hardest hit. Page 14 Plenary discussion The economic impact of HIV: As expected, the economic impact of HIV is severe, and has intergenerational consequences. While there has been recognition that PLHIV are getting into poverty for some time, the findings of the socioeconomic studies provide data on the severity of the impact and irreversible coping mechanisms, such as shockingly high asset liquidation rates. Partner notification: A significant finding is the low level of partner notification. Stigmatisation by health service providers: It is important to identify how to address the stigmatisation of PLHIV by healthcare professionals to increase demand for health services. Need for HIV-sensitive social protection schemes in health care: HIV places a severe or even \u201ccatastrophic\u201d burden on HHs, and due to the impact of HIV, PLHIV should be included within social protection schemes, such as cash transfers, food support, and other social transfers, including for the most vulnerable people. This is not the case in all the countries in the region. Inclusion of MARPs: Since the study was on the impact of HIV on households, the samples were people living with HIV and their households. MARPs was not a criterion for sampling; however, in Indonesia a large majority of the samples were people who inject drugs, and in Cambodia, the number of women respondents was considerably higher in number. Social protection from the perspectives of the PLHIV community Kirenjit Kaur, WAPN+ Coordinator; Asia Pacific Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS Speaking on behalf of the community of people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS in the Asia-Pacific region, Kirenjit Kaur emphasized that being HIV+ has far-reaching implications for the social well-being of HIV+ people. The dream of having social protection11 in any context or any surrounding is not realized for the majority of PLHIV in the Asia-Pacific region. For almost two-thirds of the HIV+ community, the reality appears as one where they do not have any rights to seek any kind of social protection \u201cwhether it\u2019s the right to proper and affordable access to treatment, employment, insurance, or other medical care and support.\u201d PLHIV are often not able to access similar benefits as other people in need of treatment, and many children are denied proper education if their status is known. Social, economic, and geographic contexts have been identified as impacting social protection available to PLHIV. One of the biggest issues that PLHIV face in social protection, she noted, is their lack of access to private insurance schemes. Having lived with HIV for 17 years, Kirenjit highlighted that she has not to date been able to purchase accident insurance, for example, not to speak of health insurance to cover hospital fees for when she has been sick. \u201cIt\u2019s like, if you are living with HIV, you are living a death sentence already,\u201d she said. PLHIV and their families \u2013 in remote, poor, rural areas who live from subsistence farming, but also some living in urban areas \u2013 Kirenjit Kaur claimed, are the most affected as there is no social protection for them when they lose their stable sources of income. There have been incidents of young people being denied education because of their status, she noted, sharing the story of a widow with HIV that she recently met whose son was denied access to school by the principal on the basis that \u201cif your son is in pain, or if he gets hurt, or other children get hurt while being with him, I cannot be answerable to their parents.\u201d Women and children are invariably impacted by HIV/AIDS and are the most vulnerable in family settings. Stigma towards PLHIV continues to be strong, and results in PLHIV not being able to live normal lives. Kirenjit Kaur shared the story of a woman living with HIV (WLHIV) who participated in a WAPN+ survey on the accessibility to WLHIV of maternal and child health care services in 6 countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b45162a-04da-4d4d-b59a-ac36f983d332": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b45162a-04da-4d4d-b59a-ac36f983d332", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Sensitive Social Protection for Impact Mitigation in Asia and the Pacific - Report on the High-level Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "897a98570a045aea392fb82ee6f1eec27ae70f082e6e76a7cff2344710a625bc"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2f1657d-97ac-46b6-96f8-a6ae47f5828b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "143d372ae1a84020eb83ddc648ff66609e1fa9a961c764a408bf4d73b8d4254e"}}, "hash": "a1ce3b4b7b996bb87fd05243bde3adb3aeafeda603973721a9342ce60a00b60e", "text": "The WLHIV, who lived with her in-laws, was locked into her room by her mother-in-law when she went into labour, and told to \u201cplease move away from the bed, come down to the floor, I", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fcb6906e-b8c4-4329-9182-067c2b9d358f": {"__data__": {"id_": "fcb6906e-b8c4-4329-9182-067c2b9d358f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Sensitive Social Protection for Impact Mitigation in Asia and the Pacific - Report on the High-level Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "44e6d3a64cfd8c0a44d7ddac85af5f24fa50b5486ad37f285fd939b0807545ce"}, "3": {"node_id": "3fb0e13f-2a4b-48e2-ae5a-66f50025e2ad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "017b872b93c79a35eaa26e95d46d9fb110eb5764d915c57bcf057e5243ecf268"}}, "hash": "9b0611c68fe4aa43dc701897230dbdb7287808c0b52c90c2e7433bf4cb248dd0", "text": "do not want your contaminated blood to stain the mattress.\u201d In coming down to the floor, she gave birth, and her baby hit the floor and died.

Social protection is also absent for key populations, she observed, asking \u201cwhere is the social protection for these populations? It is well known that PLHIV are living more healthy and productive lives and can contribute towards the economy of their countries. However, they do not have same benefits as other people, e.g. in the workplace. PLHIV are worried to access treatment as they are afraid their HIV status will become known: \u201cwho is going to take care of social protection and social security for them?\u201d Governments should be urged to ensure social protection, including social services and social benefits, are in place and that all people, with or without HIV, have the same benefits. Plenary discussion ILO and social protection: Social protection should be made universal to cover the entire population. All people have the right to work, and PLHIV should not be removed from jobs because of their HIV+ status, or discriminated against in seeking employment. ILO\u2019s a new international labour standard on HIV and AIDS was adopted in 2010, and can be used as a tool to hold 11 Kirenjit Kaur shared Shepherd\u2019s (2004) definition of social protection, as the \u201crange of processes, policies and interventions to enable people to reduce, mitigate, cope with and recover from risk in order that they become less insecure and can participate in economic growth.\u201d Page 15 governments, employers, and other workers accountable to protecting the rights, and give accommodations to, HIV+ workers. Private insurance: Private insurance schemes often exclude PLHIV because they want to avoid \u201cadverse selection\u201d, and PLHIV often are denied access to all insurance schemes. When PLHIV have private insurance, their HIV status has sometimes been used as pretence to not reimburse fees unrelated to HIV. Public insurance: Public insurance schemes are more inclusive, but need to be expanded to cover all people. Public insurance does not always cover PLHIV, and there are variations between the formal and informal sectors. Social health insurance for the poor in Indonesia: There is a new regulation (2010) in place that stipulates all marginalised people (including PLHIV) need to be protected. PLHIV should now be able to access healthcare, including treatment for OIs. Insurance schemes (India): There are many insurance schemes in India, e.g. a national health insurance scheme where the government pays premium for the poor, including PLHIV. There is discrimination in access to health care and health insurance, however. The argument was made that private insurance schemes should be made available to PLHIV to cover non-HIV related conditions. India has made some progress in this area, negotiating with major insurance companies to remove HIV exclusions. Involvement of PLHIV in decision-making: PLHIV networks may not always be aware of new regulations and policies, and collaboration between the government and PLHIV networks should be enhanced. The participation of PLHIV in decision- making still faces many challenges. \u201cSometimes they just want to see what we look like,\u201d Kirenjit Kaur observed. Need for change at the grassroots level: While policies and guidelines are largely in place, the reality on the ground is that PLHIV often face acute stigma and discrimination. There is a need for sensitization and awareness-raising at many levels in order to address e.g. the rights of WLHIV to have children. HIV-sensitive social protection to address stigma and discrimination of KAPs: General social protection may not address stigma and discrimination, and there is a need to look at these issues, keeping in mind KAPs, which in the Asia-Pacific region include PLHIV, people who use drugs, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and transgender people.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3fb0e13f-2a4b-48e2-ae5a-66f50025e2ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "3fb0e13f-2a4b-48e2-ae5a-66f50025e2ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Sensitive Social Protection for Impact Mitigation in Asia and the Pacific - Report on the High-level Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "44e6d3a64cfd8c0a44d7ddac85af5f24fa50b5486ad37f285fd939b0807545ce"}, "2": {"node_id": "fcb6906e-b8c4-4329-9182-067c2b9d358f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b0611c68fe4aa43dc701897230dbdb7287808c0b52c90c2e7433bf4cb248dd0"}}, "hash": "017b872b93c79a35eaa26e95d46d9fb110eb5764d915c57bcf057e5243ecf268", "text": "sessIon 3: lessons From AsIA And the PAcIFIc objective: to better understand the \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d of social protection for impact mitigation, with country examples country case study: cambodia HIV-sensitive social protection for impact mitigation Dr. Ros Seilavath, Deputy Secretary General; NAA Status of the HIV epidemic and response to HIV: HIV prevalence in Cambodia is estimated as decreasing to 0.6 percent in 2011, and was 1.1 percent in 2006 among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02205556-74ce-4476-bb1b-a7bf5bae01d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "02205556-74ce-4476-bb1b-a7bf5bae01d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Sensitive Social Protection for Impact Mitigation in Asia and the Pacific - Report on the High-level Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "333b3e4678ec4a0126079a9d549f5e95ceabd493f6b49365139f1193b4d4fdcf"}, "3": {"node_id": "30c3ca8b-8a0a-4139-be65-2b353e742056", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e9e23be5cdc91940f966f7c6585174af98bec33f79520db5489a73da78896c4"}}, "hash": "b9864df3961dc04e02346666b8a2f9a0962ffa92b2712994fbdab28f838d7eab", "text": "There are an estimated 53,100 PLHIV in Cambodia today, and prevalence is concentrated among entertainment workers (15.2 percent), MSM (8.7 percent in Phnom Penh), and people who inject drugs (24.4 percent). ARV coverage is high at almost 96 percent. If all interventions are maintained successfully, HIV incidence in 2012 will decrease to an estimated 460 women and men. HIV impact mitigation: In the initial stages of the epidemic, HIV had a dramatic impact on livelihoods and income, and increased numbers of school drop-outs among CLHIV. The impact of HIV has become less severe through the increase in financial support to the response, which rapidly expanded ARV treatment, for example. Social protection for PLHIV includes Home Based Care (HBC), a minimum package for OVC, interventions in the areas of housing and income generation, and workplace interventions. Most efforts to address the impact of HIV adress short term impacts of HIV; there has not been significant support to e.g. capacity building, vocational training, or the provision of micro-credit. Social protection and PLHIV: Cambodia has introduced various social protection measures such as a National Social Protection Strategy, a social safety net program, food security programs, and various related laws including the Labour Law. Cambodia\u2019s National Strategic Plan for a Comprehensive and Multisectoral Response to HIV and AIDS (2011\u20132015) addresses the need for social protection for PLHIV under its third goal, which is \u201cTo alleviate the socioeconomic and human impact of AIDS on the individual, family, community and society.\u201d The strategy for achieving this is to \u201cIncrease coverage, quality and effectiveness of interventions to mitigate the impact of HIV and AIDS.\u201d HIV Funding to social protection: In 2009, about USD 6 million of HIV/AIDS spending was chanelled to social protection and social services; in 2010 this amount was USD 8 million, which represents about 12 percent of HIV/AIDS expenditure. Page 16 KHANA economic livelihoods program Dr. Oum Sopheap, Executive Director; KHANA, Cambodia Background: KHANA\u2019s Economic Livelihoods Program, which is supported by USAID and EC, provides social protection in the form of support to sustainable livelihoods. Its key objectives are to improve livelihoods among vulnerable communities, people affected by HIV and most at risk populations (MARPs); and to alleviate the socio-economic and human impacts of AIDS on the individual, family and community. Target populations of the program include PLHIV, OVC, and MARPs, and most recently, other vulnerable populations as well. The focus has thus moved into the direction of being HIV-sensitive from an original HIV-specific focus. The program covers 19 out of Cambodia\u2019s 24 provinces. Model: The initial model adopted for the Economic Livelihoods Program from 2003 through to 2010 was that of providing small grants to individuals and HIV-HHs, supported by training, and follow-up. In 2010, this model was revised based on data generated through a household survey and an evaluation of KHANA\u2019s income generation activities. The new model (currently being pilot tested in 6 provinces) is that of Village Savings and Loan Schemes, which has moved from consumption enhancing- to livelihood enhancing support. Results: Between 2003 and 2010 about 3100 PLHIV and OVC were supported through 25 Implementing Partners. From 2010, 14 village savings and loan groups (311 PLHIV, OVC and MARPs) have been established. 121 beneficiaries have received skills training in micro-business, food processing, home gardening, and crop production. A new, evidence informed livelihoods model was developed in 2010. Challenges: PLHIV have sometimes used the livelihoods grants or savings to cover health or immediate needs. Building a strong understanding of the benefits of long term saving and investment takes time. Productivity, behaviour change, and building stronger linkages to local businesses need strengthening. Sustainability of livelihoods programs, and ensuring long- term, sustainable income for PLHIV present key challenges. Lessons learned: The beneficiaries often lack basic skills required for income generation and livelihoods, as well as self confidence in economic activities and hope for change. The motivation and interest of beneficiaries if key to successful interventions. In this project, there were 3 groups with different intervention combinations, which received (1) training and grant, (2) grant only, and (3) nothing.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30c3ca8b-8a0a-4139-be65-2b353e742056": {"__data__": {"id_": "30c3ca8b-8a0a-4139-be65-2b353e742056", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Sensitive Social Protection for Impact Mitigation in Asia and the Pacific - Report on the High-level Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "333b3e4678ec4a0126079a9d549f5e95ceabd493f6b49365139f1193b4d4fdcf"}, "2": {"node_id": "02205556-74ce-4476-bb1b-a7bf5bae01d4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9864df3961dc04e02346666b8a2f9a0962ffa92b2712994fbdab28f838d7eab"}}, "hash": "9e9e23be5cdc91940f966f7c6585174af98bec33f79520db5489a73da78896c4", "text": "The group that had received nothing seemed the most successful, probably due to the strong commitment of the group members.

The epidemic is unevenly spread, with 6 provinces accounting for an estimated 80 percent of HIV/AIDS cases. While the Chinese Government has achieved the goal it set 5 years ago, that by end of 2010 the total number of PLHIV would be less than 1,500,000, the number of annual reported HIV cases remains high, and China has an estimated 740,000 people living with HIV, of whom 105,000 were estimated to be AIDS cases. The response: The Chinese government has demonstrated high political commitment to the HIV response. This is demonstrated by the participation of the President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao in HIV/AIDS events, and the allocation of significant domestic funding to the response. Basic infrastructure has been significantly improved in recent years. Between 2006 and 2010, the number of surveillance sites increased from 729 to 1,880; the number of VCT sites increased from 3,000 to 9,475; the number of screening labs increased from 3,756 to 8,870; and the number of confirmatory labs increased from 57 to 318. Recent years have witnessed significant increases in the number of spouses testing for HIV and in PLHIV participating in CD4 tests and in follow-up healthcare services. Programs, including Methadone Maintenance Therapy (MMT), ART and PMTCT, have also been scaled up and have had a demonstrable impact. The introduction of MMT has had a significant positive impact on HIV incidence, heroin use, and on decreasing drug trade. ART, in turn, has significantly decreased mortality among patients, and the number of pregnant women accessing ART has increased from 12 women in 2002 to 1,305 women in 2010. Policy environment: The Chinese government launched a \u201cFour Frees, One Care\u201d policy targeting families affected by HIV/ AIDS in 2003. In 2009, the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs issued a policy concerning children affected by AIDS, including the provision of 95 USD per month for each AIDS orphan. The government\u2019s new AIDS policy is \u201c5 expansions, 6 Strengthening\u201d (the expansion component covers education, testing, Page 17 PMTCT, intervention, ART; the strengthening component covers blood safety, medical services, care and support, rights, leadership, and personnel). Social protection and HIV: The income level of HIV-HHs is lower than that of NA-HHs in China. Schooling rates of children from HIV-HHs are similar to the rates of children from NA-HHs. Relatedly, the \u201cFour Frees, One Care\u201d policy targets particularly low-income PLHIV and their families, as well as children affected by AIDS. Social protection for children affected by HIV/AIDS is provided both by the government, and by NGOs including the Chinese AIDS Foundation. Need to further strengthen the response: Significant progress has been made towards achieving Universal Access indicators since 2006 under China\u2019s \u201c4 frees and 1 care\u201d policy.

HIV prevalence is estimated as being 0.31% among the adult population, and there are about 2.25 million PLHIVs in India. The primary drivers of the epidemic are unprotected paid sex, unprotected anal sex between men, and people who inject drugs. HIV prevalence is high among High Risk Groups (HRGs), which include an estimated 1.26 million Female Sex Workers (FSWs) and their clients, 351,000 MSM, and 186,000 people who inject drugs. Key strategies of the Indian government in responding to HIV/AIDS have included program monitoring and the generation of an evidence base, coordination and multisectoral collaboration, and capacity development.

Officers from State AIDS Control Societies (SACS) are posted in different ministries to facilitate HIV mainstreaming in different areas, including social protection. Case Study 1: HIV inclusive scheme \u201cMadhu Babu Pension Yojana\u201d: This scheme was initiated in 2008, and involves the provision of a life-dlong monthly pension of Rs. 20012 per month to elderly, disabled, widows, including widows of PLHIV or any PLHIV, irrespective of age, marital status, sex, and economic status. To date, it has benefited 23,052 PLHIV. Inclusion of HIV-affected people was made possible by NGOs that facilitated the process of availing the scheme to PLHIV. Case Study 2: HIV specific scheme \u201cJatan project\u201d: This scheme targets PLHIV, reimbursing their travel expenses from their residence to ART centers through a Jalatan staff, who is a member of the state-level PLHIV network. Since its initiatiion in 2008, it has benefited 30,000 PLHIV. Case Study 3: Widow pension scheme, Rajasthan: Altogether 1,000 WLHIV have benefited from this scheme offering Rs. 500 per month to widows. This scheme was initiated in 2009 and was amended to better address the needs of HIV+ widows by lowering the minimum age criterion from 40 years to 18 for HIV widows. This scheme is a good example of integrating HIV into a general social protection (cash transfer) intervention. There is an incentive of Rs. 15,000 to encourage widows to remarry. Case Study 4: Tamil Nadu Legal Aid Clinic interventions: This initiative has enabled PLHIVs to access free legal services through Legal Aid Clinics (LACs), which are housed in district ART centres. LACs inform PLHIV of available social protection schemes and facilitate the submission of applications, which have made it possible to reach PLHIV within a short period. Facilitating factors: At (1) Macro level: political commitment and federal structures that allow innovations, cross-learning and progressiveness; (2) Meso level: sensitisation of key stakeholders and decision makers, strengthened linkages within the HIV service provision structures, and increased outreach and scope of legal assistance programs; and (3) Microl level: empowered positive networks and creating awareness and knowledge about social protection schemes. Challenges: Challenges to strengthening HIV-sensitive social protection include inter-state variations in benefits and outreach; low priority and funding by other sectors; cumbersome procedures; gender differentials (with a positive bias towards women); stigma and ensuring confidentiality; lack of awareness of HIV-exclusive and HIV-sensitive schemes; inadequate measuring of utilisation patterns; and monitoring and data sharing. 12 One Indian Rupee is about USD 0.02 (as of 16 May 2011). Page 18 Lessons learned: Prerequisites for effective social protection for PLHIV and HIV-HHs include political commitment, a social protection strategy, complementary public and private sector interventions, and forging referrals and linkages between community systems and the public sector. Future plans: Future plans include ensuring a basic minimum package of social protection (health & nutrition); advocacy and partnerships for a basic minimum plus package (eduation, livelihoods, housing etc.); and developing effective channels for social protection provision. country case study: Indonesia HIV-sensitive social protection for impact mitigation \u2013 the lessons learned in Indonesia Emil Agustiono, Deputy Minister to Coordinating Minister for Population Health and Environment; Ministry of People\u2019s Welfare & Makmur Sunusi, Directo General of Social Rehabilitation, Ministry of Social Affairs Status of the HIV epidemic: Indonesia has a growing HIV epidemic: while in 2009, there were about 298,000 PLHIV in the country, in 2014 this figure is projected to reach about 514,000.

Components identified for HIV-sensitive social protection and social welfare include: social outreach, development of family investment, family empowerment, research, social rehabilitation, social services for children, social assistance, and empowerment of social welfare institutions. Challenges: Current challenges include difficulties in identifying beneficiaries, lack of data (evidence), stigma and discrimination, and dependency on donor funding. Results to date: Interventions have taken place to address stigma and discrimination; improve the social welfare response to HIV; develop a model of social protection services and family development for PLHIV and their families; provide living support assistance and direct cash transfers to PLHIV for developing SMEs; to provide consultation to PLHIV and their families on life skills and training; and to refer PLHIV to social service programs, Lessons learned: Particularly given the growing number of PLHIV in Indonesia, there is a need to increase HIV-sensitive social protection programs. Strengthening prevention, care, treatment, and psychological as well as socioeconomic support to PLHIV is key to mitigating the impacts of HIV. There is a need for an integrated action plan; synergizing resources; and accelaration of programs, especially by national authorities. Page 19 country case study: nepal Surya Prasad Acharya, Joint Secretary; MOH & Population, Government of Nepal Status of the HIV epidemic: Nepal has a concentrated HIV epidemic, with an estimated 63,528 people living with HIV (2009). Of these, about 6% are children (0\u201314 years), and 29% are women (15\u201349 years). Notably, more than 75% do not know they have HIV. HIV prevalence is highest among people who inject drugs, FSWs, MSM, labour migrants and their spouses. Unprotected heterosexual sex is the main mode of transmission. Defining social protection: The terms \u201csocial safety net\u201d, \u201csocial security\u201d, and \u201csocial protection are often used interchangeably in Nepal. In the Social Protection Framework of Nepal, social protection is defined as \u201cthe set of policies and actions designed to reduce poverty, vulnerability, and risks as well as to enhance people\u2019s capacity to protect themselves against shocks or loss of income and employment.\u201d The response: Since 2004, ART and treatment for OI have been provided for free, although only a quarter of the people needing ART are currently receiving it. Nutrition support is provided for PLHIV (after ARV/Prophylaxis initiation). NGO-run community care centers provide shelter and food for poor and chronically ill PLHIV. Community HBC initiatives operate in highly affected locales. Also, USD 1.3 per month is provided to PLHIV by the village development committee. Policy provisions and action plans: Nepal is in its third National HIV/AIDS Strategy Plan (2006\u20132011). This plan has 6 pillars (prevention; treatment, care and support; advocacy, policy and legal reform; leadership and management; strategic information; finance and resource mobilisation). Nepal has a National Action Plan (2008\u20132011); and a National Advocacy Plan on HIV and AIDS(2008\u20132011). General social protection initiatives relevant to HIV include the new Labour Bill, and the Nepal Health Sector Program II. A National Social Protection Framework (2011\u20132020) has been recently developed, and needs to be operationalised. Figure 1.

The highest number of reported infections have been diagnosed in Port Moresby and other urban and peri-urban areas. In 2009, the number of adults (aged 15\u201349) estimated as living HIV was 35,800, and about 5,610 children have been orphaned as a result of the epidemic. HIV and vulnerability: People at highest risk to HIV exposure in PNG include SWs, MSM, and people who use drugs13. The epidemic impacts vulnerability through increasing poverty, loss of jobs/income, health expenditure, and the number of orphans; and limiting access to education, health services, and income generation schemes. The response: PLHIV have access to free ART, and free VCCT for Prevention of Parent-to-Child Transmission (PPTCT). Faith Based Organisations (FBOs) also play a significant role in the response. Social protection and HIV: There is a social protection strategy in place for OVC; and the government has developed an HIV/ AIDS Management & Prevention (HAMP) Act; a Lukautim Pikinini (\u201cchild protection\u201d) Act; and various policy documents. The Government has initiated a process to develop a social protection policy, which is currently focused on 3 categories of beneficiaries: children, disabled, and the elderly. A Social Protection Task Force is leading this process. Progress has been made towards achieving Universal Primary Education; civil servants have access to a pension scheme; and provincial social protection initiatives have been developed and include school subsidies, free health services for the elderly, and a \u201cOne kina14\u201dpolicy for the elderly and disabled. Faith based organisations provide community/home care support services. There are limited micro credit schemes for PLHIV. Challenges: There is a need to advocate to the government for a formal social protection system (including for financing), as the government has largely relied on traditional safety nets. Due to stigma and discrimination, MARPs often fall outside these safety nets. There is a need to develop the legal framework, which criminalises groups such as SWs and MSM. PNG has weak governance and transparency systems in the delivery of goods and services, and there is limited capacity to implement government policies and legal frameworks. The geographic terrain and limited transportation infrastructure in PNG makes it difficult for people to access services, and infrastructure is insufficient to manage complicated cash transfer systems. There is limite data available to support program and policy development. Way forward: More work is needed to strengthen existing social protection policies, and to revise programs (e.g. the traditional adoption and fostering system), and bring them to scale. HIV nees to be incorporated within policies, programs, and the legal framework. This will require analysis of the evidence base. Children and young people should be involved in policy and program planning and implementation. country case study: thailand Social protection programs for people impacted by HIV/AIDS: Vienping children home Sirirat Ayuwatana, Deputy permanent secretary, Ministry of Social development and Human Security, Thailand National social protection program: The Ministry of Social development and Human Security (MOSDHS) takes the lead in developing and managing the national social protection program in Thailand.

Children are referred to Vienping by hospitals, and the community (social workers, community leaders, families). Coverage and HIV-sensitive programs: Vienping covers 17 provinces, and leads a network of orphanages, group homes, and foster care families dedicated to caring for orphaned or abandoned children. It is linked with different government and non- government organisations and facilities that provide services to children living with or affected by HIV/AIDS. Programs and services for these children include: \u2022\ufffd Foster home care for children living with or affected by HIV/AIDS; \u2022\ufffd Services to group homes/private orphanages (funding assistance and management of legal guardianship of children); \u2022\ufffd Financial support to families with children living with or affected by HIV; \u2022\ufffd Caretaker program; \u2022\ufffd Adoption program. Financing: Funding to Vienping is mainly provided by the government, with additional resources from private individuals (local and international), and through partnerships with NGOs. About a third of Vienping\u2019s annual budget goes to its programs and services focused on children living with or affected by HIV/AIDS. Results: One of the areas of Vienping\u2019s work is that of promoting and protecting children\u2019s rights, and its work has made concrete contributions to ensuring children\u2019s rights to health, education, care, and social inclusion. Vienping\u2019s work has brought about an improved quality of life for the people and children living with HIV/AIDS, and their families, that it serves; and greater public social awareness of people living with HIV/AIDS, children and poor elderly people affected by HIV/AIDS. As an outcome of Vienping\u2019s work, the capacity of the network organisations has been strengthened. Lessons learned: Partnerships are essential to promoting and coordinating the operation of the social welfare service network for HIV/AIDS. Developing and standardising models and methods of providing social welfare services for HIV/AIDS ensure quality of services. Future plans: Areas of work that Vienping plans to develop include: Knowledge, information and training on HIV prevention for families and caretakers; Strengthening the capacity of organisations and children\u2019s homes in the areas of welfare services and occupational training; Engage government officers in participating in NGO activities; Share best practices; Establish a focal point to improve coordination between different organisations. country case study: viet nam HIV-Sensitive social protection schemes in Viet Nam Dr. Do Huu Thuy, Director, Department of BCC and Social Mobilisation, Viet Nam Administration on AIDS Control Background and Status of the HIV epidemic: Viet Nam has a population of about 86 million, of which the percentage of poor HHs is estimated at 14 percent. Viet Nam has a concentrated epidemic, and the highest prevalence is found among people who inject drugs which comprise about 70 percent of those tested positive for HIV. At the end of 2010, Viet Nam had 183,938 reported cases of HIV; 44,022 reported cases of AIDS; and 49,477 reported cases of AIDS related deaths. Viet Nam has achieved its goal of decresing HIV prevalence to less than 0.30 percent. However, HIV incidence is projected to increase in Viet Nam. Rights of PLHIV under Vietnamese Law: PLHIV have the same rights (healthcare including health insurance, education, work, privacy) as other Viet Namese citizens under Vietnamese Law. However, there are more social protection schemes available to PLHIV. HIV-sensitive social protection schemes: Social assistance, social insurance, and health insurance are provided to vulnerable groups, including PLHIV. Many legal and policy frameworks relevant to HIV-sensitive social protection have been developed, and include: \u2022\ufffd Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control; \u2022\ufffd Law on Health Insurance; Page 22 \u2022\ufffd Government Decree on support policies for social protection beneficiaries; \u2022\ufffd Government Decree on the establishment and operation of social protection institutions which provide social support to PLHIV; \u2022\ufffd Decision on Social Work Scheme, which targets vulnerable groups in particular, including PLHIV; \u2022\ufffd Decision on Management, Care and Support for PLHIV in closed settings.

Financing: The HIV response is mainly externally funded, and the government manages budget allocation to localities to support vulnerable groups, including PLHIV. In addition, the medical examination and treatment expenses of those who have purchased medical insurance and who become HIV positive, are covered by this insurance fund. Challenges: Stigma and discrimination are a barrier to accessing the social protection system, in part because PLHIV have to share their personal information to access these services. Most people with HIV are SWs or people who inject drugs and are stigmatised because they use drugs or sell sex. The selection proceure for various social protection schemes takes place only once a year, which presents a challenge to effective program implementation. Due to budget limitations, allowances made to vulnerable people are low and there is a need to increase funds. Lessons learned: The role of the state is key to developing the social protection system. The legal framework needs to be in place to safeguard PLHIV and to ensure the operationalisation of HIV-sensitive social protection. Social protection schemes and social security schemes need to be HIV-sensitive. It is important not to equate HIV with injecting drug use and selling sex, which are viewed as social evils. Community mobilisation can contribute significantly. Highlights from plenary discussions Coordination of HIV-sensitive social protection at national level (India): India demonstrates a high level of political commitment to HIV-sensitive social protection. A question posed to India was whether, however, coordination (organising meetings) at the national level faced problems. Response: The involvement of high level leadership ensures political commitment (e.g. national and state level councils on AIDS are headed by Prime Minister and the State Chief Minister respectively) and the development of a roadmap. Coordinating meetings do pose some challenges, but they are surmounted. Adjusting the parameters to include PLHIV (India): Another question posed to the Indian delegation was how the use of BPL (Below Poverty Line) and other cards is related to PLHA, and how these cards are linked to different services. Response: Since a large number of PLHIV are economically marginalised, they benefit from general social protection schemes, such as the schemes for people in the BPL category. The advantage of this approach is that PLHIV are not stigmatized because of their HIV status, as it covers all living below the poverty line. Another card scheme being developed in India is the \u201csmart card system\u201d, which will enable PLHIV to access services wherever they are in India. The plan is to make this card a \u201chealth card\u201d which can be used for the poor to access other health services as well, thus reducing HIV related stigma. Some states have also introduced cards for transfers to health services, and the plan is to expand this scheme to include non-HIV+ people. It is critical to make social protection schemes non-HIV specific to avoid the risk of stigma. Targeted interventions for key populations (China): A question was posed whether there is an existing social protection scheme that target KAPs in China. Response: China has some programs specifically targeting KAPs such as methadone treatment, job training, and assistance to drug users to find employment. NGOs work with SWs, and families as well as the MSM community have provided support to MSM. Page 23 Making social protection more inclusive (India): India has many examples of making social protection more inclusive for PLHIV and other marginalised populations. This work has required a lot of lobbying and coordination with different ministries and different states. One example of the outcomes triggered by these efforts is the decision to include transgender people in the census as the third sex category. In Tamil Nadu, there is a TG welfare board. In Delhi, the government provides employment opportunities to TG persons so that they do not have to turn to sex work. HIV prevalence and disclosure (China): Many PLHIV choose not to disclose their status, which complicates establishing HIV prevalence for China. The reliability of HIV estimates has improved in recent years through the increase in numbers of people accessing VCCT, and data is generated at healthcare sites on HIV prevalence. HIV test results recorded at private clinics need to be reported to the authorities. Data from these and sentinel surveillance sites that cover KAP also provide good data. Estimates are made jointly by government, UNAIDS and WHO.

Response: The expectation is for local authorities to contribute to these cash allowances, but the government subsidizes these allowances where there is a lack of funds at the local levels, e.g. in provinces/districts/communes where there is a pronounced need (high levels of poverty) for these schemes. The selection of eligible HHs\u2019 is made by local authorities at the commune level, and local authorities monitor how HHs use this money. State-run social establishments (Viet Nam): A number of countries have developed the idea of institutionalisation being a social protection mechanism. The questions were posed as to whether state-run social protection establishments in Viet Nam are closed or open settings, and whether they are voluntary. Response: For key populations, these establishments can be either voluntary or forced (closed), and for OVC and poor PLHIV, these are voluntary. Cash transfers for nomadic and indigenous people: Reaching nomadic and indigenous populations is a challenging task. In Nepal, on predefined dates, cash transfers are available for pick-up from local government authorities in areas where the beneficiaries reside that year. Increasing awareness of cash transfer schemes among the nomadic and indigenous community is important (e.g. through training teachers and health care workers). Government support to HIV-sensitive social protection for children: There is not much information readily available on best practices on family-based and community-based rehabilitation for OVC. In Thailand, financial assistance is provided for families/ members of the extended family/foster parents to look after children (including CLHIV) at home. In addition to cash transfers, families are provided with education on child care, and equipment etc. Need to avoid exceptionalism: Some of the programs and activities introduced/discussed have been HIV-exclusive. It is important to avoid exceptionalism and the creation of parralel systems, which has the tendency to pit groups against another as they compete over scarce resources. Issues to consider when developing targeted HIV-sensitive social protection: A key issue to consider when developing targeted HIV-sensitive social protection (self-selection/HH-based/categorical approach) is how to address stigma and discrimination. Another issue to consider is when the government is best placed to provide social support, and when it is most effective for the civil society to provide this support. Page 24 dAy 2: hIv-sensItIve socIAl ProtectIon needs: IdeAs And ActIon Day 2 was composed of brainstorming sessions in country groups, country presentations, and plenary discussion. Key messages that emerged during the second day included: \u2022\ufffd There is a need to work first and foremost on ensuring existing and new social protection measures are HIV-sensitive. \u2022\ufffd There is a need to identify and predict the costs of HIV-sensitive social protection programs. \u2022\ufffd Services are largely in place, but there is a need to increase demand for services, promoting health-seeking behaviours among PLHIV and KAPs. \u2022\ufffd Laws and policies are largely in place, but operationalising them \u2013 particularly at sub-national levels \u2013 needs improvement. \u2022\ufffd The most sustainable approach to ensuring PLHIV have income is employment, and there is a need to build linkages to existing broad employment interventions, developing effective employment strategies and models for PLHIV. \u2022\ufffd Designing effective and cost-efficient HIV-sensitive social protection requires understanding the ways HIV is being transmitted and community involvement (MIPA). \u2022\ufffd Multisectoral and multistakeholder partnerships are key to effective social protection \u2022\ufffd There is a need to increase domestic funding to ensure long-term sustainability. sessIon 4: whAt Is needed? objective: to identify/map what is needed to improve hIv-sensitive social protection for impact mitigation This session comprised brainstorming sessions to identify prioritity HIV impact categories in each country. All eight countries identified income and/or employment as key areas requiring action; six countries identified stigma and discrimination as requiring action15; five countries identified issues related to healthcare as requiring action; and one country identified strengthening the evidence base as a key area for action. 15 There was common agreement that stigma and discrimination in health settings needs to be addressed to improve access to healthcare.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66ac6585-60fc-4e51-a4dd-17b5afbe1e24": {"__data__": {"id_": "66ac6585-60fc-4e51-a4dd-17b5afbe1e24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Sensitive Social Protection for Impact Mitigation in Asia and the Pacific - Report on the High-level Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "067553895cb3165c1fb830d202df81ab71a5b5a2468f53152684eeacb01b6721"}, "2": {"node_id": "c28e8572-53bc-42c7-9212-555ac4a3bb91", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cbd73f1272b5c674cd1b44c5ee56251a557bb02204cea2999b238bd0749b9847"}}, "hash": "ffe263840ad2a2a85de81ce85c317f8bcf8be51cbc595a64616d6dc1939218e7", "text": "Actions relate to stigma and discrimination were identified under the priority area of health services by China, India, Nepal, and Viet Nam.

Cultural norms and institutions x x 2 6. Other Evidence base 1 As the table above shows, three key areas that the country groups identified as priorities requiring attention in terms of HIV- sensitive social protection were: economic (income and employment); health-seeking behaviours (which will require actions to increase demand and to ensure services are friendly and non-stigmatising); and stigma and discrimination. Most of the priority actions identified were built on modifying or scaling up existing programs or interventions. Plenary discussion The importance of employment: Employment was identified as a key priority by most groups. The experience from countries such as India demonstrates that employment is the most sustainable, effective strategy for improving the income of PLHIV. Implementation of microcredit for HIV+ entrepreneurs (SMEs) needs a lot of support from key stakeholders, including non affected partners and NA-HHs, to sustain their enterprise. Public works programs for the chronically ill: Employment options for PLHIV \u2013 and related data and models \u2013 are limited. However, there are many public works programs, and one model of good practice is to explore opportunities to make these programs \u2013 and all other forms of employment \u2013 friendlier to the chronically ill, including PLHIV. Importance of coverage: Providing services to all those who need them is extreme importance. For instance health service coverage incorporates three dimensions: population coverage, benefit coverage, coverage of costs. Importance of nuanced understanding: In aiming to increase demand for services, it is important to go beyond broad trends to examine nuances. Many countries have good policies and laws in place, but are weak enforcement. While in some countries stigma and discrimination may be decreasing, marked stigma towards KAPs may be strong. Page 26 Transformative potential of HIV-sensitive social protection: Addressing stigma, discrimination, including marginalisation of MARPs, and employment can transform the lives of PLHIV in profound ways, and go beyond the conventional approach of providing social safety nets to making society more inclusive. WHO priority for 2011 on sensitizing health sector: WHO has prioritised sensitizing the health sector for HIV access this year, and is developing related trainings and guidelines. sessIon 5: IdeAs to ActIon Objectives: To brainstorm and formulate interventions on the social protection needs identified in the previous session as the country representatives find relevant to themselves; and to synthesise and generalise stakeholder responsibilities to operationalise the ideas. This session comprised discussions in country groups to respond to the following questions for each priority impact category: \u2022\ufffd What needs to happen to address the impact? (political will/leadership, policy, implementation, financing) \u2022\ufffd For whom? \u2022\ufffd Who is responsible to make it happen? (government, UN, donor, NGO, INGO, CSO and networks (local, regional and international) The key activities identified by the groups include: \u2022\ufffd Income and employment: Modifying existing schemes to make them HIV sensitive, and linking PLHIV with these schemes; developing partnerships with the private sector. \u2022\ufffd Health: Increasing uptake of services through the promotion of health-seeking behaviour (particularly among KAPs); and through improving the quality of health services (addressing stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings). \u2022\ufffd Stigma and discrimination: Application, enforcement and harmonisation of laws and policies; and developing social communication strategies to address stigma and discrimination among the general public. Page 27 dAy 3: PrIncIPles For ActIon Day 3 was composed of break-out sessions in country groups to identify follow-up actions, country presentations, and a plenary discussion to identify areas where support is needed, and to discuss and agree on common priorities. Key messages put forward /reinforced during the third day include: \u2022\ufffd Political commitment will be key to establishing successful HIV-sensitive social protection. \u2022\ufffd Ensuring the sustainability of current and new HIV-sensitive social protection measures will require national budget, technical support, and south\u2013south dialogue.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14a00ea7-da30-49a0-b00e-a73e840ed566": {"__data__": {"id_": "14a00ea7-da30-49a0-b00e-a73e840ed566", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Sensitive Social Protection for Impact Mitigation in Asia and the Pacific - Report on the High-level Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "558d32c05940c654463c0ea7e404bb16c6a4a5082c0b1a4fd3c448d69f3fa8cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "a6786f6c-5f61-4bf6-9adc-12d4e0d41a5c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b4ad27f49acbb9951f68ccb698457fe0225b2d905fd984195271761c6f09896"}}, "hash": "76c535863841ed18ef08e57a4a47f684d71ca5f01b426e39ed2cc9a8f14eda63", "text": "\u2022\ufffd Effective and cost-efficient HIV-sensitive social protection measures in the Asia-Pacific region need to reflect the concentration of the HIV epidemic among key populations.

Key objectives include fair working conditions, access to social protection, and non-discrimination. Employment and income: ILO\u2019s HIV and the World of Work- program aims to promote national policies and legal frameworks on HIV/AIDS and the world of work, ensuring PLHIV are included in the Labour Law and that they are not discriminated; and that social protection mechanisms are strengthened in the world of work. ILO provides technical assistance to governments to assess and design social protection strategies and schemes, ensuring coverage for PLHIV. ILO works in the area of skills development, providing support to vocational training, business development, and micro-credit programs, for example. UNDP Pramod Kumar, Senior Program Advisor; UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Development planning and mainstreaming: UNDP works with countries and government institutions to plan and respond to aspects of HIV that relate to development, integrating HIV into planning instruments and national social protection strategies, and facilitating South \u2013 South dialogue. Governance: Governance of HIV responses \u2013 ensuring they address the impact of HIV on KAPs \u2013 is a key area of UNDP\u2019s work. Laws and policies, and the protection and promotion of human rights, including in the areas of gender equality and sexual diversity, are aspects of this support, as is the generation of data to inform this work (socioeconomic impact assessments). Page 28 UNICEF Ketan Chitnis, Regional HIV/AIDS Specialist; UNICEF, Asia-Pacific Shared Services Centre Health-seeking behaviours: UNICEF works with communities to make sure there is demand for health services, and to ensure KAPs are able to access health services (social mobilisation). Social protection for vulnerable populations: On the service side, UNICEF works to ensure health \u2013 as well as education and social services \u2013 reach the most disadvantaged and marginalised populations. This includes strengthening the capacity of child- and social welfare workers, and support to strengthening systems to ensure social protection is child- and HIV-sensitive. Strengthening the evidence- and resource base: UNICEF works to ensure there is data and analyses available to inform policy and program development (particularly on risk and vulnerability). UNICEF also supports fundraising, providing technical support to the development of Global Fund proposals, for instance. UNAIDS Robin Jackson; UNAIDS Geneva ABC Advocating, brokering and coordination are central tasks of UNAIDS. Advocating for a range of important issues, particularly as they relate to gender and human rights is central to UNAIDS work. UNAIDS works to broker effective partnerships between governments, civil society, the UN and other actors to enhance the response to the epidemic. Coordination of the 10 cosponsors16, catalyzing expertise and leveraging resources is a core UNAIDS function. Access to technical support: UNAIDS has developed regional Technical Support Facilities (TSF) as a mechanism to provide technical support to countries. In Asia and the Pacific, TSFs are located in Kuala Lumpur and in Kathmandu, and technical support is also available through the HIV Alliance in Cambodia.

Principles for actions Clifton Cortez, Practice Team Leader, UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre The following principles or concepts reflect common, repeated themes that emerged from the presentations and plenary discussions17. These principles underline strengths that drive social protection. Social protection for mitigating the impact of HIV on affecte people and their households should: 1. Aim for HIV-sensitivity versus HIV-specificity: For reasons of sustainability, coverage, involvement of multiple sectors and the opportunities for mainstreaming HIV into national and decentralised development plans. 2. Involve multiple sectors and partners: HIV-sensitive social protection requires the involvement of different ministries, the private sector, civil society and communities. Their involvement and partnership is required at every stage \u2013 from planning to implementation. This is also important for sustainability. 17 This list has been refined by key UN partners on the basis of feedback presented through plenary discussion. Page 31 3. Engage affected individuals, networks and communities \u2013 especially key populations: The design of HIV-sensitive social protection programs should be inclusive and participatory so as to ensure that the interventions address the specific needs and concerns of the affected people. 4. Protect and enhance human rights: While implementing HIV-sensitive social protection schemes, special attention must be paid to ensure that the human rights of the participants are not violated but rather are enhanced. Issues of concern are mandatory testing, disclosure of beneficiary details, breach of confidentiality and involuntary confinement. 5. Take into account sustainability: As in the case of ART, HIV-sensitive social protection requires long-term political and financial commitment and hence sustainability should be an integral part of the planning process. Plenary discussion Agreement on the principles: All participants agreed on the principles presented above. Importance of knowing and responding to the epidemic: It is important to know how the epidemic is evolving in each country, and to ensure this informs program design and development. Countries in the Asia-Pacific have good knowledge of their epidemics, including on its concentration among particular sub-populations. The translation of the principles /concepts (above; especially principles 1 and 2) into practice should reflect the reality of the epidemic, prioritising actions targeting KAPs. Specify sub-populations: To help target interventions, it will be good to specify which sub-populations priorities 3 and 4 relate to at the country level. Reflecting the regional scenario, a participant suggested that the third priority, \u201cEngage affected individuals, networks and communities\u201d, be modified to include women and adolescents, who have \u201ca lot to advise about.\u201d Young people: Countries in the region have large youth populations, who are among the key populations most affected by the epidemic.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f989f83f-d3c0-4ab2-9372-78dcbbd81438": {"__data__": {"id_": "f989f83f-d3c0-4ab2-9372-78dcbbd81438", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Sensitive Social Protection for Impact Mitigation in Asia and the Pacific - Report on the High-level Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "75ce9b80c911f1fb70730635296474a5ed97fb98d80c3a37f7ddebdabec4db2e"}, "2": {"node_id": "eab8af15-eff9-4936-b3ae-f9d600775751", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a7fad9fe25fa56bf644e41474221cb2e1c1fc13b6ca14eaa2e621e903e552e6d"}}, "hash": "94ab9e17ff9a98ca7a1488ce0f30ea7b57b23c29146f5549331efb2a42b48f57", "text": "Young people have the highest rates of HIV infection, and there is a need to address the needs of children who have been infected through their mother during pregnancy, and are entering a sexually active phase in their lives.

To ensure sustainability, it is important to understand what sustainability entails, and to work in the areas of e.g. policies and the legal environment.

Cost efficiency and mobilizing domestic budget are important, if also complex issues. Need to approach social protection as an investment: While mobilizing funds for HIV-sensitive social protection is likely to be a challenging task, it is important to underline that HIV-sensitive social protection is an investment which yields benefits for society. UN support to move the agenda forwards Brian Lutz, Policy Specialist, UNDP, New York UN counterparts present at the consultation identified the development of the following regional products by UN organisations to support HIV-sensitive social protection: Assessment tools for country-level use (to identify HIV-sensitivity of social protection schemes); Guidance note on HIV sensitive social protection; Good Practices (sharing information on what works to assist in the design of HIV-sensitive social protection schemes). Plenary discussion Include costing and harmonisation in the principles: Costing and harmonisation are key to determining the success of HIV- sensitive social protection interventions. They should thus be included in the principles, ensuring they are congruent with each other. Publication on good practices relevant to the region: A regional publication identifying good practices would be helpful to supporting countries to operationalise HIV-sensitive social protection. This should reflect the concentration of the epidemic among particular sub-populations. Experiences (best practices and lessons learned) from countries outside the region \u2013 with with a different HIV scenario, but e.g. similar geographic, cultural, and/or economic features \u2013 would be useful to include in the publication. Benefit package: It would be helpful to identify good models for benefit packages offered through HIV-sensitive social protection schemes. These will look different in different countries, but an analysis of the basic elements of a benefit package would benefit governments as they develop these packages. Page 32 Guidance on harmonisation: Social protection interventions are often fragmented and individualised, which presents a challenge to harmonising these, and to making sure they are HIV-sensitive. There is a need for guidance on harmonisation, including how to ensure systems, structures, and practices are coherent. Regional tool on costing: Given the importance of costing, specific guidance (a regional tool) on costing would be extremely useful, assisting countries advocate for, design and manage HIV-sensitive social protection schemes. Return on social investment: Minitries of planning and financ may want to want to know the returns on social investment, and there is a need to detail expected returns (financial and social). Monitoring and evaluation tool: Designing and implementing HIV-sensitive social protection is a complex, multisectoral process, and there is a need for a monitoring and evaluation tool. Rapid assessment tool: Many countries in the Asia-Pacific have begun to develop social protection schemes, and a rapid assessment tool on HIV-sensitive social protection for countries with concentrated HIV epidemics would be helpful. closIng remArks ILO Richard Howard, Senior Specialist on HIV and AIDS, ILO Decent Work Technical Support Team for East and South-East Asia and the Pacific Richard Howard expressed his thanks to UNDP and all the co-organisers of the consultation, as well as the Cambodian counterparts for hosting the consultation. He shared with the audience that his thinking on HIV-sensitive social protection was provoked by the initial findings of the socioeconomic survey, which demonstrated the clear impact HIV had on HIV-HHs. He expressed his thanks also to the Asia Pacific Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (APN+), and stated that he was impressed with the linkages established during the workshop, and called on participants to pledge to strengthen work on HIV and to ensure HIV is incorporated into work around social protection.

Many countries in the region are experiencing strong economic growth, he noted, yet the gap between their rich and poor is growing, impacting social instability. There is also strong evidence that societies that have strong equality, he noted, are best placed to compete in the global market place. The experiences of the HIV/AIDS community and of the social protection community need to come together. He encouraged participants to continue the dialogue across sectors and agencies. It is important to engage communities in the response, he reminded. \u201cIf we have learned anything in 30 years, it is that the recipe for failure is not to talk to key populations, they are our best advisors.\u201d In Asia, most affected people include those who buy and sell sex, who use drugs, and MSM, he said, presenting participants with the challenge to get to know and befriend people from these groups. Satisfaction comes with the ability to look back and respond positively to the question \u201cHow well will we have really touched the lives of the peoples we served?\u201d he suggested. Asia has received considerable external funding to resource its HIV response and every country has received substantial funding from the Global Fund. This will not continue, Steve Kraus observed, pointing to the need to move from donor dependency to partnerships, increasing national budget to the HIV response, and to resourcing the development of HIV-sensitive social protection. \u201cThe issue of sustainability is not going to go away. We all are one planet, but we need to ensure government commitments are sustained.\u201d As the countries in the region move from low- to middle income, the challenge is to ensure financial sustainability to the HIV response, he stated, providing the positive example of Thailand where 95 percent of national HIV/AIDS expenditure comes from domestic sources. The economy moves faster than social protection, and experiece from many parts of the world suggests that in order to limit the negative impact of this gap and ensure maximum positive impact from economic growth, dialogue on social protection needs to take place at an early stage. Before finishing, Steve Kraus presented one more challenge to the participants: that of thinking about the kind of changes they can make to laws and policies. The lack of a supportive, protective legal environment is the biggest single impediment holding back the HIV response, he observed. Many of the countries in Asia and the Pacific have punitive laws that have a severe impact on key populations, including laws that prohibit same sex behaviour, commercial sex, or criminalize those who take (not those who sell) drugs, and in four countries taking drugs can lead to a death penalty. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way to get from here to there; to good public health, or good social protection schemes.\u201d He commended participants for their active engagement, and called on all to \u201clearn and work together to make the world a better, healthier, safer place for us all.\u201d Ros Seilavath, Deputy Secretary General, NAA, Cambodia Dr. Ros Seilavath expressed his thanks to the UNDP, ILO, UNICEF and UNAIDS for organising the consultation and for the opportunity to learn from the different experiences within the region. He noted his appreciation for all the discussion on the concept and application of HIV sensitive social protection. Cambodia faces many challenges in providing interventions to particularly MARPs (which is the term adopted in Cambodia, he noted, in place of KAPs), with cultural norms placing restrictions on the selection of appropriate interventions. Against this back-drop, Ros Seilavath drew attention to the importance of harmonising laws, and of convening interministerial discussion to raise awareness of, and seek ways to address the harmful effects of particular aspects of laws, such as the laws on anti-trafficking and drug use in Cambodia. \u201cWe can only try to live and work together to harmonise laws,\u201d he commented, noting that while changing policies and laws is possible, this takes time and requires thorough understanding of the conflicting points of laws and policies.

Page 34 APPendIx 1: concePt note Synopsis Given its increasing importance in expanding universal access and for mitigating the impact on people and families affected by HIV, social protection has emerged as a key strategy in AIDS responses. UNAIDS in its 2009-2011 Outcome Framework lists social protection for people impacted by HIV as one of the priority areas and cross-cutting strategies. Many Asian countries have impressive records of social protection, but not adequate HIV-sensitive social protection18 despite the impoverishment and marginalistion of people affected by HIV. An issue of concern in the context of HIV in Asia and the Pacific is the severe and wide-ranging socio-economic impact on people living with HIV and their households. Although the prevalence is generally low and the epidemic is concentrated among the most at risk populations in the region, the impact on households is quite burdensome, often pushing them to irreversible coping mechanisms19. There is increasing call for social protection to help mitigate the impact as well as to prevent them from adopting irreversible coping mechanisms. In this context, UNDP in partnership with UNICEF, ILO, UNAIDS, and APN+ is organizing a high level technical consultation in April 2011 on HIV-sensitive social protection with particular focus on impact mitigation. Besides strengthening the understanding of HIV-sensitive social protection, the consultation will arrive at a common approach to HIV-sensitive social protection for impact mitigation. It will bring together leading experts of social protection, HIV-specialists, academia, economists and leaders of PLHIV networks with participation from governments, civil society, UN and other stakeholders. Background and rationale Although various State-supported social welfare schemes have been in implementation in most of the countries in the Asia- Pacific region for several years, since the Asian financial crisis of 1997, there has been increasing attention to the importance of social protection to safeguard vulnerable populations from livelihood shocks. That more than a decade of unprecedented growth could not protect a large number of people in Asia from deprivation and socio-economic risks has brought to sharp focus the necessity of institutional mechanisms for social protection20, particularly of the vulnerable groups. As a global review of social protection21 by the Institute of Development Studies, Sussex, notes, the risks, vulnerabilities, exclusion and inequalities that accompany the rapid economic, social and environmental changes leave millions of people exposed to livelihood insecurity. The impact of the recent economic crisis and food and fuel price shocks is a case in point. There is considerable unanimity now among international development partners that economic growth and social infrastructure alone aren\u2019t enough to fight poverty, and to protect vulnerable groups, there is an urgent need for various measures of social protection22. They also feel that \u201csocial protection should cover a wider set of policies and programmes than the approaches adopted in developed nations.\u201d According to the Chronic Poverty Report 200923, social protection, and particularly social assistance, tackles the insecurity trap by protecting poor people from shocks and reducing their extreme vulnerability; it helps them conserve and accumulate assets so that they can improve their livelihoods and productivity; and it contributes to transforming economic and social relations in ways that strengthen the longer term livelihood prospects of the poor and the chronically poor. Key among the people who face severe socio-economic vulnerabilities, exclusion, marginalization, poverty and livelihood shocks in the Asia-Pacific region are the people living with HIV, their households and those who are at risk of infection. People living with HIV and their households, including those who suffered AIDS-deaths, are acutely burdened by illnesses, loss of jobs and income, rising medical expenses, depletion of savings and other resources, food insecurity, psychological stress and related morbidity, discrimination, social exclusion and imminent impoverisation that is often irreversible. This socio-economic impact is also felt on the status of women as well as the education of children. The Report by the Commission on AIDS in Asia24 estimates the annual economic cost of AIDS on Asian households at about US $ 2 billion. Each AIDS death results in a loss of at least US $ 5,000 or 14 years of productive life calculated at a modest US $ 1 a day. Recent studies supported by UNDP in China, India, Indonesia and Cambodia, demonstrate the extreme socio-economic vulnerability of people living with HIV and their households in the Asia-Pacific region. For instance, the study in China showed that the socio-economic burden of HIV at the household and per capita levels is significant compared to the non-HIV 18 HIV-sensitive social protection refers to social protection that does not exclusively target those affected by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "568314de-db84-4e44-800b-954110723c5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "568314de-db84-4e44-800b-954110723c5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Sensitive Social Protection for Impact Mitigation in Asia and the Pacific - Report on the High-level Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "032ca69b57a4227b8807bc3168bbbf4fa632f6354d5c05974faa67f145208b2e"}}, "hash": "032ca69b57a4227b8807bc3168bbbf4fa632f6354d5c05974faa67f145208b2e", "text": "HIV, instead targeting a more encompassing set of vulnerable group, but nonetheless is able to reach people affected by HIV and adequately address their unique needs. HIV-specific social protection refers to social protection that exclusively or predominately targets those affected by HIV. 19 Socio economic impact studies by UNDP in India (2006), Cambodia, China and Indonesia (2010), UNDP 20 Seven out of the 29 countries that will pilot the Social Protection Floor Initiative of the UN CEB are in Asia 21 Socio-economic security over the life course: A global review of social protection, Sarah Cook and Naila Kabeer, Institute of Development Studies, Sussex; July 2009 22 Social Protection Index for Committed Poverty Reduction, ADB, 2006 23 Chronic Poverty Report 2008-09 24 \u201cRedefining AIDS in Asia\u201d, Report of The Commission on AIDS in Asia, Oxford, 2008 Page 35 households across a wide spectrum of indicators ranging from loss of income to education of children. Reduced workforce participation of adults of productive age and additional burden on older people and children are substantially higher among HIV-households. Medical expenditure of HIV-households is four times higher than that of non-HIV households and the quality of food consumed, despite comparable level of expenditure, is poorer. HIV significantly compromised the ability of households, particularly in the lower quintiles, to borrow. They liquidated assets twice as many times as the non-HIV households did. HIV also has a serious impact on food security as indicated by the reduced farm activity, reduced area under cultivation as well as non-diversity of crops among HIV-households. HIV led to school drop-outs, which is higher among girls, and considerable household burden on women. Discrimination is rampant and had a wide-ranging impact including on loss of income. A major recommendation of these multi-country studies for strategic impact mitigation is targeted social protection schemes and integration of HIV into existing social protection schemes. Despite the acute socio-economic vulnerabilities, the attention to strategically integrate HIV into appropriate social protection schemes (HIV-sensitive social protection) is very limited in the region. The recent financial crisis and the food and fuel price inflation add a more complex dimension to the situation. Already burdened by the severe socio-economic impact of HIV/AIDS, people living with HIV are among the most vulnerable to external shocks. In addition, the possibility of rollback of resources by donors in the wake of the crisis worsens the situation as the AIDS programmes in many countries in the region are largely dependent on donor funds. A World Bank/UNAIDS study25 concludes that a majority of countries will be forced to cut their HIV programmes as they are dependent on external sources of support that will be reduced because of the crisis. The volatile food price situation in the region is also of serious concern. Since 2000, food prices have been rising in Asia and the Pacific and throughout the world, with particularly sharp increases since 2007. Globally, food prices rose by 66 per cent between mid-2005 and August 200826. The FAO Global Food Price Monitor notes that that the price of rice is at a record high in several countries of Asia27. A number of economists are projecting renewed high levels of food price inflation in 2011. Recent modeling work on how these increases affect the poor in developing countries shows that increases in the poverty headcount are likely to be severe, eliminating much of the progress in poverty reduction that has been made in recent years28. Additionally, some HIV-affected households spend a lower proportion of their total expenditure on food than their non-HIV counterparts implying that these households use for medical purposes the money that they would otherwise spend on food. Food price-rise will likely impact the quality as well as the quantity of diet of HIV-affected households. Available examples show that social protection has significant AIDS mitigation impact. For example, cash transfer programmes piloted in countries with high HIV prevalence have a significant impact on poverty reduction in households affected by HIV and AIDS29, while supporting livelihoods, enabling access to education and improving nutrition30. As the State of Evidence paper of UNICEF31 notes, social protection, mainly through instruments such as social transfers, livelihoods, social health protection, legislation, policies & regulation, can promote Universal Access outcomes on HIV prevention, treatment, care & support. In the East Indian state of Orissa, lowering the age limit for AIDS-widows has helped women living with HIV access monthly financial assistance from the government under the widow pension scheme32. Quoting relevant studies, Ann Nolan of Irish AID33 argues that cash transfers may prevent households affected by AIDS from adopting non-reversible coping strategies such as liquidation of assets and removal of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f234b87-7aed-4860-95e5-9a5f6587d8f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f234b87-7aed-4860-95e5-9a5f6587d8f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Sensitive Social Protection for Impact Mitigation in Asia and the Pacific - Report on the High-level Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c28bd8fee852750b0d28bfb704842d69e99490d6801118b67f31f95ee7f8402b"}, "3": {"node_id": "9ec7d2bb-69c3-4fc1-ad2d-d27b656ae6b0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2d16337012e69b73694ccc33980fd5935e15ce4c2f2cc01fd1822b5b9ba3531"}}, "hash": "a5ab10599f5138ea7234e26314915e5609d6858beb320ea9edd79ba8c7e57b19", "text": "girl children from schools; labour market interventions can make amends for the erosion of skills and experience caused by illness and long periods of absence from work; increasing resources and decision- making capacity in women\u2019s hands can enhance gender equality, child survival and better food security; and transformative social protection3435 can support the realization of rights of women crucially required in the context of HIV/AIDS. Some suggest that such interventions should be prioritized based on their potential contribution to reducing the impact of the epidemic, rather than on prevalence rates alone, and that such schemes could potentially contribute to prevention and treatment as well as to care and support36.

E.g. changes to the regulatory framework that afford succession rights including land retention to women and are supported by awareness campaigns to help change societal attitudes 35 Miriam Temin, HIV-sensitive social protection: What does the evidence say? UNICEF, 2010 36 Ibid 16 Page 36 is much debated. Many argue that the highest priority \u2018structural\u2019 interventions for HIV prevention in these environments are linked to human rights protection and creating an enabling legal environment for marginalized populations, while expressing skepticism that social protection in general can significantly influence these kinds of epidemic dynamics. The Sonagachi Project of sex workers in the east Indian city of Kolkatta, which combines both transformative elements of social protection and livelihoods interventions, both designed by sex workers, is a good example in this context. Though the common understanding and approach to social protection as well as the current systems and programmes vary considerably across the region37, a crucial aspect is quite discernible: a vast majority of highly vulnerable people, the informal economy workers and their families, fall between the two dominant forms of social safety nets - the social welfare schemes of the formal sector and the social assistance schemes targeted for the poorest of the poor. It is important to note that social protection in developing country contexts has to deal with deficits in basic needs (basic social security), protection in times of adversity (contingent social security)38 and an overall paradigm of inclusive growth. Finally, it is important to understand and respond to those who are critical or skeptical about the relevance of HIV-sensitivity in social protection. Some opposition to HIV-sensitivity might be rooted in stigma or discrimination against people with HIV or against the populations disproportionately affected by HIV in this region. In addition, however, it must be noted that there are more legitimate concerns linked to the relatively modest overall burden of HIV in Asia-Pacific, and the degree to which HIV- sensitive social protection does or does not make social protection more effective and inclusive, not just for people living with or vulnerable to HIV, but also for people with other chronic or life-threatening illnesses or disabilities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ec7d2bb-69c3-4fc1-ad2d-d27b656ae6b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ec7d2bb-69c3-4fc1-ad2d-d27b656ae6b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV-Sensitive Social Protection for Impact Mitigation in Asia and the Pacific - Report on the High-level Technical Consultation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c28bd8fee852750b0d28bfb704842d69e99490d6801118b67f31f95ee7f8402b"}, "2": {"node_id": "0f234b87-7aed-4860-95e5-9a5f6587d8f1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv-sensitive-social-protection-impact-mitigation-asia-and-pacific-report-high-level-technical-consultation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5ab10599f5138ea7234e26314915e5609d6858beb320ea9edd79ba8c7e57b19"}}, "hash": "e2d16337012e69b73694ccc33980fd5935e15ce4c2f2cc01fd1822b5b9ba3531", "text": "The UNAIDS Business Case for social protection39 lists as its goal, national social protection strategies that include people living with HIV and affected by HIV, with a focus on most-vulnerable groups and contribute to universal access and achievement of MDGs by 2015.

The proposal aimed to address the vulnerabilities of migrant and mobile populations to HIV and AIDS in South-East Asia and involved several partners in the region: ASEAN1 Secretariat, Governments of the 10 ASEAN Member Countries2 (through the ASEAN Task Force on AIDS and national ministries of labour, health or similar bodies), UN and international organizations (UNRTF3 Secretariat, UNDP, UNAIDS, IOM, ILO, UNESCO, UNHCR), CIDA, CSEARHAP4, and regional NGOs (APN+, Migrant Forum Asia, CARAM Asia and several CARAM Asia national counterparts like Achieve and Raks Thai). Many people participated in the various consultations to design the proposal while several government officials, NGOs, UN and international organizations provided key information and validated various drafts. It is difficult to acknowledge everyone involved in the production of this document. However, this publication would not have been possible without the collaboration and substantive contributions of the following persons: Dr. Bounpheng Philavong and his team in the ASEAN Secretariat, as well as mem- bers from the ASEAN Task Force on AIDS, Dr. Tia Phalla and Ms. Soimart Rungmanee from UNRTF Secretariat, Ms. Caitlin Wiesen and the regional HIV practice team from UNDP, Ms. Sue Carey and her team from CSEARHAP, Dr. Nenette Motus, Mr. David Trees and their country delegations at IOM, Dr. NweNwe Aye and various Country Coordinators from UNAIDS, Ms. Cynthia Gabriel from CARAM Asia, Mr. Promboon Panitchpakdi from Raks Thai, Ms. Malu Marin from Achieve, Mr. Shiba Phurailatpam from APN+ and Mr. William Gois from Migrant Forum Asia. The compilation of this report was a team effort led by Ms. Marta Vallejo Mestres from the UNDP Regional HIV and Development Programme with support from Ms. C\u00e9line Artal who updated and synthesized all the information found herein.

These patterns are likely to continue into the future. Today there is a growing body of evidence that migrants and mobile people are more vulnerable to HIV than are populations that do not move. The recent report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia stated that \u201cthe future of Asia\u2019s epidemics depends to a considerable extent on what happens to men\u2019s incomes and their mobility outside family settings. Men who have disposable income, and who travel or migrate to work opportunities, provide most of the demand for commercial sex.\u201d Women are a sig- nificant proportion of the migrant population and face a wide range of risks and vulnerability that expose them to exploitation, abuse and HIV.

Likewise, epidemiological data on HIV among migrants needs consolidation, and comprehensive and regular updating, and should be made accessi- ble to practitioners and policy makers from all sectors. Drawing on data collected during large resource mobilization efforts in 2007, the secretariats of the UN Regional Task Force on HIV and Mobility (UNRTF) and ASEAN agreed to put together the following rapid assessment document. It combines a concise country-by-country overview of HIV and mobility in each of the 10 ASEAN Member States with profiles of the major organizations working in the region on this issue. We hope that policy makers and practitioners find this report useful as they develop comprehensive rights-based responses to address the HIV-related issues that confront migrants and mobile populations throughout the migration cycle from their home countries, in transit to their destination and upon return.

The Leaders reaffirmed ASEAN commitments to preventing the further trans- mission of HIV and mitigating the impacts of HIV and AIDS, by improving regional responses and en- hancing Member States\u2019 development of people- centred initiatives. An important focus of ASEAN\u2019s efforts has been on migrant and mobile populations, who are by far among the groups most-at-risk. Recognising this, the ASEAN leaders endorsed an ASEAN Declaration on the Pro- tection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers by recognising the contributions of migrant workers to the society and economy of both receiving states and sending states of ASEAN. A MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY- GENERAL OF ASEAN In line with this, the ASEAN Task Force on AIDS (ATFOA) and the ASEAN Secretariat have been working closely with UNDP and the UN Regional Task Force on HIV and Mobility (UNRTF) to conduct a Rapid Assessment on HIV and Mobility Issues in all ten ASEAN Member States. This assessment pro- vides information that will be useful for policy makers, health givers and clinicians in ensuring that migrant workers and mobile populations are provided with high-quality prevention and treatment services. I would like to thank UNDP, the UNRTF and all others involved in this outstanding endeavour. This productive collaboration has put in place a milestone document which will further enhance ASEAN\u2019s efforts at preventing and reducing the impacts of HIV and AIDS. It is through initiatives like this that we give meaning to ASEAN\u2019s vision in forging a caring and sharing society.

Largely due to growing political and economic integration in South-East Asia, the region is witnessing a steady increase in the millions who migrate be- tween ASEAN Member Countries annually in search of employment. Migrants are a growing and essential part of the workforce in more economically devel- oped countries in the region and beyond in some cases. Remittances from these workers to their families represent a significant portion of the national GDP (14.5% in the Philippines, according to World Bank 2006) and balance of payments. Despite their contribution to national economies, migrants are often exploited, marginalized and stig- matized throughout the migration process. Studies show that mobile populations are vulnerable to discrimination, racism, exploitation and harassment at home and abroad. Their basic rights are violated in terms of pay and working conditions. Often poor and powerless, migrants have little or no right to legal or Overview social protection and generally lack access to HIV/ AIDS services and information. While migration alone is not a vulnerability factor for HIV infection, the conditions under which people migrate expose them to HIV infection risks. New- found freedoms, disposable income, exploitation or abuse lead some migrants to high-risk behaviours, such as unprotected sex or drug use, making them vulnerable to HIV. It is now clearly recognized in the region that the implementation of bilateral and regional memoranda of understanding, regional work plans, such as ASEAN Work Plan III, and regional strategies and declara- tions, such as the UNRTF Regional Strategy on Mobility and HIV Vulnerability Reduction and the ASEAN Declaration on the Rights of Migrants, require operationalization into coherent, collaborative and funded implementation plans at the national level. If envisioned results are to be achieved, regional coor- dination of the implementation of national plans and cross-border interventions in support of signed agreements is essential. This document presents the key findings and recommendations of a rapid assessment conducted on HIV and mobility issues in the 10 ASEAN Member Countries in 2007-2008. It includes the migration patterns and HIV situation across the region, and the challenges and opportunities facing South-East Asian countries as they work together to develop a com- prehensive response to HIV for migrant and mobile populations. Migration patterns in South-East Asia are the result of complex push and pull factors. Dynamic and growing economies of Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei Darussalam have attracted in cumulative numbers an estimated 7.6 million migrants\u2014of which more than 3.8 million were undocumented. An estimated 12.6 million workers left Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, the Philippines and Viet Nam for better economic opportunities abroad (see table below7).

Overview national HIV strategic plans has yet to include com- prehensive and coordinated national and regional re- sponses that meet the needs of migrant and mobile populations. Some programmatic and budgetary issues to take into account are: Migrants are not covered by National AIDS Programmes\u2019 services Most national AIDS programmes do not make pro- visions for migrants\u2019 access to essential HIV preven- tion, care and treatment services. Undocumented migrants have no access to health services or pro- grammes within the host country. Pre-departure HIV prevention efforts in origin countries may be ineffective Countries of origin, especially Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines and Viet Nam, have devel- oped pre-departure training for outbound, document- ed migrant workers that includes HIV awareness sessions. The Philippines offers the most comprehen- sive HIV prevention interventions, including compulsory pre-departure HIV education. However, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to ensure effective delivery of good quality HIV prevention messages and services to migrant workers remain to be developed. Migrants and trainers report that HIV sessions occur too late in the migration process, are of short duration and not comprehensive, and that migrants pay little attention to HIV issues a few days before moving abroad. Mandatory health examinations may breach migrants\u2019 rights As in many other parts of the world, pre-departure and post-arrival health examinations are part of recruitment processes for migrant workers. Mandatory HIV testing in health examinations is required by the majority of ASEAN destination countries, except Thailand. Man- datory testing breaches migrant rights, including confi- dentiality and consent. Overview Health and HIV services in host countries not geared to migrants Migrants, especially minorities, face cultural and language barriers. They often do not read or speak the host country language, and consequently do not understand the HIV/AIDS prevention information provided to them. Migrants also seldom have full access to health services in destination countries. In Thailand, registered migrants have access to health services with sub- sidized medical costs, but anti-retroviral treatment (ART) is not included. In other destination countries, documented migrant workers can access medical services although the cost varies depending on health insurance, if any. If migrants are found to be HIV-positive through routine testing in Malaysia, Singapore or Brunei Darussalam, they are repatriated. Gaps in host-country treatment and referrals for migrants Subsidised ARV treatment is not available to migrants in any destination country, making it unaffordable. Moreover, there are no provisions for referral services for migrants found HIV-positive during health exami- nations. This is a major gap in health services through- out the region. Undocumented migrants have limited access to health services A large and growing percentage of the migrant population is undocumented or under-documented. Undocumented migrants, including those that have been trafficked, are less likely to seek health care, including treatment for STIs, testing for HIV, or any other services that would put them in contact with health authorities. They are difficult to reach with HIV prevention programming and rarely benefit from government health programmes given the under- ground nature of their situations. This presents a significant challenge to a comprehensive HIV preven- tion response. HIV trends There are signs of progress in reducing the pre- valence of HIV in some countries in the region. For example in Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia, where despite the earlier presence of generalized HIV epidemics, the number of new infections per year has declined. In Cambodia and Myanmar, the general prevalence is now below 1% (0.9% and 0.7% respec- tively), according to the latest 2007 estimates. In contrast, Indonesia is experiencing one of the fastest growing HIV epidemics in Asia, through injecting drug users (IDUs) and men having unprotected sex with multiple partners. Viet Nam also saw a rapid increase of people living with HIV from 2000 to 2005, driven by injecting drug use and unprotected sex. Increasing numbers of women are infected by male partners who engage in either unsafe paid sex or injecting drugs. Moreover, Malaysia is facing a con- centrated epidemic among IDUs: over 65% of HIV infections are estimated to result from unsafe inject- ing drug habits. In the other countries in the region, prevalence of HIV among adults (aged 15-49) is low at or below 0.1% and the main mode of transmission is unprotected sex.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57a22136-94a6-4946-a04d-1feb3ff8d6b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "57a22136-94a6-4946-a04d-1feb3ff8d6b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV/AIDS & Mobility in South-East Asia: Rapid Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d2ff58c22fe7978ff5a6cd94524e6292d0df2b5f44ad1a5c327d6b869208609"}, "2": {"node_id": "f8b0ada3-0519-42eb-84aa-862ce35003dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fcc1c2ae7c1c51f638c6fb92be71039f6e872867ed959acd5f9f41454af75da5"}}, "hash": "6809381dfdf96362420cbe3fe1effa22b238b4d2d919a6f9969dcfb30b524739", "text": "Though comprehensive epidemiological data on HIV prevalence in migrants in South-East Asia is un- available, current evidence indicates that in particular settings risk behaviour and HIV infection rates are considerably higher among migrants than in the gen- eral population.

Most of them acquired the virus through unprotected sex in the destination country. Response: Opportunities and challenges Every ASEAN Member Country has responded to the HIV epidemic\u2019s health and development challenges. Six countries \u2013 Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam \u2013 are currently implementing a total of over USD 200 million in HIV grants received from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) from its first round in 2001 to 2007. Several other bilateral and multilateral donors are contributing financial support to the regional response. National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plans and mechanisms to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic through HIV prevention, care and treatment have been developed in all ASEAN countries. These plans identify migrants as a distinct vulnerable group that should be includ- ed in the national response primarily through HIV prevention strategies. However, the response has focused on high-risk groups such as sex workers and their clients, men who have sex with men and IDUs, without addressing the mobility factor within these groups. Overall, national health policies and HIV inter- ventions in origin, transit and destination countries do not offer a comprehensive package of HIV pre- vention, care and treatment services that address HIV vulnerabilities and needs of migrants through all phases of the migration cycle: pre-departure, transit, destination and return. Recent studies have identi- fied the risks and vulnerabilities of migrant and mobile populations. However, operationalization of 10 HIV/AIDS & Mobility in South-East Asia Overview 11 12 HIV/AIDS & Mobility in South-East Asia Country Profiles 13 Discrimination against migrants, especially those with HIV Migrants are often stigmatized and face discrimi- nation in host countries, with HIV-positive migrants facing even greater discrimination and often immediate deportation if their sero-status is discovered. As a result, migrants are reluctant to determine their HIV status or to access other health services, increasing their vulnerability. Due to economic necessity, migrants will sacrifice access to treatment and services to remain in the host country. Upon return to their home coun- tries, limited support is available for HIV-positive mi- grants and their HIV-positive status makes it unlikely that they will have the opportunity to work abroad again. Recommendations 1) Develop gender-sensitive epidemiological data collection mechanisms Limited HIV interventions targeting migrants in South- East Asia have inhibited data collection on risk be- haviours and vulnerabilities in people on the move. This has hindered effectively addressing migrant needs, reducing their vulnerabilities and providing strategic HIV programmes throughout the migration cycle. Greater commitment to rights-based research and epidemiological studies aimed at accurately asses-sing HIV vulnerability, risks, trends and patterns along migratory routes is required. 2) Strengthen regional cooperation to ensure a continuum of services for migrants Effective coordination of the response to HIV and mobility in South-East Asia requires better cooper- ation among ASEAN Member Countries in trans- lating national HIV provisions for migrant and mobile populations into harmonized interventions and health policies that focus on HIV prevention, care and treat- ment services throughout the migration cycle. Lin- guistic and cultural sensitivity is important to an effec-tive regional response. 3) Create and fund coordinated, multi- sectoral, cross-border HIV efforts A comprehensive approach to addressing HIV and mobility issues across borders requires promotion of non-discriminatory HIV and mobility policies by relevant ministries, such as Health, Labour, Transport and For- eign Affairs, and also the private sector, which employs the majority of migrants. The allocation of resources, both financial and human, to improve policy coordination, and the establishment of multisectoral partnerships between the public and private sectors are essential.

The Ministry of Health pro- vides public health services through provincial health departments and operational health districts. From De- cember 2005 to September 2007, the number of facilities that provide ART increased by 60%; there are currently 48 facilities providing ART in Cambo- dia.28 In addition, the number of health facilities providing voluntary and confi- dential counseling and testing increased from 109 in December 2005 to 140 by December 2006.29 Prevention inter- ventions are carried out by non-profit organizations, and by private and public sector agencies, and have had particular success among high-risk groups, especially female sex workers in brothels. Despite national efforts to address the HIV epidemic, access to health care, treatment and reproductive health services is limited, notably in rural areas where most Cambodians live and migrate from. In addition, the significant epidemiological shift of the HIV epidemic to a larger population, including spouses, young people and indirect sex workers in massage par- lours, casinos and beer bars, calls for the adjustment of national HIV prevent- ion, care and treatment strategies to reflect new realities if low prevalence rates are to be maintained. Injecting drug users, men who have sex with men, youth out of school and internal and cross-border migrants are also populations of concern. In 2004, the National AIDS Author- ity set up a Mobility Working Group on HIV/AIDS, first to address HIV issues among migrants, and second to strength- en government capacity to deal with these issues. In May 2006, the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training issued a regulation, Education of HIV/AIDS, Safe Migration and Labour Rights for Cambodian Workers Abroad. Its ob- jectives are to raise awareness on HIV/ AIDS for migrant workers and their families, to provide pre- and post- departure training on HIV/AIDS, and to inform migrants on safe migration and labour rights.30 In 2006, the Ministry signed an MOU with CARAM Cambodia to provide training on HIV/AIDS to migrant work- ers, and an MOU with the Cambodian non-profit organization, Legal Support for Children and Women, to provide outgoing migrant workers with training on legal issues and migrants\u2019 rights.31 Migration patterns Cambodia is a major sending country of migrant workers to booming Asian economies, including Malaysia, the Republic of Korea and neighbouring Thailand.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0fafeca-c60f-4cad-b90d-78654b7f26cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0fafeca-c60f-4cad-b90d-78654b7f26cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV/AIDS & Mobility in South-East Asia: Rapid Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c7b7902ecddd0cf98cd455827a68e73abfc208d8f7f1601db05ba6f17f75b08f"}, "2": {"node_id": "43219daf-735d-42b0-aeb9-eacb6036d9b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b81d735cec615e3b23e34f576b8c4b94d7687ff662ef59e82ca6ba75d5663066"}}, "hash": "802d8959807d3d944bd905ddae8be4e1620e2691c4bfb59452af14d3f1e95693", "text": "From 1998 to 2007, 8,969 documented migrants worked in Ma- laysia, 7,042 of them women.32 An estimated 10,000, regular and irreg- ular Cambodian migrants worked in Malaysia in 2003, and 2,464 Cambodian migrants currently work in the Republic of Korea.33 In 2002-2003, remittances to Health and HIV situation It is estimated that there were 64,750 people living with HIV in Cambodia in 2007, out of which 3,350 were children under the age of 15.22 The total number of people living with HIV who receive ART has more than doubled from 12,247 in December 2005 to 25,353 in September 2007.23 The adult national HIV prevalence rate decreased to 0.9% in 2006 from 1.2% in 2003 following the successful implementation of the 100% Condom Use Programme and extensive infor- mation campaigns on condom use and HIV transmission risks targeting sex workers and their clients.24 In 2006, among the total number of people living with HIV, 52% were estimated to be women compared to 37% in 1998.25 In 2005, UNAIDS reported that married", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5c367b1-8403-484a-9f8b-ed16d1a28414": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5c367b1-8403-484a-9f8b-ed16d1a28414", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV/AIDS & Mobility in South-East Asia: Rapid Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "686d5dd4014303403a5c18c8790745b5c57cadbbce37412b5b7ea332bc91db62"}, "3": {"node_id": "be52e4c2-6eae-42f4-aa1d-0da6e072c755", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e3d6375a80ce6e2c199b96a5c4483ba69b8cff90ed2306a6da842a000ee5222d"}}, "hash": "39a58e35676ea75d798c4162f84ad2be1cc520e2fe7d8f2adaf43eb8a55b402d", "text": "women accounted for almost half of new infections. The sex trade has driven the HIV epidemic in Cambodia and female sex workers remain one of the most at-risk groups of HIV infection, despite a sig- nificant decrease of the HIV prevalence rate among this group from 21.4% in 2003 to 12.7% in 2006.26 National HIV programme and response The National Strategic Plan for a Com- prehensive and Multisectoral Response to HIV/AIDS (2006-2010) was developed with development partners, civil society organizations and people affected by HIV/AIDS. The Plan has specific objec- tives and strategies and an operational plan that involves all stakeholders, including the Government, civil society and the private sector. The Plan aims to reduce new HIV infections among Cambodia Cambodia amounted to approximately USD 3,177,600.34 Documented migrant workers to Malaysia and the Republic of Korea receive a three-month pre- departure vocational training course from re- cruitment agencies that focuses on reproductive health, HIV/AIDS and general medical exams.35 There are no evaluation and monitoring processes to ensure the delivery of such training courses and to assess their quality. Undocumented migrant workers, who are especially exposed to exploitative forms of labour in their destination countries, are difficult to reach with information on HIV-risk situations and safe migration. Porous borders, well-established local trans-border networks and economic inequalities have led to the extensive migration of documented and undoc- umented Cambodian labour migrants to Thailand. These migrants usually perform low-skilled work in agriculture, fishing, mining, and construction. In 2005, 181,579 Cambodians were reg- istered with the Thailand Ministry of Interior, 123,998 male and 57,581 fe- male, representing approximately 13% of all registered migrants in Thailand but this figure decreased to an esti- mated 37,142 by 2006 as few new work permits are being issued.36 It is esti- mated that there are another 180,000 undocumented migrants.37 Male mi- grant workers tend to stay short term in Thailand, while female migrant workers usually stay longer. Undocumented migration from Cam- bodia to Thailand is an increasing con- cern. Documented migrant workers in Thailand have limited access to health care and treatment services due to language and cultural barriers. Undoc- umented migrants, who are less visible and thus more difficult to reach by non-profit organizations, remain largely isolated from HIV prevention, care and treatment services. Poor living condi- tions and discrimination are just some of the difficulties Cambodian migrants face. Cambodia is a destination country for labour migrants, mainly from Viet Nam and China. The sex industry em- ploys Vietnamese female migrants, who are quite vulnerable to HIV due to their profession and irregular status. The country has also been a major host for Vietnamese asylum seekers and refugees. Cambodia is a source and transit country for men, women, and children trafficked for commercial sexual ex- ploitation and forced labour to Thailand and Malaysia;38 it is also a transit and destination country for Vietnamese and Chinese women and children for sexual exploitation. There is a lack of comprehensive information on HIV infection rates and risk behaviours among mobile popula- tions. HIV response for migrant populations: Gaps and opportunities Cambodia\u2019s commitment to address the HIV epidemic has translated into the development of impactful pre- vention strategies and expanded care and treatment coverage for those in need. However, HIV interventions and programmes specifically targeting mi- grant and mobile populations remain to be developed and the capacity of nati- onal institutions to address HIV and mobility issue needs to be strength- ened. Comprehensive gender-based data collection mechanisms and sur- veillance systems are necessary to de- velop evidence-based, targeted HIV interventions among migrants and mobile populations. Evaluation and monitoring mech- anisms need to be put in place to en- sure the delivery of good quality pre- and post-departure training courses on HIV/AIDS issues to migrants. HIV pre- vention, care, treatment, and support services for returning migrants are also required, as well as provisions that ad- dress trafficked persons\u2019 specific health and psychological needs.

HIV trans- mission between female sex workers and their partners is a cause of concern with 6.37% of female sex workers living with HIV in Jakarta (2003).54 In 2006-2007, the percentage of most- at-risk populations tested for HIV and informed of the results doubled com- pared to 2004-2005.55 National HIV programme and response In 2007, the National AIDS Com- mission launched the HIV/AIDS Re- sponse Strategies 2007-2010. Key ob- jectives include HIV prevention by targeting high-risk behaviour and vul- nerable populations, and providing medical treatment, care, and support services to people living with HIV. The Strategy encourages greater stake- holder involvement in the HIV/AIDS response; more partnerships between the government, professional organi- zations, civil society, NGOs, the pri- vate sector, as well as strengthened policy coordination in HIV/AIDS efforts at national and local levels.56 In January 2004, the Sentani Com- mitment was signed by Indonesian central and provincial governments to reach the following goals: promoting condom use in every high-risk sexual activity; promoting harm reduction practices among IDUs; providing ART to at least 5,000 PLWHA by end 2004; reducing discrimination against PLWHA; establishing active provincial and dis- trict AIDS committees; developing laws and regulations conducive to HIV/AIDS prevention, care and support pro- grammes; and expanding information, education and communication efforts, including religious instruction, to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS. The Commit- ment was re-endorsed in July 2005 by 14 provinces.57 To increase and improve access to ART for PLWHA, the Ministry of Health developed national guidelines for ART and case management, as well as policy initiatives, which are currently being undertaken.58 Indonesia has 296 VCT clinics and 153 hospitals that provide free ART, 19 of which run PMTCT pro- grammes.59 In addition, there are 20 referral networks for Integrated Man- agement Adult Illnesses.60 Weak institutional and human re- source capacities however, hinder nati- onal efforts to extend ART among PLHWA. National AIDS programmes reach a limited number of injecting drug users and sex workers with their HIV prevention, care and treatment strategies. Stigma and discrimination limit the successful delivery of any HIV intervention. Implementation pro- grammes face other challenges such as weak HIV programme manage- ment, uncoordinated interventions bet- ween partners and the limited capacity of the HIV surveillance system. Internal and cross-border migrants are recognized as a vulnerable and sometimes at risk group, but limited national capacity exists to address their HIV issues.61 The Ministry of Manpower and Trans- migration and the Ministry of Health have developed policies on medical testing for migrants that prohibit using HIV test results in recruitment. However, because in most cases destination coun- tries require HIV testing as part of the recruitment process, migrant workers undergo thorough mandatory medical tests, including an HIV test, under the responsibility of recruitment agencies before employment. In 2006, the Government accredited 119 clinics to perform HIV testing.62 Prospective migrants are not always Health and HIV situation Overall, the HIV prevalence rate of Indonesia remains low at 0.16%, but the HIV epidemic in the country has been among the fastest growing in Asia.39 Indonesia now faces a concen- trated epidemic mainly fuelled by in- jecting drug use and the sharing of contaminated equipment, unprotected paid sex and, to a lesser degree, unpro- tected sex between men.40 HIV infection rates vary in Indonesian provinces. The two provinces of Papua (Papua and West Papua) face a gener- alized epidemic.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b0b2ebf-735f-493f-80fe-35ec81bdda69": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b0b2ebf-735f-493f-80fe-35ec81bdda69", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV/AIDS & Mobility in South-East Asia: Rapid Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60fdbe0afcf94ef34f8f735ab3689894ec474a0ad349b1637a8be1d699e61c93"}, "2": {"node_id": "324804d0-7556-4040-902c-b85ad7bc15a1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f72c364b22e2b8523338c954f7ad96153c6765a45e0a5bd85dc16eed3e42dedd"}}, "hash": "19e39c54fc187f8078a487d3b88cd00bcbddd091b300030822a546cd5343a798", "text": "In Papua province, the number of AIDS cases is 15 times higher than the national average and HIV prevalence is estimated at ap- proximately 2.4%.41 Even higher infec- tion rates have been recorded in remote highlands (3.2%) and less ac- cessible lowland areas (2.9%).42 In West Papua, the number of AIDS cases is twice the national average.43 Currently, an estimated 193,000 peo- ple live with HIV in Indonesia,44 up from 170,000 in 2005, and 110,000 at the end of 2003.45 It is estimated that 46% of people living with HIV are injecting drug users (IDUs) and 14% are clients of sex workers.46 AIDS-related deaths", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa7ac6d4-fa71-4ddd-bfd4-5b08d15e54ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa7ac6d4-fa71-4ddd-bfd4-5b08d15e54ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV/AIDS & Mobility in South-East Asia: Rapid Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "debcae4c81450c19d49f3ccc48429eb4fc3c4f726202e3bbe0600766b3bb7cdf"}, "3": {"node_id": "e15dee5a-9cd4-4e0d-9d9a-f5659f24c8b9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30cd62ec266d71d9d0f083d0579dbe65797d502fe24fbe1468a711658b32c4ad"}}, "hash": "ac563a13f350e3449100192ddec2e2756549dd4796ee69d82a02fac2c86361d9", "text": "have also drastically increased from 2,300 at the end of 2003 to 5,500 in 2005.47 In 2006, 2,873 AIDS cases were recorded, 82% of them men.48 Every year, an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 lose their lives to AIDS in the country, or 8 -14 people per day.49 As of December 2006, out of the estimated 20,577 people who had an advanced HIV infection, 5,100 of them (24.78%) were receiving ART.50 In Papua, which presents a generalized epidemic, only 3% of people living with HIV had received ARV treatment.51 The number of women infected by HIV has almost doubled from 15,000 in 2003 to 29,000 in 2005.52 As of De- cember 2006, an estimated 2,563 Indonesia informed of test procedures or their purpose,63 and pre- or post-test coun- seling and HIV prevention and information services are not given to migrant workers. There is also no standardised referral system to provide care, support and treatment services to those found HIV positive, although there are currently several institutions in Indonesia that provide those services to PLWHA and that can be accessed by migrant workers.64 Recruitment agencies are respon- sible for providing health and reinte- gration services to repatriated migrant workers under the 2004 Placement and Protection of Indonesian Migrant Workers in a Foreign Country. Undoc- umented migrants or trafficked persons do not benefit from this decree. Mi- grant workers found HIV positive in destination countries receive no treat- ment or referral services before being repatriated.65 The Medical Service Centre (Pusat Pelayanan Medis, or PPM) of Raden Soekanto Hospital in Jakarta provides medical services to migrant workers and trafficked persons in cooperation with IOM and assists their reinte- gration to their villages with the help of a local non-profit organization.66 Migration patterns Indonesia is a major sending country of migrant workers to the Middle East and to neighbouring Hong Kong, Malay- sia, Singapore and Taiwan.67 In 2006, 680,000 Indonesian migrant workers \u2014 80% (541,708) of them female68 \u2014 were deployed by the government; 502,432 migrants (73.9%) worked in the non-formal sector including do- mestic work, and the rest in the formal sector.69 Government estimates of the total annual number of Indonesian mi- grants abroad was 1 million in 2007. However, because migrants are often deployed overseas for more than one year with not all of them going through official channels, the number of Indo- nesian migrants overseas at any point in time is much larger than annual numbers. It is currently estimated that 3.5 million Indonesians work overseas.70 Undocu- mented migration remains an issue with an estimated annual 150,000-200,000 undocumented migrants working abroad.71 In 2006, remittances a- mounted to USD 4.4 billion.72 Indonesia is a source, transit, and destination country for women, children, and men trafficked for sexual exploi- tation and forced labour.73 In 2006, Indonesia and Malaysia signed an MOU ceding basic worker rights to employers; this may increase the inci- dence of exploitative forms of labour among migrant workers.74 An estimated 150,000-250,000 people are displaced in Indonesia.75 In 2006, UNHCR reported 301 refugees and 265 asylum seekers in the country.76 Limited information is available on HIV infection rates and risk behaviours among migrant and mobile popula- tions from Indonesia. No surveillance systems are in place to monitor and evaluate HIV infections among this vulnerable group. HIV response for migrant populations: Gaps and opportunities Indonesia has shown commitment to address HIV vulnerability among mi- grants and mobile populations with their inclusion in national HIV preven- tion, care and treatment strategies. Policies have been developed to pro- vide migrants with health and rein- tegration services and to prohibit HIV mandatory testing during the recruit- ment process. However, HIV testing is mandatory in most destination countries as part of recruitment procedures and on-site medical exams often take place upon arrival. This raises concerns about the availability of care, treatment and refer- ral services for potential and returning migrants found HIV positive. Strengthening national capacities to provide migrant and mobile pop- ulations with quality prevention, care and treatment services throughout the migration cycle is needed. In addition, gender-based data collection and sur- veillance systems that target vulnerable migrant and mobile populations with strategic HIV interventions remain to be developed.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e15dee5a-9cd4-4e0d-9d9a-f5659f24c8b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "e15dee5a-9cd4-4e0d-9d9a-f5659f24c8b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV/AIDS & Mobility in South-East Asia: Rapid Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "debcae4c81450c19d49f3ccc48429eb4fc3c4f726202e3bbe0600766b3bb7cdf"}, "2": {"node_id": "aa7ac6d4-fa71-4ddd-bfd4-5b08d15e54ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac563a13f350e3449100192ddec2e2756549dd4796ee69d82a02fac2c86361d9"}}, "hash": "30cd62ec266d71d9d0f083d0579dbe65797d502fe24fbe1468a711658b32c4ad", "text": "Overview: 39 UNGASS, Country Progress Report, Indonesia, Reporting period: 2006-07, 2008, p. 9 40 Idem 41 Idem, p. 21-22 42 Idem, p. 10 43 Idem, p. 22 44 Idem, p. 9 45 UNAIDS/ WHO, Epidemiological Fact Sheet on HIV/ AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections, Indonesia, December 2006, p. 2 46 UNGASS, p. 19 47 UNAIDS/ WHO, p. 3 48 UNGASS, p. 19-20 49 Idem, p. 25 50 Idem, p. 34 51 Idem 52 UNAIDS/ WHO,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91cf50a1-1acc-4fb8-8c83-e182b0f644d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "91cf50a1-1acc-4fb8-8c83-e182b0f644d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV/AIDS & Mobility in South-East Asia: Rapid Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cafecb8287ef28dbad91c5eb6a16fa3f0aa24a75133b563e25475f7d3dc47afd"}, "3": {"node_id": "007f400d-aa6e-4de3-94ba-129143a25e87", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae814ec650955ce2f38bd1708c8e3661fe86a90778fece29421e1da43540d0db"}}, "hash": "a2b6592b32e282e2f3f5482d9cf29c3ebf33cdca1e5c23d1d59c5eb139ec4166", "text": "p. 2 53 UNGASS, p. 35 54 UNAIDS/ WHO, p. 4 55 UNGASS, p. 10 56 National AIDS Commission, HIV/AIDS Response Strategies 2007-2010, 2007, p. 20 57 WHO, Summary Country Profile for HIV/AIDS Treatment Scale-up, Indonesia, December 2005, p. 2 58 Idem 59 Idem 60 Idem 61 CARAM Asia, State of Health of Migrants 2007, 2007,p. 53 62 Idem 63 Idem, p. 54 64 Idem, p. 58, p. 61 65 Idem, p. 60 66 Idem, p. 61 67 CARAM Asia, State of Health of Migrants 2007, p. 53 68 Idem 69 Idem 70 Idem, p. 226 71 CARAM Asia, State of Health of Migrants 2005, p. 216 72 Idem, Source: Ministry of Manpower 73 United States State Department, Trafficking in Persons Report 2007, p. 118 74 Idem, p. 109 75 Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, Between 150,000 and 250,000 people still displaced by conflict in Indonesia at the end of 2006, Indonesia Country profile 76 UNHCR, 2006 UNHCR Statistical Yearbook (Annex), Indonesia, p. 1 18 HIV/AIDS & Mobility in South-East Asia Country Profiles 19 Lao PDR Cambodia, the southern provinces of China, and Viet Nam, which has a growing epidemic. Low levels of HIV awareness and limited access to pre- vention increase HIV vulnerabilities in Lao PDR84 and among Lao migrants. National HIV programme and response The National Strategic and Action Plan on HIV/AIDS and STI 2006-2010 devel- oped by the National Committee for the Control of AIDS aims to expand national capacity for universal access to prevention, treatment, care and sup- port. Priority areas include: expanding HIV counseling and testing services and data collection, monitoring, eval- uation and surveillance mechanisms; strengthening prevention campaigns; increasing condom use; and building capacity of implementing agencies. The Plan targets vulnerable groups, including sex workers and their clients, mobile populations, drug users, MSM and young people.85 Regarding HIV and mobility, the Plan aims to: raise HIV risk awareness among mobile populations and their families; provide pre-departure and post-arrival information and counseling at selected border crossings; promote behaviour change and increase condom use; provide confidential STI services; establish and strengthen voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) and re- ferral services; and build local authori- ties\u2019 capacity to support mobile popu- lations and their families. The Plan expects that by 2010, 5% of mobile men and their partners will use VCT services, 75% of migrant men will use condoms, and that STI pre- valence among mobile men will be reduced by 50%. In 2007, a Task Force on HIV and Drug Use was established to address issues related to injecting drug use and HIV transmissions. The Task Force is co-chaired by the Lao National Commission of Drug Control and Supervision and the Ministry of Health.86 Companies sending Lao workers overseas must meet receiving countries\u2019 immigration requirements.

Malay- sia and Thailand are the primary des- tination countries for Lao migrant workers. In Thailand, migrants from Lao PDR account for 12% of the estimated 1,284,920 migrants and de- pendents registered for the general ID card, and the 849,552 migrants reg- istered for a work permit.89 These figures do not include the probably large numbers of undocumented migrants from Lao PDR in Thailand. Long, porous borders and Thailand\u2019s demand for low-skilled labour make possible various migration networks for economic opportunities abroad. Lao PDR is also a destination coun- try for migrant workers, especially from Viet Nam and China. In 2006, 5,731 Vietnamese migrant workers worked in Lao PDR,90 while in 2008 an esti- mated 300,000 Chinese workers were in the country as well. The Lao population is vulnerable to trafficking due to high poverty levels and porous borders. Lao PDR is a source country for trafficked men, women and children to Thailand and a destination country for trafficked Vietnamese, Chi- nese and Burmese women and girls.91 HIV response for migrant populations: Gaps and opportunities The National Strategic and Action Plan on HIV/AIDS and STI 2006-2010 shows commitment to address HIV and mobility issues with provisions on HIV prevention, testing and counseling for mobile populations and their families. Pre-departure HIV information and linguistically and culturally appropriate prevention programmes for prospec- tive migrants need to be expanded, as do comprehensive HIV prevention, care, treatment, VCT and support ser- vices for returning migrants. To suc- cessfully address HIV and mobility issues, it is important to develop a more comprehensive surveillance sys- tem including gender-based data to target HIV interventions among mi- grant and mobile populations.

The Foreign Workers Medical Examination Agency is in charge of medical screenings and notifies the Immigration Department of the HIV test results; the Immigration Depart- ment then informs the employer. The majority of unskilled and semi-skilled labourers are women, and they are the ones that are tested and screened while professionals and expatriates are exempted.113 Health information and education programmes for migrant workers are not available through formal channels in Malaysia. Some NGOs work with migrants to increase their awareness of their rights and of health issues; however the limited number of NGOs and lack of resources available make reaching out to the large number of migrant workers very difficult. Refugees with appropriate UNHCR documentation are able to receive medical services at government hos- pitals at subsidised cost.114 As of December 2007, UNHCR regis- tered 39,094 refugees and asylum seekers in Malaysia.115 Since 2005 UNHCR has conducted HIV awareness activities, including the distribution of Health and HIV situation By December 2006, an estimated 5,830 new HIV cases were reported in Ma- laysia compared to 7,000 in 2002.92 AIDS-related deaths reached 976 in 2006.93 With an estimated HIV preva- lence rate of 0.4%,94 Malaysia currently faces a concentrated epidemic primarily driven by injecting drug use and un- protected heterosexual contact.95 In 2006, 3,127 new HIV infection cases were reported among injecting drug users.96 It is estimated that nine out of ten HIV infections occurring through injecting drug use were among men.97 While injecting drug use has been the primary mode of HIV trans- mission, new HIV infections acquired through heterosexual contact are on the rise, 17.5% in 2002 compared to 27.4% in 2006.98 Despite limited data available, recent trends in the HIV epidemic in Malaysia may indicate a decrease in HIV infec- tions through injecting drug use among men and an increase in HIV infections among women through heterosexual contact.99 In 2002, 63.9% of tested women acquired HIV through hetero- sexual contact.100 By 2006, HIV infect- ions among women and girls repre- sented almost one-fifth of newly in- fected persons in Malaysia.101 The 2003-2004 first round of the National Behavioural Survey showed that the HIV prevalence among com- mercial sex workers was above 5%.102 Mandatory medical screenings for migrant workers in Malaysia have shown that 0.03% of those screened tested HIV positive as of 2004.103 National HIV programme and response The National Strategic Plan on HIV and AIDS 2006-2010 concentrates on reducing the transmission and impact Malaysia information leaflets and condoms. In addition, a volunteer counseling and testing campaign conducted in 2007 reached more than 1,800 refugees and asylum seekers.116 HIV counseling, shelter homes and nursing care were made available to UNHCR\u2019s persons of concern infected with HIV. UNHCR provided financial assistance to refu- gees living with HIV and funded ARV treatment. The Government of Malaysia funds two-thirds of the cost of ARV drugs for refugees. Recently, the Czech Embassy in Kuala Lumpur provided UNHCR with USD 19,000 to implement a nine-month project aimed at reach- ing 1,000 refugees in Malaysia with health care services.117 Migration patterns In Asia, Malaysia is a major destination country for migrant workers from Indo- nesia, Nepal, Viet Nam, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Cam- bodia, Myanmar, Lao PDR, Thailand and Sri Lanka.118 Migrants represent almost 12% of the Malaysian popu- lation.119 Migrant workers are mainly employed in 3-D (dirty, dangerous and demanding) jobs.120 Latest estimates show 1.8 million documented migrant workers employed in Malaysia; 17% are domestic workers, 15% employed in construction, 36% in manufacturing, 9% in services and 7% in agriculture.121 Undocumented migrant workers may equal the number of documented workers employed in the country, although this is hard to verify.

HIV response for migrant populations: Gaps and opportunities Despite national commitment to addr- ess the HIV epidemic, several gaps remain including a lack of HIV pre- vention interventions targeting sex workers and their clients.125 The majority of HIV prevention programmes target- ing vulnerable groups (injecting drug users, sex workers and men who have sex with men) are carried out by NGOs and community-based organizations which face numerous financial and human resource challenges.126 While Malaysia has identified mi- grant and mobile populations as a group vulnerable to HIV, there is a need to increase their access to HIV information and prevention and to deliver services in a language that they can understand. Care, support, post- counseling and referral services for migrant workers who test HIV positive during mandatory HIV testing should be strengthened. The health situation and HIV vulner- abilities of migrant workers in the country remain to be substantiated with in-depth research and studies. To this aim, gender-based data collection mechanisms and HIV surveillance sys- tems that protect migrants\u2019 rights and dignity need to be developed.

The Plan focuses on the control and prevention of HIV, mobilizing resources, providing care and support for AIDS patients, and expanding peer education-based behaviour change programmes. The Plan identifies and prioritizes HIV interventions for the groups at highest risk of HIV infection: sex work- ers, clients of sex workers, drug users, men who have sex with men, and partners of people living with HIV. Mobile populations are also consid- ered a group vulnerable to HIV infection.

Burmese migrants remain the largest migrant population in Thailand. In 2004, 633,692 Burmese migrant workers were registered for work permits, 75% of Thailand\u2019s total registrations.136 The same year, an estimated 20% of Bur- mese migrants were employed in agri- cultural work, 14% in household work, 13% in construction, and 10% in sea- food processing and related indus- tries.137 Undocumented migrants are estimated to be twice the number of those registered. Burmese migrants who register for work in Thailand have to undergo a health examination, but are not tested for HIV. If considered fit for work they are included in Thailand\u2019s national health insurance scheme. They receive a subsidized rate for health services, are assigned a health provider and the same health provisions as Thai nationals through the 30-baht scheme.138 Those not holding a work permit are not included. Migrants face numerous language barriers throughout medical testing and at the time of results delivery, as Health and HIV situation In 2007, an estimated 240,000 people were living with HIV in Myanmar, with the national prevalence rate at 0.7% that year.127 Myanmar\u2019s eastern prov- inces remain the most affected by HIV. Recent national responses to the epidemic have led to a decline in HIV infection rates among pregnant women (prevalence rate of 1.8% in 2004, down from 2.2% in 2000), but infection rates among other groups, including female sex workers (FSWs) and injecting drug users (IDUs), are still high and rising.128 In 2003, HIV infection rates among IDUs tested ranged from 50% to 85% in Yangon and Mandalay.129 From 1992 to 2003, HIV infection rates among sex workers rose to 31% from 5%.130 In 2004, one in four FSWs were infected with HIV as were one in three IDUs.131 AIDS-related deaths were estimated at 24,000 in 2007.132 According to latest estimates, primary modes of transmission are heterosex- ual contact (65%), injecting drug use (26%) and contaminated blood (5%).133 Treatment, care and support services still fall short of needs, with less than 10% of AIDS patients receiving ARV treatment. The high incidence of unsafe injecting drug use and unprotected sex along well estab- lished internal migratory routes has contributed to the HIV epidemic\u2019s expansion in Myanmar.134 National HIV programme and response The National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS 2006-2010 is the first national response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic to use partici- Myanmar documents are usually in Thai and medical personnel rarely speak Bur- mese.139 Migrants found with unfit health conditions may lose their em- ployment status and face deportation. It is the employer\u2019s decision to retain migrants or renew their employment. There is no indication that Myanmar provides care, treatment and support for returning migrant workers. HIV testing of returning migrants is man- datory and exposes HIV-positive mi- grants to stigma and discrimination. There are internally displaced persons in nine border camps at the Thai- Burmese borders. As of October 2006, an estimated 500,000 people were internally displaced.140 There is limited comprehensive information on HIV in- fection rates among displaced people and refugees, who are located pri- marily at the Thai-Burmese border and in Thailand. An estimated 200,000 Burmese are refugees in neighbouring countries.141 Thailand hosts a large number of them. Cases of trafficking have also been reported. Myanmar is a source country for trafficked men, women and children to Thailand, China, Bangladesh, Ma- laysia, the Republic of Korea and Macau.142 Myanmar is also a transit country for trafficked persons from China to Thailand, Malaysia, and Sing- apore.143 Some information on HIV infection among Burmese migrants is available. In 2001, an estimated 1.4% of Burmese migrants from a surveillance sample tested HIV positive in the Thai province of Samut Sakhorn.144 In 2004, 9.4% of tested Burmese fishermen were found HIV positive in the Thai province of Chumporn. This represents the highest HIV infection rate among fishermen found in any provincial surveillance site in Thailand.145 Unprotected sex between migrants and sex workers is believed to be the primary mode of HIV transmission.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7ffaa1d-9783-4e46-be4e-a6d7182f991f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b7ffaa1d-9783-4e46-be4e-a6d7182f991f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV/AIDS & Mobility in South-East Asia: Rapid Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ec12989e781f87050f33005fb23e2f8d714b271b3c36d1bf0eb697b1963bbd7"}, "2": {"node_id": "11aebc7e-99d0-4404-b73d-fb156a14a850", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f4acde25dba171795e30a251b51d1f21838fac9bbb25e6f1d659386be58f3f1b"}}, "hash": "2a8fdd5049dcdb386b2ab7db4eb2e93c888b5bc4d058dd80088919ea4ab1642c", "text": "Limited access to condoms and low condom use by mi- grants due to lack of information, famil- iarity and trust increase HIV risks.146 HIV response for migrant populations: Gaps and opportunities In Myanmar, there is a need to develop linguistically and culturally appropriate pre-departure HIV information and prevention programmes, as well as counseling and referral services for returning migrants.

The Plan includes a new push to expand universal access to HIV prevention, care and treatment among highly vulnerable groups, in- cluding FSWs and their clients, IDUs, MSM, and OFWs. The national strategy against HIV includes mobilizing and involving all sectors including the Catholic Church, continuing implementation of surveil- lance and research systems on the HIV epidemic, and focusing on local HIV interventions.160 Now, 32 public VCT centres are available with trained staff. Full implementation of the AIDS component of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) has boosted the country\u2019s prevention, treatment and care programmes. Ge- neric ARV drugs are provided free of charge to adults and children living with HIV. The expansion of GFATM sites has broadened service coverage to people most likely to be exposed to HIV. Through UNICEF, the Filipino Government has procured 20 million pesos (about USD 400,000) of additional ARV for opportunistic infec- tions and diagnostic reagents. Chal- lenges remain in assuring continuum of prevention and care interventions in a decentralized setting and in having enough well-trained personnel despite the ongoing \u201cbrain-drain\u201d in the health sector.161 HIV prevention and education have long been mandatory for overseas workers.

Pre - departure and post-arrival prevention and care programmes need to be further devel- oped. Migration patterns International migration is an integral part of the Government\u2019s poverty alle- viation programme. The Philippine Over- seas Employment Administration reports that in 2006, 1,092,055 Filipinos were employed abroad, 24% of them sea- based.165 This is a 10% increase com- pared to 2005.166 There are an estimated 3.6 million contract workers overseas at any point in time working in more than 160 countries, with an additional 1.3 million undocumented Filipinos working abroad.167 The Philippines received an estimated USD 12.8 billion in remittances in 2006.168 The Philippines is a source country for trafficked men, women and children to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Malay- sia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, South Africa, North America, and Eu- rope.169 Trafficking rings also operate internally with people trafficked from rural areas, such as Visayas and Min- danao, to urban centres.170 UNHCR reports 100 refugees and 40 asylum seekers present in the Philip- pines in 2005.171 The Internal Displace- ment Monitoring Centre estimates that 91,905 people were internally displaced during 2006.172 The southern island of Mindanao witnessed the most displace- ment.173 Little is known about HIV infection rates and vulnerability among internally displaced persons, asylum seekers and refugees. Recently, the Philippines Sen- ate proposed a bill, Improving Philip- pine Commitment to Human Rights Promotion and Protection by Pro- viding the Necessary Mechanisms for the Prevention of the Occurrence and Protection from the Adverse Effects of Internal Displacement and for Other Purposes (Internal Displacement Act of 2006), with health provisions for internally displaced persons with a focus on women\u2019s reproductive health.174 However, the bill does not ensure HIV prevention, care, treatment and support for them.

National HIV programme and response The Singapore National AIDS Control Programme includes a broad range of strategies to address HIV: public edu- cation; legislation; blood supply screen- ing; counseling and care for people living with HIV/AIDS; contact tracing and tracking; surveillance among high- risk behaviour groups; and training of medical personnel. Both government and non-government stakeholders are engaged in the HIV response, includ- ing the Ministry of Health, a multi- sectoral National HIV/AIDS Policy Com- mittee, civil society groups such as Action For AIDS (AFA) and the Asso- ciation for Women and Action (AWARE), and the private sector. Education is provided to both the general population and to those at high risk of HIV infection. Special education programmes are carried out for sex workers to educate them on STIs, particularly HIV, and their modes of transmission, and to strongly promote condom use. Educational messages on STIs, including the use of condoms, also target men who have sex with men and high-risk heterosexual men.181 The Health Promotion Board of Singapore (a Statutory Board under the Ministry of Health) carries out various prevention and education activi- ties to promote HIV/AIDS awareness among migrant workers. These include distributing information materials in various languages to foreign workers and holding group discussions and Q&A sessions. In addition, the AIDS business Alliance of Singapore has launched the Rallying Employers to Support the Prevention, Education and Control of STI and HIV/AIDS (RESPECT) in 2006 to raise awareness on HIV issues among workers and to fight discrimination against HIV-positive peo- ple in the workplace.182 In 2000, the Ministry of Health issued a new directive making mandatory HIV testing part of the health examination for prospective migrants applying for Health and HIV situation At the end of 2007, the cumulative number of known HIV-positive Singa- poreans was 3,224, up from 2,075 in 2003.175 In 2006, 357 newly diagnosed HIV infection cases were recorded compared to 317 in 2005.176 The pre- valence of known HIV cases in the resident population (aged 15 and above) was 0.07% and for pregnant women 0.05%.177 The male population is most affected by the virus. Out of the above-quoted 3,224 cumulative HIV cases, 89% were among men, 69% acquired HIV through het- erosexual transmission, and 24% con- tracted HIV through homosexual or bisexual contact.178 In the same period, only 2% of all HIV infection cases occurred through injecting drug use.179 In the first six months of 2007, 76% off all diagnosed HIV cases were detect- ed during medical care and 12% through voluntary HIV screening.180 At-risk groups mainly include female sex workers and men having unpro- tected sex with multiple partners, Singapore Overview: 175 Ministry of Health data 176 UNGASS, Country Progress Report: Singapore, Reporting Period January 2006-December 2007, March 2008, p. 1 177 Ministry of Health data 178 UNGASS, p. 1 179 Idem 180 Idem, p.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54263da6-25f2-48cd-ae1e-caa5a7bec607": {"__data__": {"id_": "54263da6-25f2-48cd-ae1e-caa5a7bec607", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV/AIDS & Mobility in South-East Asia: Rapid Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "429d31d806e464a7a37c8bdebebf32bac22985677c8ec139a6109b2dc75e5d31"}, "2": {"node_id": "36b2f96b-cf00-49d4-b87f-f8178541a8d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8587a05a428ae350e1b9d5da651a8b7d6bd9160359274b1330be0abc622183a0"}}, "hash": "872bc7efb2a776e656a888af2002c9ec37ed24e5502ca5a3a9bb9a388d8459fa", "text": "1 179 Idem 180 Idem, p. 2 181 Singapore Ministry of Health 182 UNGASS, p. 3 183 Ministry of Health, Singapore, Medical Examination For Successful Applicants Of Employment Pass,Long-Term Immigration Pass And Permanent Residence, News, Press Releases, 17 February 2000 184 Ministry of Transport 2007 185 The US Department of State Trafficking in Persons Report 2007 reports that women and girls from Thailand, the Philippines, China and Indonesia are supposedly trafficked to Singapore for sexual exploitation (p. 182) 28 HIV/AIDS & Mobility in South-East Asia Country Profiles 29 a work permit who have obtained in- principle approval for employment.183 Those", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "713a65cc-1b22-4f47-ad30-60f845b0a1b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "713a65cc-1b22-4f47-ad30-60f845b0a1b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV/AIDS & Mobility in South-East Asia: Rapid Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31d3b396f22d463f4e37687eb9af1c03990477ce74f156b2b22c91cf2926bf7a"}, "3": {"node_id": "d1832fc4-5638-4cab-9e4d-4a4f9260b9ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79e80447a33916ac53497f1106332b4ec7de2de1afb2cc4ab52e01c510a4f62d"}}, "hash": "3b162de7b2ac42257c45e75bda12a348f1eb4d1fcd0de6da439fa07fb9c431cb", "text": "tested HIV-positive are not granted employment passes and if identified HIV-positive in Singapore they are repatriated. Migration patterns Singapore is a destination country for migrant workers from South-East and South Asia, including Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan and the Philippines. While Singapore attracts highly-skilled workers, the country also employs many domestic workers, espe- cially from the Philippines, and con- struction workers. In 2006, the esti- mated number of foreign workers (non- resident workforce) reached 613,000.184 While cases of trafficking to Singa- pore for sexual exploitation have been reported, Singapore\u2019s investigation has substantiated very few of these cases.185 HIV response for migrant populations: Gaps and opportunities Singapore\u2019s policies and interventions do not specifically target migrant and mobile populations. Migrants have access to the same HIV prevention programmes, VCT and treatment services that are available to the general population. There are also HIV prevention and education programmes that reach out to migrants, with plans to continue their expansion. Strengthening HIV data collection mechanisms and surveillance systems with gender-based approaches and increasing access to referral services in Singapore remain an important con- dition to strategically address HIV risks and vulnerabilities among migrant workers. Thailand an estimated 27.8% of injecting drug users (IDUs) being HIV positive in 2006.192 National HIV programme and response The new National Plan for Strategic and Integrated HIV and AIDS Pre- vention and Alleviation (2007\u20132011), developed through a broadly consul- tative and inclusive national process, aims to increase HIV prevention efforts, improving the lives of PLWHA, and fighting stigma and discrimination.193 The Plan also aims to integrate AIDS prevention and alleviation strategies into organizations at all levels, to promote a multi-stakeholder approach in addressing the epidemic and to integrate prevention, care and treat- ment for all targeted population groups.194 Target groups include hus- bands and wives or discordant couples, MSM, sex workers and their clients, drug users, children and adolescents, and other groups such as migrant workers.195 Thailand has successfully expanded access to HIV care, treatment and support services for PLWHA and their families. ART has been included in the National Health Security Scheme and the Government issued two compul- sory licenses for anti-retroviral drugs. ART coverage now reaches more than two thirds of those in need.196 Thailand is considered a leading country in the region in recognizing the importance of migrant workers\u2019 access to health. The migrant health strategy developed jointly by the Thai Government and civil society focuses mainly on health promotion, preven- tion, treatment and care among mi- grants, as well as universal access to health, and the participation of mi- grants and communities in national responses to HIV.197 In addition, the Government signed an agreement for the Border Health Programme to provide health care, including HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment ser- vices to anyone living at the Thai borders, including Thais, migrants, stateless people and ethnic minori- ties.198 However, HIV prevention mea- sures for documented and undoc- umented migrants and mobile popu- lations remain to be strengthened. Migrants registering for a work permit in Thailand must undergo a health examination, but HIV testing is not mandatory, as stipulated in Thailand\u2019s National Code of Practice on Preven- tion and Management of HIV/AIDS in the Workplace (January 2005).199 If found unfit, migrant workers may lose their work permit and face deportation. Registered migrants who pass the health examination are included in the national 30-baht health insurance scheme, with health services available at a subsidized cost and assignment of a health provider. ART is not available to migrants at subsidized cost, often making the therapy financially inac- cessible to them. Stigma, discrimination and fear of arrest, especially among undocumented migrants, remain addi- tional hindrances to migrants\u2019 access to health services.200 Displaced persons from Myanmar, housed in 9 border camps at the Thai borders, are believed to receive health care. In 2007 they started to benefit Health and HIV situation The implementation of national strategic HIV interventions in Thailand since the late 1990s, including the 100% Condom Programme and the increased provision of care and treatment services for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), has led to a decline in HIV infection rates in Thailand.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1832fc4-5638-4cab-9e4d-4a4f9260b9ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1832fc4-5638-4cab-9e4d-4a4f9260b9ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV/AIDS & Mobility in South-East Asia: Rapid Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31d3b396f22d463f4e37687eb9af1c03990477ce74f156b2b22c91cf2926bf7a"}, "2": {"node_id": "713a65cc-1b22-4f47-ad30-60f845b0a1b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b162de7b2ac42257c45e75bda12a348f1eb4d1fcd0de6da439fa07fb9c431cb"}}, "hash": "79e80447a33916ac53497f1106332b4ec7de2de1afb2cc4ab52e01c510a4f62d", "text": "Estimates of the number of new infections for 2007 reached 13,936 and is projected to de- cline to 10,097 by 2011, which would result in the decline of the total cumu- lative number of PLWHA from 546,578 in 2007 to 481,770 by 2011.186 In 2007, 52.9% of reported adults and children with advanced HIV infec- tion received ART compared to 41% in 2006.187 Despite encouraging efforts that re- duced new HIV infections, the country still faces a generalized epidemic with a 1.4% HIV", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e1b2582-76c1-48f6-9d11-3f139cdc4898": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e1b2582-76c1-48f6-9d11-3f139cdc4898", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV/AIDS & Mobility in South-East Asia: Rapid Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe549d6f502b01d2113334dbffb2700bf3f4de9a88dde23291f488fb31d88672"}, "3": {"node_id": "a98936e4-2df5-468f-ac8f-a910cc15f575", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da9d905048e9b51f02165f0be3586bb6ae0e43b0609492ab50dca7337c14c6b9"}}, "hash": "172fe79523e3551bf9e2536f141bd8443c746d0dddf7f91834771cfaa81f718e", "text": "prevalence rate.188 New HIV infection patterns, especially among women in stable relationships who are infected by their long-term partners or their sexual partners, have been of concern. In 2005, an estimated 37% of women newly infected with HIV con- tracted HIV through sexual contact with their male partner, 80% of whom acquired HIV through paid sex.189 In addition, a 2007 survey of the Bureau of Epidemiology showed a high HIV prevalence rate among men who have sex with men (MSM), reaching 24.6%.190 In Bangkok, a recent survey has shown an increase in HIV infections among MSM from 18.9% in 2005 to 27% in 2007.191 Injecting drug use and the sharing of injecting equipment also remains a source of concern with Thailand from HIV prevention, care and treat- ment services from a government- mandated programmes funded by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM). Migration patterns Thailand is a major destination country for migrant workers due to its boom- ing economy. The International Orga- nization for Migration (IOM) reports that approximately 1.2 million workers from Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myan- mar registered for a work permit with the Ministry of Labour in 2004.201 Of these migrants, 75% were from Myan- mar, 12% from Lao PDR and 13% from Cambodia.202 Undocumented migration remains a source of concern in Thailand with an estimated total number of 2.5 million (including dependents).203 To address irregular migration, the Ministry of Interior registered 1,280,000 workers from neighbouring countries in July 2004. The Thai Government has ini- tiated regional cooperation talks on labour migration management with neighbouring countries. It has also en- gaged in bilateral agreements with neighbouring countries Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar, resulting in an elaborate system of temporary em- ployment.204 Thailand is also a sending country of migrant workers, primarily to East and South-East Asia and to the Middle East. More than half of Thai migrant workers abroad have been employed in Taiwan.205 Remittances from overseas Thai migrant workers may amount to USD 1.5 billion per year.206 Thailand has a significant number of displaced persons with approximately 135,000 residents in camps.207 Traffick- ing is also an issue in Thailand, which is a source, transit and destination country for trafficked persons. Large cross-border migration from Myanmar and Cambodia to Thailand poses numerous HIV prevention, care and treatment challenges. In 2001, a surveillance sample among Burmese migrants estimated that 1.4 percent (316 individuals) tested positive for HIV in Samut Sakhorn Province.208 In another study, HIV infection rates of 4.3% among pregnant migrant women at ANC clinics were found to be higher than for Thai women (2%).209 IOM, in cooperation with the Ministry of Health, is developing a compre- hensive national surveillance system to monitor and evaluate HIV infection rates among migrants and mobile populations in the country. HIV response for migrant populations: Gaps and opportunities The accessibility of HIV prevention and care services, and current efforts to include treatment for migrants and mobile populations is a leading exam- ple in the region that should be rep- licated. Current efforts from various stake- holders (Ministry of Health, civil society organizations, etc) should be strength- ened to expand coverage, including providing health service delivery in a language understood by migrants. Culturally sensitive and linguistically ap- propriate prevention materials and behaviour-change communication pro- gramming remain to be fully scaled up, as do peer education programmes to enhance access to health and HIV services among migrants and mobile populations.

It uses a comprehensive set of prevention, care and treatment interventions, harm reduction pro- grammes, and provisions for access to ARV treatment for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). High risk groups, such as injecting drug users and sex workers are the National Strategy\u2019s main targets. The National Strategy\u2019s goals include: integrating HIV/AIDS prevention and control into local social economic de- velopment plans across the country; reaching out to people with HIV pre- vention activities in rural, urban and mountainous areas; implementing a comprehensive intervention program- me to control HIV transmission from high-risk groups to the general popu- lation. It also ensures care and appro- priate treatment for PLWHA so that 90% of HIV/AIDS adults, 100% HIV infected mothers, and 100% of HIV/ AIDS infected or affected children re- ceive appropriate care, treatment and counselling services. The strategy also aims to provide 70% of AIDS patients with ARV treatment and to improve the surveillance, monitoring and evaluation systems for HIV/AIDS prevention and control.221 In addition, the condom promotion programme has been implemented in 314 out of 639 districts, in 58 prov- inces and cities and in Centres for Treatment, Education and Social Sup- port for IDUs and sex workers.222 In 2006, 228 sites provided VCT com- pared to 157 in 2005.223 However, major challenges remain in the national response to the epidemic. Legal regulations on HIV prevention need to be harmonized and imple- mented by key sectors at all levels.224 In addition, human resources and pro- gramme management capacities re- main to be strengthened and civil society organizations more involved in the national response to HIV.225 On HIV and mobility, the National Strategy aims to collaborate with neigh- bouring countries on HIV prevention and control226 and to expand interven- tion measures to mobile populations.227 In 2007, the Government Decision on Cross-Border HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control was approved and, like the other nine ASEAN Member Countries, Viet Nam signed the ASEAN Decla- ration on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers. Viet Nam\u2019s Labor Law stipulates that Vietnamese employment agents should provide migrant workers with orienta- tion prior to their departure. Mandatory tests including HIV testing are required as requested by receiving countries. No pre- or post-test counseling is ensured and breach of confidentiality of results remains an issue. Currently, there are 70 government-mandated hospitals that provide health testing and issue health certificates for migrants.228 Article 16 of the new Law on HIV/ AIDS Prevention and Control, passed in 2006, addresses HIV prevention among migrants, spelling out govern- ment and private sector agencies responsible for HIV/AIDS prevention and propaganda work. These include People\u2019s Committees, accommodation and service establishment owners, medical quarantine offices, and employment agencies sending Viet- namese workers abroad. Vietnamese migrant workers have almost no access to health information in destination countries, mainly due to language barriers and lack of infor- Health and HIV situation It is estimated that there were 293,000 people living with HIV in Viet Nam in 2007.210 The national HIV prevalence among the general population is esti- mated at 0.53%.211 Cumulative reported data has indicated that there were 132,628 HIV infection cases, 26,828 AIDS cases and 15,007 deaths due to AIDS as of 31 August 2007.212 Out of all reported HIV infection cases, 78.9% are in the 20-39 age group and 85.2% were among men.213 There are concerns that HIV infections among young people are on the rise as well as HIV transmission through heterosexual contact.214 Viet Nam currently experiences a concentrated epidemic with at-risk populations including injecting drug users (IDUs), female sex workers (FSWs) and men who have sex with (MSM).215 The national HIV prevalence rate among IDUs has been estimated at 28.6%, and at 4.4% for FSWs.216 In 2006, the HIV prevalence rate among MSM was 9.4% in Ha Noi and 5.3% in Ho Chi Minh City.217 Studies show that IDUs have en- gaged in unprotected sex with different partners, including FSWs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8319ae3b-5267-47e0-b659-ca0bebd536c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "8319ae3b-5267-47e0-b659-ca0bebd536c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "HIV/AIDS & Mobility in South-East Asia: Rapid Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f5bc04603aee953e118831bcfa21a16d74db97b7e5f8c0b3ddaec558b9afbf2"}, "2": {"node_id": "a44d8cce-309d-4460-88fb-bd0d3c063949", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hiv/aids-mobility-south-east-asia-rapid-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f54aa174a72d12d045833e49408c67a08549e8cff433c818eeaff035e05b6f5d"}}, "hash": "84c0cafd0005871f7b506cdebf0cbcd064daeab80070c7b94251e5cc2532c9f3", "text": "Unprotected sex between IDUs and FSWs reached 55% in An Giang and 54.8% in Ho Chi Minh City.218 The rate of condom use between street FSWs and their clients was low at 37%, and condom use among MSM remains also low.219 There are concerns on the high rate of FSWs injecting drugs.

Migrants returning with HIV or TB face discrimination. No medical, social and financial services are in place to help them reintegrate. The issue of referral services for migrants who test HIV positive abroad still remains to be addressed. Migration patterns Viet Nam is a major sending country of migrant workers to South-East and East Asia with Malaysia and Taiwan the top destination countries. The Min- istry of Labour, War Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) estimates that 400,000 Vietnamese workers were abroad by mid 2006.229 There were 37,941 recorded migrant workers in Malaysia in 2006 compared to 24,605 in 2005, and 22,784 migrants employed in Taiwan in 2005 compared to 14,127 in 2006.230 To a lesser extent, Vietnamese migrant workers are employed in the Republic of Korea, Japan and in the Gulf countries. Estimates from MOLISA refer to of- ficially deployed migrant workers; how- ever many have moved to bordering Cambodia, Lao PDR and China without going through official channels. Although there is lack of reliable data on the number of Vietnamese workers in Cambodia, it is estimated that at least there are 150,000 of them there. As in the Philippines, migration in Viet Nam is considered a socioeconomic strategy to alleviate poverty. Recent estimates show that remittances from Vietnamese mi- grant workers amounted to USD 6.82 billion in 2006 and are expected to exceed USD 7.5 billion in 2008.231 Viet Nam has become a source and destination country for trafficked men, women and children.232 Women and children are trafficked to Cambodia, China, Thailand, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic for sexual exploitation.233 Vietnamese women and children may also be trafficked to Taiwan, China and the Republic of Korea.234 Although substantive infor- mation on its scope and health risks is lacking, the migration phenomenon of Vietnamese brides to the Republic of Korea and Taiwan raises trafficking, abuse and HIV vulnerability concerns. Thousands of Vietnamese refugees are abroad and internal displacement remains an issue. UNHCR estimates that there were 374,000 Vietnamese refugees as of January 2007, one of the highest recorded worldwide.235 HIV response for migrant populations: Gaps and opportunities HIV and mobility issues have been rec- ognized in Viet Nam, but provisions on pre-departure HIV prevention, care, treatment, support, counseling and VCT services for migrants and mobile populations are lacking. Mi- grants and mobile populations have been included in the National Strat- egy, but specific HIV interventions among this group remain to be dev- eloped. Greater national efforts to mainstream HIV/AIDS interventions among migrants and mobile popu- lations are needed. Quality pre-departure HIV informa- tion and prevention, counseling, and referral services remain to be put in place. Referral services for migrants, and provision of HIV prevention, care and treatment, are also needed for returning migrants. As in the majority of ASEAN count- ries, expanding comprehensive gender- based data collection and surveillance systems on HIV infection rates and risk behaviours in migrants and mobile populations is an important precon- dition to strategically target this vul- nerable group with effective HIV/AIDS programmes.

Overall, programme activities have raised demand for prevention services and supplies, increased the quality and coverage of outreach and peer education activities, increased availability of testing, screening, care, treatment and support services, and reduced barriers to accessing those services. STI and HIV prevention activities to promote risk-reduction and risk-elimination behaviours through an \u201cABC\u201d approach (ABC refers to Abstinence, Be faithful and use Condoms), HIV prevention among injecting drug users and through strengthened health care-seeking behaviours. STI clinical services provide user- friendly STI diagnosis, testing and treatment, access to VCT and entry into the continuum of care. Care, support and treatment activities are offered to target groups such as People Living With HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and their families by the Government of Indonesia, NGOs, faith-based Organizations, private clinics and hospitals, and local support groups. In Papua, where the epidemic is different from the rest of Indonesia, FHI works on health and education programmes for communities and migrant workers in Mimika and its surrounding districts. Many employees of Freeport and its contractors return regularly to their home villages in the Central Highlands. While this enables an efficient spread of the epidemic, it also presents an effective avenue for prevention activities. FHI/Indonesia therefore collaborated with Pelni, the domestic passenger shipping company, to develop IEducation Communication materials and edutainment videos to be shown on ships for people moving around the province.

With minimal \ufb01 nancial investment, this initiative created a multi sector coalition of partners to design and sustain distribution of innovative anti stigma messages reaching hundreds of millions of Chinese by utilizing modern media and communication platforms, while generating over US $5 million in donated advertisement time. Harnessing the Power of the Arts and Commercial Media Launched in 2007, UNDP\u2019s innovative and groundbreaking initiative to harness a previously untapped potential in China \u2013 the Arts and Commercial Media Sector \u2013 had a simple goal: to engage and harness the potential of the Arts and Commercial Media Sector to increase access to a broad segment of the Chinese population, improving understanding of HIV and thus creating a more supportive and accepting attitude towards people living with the virus. UNDP initiated the programme by organizing the \ufb01 rst China Arts and Commercial Media Roundtable on HIV to help identify possible private sector partners and articulate the potential of their engagement. By understanding individual companies\u2019 market advantages and advertisement platforms, UNDP approached individual companies to participate in a speci\ufb01 c part of the initiative. In some instances, this required UNDP to \u201ccold call\u201d a media company\u2019s communication department and propose partnership on HIV and stigma. This initiative provided a welcome opportunity for many commercial media companies to be engaged in an HIV public service campaign for the \ufb01 rst time. The fact that the public services announcements with international and national celebrities were already produced and endorsed by the Ministry of Health or other government departments helped in securing commitments to di\ufb00 erent stages of the initiative. Working with a wide variety of government, private sector partners and community based organizations also reduced some of the bureaucratic pitfalls that slowed earlier e\ufb00 orts, in e\ufb00 ectively reaching a broad sector of the public with HIV prevention information and anti Background Stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV (PLHIV) remain a major problem in China. In a recent survey of more than 2,000 PLHIV in China, more than 40% said they had experienced direct discrimination due to their HIV status, with many losing jobs, being forced to leave school, or being rejected by their own families. In the same survey, 76% of PLHIV said their families had experienced discrimination due to their status. The rami\ufb01 cations are huge, as fear of stigma and discrimination leads many people to avoid HIV testing services, and reinforces dangerous stereotypes surrounding HIV that perpetuate misunderstandings and ignorance about the virus.1 Despite years of government and project based public information campaigns, understanding of HIV transmission and prevention remains limited: Most people still fear even casual contact with someone with HIV. In a 2008 survey of young people in six Chinese cities, four out of \ufb01 ve respondents knew that contaminated syringes or unprotected sex can transmit HIV, but almost half said a mosquito bite could transmit the virus, and some 31.7% thought people living with HIV deserved to have the disease because of their sexual behavior or drug abuse. In short, stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV continue to be major barriers to e\ufb00 ective responses to the AIDS epidemic in China by impacting behaviors such as increasing condom use, accessing HIV testing programmes, and disclosing one\u2019s HIV status to family and friends. Ultimately, stigma and discrimination are having a serious impact on national e\ufb00 orts to control HIV and providing treatment, care, and support for those already infected. To creatively address this national challenge, UNDP worked closely with a range of government, private sector and non-government partners to mobilize a coalition of partners with the aim of maximizing the impact of the advocacy activities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "428dad84-dc70-4202-9015-be8889d96e39": {"__data__": {"id_": "428dad84-dc70-4202-9015-be8889d96e39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-arts-and-media-aids-advocacy-initiative", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Innovative Approaches - Arts and Media AIDS Advocacy Initiative", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-arts-and-media-aids-advocacy-initiative", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b19fcf686072426d9ac98abfe7688cbfc6214b1fb4e5f0967d8bbc7d2d96158"}, "2": {"node_id": "60eb8044-586e-4f04-8693-8e8071155ca9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-arts-and-media-aids-advocacy-initiative", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f76828b41825876cbb30ad264ad9b6dd0d7cbaa8a4428804ce34a4b8cabd38a8"}}, "hash": "62278b45d922974e862045464f2f35a591985fe76061158f8b654edd0b10c9f9", "text": "The UNDP China Arts and Media AIDS Advocacy Initiative designed and implemented public advocacy campaigns which went well beyond traditional project-based advocacy campaigns \u2013 single-partner, project-based, short-term, 1 China Stigma Index Report, 2009 (see http://www.stigmaindex. org/211/analysis/china-2009.html Discrimination against PLHIV in China 65% said they did not want", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe89da49-f29c-472d-93ae-c726f6a4beec": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe89da49-f29c-472d-93ae-c726f6a4beec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-arts-and-media-aids-advocacy-initiative", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Innovative Approaches - Arts and Media AIDS Advocacy Initiative", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-arts-and-media-aids-advocacy-initiative", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c671a2def1a32a8691468375504f17715e14ff6a44a0ef1653e9c3beaaa1375"}, "3": {"node_id": "629d5c58-e159-4586-8ffa-0bb01e24cc25", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-arts-and-media-aids-advocacy-initiative", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2787bd75f17191bcb3dbeb70e951d0b8838b2537309d7cc90a87f54c32cabca5"}}, "hash": "1ea15c524ceec1cba1f8009153daf96a2b78f48ab396d3176f322c137b10fdea", "text": "to live in the same household; 47.8% would be unwilling to associate at meals; 41.3% would be unwilling to be a co-worker; 30% objected to HIV-positive students being allowed to study with healthy students Source: Xinhua News Agency, November 18, 2008 3 stigma messaging.

This UNDP initiative consisted of many di\ufb00 erent projects and multi-sectoral advocacy e\ufb00 orts, all of which centered on the use of media and public advertising to reduce stigma against PLHIV and improve public understanding of HIV. The initiative ran from 2007 through 2009, and included a number of separate collaborations, including: \u201cWe are Friends\u201d Anti-stigma media Campaign with NBA All-Star Yao Ming and Chinese \ufb01 lm start Pu Cunxin (2007)2 Activities included distribution of Yao Ming / Pu Cuxin anti-stigma posters, HIV information resource kits in schools, and multi-media information on Chinese trains, at workplaces, gas stations, universities and other sites. By working with the Chinese State Ethnic A\ufb00 airs Commission, the poster was translated into Uygur, Tibetan and Jingpo (Yunnan) languages and distributed throughout these areas. The poster and message was designed by people living with HIV and local university students. Partners included National Basketball Association (NBA Cares), China National Population and Family Planning Commission, China Association of Ethnic Economy under the State Ethnic A\ufb00 airs Commission, Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Centre (ADARC), UNESCO, UNICEF, ILO, the China HIV/AIDS Information Network (CHAIN) and several private sector companies including Total. The poster was placed in each of China\u2019s Total petrol stations, and on billboards across universities in Shanghai. 2 For more information visit: http://www.undp.org.cn/modules. php?op=modload&name=News&\ufb01 le=article&catid=14&topic=7&si d=430&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0 Arts and Commercial Media Roundtable on HIV and AIDS (2007)3 Activities included planning a strategy to expand public-private partnership around HIV anti-stigma education, the signing of an agreement with a local web advertising company for free space to distribute HIV prevention and testing information, and strengthening linkages between various public and private sector partners. Partners included China National Population and Family Planning Commission, UN agencies, Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Centre and MTV. Participants included a number of media and advertising agencies in China, Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS (GBC), Bayer, and communications departments from many more companies. \u201cLife is too Good\u201d Public Service Announcements (December 2007 \u2013 2008)4 Activities included production of three cutting-edge AIDS awareness Public Service Announcements (PSAs) featuring Jackie Chan, Pu Cunxin, and Chinese folk singer Peng Liyuan. Produced by Academy Award winning producer and director, they were developed in cooperation with the Chinese Ministry of Health. UNDP was able to arrange nationwide distribution channels forming a coalition of commercial media partners.

Beijing City TV Media has shown the PSA\u2019s on 15,000 TV outlets in o\ufb03 ce buildings, shopping malls and LED big screen displays. Towona Mobile Media reaches 200 million people daily via 80,000 video advertisement outlets on 50,000 buses in 32 Chinese cities.

There are a number of important factors involved in the success of this initiative. First, UNDP and its partners reached out to both traditional and non-traditional media, creating a much broader coverage and more \u201cmainstreaming\u201d of the HIV prevention messages. Unlike most public information campaigns in China, this initiative utilized commercial media and advertising methods, such as video advertisements on bus and subway transport, to access millions of potential new viewers. In most Chinese cities, bus and subway passengers are ideal captive audiences for public service announcements due to long travel times and tra\ufb03 c congestion. Second, both the message and the messenger were designed for maximum impact. PSAs were delivered by international superstars such as NBA All-Star Yao Ming, \ufb01 lm star Jackie Chan, as well as Chinese celebrities Pu Cunxin and Peng Liyuan, all household names in China. More importantly, the messages, designed by people living with HIV and young people, challenged viewers to accept PLHIV as people who are able to lead \u201cnormal\u201d lives as friends and family members, not as people deserving extraordinary sympathy or living conditions. The messages \u201cWe are Friends\u201d and \u201cLife is too good\u201d are simple and powerful.

First, it formed successful coalition of public-private partners, working with a broad range of stakeholders to design, launch and distribute innovative and cutting edge public information messages. The participation of multiple partners ensured ownership and sustained engagement by all partners. Public Sector Partners include the government, NGOs, CSOs, educational institutions, internet and new media. They help to bring clout and credibility, technical expertise, talent, local networks and volunteers, as well as access to distribution channels. In return they receive access to resources, increased visibility, technical expertise, international and national networks, contacts, and support for mission goals Private Sector Partners include media and advertising agencies, \ufb01 lm production companies, magazine publishers, companies, prominent individuals, and the internet. They help to bring access to distribution channels, in kind services or products, brand name, customer base, visibility for communications, advocacy, volunteers and funding. In return, they can generate technical expertise, brand recognition, increased sales, goodwill of society and social impact, employee attraction and retention. The UN System and its specialist agencies can convene a diverse range of partners, o\ufb00 er international expertise and groundbreaking research according to their individual mandates and core competencies as well as global networks and resources. In return UN agency supported projects bene\ufb01 t from greater coverage and impact of initiatives and a wider network of partners. Second, the use of media and art celebrities to be the \u201cface\u201d of these campaigns was a breakthrough for China. This engaged a much larger range of partners, especially commercial media and advertising, who understand that celebrity recognition is an invaluable means to attract large audiences. Third, this initiative sparked the innovate use of traditional media platforms (such as billboards and television spots), multi-media platforms (such as video advertising on public transport), and new media (such as internet search engines and websites). \u201cEveryone, including the private sector, is responsible for f ghting AIDS. A company should not avoid its social responsibilities.\u201d - Tang Lixin, president of EPIN Media 6 Finally, mobilizing a broad range of partners allowed this initiative to succeed with a minimum of UNDP funding. UNDP invested only US $75,000 for the two main campaigns and roundtable, but mobilized an estimated US $5 million worth of donated advertisement time on television, multi-media advertising platforms, websites and internet search engines across China. This approach was not without challenges, namely private companies were historically hesitant to link their brands and products with HIV information campaigns. However, two factors were pivotal to their acceptance of this initiative: the use of celebrities and government endorsement of messages. For many private sector partners, the endorsement by government authorities of the media friendly materials gave companies the policy backing, and partnership with UNDP gave them the opportunity and tools with which to achieve their own goals under existing corporate social responsibility frameworks. Sustainability Following the successful building of an Arts and Commercial Media coalition of partners, UNDP along with the Chinese Hepatitis Foundation, the Zeshan Foundation and the Chang Ai Media Project came together and produced a Hepatitis B (HBV) Anti Stigma public service announcement. By working with UNDP\u2019s Commercial Media partners, the PSA has aired on Chinese television over 4,200 times by end of 2009. The estimated commercial value for the airings will reach US $2.7 million (RMB 18.5 million). This includes television channels with national coverage and 14 provincial channels, 8 airports covered by Air Media, and 8 city bus systems covered by Towana. Based on the marketing data from these companies, the PSA is estimated to each over 700 million people over the next year. During the 2010 spring festival season, the PSA was aired through the railway media system\u2014 Universe Media (formally EPIN Media), a group running more than 75,000 LCDs on 500 trains. According to data from Universe Media, the PSA had reached a population of 118 million throughout the spring festival transportation season. UNDP\u2019s engagement of government, private sector and civil society partners has helped create a new paradigm to scale up public information campaigns targeting HIV in China. In late 2009, the Chinese Ministry of Health joined with UNAIDS to launch a nationwide campaign to reduce HIV-related discrimination employing the public private partnership strategy development by UNDP. The campaign culminated on World AIDS Day 2009 and utilized broadcasts of the videos and distribution posters featuring Yao Ming on more than 20 giant outdoor screens in 12 cities. More than 30,000 posters were distributed and the video was shown in hotels and websites across China.6 Working with the government of China, harnessing the innovation", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f237c586-1d06-4ed7-b4f7-f1b79f2412ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "f237c586-1d06-4ed7-b4f7-f1b79f2412ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-arts-and-media-aids-advocacy-initiative", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Innovative Approaches - Arts and Media AIDS Advocacy Initiative", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-arts-and-media-aids-advocacy-initiative", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7266761ae17ce0c64eacccbe4bd93aff8221a91b0129b38736a265cdbb4cc25e"}}, "hash": "7266761ae17ce0c64eacccbe4bd93aff8221a91b0129b38736a265cdbb4cc25e", "text": "and reach of the private sector, and drawing on key competencies from within the UN system, UNDP has demonstrated the e\ufb00 ectiveness of this public private partnership (PPP) strategy in China.

The difficulty in establishing a national response is that LGUs are largely autonomous; national policy is guidance for local governments and not binding. An assessment of the 3rd AIDS Medium Term Plan from the Philippine National AIDS Council (PNAC) showed that only 18 of the 48 localities identified as highly vulnerable were reached with preventive interventions while only 10 received comprehensive essential prevention measures. As of 2007, on-going projects supported by the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria (GFATM, rounds 3, 5 and 6) covered 37 cities \u2013 only 2 percent of the country \u2013 even though they represented at least 75 percent of the total national AIDS budget4. The National Capital Region, despite having the fastest growing rates of new infections in the country, still does not have a full-scale AIDS response. The reality on the ground was that while HIV policies were present, interventions to prevent and provide services for people most-at-risk, indirectly affected by, or living with HIV has been underfunded and uncoordinated. Technical, human, and financial resources at the local levels do not meet the needs for effective HIV prevention. Further, since HIV has traditionally been viewed as a health issue and not a development issue, it has been hard to pull in different government departments together and to coordinate policies more effectively. The country\u2019s ability to respond to and plan for the growing HIV epidemic has been seriously hampered by these two characteristics and the result of this institutional gap can be seen through the stunning acceleration of HIV cases. Addressing the Gaps To help better translate national policy into local responses, UNDP formulated a programme in 2008 that worked with PNAC and the UN Joint Team on AIDS to increase institutional leadership and improve local commitment to HIV and AIDS. The goal was to bridge the gap between national institutions and local ones, as well as encourage Local Government Units to implement local responses and ensure that they had the necessary technical support to be successful at it. 4 Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic, 2010, UNAIDS Background HIV prevalence is still remarkably low in the Philippines. In December 2011, 268 new cases of HIV infection were reported. Total cases in the country amounted to less than 8400 people1. With a total population approaching 100 million people, those who are HIV-positive still represent less than 0.1 percent of the population. At first glance, these figures would suggest little reason for alarm. Closer inspection though of the data proves that the situation is more worrying. The UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic in 2010 noted that the Philippines was one of only seven countries in the world where HIV incidence had grown more than 25 percent in the past 10 years. Figures in 2007 showed that there was an average of one new case a day. By 2011, this figure had risen to between six and seven new cases per day. This dramatic acceleration of new infections may just be the tip of the iceberg. Today, young people aged 20-29 represent six out of 10 new infections, and 96 percent of all new infections in 2011 were through sexual contact2. Unprotected sex accounts for nearly 90 percent of all transmissions and yet condom use remains stubbornly low. Based on the 2009 Integrated HIV Behavioural and Serologic Surveillance, condom usage among the most at-risk-populations in the country \u2013 men who have sex with men (MSM), female sex workers (FSWs), and injecting drug users (IDUs) \u2013 ranges from 11 to 65 percent. Likewise the country remains far off targets of key Millennium Development Goals (MDG) for HIV, particularly with respect to indicators 6.2 (condom use at last high-risk sex) and 6.3 (proportion of population aged 15-24 years with comprehensive correct knowledge of HIV)3. The fight to prevent this epidemic from exploding in the country is governed by Republic Act 8504 \u2013 the Philippine AIDS Prevention and Control Act of 1998.

The lack of a sub-national mechanism for advocacy and technical support was a primary reason that national policies were not being translated into local response and thus the Programme sought to reinvigorate a network of Regional AIDS Assistance Teams (RAATs) first established by PNAC in 2007. These teams would bring together three main government departments \u2013 the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), and the Department of Health (DOH) \u2013 and facilitate regional coordination and translation of national policies. 2. At the same time, a group of local AIDS champions would be identified in major cities and municipalities that the RAATs could tap in order to serve as technical advisors and support for local governments. 3. Finally, to address low awareness of the HIV issue at the local level and build support for the establishment of local AIDS councils and increase local responses, the Programme aimed to partner with the Local Government Academy (LGA) to integrate HIV awareness training in the orientation curriculum for all incoming local government officials. Together, these three approaches would lay the systemic foundation for sustainable local AIDS responses. The Work \u2018Leadership for Effective and Sustained Responses to HIV and AIDS\u2019 began in 2009 as the anchor component of UNDP\u2019s overall HIV Programme in the Philippines. It was Component 1 of a five pronged response to the expanding HIV epidemic in the country. Working with LGA as the implementing partner, Component 1 started by bringing together the three main government departments that would take part in the establishment of the RAATs. In two major workshops during 2009, the departments came together and made crucial decisions about the structure of the RAATs \u2013 determining what role the RAATs would play, the scope of each individual department\u2019s responsibilities, and how the RAATs would complement other initiatives. These workshops also sought to bring all the participants to a common understanding of the underlying factors contributing to the HIV epidemic and establish a baseline of knowledge necessary for meaningful cooperation on interventions. In November 2009, the efforts of the workshops resulted in a Joint Memorandum of Agreement that led to the operationalization of the RAATs. Under the leadership of Hon. Austere Panadero, Under-secretary, DILG, this inter- departmental memorandum was the first agreement on coordinating local HIV responses in the Philippines. At almost the same time, UNDP and LGA began integrating general HIV awareness courses into the orientation curriculum that all newly elected local officials undergo. The timing was ideal, since 2010 was a major election year, and the corresponding trainings would be a perfect vehicle to emphasize the importance of local programming for HIV responses. The Joint Memorandum, specifying the individual roles of each department, also led to greater clarity for local government officials who sought assistance in developing responses. As of 2010, nearly 900 local government officials have been trained by the HIV Programme. Equally important, the operationalization of the RAATs in all 17 regions allowed them to become a resource for local governments. The Programme worked with RAATs to identify vulnerable LGUs in target regions and potential candidates for local AIDS champions. This National Policy Achievements The Joint Memorandum Circular \u2018Guidelines on the Formation and Operation of Regional AIDS Assistance Teams (RAATs)\u2019 issued by DILG, DOH, and DSWD together was a binding document that covered the formation and operations of the RAATs; it strengthened the cooperation and coordination among the three departments, clearly delineates areas of responsibility, and provides a framework under which they can pursue complimentary programming. DILG and DSWD have both issued internal guidelines on implementing STI, HIV, and AIDS Prevention programmes in their workplaces. They represent the first department-wide HIV-focused workplace policies; DILG is integrating their policy into the employee health programme. Governments in Regions VI, VII, XI, and ARMM have issued executive orders mandating the establishment of local AIDS councils. 4 already issued their own policies mandating the establishment of local AIDS councils. In addition, 44 local AIDS policies had been", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a82f336-1941-4fcd-8afb-9840ddc83e4d": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a82f336-1941-4fcd-8afb-9840ddc83e4d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-decentralizing-aids-responses-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Innovative Approaches - Decentralizing AIDS Responses: Local Government", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-decentralizing-aids-responses-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b6f4095d73affcfffe158fa9633205747e9be9e385e32841993da0d7587d966"}}, "hash": "8b6f4095d73affcfffe158fa9633205747e9be9e385e32841993da0d7587d966", "text": "developed. While the long- term impacts of the Programme have yet to be proven, in three short years the Programme has successfully laid the institutional foundations with the relevant departments, supporting increased and deeper local HIV responses. The programme\u2019s ability to rapidly put into place broad institutional supports for local AIDS responses has been due largely to strong internal leadership and clearly defining roles and responsibilities. From the start, the Programme targeted key advocates at the highest levels within the relevant stakeholder organizations. Converting these advocates to internal champions proved to be crucial in pulling other decision-makers on-board. Having the Programme promoted from not only outside organizations, but also from influential people within the government was crucial. Champions at the secretary and under-secretary level enabled the Programme to convene leaders from other government departments that might otherwise have been difficult to engage. It also facilitated the establishment of a national Technical Working Group, bringing in high-impact actors from the breadth of stakeholders, including civil society, the health sector, and government representatives. National support has also translated into action at the local levels. The partnership among DILG, DOH, and DSWD in setting up the RAATs was made possible, partly due to the strong advocacy from national level leadership. Equally important was the active engagement of regional representatives at an early stage. The early meetings in 2009 represented an investment of significant time and effort by the Programme to define roles and responsibilities for each actor. By bringing together the eventual members of RAATs to help define how the teams would work, the Programme passed ownership of the RAATs from PNAC, UNDP, and any other national level departments to the regional members themselves. Future discussions could then be focused on programmatic concerns and not bureaucratic ones. Indeed, the Joint Memorandum that came from those initial meetings has served to information was then utilized by RAATs to provide more in-depth training and orientations to newly elected officials in 2010, following up on the introduction in the LGA curriculum. The programme also set up a website for RAAT members that provided a central repository of research, policies, and other resources that RAATs could reference and pass along to LGUs. Throughout 2010 and 2011, the Programme began a series of initiatives that aimed to contribute to better understanding the needs of LGUs and greater knowledge sharing. The RAATs served as a focal point for gathering information on existing local AIDS councils and their functionality. In partnership with the non- governmental organization ACHIEVE, the Programme supported a policy review of local HIV ordinances in two cities in Metro Manila, Quezon City and Pasay City, which recommended enhancements in the current policy environment and programmes for implementation among LGUs. Working with the University of the Philippines Centre for Local and Regional Governance, the Programme sponsored a study that resulted in a step-by-step guide for local governments in setting up local AIDS responses. At the end of 2010, the Programme sponsored the first annual C.H.A.M.P. (Catalytic HIV and AIDS Mitigation Programme) awards, which recognized the best local AIDS responses in the country. Winners received cash grants for local programming Factors for Success By first quarter of 2011, 99 new local AIDS councils had been established and 250 Local AIDS champions and advocates were recruited. RAATs were operationalized in all 17 regions, and four regional governments had Local Impacts Since the Programme began, 99 new local AIDS councils have been established while 44 local AIDS policies have been developed. This local presence has already impacted responses at the provincial and local levels. For instance, the provincial government in Cebu passed a resolution in 2011 requesting all LGUs to establish functional local AIDS councils. The Cebu City Council, also in 2011, approved a mass motion requesting that the LGBT sector be included in the \u2018Gender and Development\u2019 implementation being led by Hon. Alvin Dizon (Cebu City Council member and one of the participants in the UNDP sponsored LGU-MSM Dialogues), which lays the foundation for a broader Anti-discrimination ordinance in the city. \u201d There has been a great improvement in the last two years with regards to localizing the response to HIV and AIDS, because now it is really the (RAATs) taking action. - Dr. Ferchito Avelino, Former Executive Director, Philippine National AIDS Council Secretariat 5 \u201d \u201d and more relevant results. For example, in the planning workshops for the RAATs, important discussions took place that highlighted local issues and concerns that may otherwise have gone overlooked.

Further, in the Philippines, HIV has traditionally been managed as a health issue. It was clear from the start though, that for the long-term viability of the initiative, each partner would have to play their own unique and equally important roles. Indeed, each partner would have to see itself as an integral actor in the solution to HIV. Thus, the Programme worked to clearly define the expected contributions from each department and to undertake \u2018levelling\u2019 exercises with relevant actors. The impacts on the three government departments have been far-reaching; DILG has been the first Philippine government department to adopt a general workplace HIV policy, while DSWD now sees its role in delivering services to people living with HIV as an integral piece of its work. Working with multiple government departments can lead to bureaucratic paralysis, especially when dealing with a division of duties and responsibilities. In order to avoid this, a key decision was made to allow flexibility by setting leadership roles within the regional teams; rather than making it an issue for national level departments, RAAT leadership would be determined by individuals and interests by each team. The programme\u2019s willingness to adopt practices outside of the box has been key to its success in establishing new sub-national institutions. guide institutional cooperation on HIV throughout the country. Partnerships have also contributed to the success of the Programme. Identification and engagement of local AIDS champions has drawn heavily on existing partnerships between government departments, UNDP, and local community organizations. These partnerships have also played an important role in the provision of technical assistance and training to LGUs and in ensuring that local AIDS councils are operational and effective. The orientation training for newly elected LGU officials drew on the combined knowledge of both RAATs and local civil society organizations. Finally, the Programme operated under tight deadlines in order to take advantage of a favourable development situation. From its operational start in late 2009, the Programme recognized that the 2010 elections provided a valuable opportunity to expand awareness and build institutional capacity and structures. Building on existing orientation processes and the infusion of enthusiasm from newly elected officials provided the Programme with a significant edge in terms of gaining commitments of local officials. Lessons Learned In many ways, the \u2018Leadership for Effective and Sustained Responses to HIV and AIDS\u2019 has helped establish a foundation for HIV responses at the sub- national level. Through the support for government-led regional HIV response bodies and increased awareness and promotion of local response, the Programme has helped establish well-defined roles for different government agencies both within the Programme and outside of it. It has also helped lay the foundation for future coordination, and meaningfully affected the ability of LGUs to implement HIV-focused interventions. Through the course of this work, the Programme learned valuable lessons that can be applied elsewhere. Any broad-based multi-stakeholder initiatives such as those undertaken by the Programme require significant investment up-front in creating buy-in and ownership. While it may mean a longer lead-time before tangible results can be seen, it ensures greater sustainability Local governments are able to be in a better position to craft a more effective strategy because they know their area (and) they know how communities would handle these problems, and the kinds of vulnerabilities that are also present in their areas. - Hon. Austere Panadero, Undersecretary, Department of Interior and Local Government and Vice-Chair, Philippine National AIDS Council If we want to make Albay a liveable province, then we have to improve our health sector. We do not want to act when the problem is already there; when there are already many (HIV) cases, it will be more difficult. Is it not better to prevent it, instead of having to give a cure? - Herbert Borja, Albay Provincial Government Board Member and Co-Chair, Albay AIDS Council 6 will also require a more well-defined funding mechanism that includes cost-sharing among participating organizations; A large portion of the work that has been done by the Programme is awareness building and training of staff at regional and local levels, which makes staff turnover a significant issue especially amongst elected local officials. While the long term benefits of having HIV-aware leaders spread throughout the country is undeniable, in the short-term, the effectiveness of the RAATs and local AIDS councils will depend on continued training and support outside of the scope of this programme; As more local AIDS councils are established and more HIV responses are undertaken, there will be greater need for the systematic collection and dissemination of knowledge and experiences gained, as well as the implementation", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01be28fa-4ce2-41ec-a863-c2f7c3c98234": {"__data__": {"id_": "01be28fa-4ce2-41ec-a863-c2f7c3c98234", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-decentralizing-aids-responses-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Innovative Approaches - Decentralizing AIDS Responses: Local Government", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-decentralizing-aids-responses-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8723332d3add3f13494417eba558471068d7981a4e7cf6fcae2210b12082ec4d"}, "3": {"node_id": "47189bed-12fd-4b9a-a44d-ec1f77c3a7f2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-decentralizing-aids-responses-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ad101477fe5ccd3a59f6d345dd5f3569f2be96d87dcbc0a588e0e78e4b49b83"}}, "hash": "f8706c39d0b5d2c8e17400783af350af1489f60a02101fa08576be0530d98f7c", "text": "of a monitoring mechanism based on the national monitoring and evaluation framework. Successfully addressing these open issues can greatly support the efficiency of the sub-national institutions that the \u2018Leadership for Effective and Sustained Responses to HIV and AIDS\u2019 component of UNDP\u2019s HIV Programme has helped institute. The real impacts in the future will validate these activities, as the institutions are given time to affect local HIV interventions across the nation. Sustainability The value of the Programme\u2019s work in building sub- national institutions and advancing local interventions can already be seen. RAATs have been instrumental in facilitating dialogues between LGUs and local community groups focused on the most-at-risk- populations of men who have sex with men and transgender persons. These groups, the focus of a different component of UNDP\u2019s HIV Programme, have been mostly under-targeted and misunderstood in traditional HIV responses. However, the identification of local AIDS champions and the formation of local AIDS councils have given them a forum to express their needs and voices and become more involved in crafting local prevention programmes. There are open issues to be addressed, to ensure long- term sustainability of the RAATs and support of local AIDS champions and councils. RAATs are currently composed of representatives from DILG, DOH, and DSWD. These groups are not the only stakeholder departments, and there have been discussions about including the Department of Tourism and the Department of Labor and Employment amongst others. This will require RAATs to revisit composition, areas of responsibility, and issues of ownership and national reporting structures; the long-term viability of the RAATs Catalytic HIV and AIDS Mitigating Programmes In 2010, UNDP started the C.H.A.M.P. award to recognize some of the most noteworthy local HIV responses in the country and to set precedence to other LGUs. These responses exemplified strong leadership and successful multi-sectoral participation and partnerships. Beyond commending awardees for their achievement, the C.H.A.M.P. winners provide other LGUs with successful examples of local responses to reference as models. In addition, emerging C.H.A.M.P.s are also recognized for promising initiatives, often in the early stages.

Joint UN programming on HIV and the law provides a good example of the DaO approach in practice. The HIV epidemic in Viet Nam is concentrated in key populations at higher risk of infection, particularly people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers and their clients, as well as the spouses and intimate partners of these people. The Government of Viet Nam and international donors have invested heavily in the scale up of HIV prevention and treatment services, but uptake of these services is constrained by high levels of stigma and discrimination surrounding HIV and the behaviours that put individuals at risk of infection. For example, more than 60 percent of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Viet Nam are in an advanced stage of illness when they initiate anti-retroviral therapy, despite the fact that they are eligible for treatment much earlier in the progression of the infection. By this late stage, they may have been unwittingly spreading the virus for years, and serious opportunistic illnesses have set in. The 2006 Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control provides strong protection for the rights of PLHIV. These rights include: the right to live as an integrated member of the community; the right to enjoy medical treatment and health care; the right to be educated and work; and the right to privacy and confidentiality. Furthermore, Viet Nam is a party to many international human rights treaties and other international rights instruments. However, the implementation of the law has been limited: (a) there is a lack of awareness and understanding on the part of both rights holders and duty bearers; (b) mechanisms to uphold the law and protect the rights of PLHIV are newly established and require significant strengthening; and (c) efforts to provide HIV services to high-risk populations are significantly constrained by Background - Delivering as One in Viet Nam Legal empowerment and law reform is an essential aspect of a strategic HIV response, as demonstrated by the ongoing work of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law. In Viet Nam it is also a key dimension of the UN\u2019s engagement on HIV, implemented under flexible cooperation arrangements between UNDP and UNAIDS, using a combination of project and non- project interventions to maximize the strengths of and synergies between both organizations. Since 2007, Viet Nam has been one of the eight pilot countries for the Delivering as One (DaO) initiative, under which all UN agencies and organizations join together under one leader (the UN Resident Coordinator), one voice, one plan and one budget (the One Plan Fund) and one set of management practices. DaO is intended to improve the division of labour and coordination within the UN, with agencies and organizations specializing in their areas of comparative advantage and working together to meet the strategic priorities of their agencies in partnership and without unnecessary duplication. Within their respective comparative advantage, convening agencies are expected to act as a resource, identify opportunities for collaboration and contribute to UN as a whole. HIV and the Law Under DaO in Viet Nam Following the introduction of DaO in Viet Nam, UNAIDS was identified as the convening UN organization on HIV, while UNDP agreed to convene on governance, including rule of law and access to justice. In line with The \u2018One UN Initiative\u2019 brings together the expertise, experience and capacities of the UN agencies in Viet Nam to provide more coordinated and effective assistance. Through greater harmonization of its work and alignment with Viet Nam\u2019s development priorities, the UN is achieving more coherence, better results and greater impact \u2013 for the benefit", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3af385c-d694-458f-aeea-01ee3a67b3e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3af385c-d694-458f-aeea-01ee3a67b3e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-delivering-one-hiv-and-law-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Innovative Approaches - Delivering as One: HIV and the Law in Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-delivering-one-hiv-and-law-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28a0f5f5ef2012b3adce7ac2ad08072410a8bf7f8e6d8d5856ea0bf235cd8fdc"}}, "hash": "28a0f5f5ef2012b3adce7ac2ad08072410a8bf7f8e6d8d5856ea0bf235cd8fdc", "text": "of all people in Viet Nam. - Pratibha Mehta, UN Resident Coordinator in Viet Nam \u201d The Policy Advisory Team is a core part of our strategy to move upstream to deliver evidence-based policy advisory services. It has also helped us play our role under the One UN initiative to act as a resource to the whole UN system to strengthen the UN\u2019s policy advice to Government and civil society on issues such as rule of law and access to justice. In this way, the UN Country Team brings expertise to bear on the legal and governance aspects of all its programmatic priorities, without requiring each agency to invest in dedicated legal capacity\u201d - Setsuko Yamazaki, UNDP Country Director in Viet Nam 3 \u201d \u201d enforcement of administrative law that includes lengthy detention of sex workers and people who use drugs in \u201cmedical treatment establishments and rehabilitation centres\u201d. To educate people living with HIV on their rights under Vietnamese and international laws, UNAIDS partnered in 2010 with a local NGO, the Institute for Research on Policy, Law and Development, which was already working with UNDP to help law universities across the country to establish student law clinics to work with local communities raising legal awareness and giving legal advice. This project brought mutual benefits to the work of both UNDP and UNAIDS. The project supported law schools across Viet Nam (in the main cities of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City but also in smaller cities such as Hue, Vinh and Can Tho) to develop a \u2018Learn About Your Rights\u2019 training manual, and to pilot-test it through community law teaching initiatives. A core group of 12 active and committed trainers was established. The team included PLD staff, law professors, law students, PLHIV and staff from legal centres supporting PLHIV. Students who took part in developing the manual would travel with the team to other universities to act as trainers. About 470 people - including PLHIV, law lecturers, law students, representatives from legal aid offices and local stakeholders - were trained, resulting in strengthened knowledge among rights holders and duty bearers on PLHIV\u2019s rights and the existing mechanisms to protect PLHIV\u2019s rights under the Vietnamese legal framework. In addition, the resulting manual has now become part of the regular curriculum for the law clinics in all law schools, ensuring sustainability. 2010-2011: Know Your Rights In late 2010, UNDP and UNAIDS worked together to apply successfully for a UNDP Democratic Governance Thematic Trust Fund (DG TTF) grant of US$10,000 to carry out a \u2018Know Your Rights\u2019 on HIV initiative in Viet Nam. Under this initiative, the Institute for Policy Law and Development was supported to develop a complementary training material for women living with or affected by HIV (including female sex workers and female partners of men who inject drugs), and to educate 75 women living with or affected by HIV on their rights under the law on HIV. In addition, this ground-breaking initiative enabled those trained to make the best use of the legal protections that are available under the Vietnamese legal framework (legal aid provincial centres, legal aid clinics, etc.) to get information, legal advice and representation if needed. The training also supported women to acquire life skills needed to protect themselves from abuse such as decision making, communication or engaging in dialogue on matters such as discrimination at work, confidentiality and access to health services, etc. 2010-2012: Reforming administrative detention In Viet Nam, the Government currently detains people who use drugs and sex workers in \u2018rehabilitation centres\u2019 using administrative powers. In 2010 the UN Country Team in Viet Nam developed a common position on these centres, which is kept updated periodically, noting their ineffectiveness in treating drug addiction, the lack of due process safeguards, inadequate access to health care in the centres, and the effect of the centres in discouraging people who use drugs and sex workers from accessing community based health services, thus limiting the effectiveness of the national response to HIV. Currently Viet Nam is revising the legal framework for these measures, providing an opportunity for the UN to engage, advocating the UN\u2019s common position, bringing foreign experts to Viet Nam to discuss international best practices, and facilitating dialogue between the Law Drafting Committee and civil society representatives, which ensured that their voices are heard by policymakers. Now that the law is before the National Assembly for review, the UN has coordinated with Vietnamese experts from NGOs and academic institutions in Viet Nam to support key parliamentary committees (such as the Law Committee and Social Affairs Committee) and provide evidence-based advocacy on the negative impacts", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd75c42a-4bdf-49fe-9a0a-12a10886cd83": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd75c42a-4bdf-49fe-9a0a-12a10886cd83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-delivering-one-hiv-and-law-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Innovative Approaches - Delivering as One: HIV and the Law in Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-delivering-one-hiv-and-law-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8afdb994529f93d699a951e5ba8fcf7d2decf0def88acefb5d92250400a7b322"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d6cc298-3f95-430a-b663-31520b43e7c0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-delivering-one-hiv-and-law-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "651b5a6137f21f776a8bc3529d8d20cdfbc8c7664c5902d77db5a7913005adf1"}}, "hash": "2ce7b414b53c930748bd63712ddc1b9f7dfff6e597a7c5c93d11419bce78d027", "text": "of the current system of administrative From UNDP\u2019s perspective, it enabled a deeper engagement with the university law clinic network to develop their skills through a \u2018learning by doing approach\u2019.

UNAIDS has strong partnerships with the Viet Nam Authority for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control (VAAC), the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, and civil society organizations working in the HIV and AIDS field and self-help groups of PLHIV. Working together, each agency has access to a wider range of partnerships, from central policy-makers down to the grassroots, while delivering a clear and coherent message to each, and the UN can use its convening power more effectively over a broader reach of stakeholders. Flexibility without bureaucracy: Within the Delivering as One pilot, UN agencies can come together quickly to deliver coherent multi-sectoral policy advice. A clearer channel for policy advice: the combined effect of these advantages is that the UN in Viet Nam draws on a stronger pool of specialized expertise in a better-coordinated way to deliver a more coherent message to a wider set of stakeholders. As a result, the UN in Viet Nam delivers better policy advice, more effectively and flexibly. Replicating the Model Eslewhere Although the \u2018One UN\u2019 principles underlying the DaO initiative provided a valuable impetus to develop the new approach and to ensure the cooperation of all UN agencies, the same approach can be successfully adopted in other country contexts. In fact, the approach has been based entirely on recognition among UN agencies of the synergies of cooperation focused on an agreed division of labour based on comparative advantage and in-country capacities. Another key factor was UNDP\u2019s initiative to recruit a Rule of Law and Access to Justice policy advisor and make that advisor available as a resource to other UN organizations. If UNDP\u2019s legal expertise had been programmed or \u2018locked\u2019 inside specific nationally-executed projects, directly answerable to a government agency rather than to UNDP, it would have been more difficult to develop this flexible approach successfully. We believe that the lessons learned in Viet Nam are valuable for all country offices, irrespective of the future course of DaO as a whole. UNDP, and the UN more generally, are strategically moving upstream to focus on policy advice, especially in middle-income countries where donor support has moved beyond basic infrastructure and technical capacity-building and where bilateral donors are withdrawing. Therefore, the detention on PLHIV and key populations at higher risk of infection. UNDP has been proactive in building a \u2018One UN\u2019 approach to this engagement with the government and National Assembly, helping to build a consistent and coordinated strategy under which many agencies (including UNDP, UNODC, UNICEF, WHO, UNFPA and UNAIDS) speak to multiple partners with a single message. The resulting draft legislation includes many improvements, such as the abolition of detention for sex workers and the introduction of due process for all cases of administrative detention. 2011-2012 \u2013 Strengthening legal advice services for PLHIV In 2011, UNDP and UNAIDS again collaborated in securing UNDP HIV TTF (US$70,000) funding for a further project, building on the \u2018Know Your Rights\u2019 project as well as implementing key recommendations of the Asia Pacific Regional Dialogue of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law in Viet Nam. The new project has three components: An assessment of legal aid services for PLHIV in Viet Nam, to better understand the kinds of services needed and offered (information, referral, advice, representation), including the most frequent rights violations encountered by PLHIV; the remedies commonly used to resolve those violations; and obstacles to effectively access them.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d6cc298-3f95-430a-b663-31520b43e7c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d6cc298-3f95-430a-b663-31520b43e7c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-delivering-one-hiv-and-law-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Innovative Approaches - Delivering as One: HIV and the Law in Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-delivering-one-hiv-and-law-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8afdb994529f93d699a951e5ba8fcf7d2decf0def88acefb5d92250400a7b322"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd75c42a-4bdf-49fe-9a0a-12a10886cd83", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-delivering-one-hiv-and-law-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ce7b414b53c930748bd63712ddc1b9f7dfff6e597a7c5c93d11419bce78d027"}}, "hash": "651b5a6137f21f776a8bc3529d8d20cdfbc8c7664c5902d77db5a7913005adf1", "text": "Building on the key findings and recommendations from the assessment, capacity enhancement of the legal community in order to increase the quality of the legal aid services delivered.

Advantages of the One UN Approach Each agency focuses on comparative advantage while contributing to global programmatic goals, avoiding fragmented or overlapping programming. For instance, while UNDP has no HIV programming of its own in Viet Nam, it is able to ensure that the global priorities of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law are addressed in the country by working with UNAIDS and other agencies to develop effective programming on law reform and legal empowerment of PLHIV. At the same time, UNAIDS can ensure that access to justice dimensions and other critical enablers are fully reflected in its work. In this way, technical expertise within each agency is deployed strategically to benefit the UN as a whole. 5 UN\u2019s role in policy support becomes even more critical. Traditional project frameworks (multi-year, one implementing partner, fixed budget, fixed objectives) are challenging vehicles for policy advocacy. Relationships with different counterparts need to be strategically leveraged under the architecture of an overall cross- agency vision for policy engagement. And to support that architecture, policy advisory expertise placed in country offices and support from regional services centres in key areas (including governance, health and HIV) can play a key role in identifying emerging opportunities, drawing together the strands of an effective policy analysis, catalyzing a successful multi- Lessons Learned The UN\u2019s experience in Viet Nam suggests that successful advocacy for policy change requires: Flexible engagement with different stakeholders (government agencies, at central and local levels, parliament, academia, civil society) who may have different roles in influencing policy, and different incentives to support change; Flexibility to react to changes (whether positive or negative) in the political environment, to follow emerging opportunities and shift strategic responses accordingly; A multi-sectoral approach that addresses the different dimensions of policy change across different sectors and that monitors at an overall level how developments in particular sectors may impact the overall environment for policy change.

At the same time, reverse trends are emerging in some of the low prevalence categorized states (Rajasthan, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal) pointing to a continuously changing distribution of the HIV epidemic in India. The primary drivers of the HIV epidemic in India are unprotected paid sex/commercial sex work, injecting drug use, and unprotected anal sex between men. The efforts to prevent this epidemic from becoming generalized in the country have been governed by the National AIDS Control Organisation (DAC) under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), Government of India (GoI). The efforts of the government are supported by international donor agencies such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) amongst others and civil society/ community organizations. The Work In 2004, the government accorded the highest level of political support for the fight against HIV by establishing a National Council on AIDS (NCA) presided over by the Prime Minister, and the Council of Ministers, to initiate a multi sectoral response to HIV in the country. Through the NCA, the Government aimed to provide an opportunity to mitigate the negative impact of HIV on PLHIV by promoting social protection, which plays a critical role in helping people overcome the structural inequalities including socioeconomic challenges that drive the HIV epidemic and serve as barriers to treatment, testing, schooling and other essential services. It is particularly relevant to HIV because of its potential to address issues such as gender inequality, stigma and discrimination, which exacerbate marginalization and vulnerability faced by marginalised populations at higher risk of infection. In keeping with the Government\u2019s thrust on multi sectoral response, the third National AIDS Control Programme (NACP III) adopted mainstreaming and partnerships as one of its core strategies. One of the steps to achieve this was the agreement between various international donor agencies, government organizations and DAC (a division of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India (GoI)) to mainstream HIV issues in all the ministries and departments in five states of India, namely Bihar, Chhattisgarh Orissa, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh to provide leadership to mount a multi-sectoral response to HIV in the country during 2008-12 (NACPIII). The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) played a vital role by providing technical and financial support at both the national and state level to DAC and SACS to express their commitment and Background Although HIV remains one of the world\u2019s most serious development challenges, global solidarity in the HIV response continues to generate extraordinary health and development gains. However, the context in which the HIV epidemic continues to expand in countries around the world is one of growing polarization between the very rich and the very poor, increasing the isolation of some segments of the population and increasing social inequalities. India is no exception as communities and households already living on the edge have been made more vulnerable by the complex consequences of HIV and AIDS.1 As per the UNDP/DAC/NCAER study on socio economic impact of HIV in India (2006), the most visible impact of HIV at the household level is the financial burden on families of the people living with HIV. Loss of life and decreased human capacities due to HIV related illness and death have worsened the economic condition of households especially those with fewer resources, thereby contributing to poverty and inequality.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a0cea86-3d15-42c9-b1d3-7ea36d933e31": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a0cea86-3d15-42c9-b1d3-7ea36d933e31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-hiv-sensitive-social-protection-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Innovative Approaches - HIV-Sensitive Social Protection in India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-hiv-sensitive-social-protection-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5dfbfd66f39eac1d281b0f97f335c81fe3980cb481e73ec46465af9f3a791f3c"}, "2": {"node_id": "98d65c9b-2895-4d08-9d7f-cee36ea7a22b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-hiv-sensitive-social-protection-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "55a09d437406b24ee210ffdf5e5af6c71d1462d80fe80136fc45bece5a658d7f"}}, "hash": "14b859d52962fb6d4ee6ac1a9e33e376bec07b6ab6482bc5b92757b871ba1c70", "text": "Besides poverty, the linking of HIV to sex and sexuality and drug use triggers a widespread stigma and discrimination towards those living with and affected by HIV.

In India, the HIV and AIDS epidemic is showing a declining trend, with an estimated 2.31 million Indians living with HIV with an adult prevalence rate of 0.34%2. This is lower than many other countries yet it is still one of the countries with the world third largest population of people living with HIV (PLHIV). HIV is diversely spread across states and districts in India with six high prevalence states, namely, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, 1 Social Protection in the Era of HIV and AIDS Examining the Role of Food- Based Interventions Kara Greenblott 2 National AIDS Control Organisation 3 provide a direction and framework for initiating HIV mainstreaming strategy. Towards this end, Mainstreaming Resource Units (MRU) were set up at national and state level to ensure a more comprehensive response to HIV across different sectors, by equipping ministries, state governments and NGOs with the expertise and resources to reach information and services to those who are most vulnerable to HIV, including key affected populations, poor people, women and migrants. This has helped to strengthen the policy environment and has resulted in the availability of several social protection schemes such as pension, nutrition, livelihood, shelter and travel concessions amongst others, and improving the life conditions of PLHIV across several regions of India. State Mainstreaming Units (SMU) within respective SACS and Mainstreaming Resource Units (MRU) were formed in the respective states. Pact of various government and private organizations to mainstream the HIV and AIDS issue in the concerned ministries and departments. A nodal officer was identified, whom was later on appointed in specific departments. Preparing the ground: To prepare the ground and facilitate the transfer of these schemes, preparatory activities were undertaken as listed below: Sensitization and advocacy activities: Sensitisation sessions with various ministries/departments were useful to enhance the understanding of the problems faced by PLHIV and how they can be addressed by concerned authorities. Similar exercises were conducted at the district level as well. The data presented at these sessions included the socio- economic profile, age and the number of people living with HIV. This gave a clear picture of the epidemic in the state and was thought- provoking for the decision makers. This was useful in creating an enabling environment to facilitate the transfer of social protection schemes. The list of specific schemes being offered by these ministries and how they could meet the needs of the PLHIV was also part of the presentations. Consistent advocacy efforts with the support of positive networks and NGOs helped to sustain the momentum created by sensitization sessions. . HIV-positive speakers share their experiences, which made a definite impact especially on policy makers. This was one of the most effective strategies used by Mainstreaming Units. Initiation of the Process The Principal Health & Family Welfare secretary wrote a letter to the identified key departments for the mainstreaming of suitable existing schemes for PLHIV. Sensitization and advocacy meetings with stakeholders: policy makers from ministries and department, media , lawyers and human rights activists. Building capacity & forging partnerships with NGOs and positive networks. Sensitizing paralegal workers and human rights law network: Advocacy with paralegal bodies and human rights activists enhanced their understanding of the legal issues being faced by PLHIV. These efforts resulted in lawyers deciding to provide free legal aid to PLHIV to secure the social protection schemes. PLHIV too became aware of their rights and the use of legal system to claim their rights. Building capacity of PLHIV networks: Building capacity of PLHIV networks at the state and district levels empowered them to develop proposals and advocate for their needs. They reviewed and addressed the barriers and make the scheme more suitable to the local needs of the users. Partnering with the media: Engaging the media promoted sensitive reporting, and awareness amongst key stakeholders on issues faced by PLHIV. This created a conducive environment and helped in facilitating the availability of social protection schemes and mitigating stigma and discrimination faced by PLHIV. Engaging NGOs: Another strategy that has worked for mainstreaming of social protection schemes is the engagement of NGOs. They provide support in terms of training, capacity building, raising awareness amongst positive networks vis-a-vis schemes, help with the development of proposals and present them to the various ministries. In some states they have taken on the role of SMUs as in Rajasthan.

They play a crucial role in developing specific schemes as per the need of PLHIV. They also support the positive networks towards the development of proposals. 4 record of social protection schemes and some states in the recent past have intensified their efforts. The initiation of the process to make the schemes available for PLHIV is mostly led by the SACS and the SMUs along with positive networks and NGOs. The schemes are identified based on the needs of PLHIV. Then proposals are drawn up, which state the purpose, the suitability, the necessary amendments and the financial outflow on the department. The same is then shared with the relevant ministries through the nodal officers and followed up through regular advocacy with the concerned stakeholders by the SMUs and the leaders of the positive networks. General process Developing of briefs/proposal by SMU/SACs along with positive networks and NGOs based on the needs of the PLHIV in the state Presentation of the proposals detailing the scheme, modifications and financial outlay to the concerned ministry Follow up with the ministry /nodal officer through rigorous advocacy along with positive networks till orders are passed Although this is the general process followed by the states, different states use different approaches. In Rajasthan the proposals developed by the SACs/ SMU along with the positive networks and NGOs are presented to the Minister of Health through the Principal Secretary of Health. All changes and amendments are incorporated and with the approval of the Minister of Health, it is sent to the relevant ministries and departments for their consideration and action. Once the request has been sent, then the SMUs/ positive networks coordinate with the nodal officers to get the orders issued. The orders of amendment are issued by the Principal Secretary. Since most of the welfare schemes are subject matter of Social Justice and Empowerment (SJE) Department, the notification is issued by SJE department in coordination with the Finance department as schemes have a financial outlay, which also requires approval. For example, in the case of the pension scheme being provided to the state Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension Yojana (IGNWPY), the RSACS/SMUs along with the positive network in the state developed the proposal justifying the need, the amendments and the benefit that would accrue to women widowed by AIDS in the state. This proposal was presented by RSACS to the Health Minister of the State and with his approval it was forwarded to the Department of Social Justice. Persistent advocacy efforts by RASCS/ SMUs and positive networks, along with the support of the nodal State Advisory Councils and District AIDS Councils: They have representation from the key ministries which provide social protection schemes and play a key role in approving the schemes for PLHIV. District Administration Officials: They play a critical role in the access of social protection schemes as implementation is done at the district level. These officials help in identifying the recipients and also assisting them with the required documentations. They also in most cases disburse the benefits of the scheme to the recipients. Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs): The Sarpanch or the village head who heads the Panchayat at the village level helps in the identification of beneficiaries; acquisition of supporting documents, preparing of applications and processing claims. NGOs: Advocacy, building linkages, building capacity and follow-up work is done by NGOs with a professional rigour and credibility. Their rapport with the government department helps PLHIV to access the social protection schemes. In many cases, the NGOs complement the role of positive network in their state. Positive networks: These networks play an active role in developing proposals and participate in advocacy efforts to create an enabling environment. PLHIV speakers are able to represent the community\u2019s voice which helps in influencing policy change in their favour. They also create awareness amongst the fellow members and provide them assistance to get the necessary documents avoid bribes and address stigma and discrimination at the service delivery points. They also help to access the schemes at state and district level. Role of nodal officers: The nodal officers identified to facilitate linkages and promote efforts to mainstream HIV within the various ministries/department helps in linking the SMU to the key people within these ministries. They facilitate meetings/discussions between the relevant officials in their ministry and the SACS/SMUs.

Facilitating the Process: In the light of the strategic importance of social protection to mitigate the impact on PLHIV as well as to reduce their vulnerability, DAC works closely with other government departments and ministries to identify and advocate for amendment/adaptation of policies and schemes for social protection of marginalized groups. This has given direction to the efforts of the various sectors in ensuring social protection for the marginalized groups. Many states in India have a strong 5 officer in the Department of Social Justice helped to get the orders released. State wise Process Odisha Proposals placed before the State Advisory Council for approval, before being sent to the concerned ministry Rajasthan Proposals presented to the Principal Secretary Health and Health Minister for approval before being sent to the concerned ministry Tamil Nadu Besides the existing schemes, SACS/SMU develop specific schemes as per the need in the state and implement them In the case of Odisha, it was seen that the State Advisory Councils, which had representation from other relevant ministries, approved these schemes for PLHIV. SMUs and positive networks primed the members prior to the meeting to facilitate and hasten the approval process. SACS and SMU thought of extending the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) scheme based on the orders issued by the Central Government to meet the nutritional needs of PLHIV in the state. A proposal was presented by the SMU along with the SACS and the positive network to the State Advisory Council. This initiated discussion amongst the ministries of Health, Department of Food Supplies and Consumer Development Department. Subsequently, a directive was issued to include all PLHIV in the state including children living with HIV. In some other states like Tamil Nadu, the SACS and the SMUs took the initiative to develop specific schemes as per the need of PLHIV and got the approval and the financial sanction for them even if they were not being provided by other departments/ministries. For example the Orphaned and Vulnerable Children \u2013 Trust: Tamil Nadu Trust for Children Affected by AIDS (TNTCAA), was a scheme designed by Tamil Nadu SACS to provide financial assistance to AIDS orphans and vulnerable children where no child specific programs are in place. The Tamil Nadu SACS played a crucial role in developing the Other Vulnerable Children Trust (OVCT) scheme and the request was placed before the State Government. It was observed that sometimes more than one ministry is involved in the approval process as was evident in Rajasthan where the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) was available to PLHIV in the state after successful advocacy with both the Ministries of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj. In some cases, suggestions and requests by representatives from the national government also triggered the process and resulted in the Health Ministry of the State to send letters of request to the relevant ministry to get the necessary approvals. Once the orders are issued the implementation is mostly done through the ART centres, the district level authorities and the Gram Panchayats as stated above. The ART centres inform PLHIV of the available schemes and get their consensus before asking them to fill the relevant forms. Only those registered at the ART centres can avail these schemes. The district level HIV positive networks acts as foot soldiers, who also create awareness and generate demand for these schemes. They also accompany them to the relevant government departments and also help them to gather the relevant documents. Sometimes they also advocate on their behalf to hasten the process and deliver the benefit to PLHIV. These efforts are also supported by NGOs in some areas. Besides the ART Centre, district officials such as the District Magistrate, Sarpanch and Patwari also are responsible for the disbursement of the benefits, facilitate the availability and verification of the documents and also identify the beneficiaries if necessary. UNDP supports PLHIV networks to uphold their rights and get legal assistance to ensure that they get their due. Legal networks such as Lawyers Collective Delhi conducted sessions with positive networks in Rajasthan to build their capacity and make them aware of their rights. The Impact These processes and systems have led to amendments in certain existing social protection schemes and made them more sensitive to needs of people living with and affected by HIV. 1.

Travel Concession in Odisha Amendment:After due deliberation, at the request of the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Transport agreed to include PLHIV within the travel concession scheme being provided by the state. Process: Initially at the request of OSACS, the Indian Red Cross Society started the travel concession scheme for PLHIV in the state. OSACS and SMU through persistent advocacy with the representatives of the State AIDS Council got the consensus on the matter. Travel Concession in Tamil Nadu Amendment: Sensitization and advocacy programmes with the staff from both the transport department helped to get the Tamil Nadu Government to launch the free bus passes for PLHIV who were registered at the ART centres.

Schemes for HIV affected children: Children often face discrimination because of their parents\u2019 or their own HIV status and are discriminated against and deprived of their rights. Palanhar Yojana in Rajasthan Amendment: The scheme was modified to include all children from HIV households, irrespective of the HIV status of the child along with other destitute children who were receiving this benefit. Process: Rajasthan Network for Positive People (RNP+) were very proactive in identifying and accessing this conditional cash transfer scheme, which was provided for education of children. They were supported by the RSACS through the SMU to successfully advocate with the Department of Social Justice and Empowerment, Govt. of Rajasthan. The process involved developing a proposal which justified the need and provision of this scheme and the benefit. In 2010, Department of Social as provisioned in the scheme for non HIV widows. Furthermore, while widows who had a male child above the age of 25 years were not given this benefit in the original scheme, this condition was withdrawn in the case of HIV widows, making them eligible to receive lifelong pension. Process: Proposal developed by RSACS/SMUs along with the positive network justifying the need, the amendments and the benefit that would accrue to the HIV widows in the state. Proposal presented by RSACS to the Health Minister of the State and with his approval forwarded to the Department of Social Justice. Persistent advocacy efforts by RSACS/ SMUs and positive networks, along with the support of the nodal officer in the Department of Social Justice helped to get the orders released. Madhu Babu Pension Scheme Odisha (MBPY) Amendment: The scheme which was meant for widows was modified to include all PLHIV, irrespective of age, marital status, economic status, caste and gender Process: Collaborative efforts of positive network, UNDP and the SACS helped to develop a proposal to extend the pension scheme to the PLHIV, which was presented to the State Advisory Council for approval. The proposal was then presented to the Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare as well as to Chief Secretary of the state. Finally after the approval from the Minister of Health, the request was sent to the Director, Women and Child Development Department, for consideration. A yearlong advocacy through a series of events and engagement with the state government, civil society organisations, media, legislature, led to the issuing of orders whereby PLHIV and HIV affected widows were made beneficiaries under MBPY. 2. Food and Nutrition Schemes: Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY), Odisha Amendment: The scheme, which was originally meant only for adults, was amended to include PLHIV in the state. Process: Notification from the Ministry of Food and Civil Supplies, Government of India in 2008, to include PLHIV under AAY, triggered the process in the state. SMU presented the proposal at the State Advisory Council meeting, which was discussed and agreed by the ministries of Health, Department of Food Supplies and Consumer Development Department.

The proposal was developed by the SACS and SMU, and was placed before the State AIDS Council for consideration. The matter was approved by the SCA. Subsequently, the Commissioner cum Secretary, Health and Family Welfare sent the request to the Commissioner cum Secretary, Women and Child Development Department. This was pursued by the SMU and SACs and finally the notification was issued to extend the benefits of extra nutrition under the ongoing Integrated ICDS programmes. 5. Livelihood Schemes: Loss of employment and livelihood is a major outcome for PLHIV. Furthermore, lack of laws that enforce the right to employment for PLHIV increases their vulnerability. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MG NREGA), Rajasthan Amendment: The scheme was modified to allow PLHIV to choose the kind of work as per their health status. Process: The lead was taken by SACs/SMU and after the approval of the Minister of Health a request was sent to the Ministries of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj. This was followed by continuous advocacy with these ministries which resulted in the orders being issued by the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of Rajasthan (GOR). UNDP supported the process by engaging the Delhi based legal activist organisation, Lawyers Collective. The advocacy briefs prepared by them along with the capacity building of PLHIV to advocate for their rights ensured the availability of the scheme Chief Minister\u2019s farmer\u2019s protection scheme (Uzhavar Pathukappu thittarn), Tamil Nadu Amendment: As a part of mainstreaming, TNSACS & GIPA made strong case for getting this scheme extended to PLHIV farmers. With the efforts, TNSACS succeeded in getting the scheme extended to farmers who are living with HIV, and are declared unfit to work. The farmers receive a monthly support of Rs.1,000 under this scheme. 6. Housing Scheme: Some PLHIV are deprived of shelter especially when their status becomes known. PLHIV widows are often pushed out of their marital homes after the death of their spouse. Mo Kudiya Scheme, Odisha Amendment: The Panchayati Raj Department modified the scheme to include PLHIV as beneficiaries. Process: Efforts were initiated by the OSACS/SMU in its internal meetings in the year 2008 to cover PLHIV under some housing scheme. Since the PLHIV could not be included within the IAY scheme, this scheme was found suitable to meet the needs of PLHIV when it was launched in 2008 in the state. Continuous advocacy by the OSACS/SMU and the positive network, at various forums and the Chief Minister\u2019s recommendation, this scheme was made available to the PLHIV in 2009. 7. Legal aid: Need to provide free legal services for PLHIV to address stigma and discrimination cases and claim their rights. Legal AIDS Clinics (LAC), Tamil Nadu Process: TNSACS took the lead and carried out an assessment and submitted a report to Tamil Nadu Legal services Authority and a grievance meeting of advocates was called to assess the need. The Project Director, TNSACS further facilitated a meeting with 500 PLHIV in Namakkal to understand the legal needs which also included 3 Judges. A partnership between UNDP and DAC helped to provide funds to start the Legal Aid Clinic (LAC) projects in five districts in Tamil Nadu.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c5d7da9-28d7-4f6d-b804-17b276c6c8e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c5d7da9-28d7-4f6d-b804-17b276c6c8e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-hiv-sensitive-social-protection-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Innovative Approaches - HIV-Sensitive Social Protection in India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-hiv-sensitive-social-protection-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3428d81fa3bb157719bd9990ff76b67acae39351c58aae8276384d92533948b0"}, "2": {"node_id": "2efda15c-d17f-4330-8e1c-c1e0306ba786", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-hiv-sensitive-social-protection-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a7864f612b0822ef31b542ba4e58f0b7be74a852722a68fbbde9f59945767f2"}}, "hash": "4b54ad717bfa8550e95d7e92cf704b41fcf30207f6c26a4616b2dde05b6ea9b7", "text": "Tamil Nadu Legal Services Authority and the district administration plays a major role in the management and funding of the LAC.

It was seen that government orders issued nationally in favour of including PLHIV within the available schemes becomes one of the major triggers that facilitate the process at the state level. Political will and commitment play a key role in ensuring the availability of the scheme for PLHIV. Sensitiveness and pro-activeness of officers seemed to facilitate the process as they made it possible by circumventing the administrative and procedural issues. Sometimes moral bias amongst officials with regards to the behaviour of PLHIV led to reluctance on their part. However consistent advocacy helped to enhance the understanding and facilitate the matter. Promotion of a rights-based approach has helped to empower PLHIV by raising their awareness with regards to their rights. This has been very helpful for them as they have been able to negotiate several schemes for themselves and also get the necessary amendments to the existing schemes to suit their needs. The process of familiarising PLHIV with the legal systems as well as the sensitization of the judicial sector fraternity towards the issues and challenges being faced by PLHIV has also been one of the positive factors that has not only raised the awareness on both sides but has also been extremely useful in empowering PLHIV to use the legal systems to get their dues in terms of making the schemes available for them. Building capacity of PLHIV to identify relevant schemes, develop proposals to avail the schemes, successfully advocate on behalf of their community and raise awareness within their community to generate demand and avail the benefits has successfully contributed to the process. Persistent advocacy through a collaborative mechanism of SACS/MRU/HIV positive networks and NGOs with key stakeholders both at the national and state level has helped in sensitising them with regards to the grave problems being faced by PLHIV and has also motivated them to focus on these issues at the state level. Besides the IEC efforts and the evidence collected and provided both from within and outside the country strengthened the process and made it compelling enough to turn the tide in the favour of PLHIV. The appointment of nodal officers within other relevant ministries and department has been a very good way of ensuring the consistency and continuity of the process. They not only help to provide specific inputs in terms of the way the proposals can be amended but also serve as a point of linkage in case of transfer of key officials. Lessons learned The vulnerabilities/denial of rights faced by PLHIV has pushed them into an abysmal life denied of their basic rights and deprived them of their dignity. The provision of modifying and making available suitable social protection schemes through the mainstreaming strategy has achieved considerable success in recognising the other significant challenges being faced by PLHIV beyond their health issues. Despite success in the process of making social protection schemes available for PLHIV in India and mitigating their challenges, many issues and challenges remain, which are both procedural and governance related. In states with low HIV prevalence it becomes extremely challenging to get the attention of decision makers to focus or prioritise the issue of social protection for PLHIV. This delays the process of getting the sanctions and approvals. In order to overcome this matter, evidence- infomred sensitization sessions and experiences shared by positive speakers has proved to be a useful strategy. This helps to convince the key stakeholders about the vulnerability and motivates them to take prompt action. Frequent change of relevant officers, especially the key persons and decision makers as well as staff both within the SMU and other ministries also proves to be a setback as it delays the process. However, the nodal officers in the ministries and departments play a critical role in ensuring continuity by taking up the issue from where it was left after the last official moved away. Delays in physical and financial approval for advocacy events by the state authorities becomes a major barrier as this is the key strategy which facilitated the availability of these schemes. Protocol followed between ministries can also lead to delays as all changes and amendments are finalised in consultation between department and the minister who then seeks government\u2019s approval for the same, if it is a policy matter. Lack of unity among positive networks is an issue which creates problems. The presence of parallel/ multiple positive networks with differences in perspectives and ideology acts as barriers and prevents the availability of the schemes.

Stigma and loss of confidentiality also appeared to be constraining the process of making these social protection schemes available. These schemes cannot be disbursed without revealing the HIV status; therefore, 9 there is a need for constant sensitisation of all concerned officers who are responsible for the disbursement of the schemes, to ensure confidentiality. Sustainability Social protection helps to mitigate the impact of HIV and AIDS and also reduces the risk of deprivation, thereby creating an enabling environment and transforming individual prospects. The financial and technical support provided by UNDP to both DAC at the national level and the SACS in the selected high HIV prevalence/vulnerable states has yielded positive results. However, to sustain the efforts undertaken in the UNDP-supported states to facilitate the availability of social protection schemes by integrating HIV specific needs and considerations into the process needs to be reinforced to make it sustainable. Since HIV in India is localised and concentrated in a few pockets, it was observed that the activities undertaken in the UNDP-supported states such as advocacy, sensitization, training/building capacity and awareness generation among different stakeholders need to be continued in an unrelenting manner. This will not only strengthen the momentum generated but will also boost the process further by keeping the issue prioritised amongst decision makers, especially in low HIV prevalence states. Furthremore, these efforts will also address the challenges faced on the ground level due to the frequent change of key persons and decision makers at the state level. Prioritising adequate resources for the mainstreaming efforts and the easy facilitation and availability by the state authorities will also help to hasten the process and keep the momentum going. This is very important as advocacy plays a key role in turning the tide in favour of PLHIV. If they do not get the funds in time, then the process gets delayed and the matter gets diluted. HIV positive networks have emerged as a strong collaborator in the entire process. They seem to have been very proactive in identifying suitable schemes, developing proposals and advocating successfully in their favour. The process initiated of building and strengthening their networks and their capacity needs to be done on a regular basis so as to not let the process slacken. For this purpose, both manpower and resources need to be made available. This will also be useful to identify more schemes wherein HIV-sensitive considerations can be integrated. Similarly looking at the support provided by the NGOs in these states, it too needs to be integrated further into the process so as to make the system more sustainable. The efforts need to be widened beyond the government departments to include the corporate sector and sensitize them on the various issues pertaining to PLHIV. Successfully addressing these issues can greatly support the effectiveness and sustainability of the policies and programmes to maximize benefits for PLHIV. Initiative should also be taken to share the process undertaken by the SMU- UNDP in assisting and providing technical support to SACSs in other states. Further systematic documentation and dissemination of knowledge and experiences gained can help in reinforcing the mechanisms and expanding the scope not only within the country but amongst countries with similar issues. The Ministry of Health can promote widely HIV-sensitive policies and programmes by involving PLHIV networks in the national HIV responses at all levels. In conclusion, one can state that a combination of factors could be useful for facilitating the availability of HIV-sensitive social protection schemes for PLHIV: presence of active and strong NGOs and other rights- based organisations, which provide the much needed push; convergence and coordination between all stakeholders, which is useful to garner support and also maximise the availability of resources; active engagement and involvement of PLHIV networks, CSOs/ NGOs and like minded people and organisations who can provide strong support for advocating on social protection issues in the state; research including primary and secondary data to show the linkage between HIV and development; and sharing of best practice amongst states to build evidence and strengthen the process. 10 Photos: UNDP India Additional UNDP Resources Related to HIV-Sensitive Social Protection UNDP (2006).

In this context, Positive Talks could be bene\ufb01 cial for everyone involved. Given this background, Positive Talks was initiated with three main goals: 1. Reduce stigma and discrimination against PLHIV in China. 2. Raise PLHIV abilities and purpose by giving them intensive training and support 3. Create a working model of a PLHIV-led anti-stigma and AIDS awareness intervention that avoids many of the common pitfalls facing grass-roots HIV organizations in China. All these goals would be achieved by supporting a core group of PLHIV to develop deeper knowledge, con\ufb01 dence and speaking skills, and for this group to conduct trainings and \u201cpositive talks\u201d addressing stigma, prevention, care, and other HIV-related topics. Positive Talks: What is it? Positive Talks was initiated in early 2007 by UNDP and the China o\ufb03 ce of Marie Stopes International (MSIC). MSIC provided an operational base and critical start-up support for Positive Talks. In addition to providing o\ufb03 ce space and \ufb01 nancial management, MSIC helped the group organize and manage the growth of speaker networks, local activities, training materials and publications. MSIC has years of experience supporting the growth of grass roots PLHIV organizations, allowing it to nurture the group as an autonomous project.

Background Despite years of government and non-government e\ufb00 orts to spread information about HIV and AIDS, misunderstandings about HIV, along with stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV, remain widespread in China. Stigma and discrimination have been identi\ufb01 ed by the Chinese government as a major challenge to the national AIDS response. \u201cEliminating discrimination and stigma, still a serious problem in China today, is crucial for an e\ufb00 ective AIDS response,\u201d1 China\u2019s vice health minister Huang Jiefu recently stated.

The principle behind Positive Talks is the belief that people living with HIV can be the most quali\ufb01 ed and e\ufb00 ective speakers about HIV. Furthermore, the speakers believe the best way to break down the pervasive discrimination against PLHIV in China is to have people see somebody \u201cjust like me\u201d, who also happens to be HIV-positive, standing up and con\ufb01 dently speaking out. While most AIDS-related projects in China now involve PLHIV, only a handful of individuals have been willing to openly speak about their HIV status. Therefore, there is an urgent need for dedicated, articulate and outspoken PLHIV community members to be supported and given the opportunities to educate and inform. To address this gap, Positive Talks aims to establish a cadre of well trained, well-supported and well-organized HIV-positive speakers who could organize, design and provide trainings; participate in meetings and workshops; and engage policy makers with authority and con\ufb01 dence. Positive Talks: Who is it? An open call for members was put out in early 2007 through community networks and HIV electronic forums. 30 people, both men and women, applied, participated in an interview process, and were invited to join the Positive Talks Team. All underwent systematic and intensive training on all aspects of HIV training and \u201cspeaking out\u201d as an HIV-positive person, including many hours of practice in public speaking. All Positive Talks members join as individuals, with no organizational a\ufb03 liation allowed to interfere with their participation in the group. Also, no member is asked to \u201crepresent\u201d Positive Talks, as this role might con\ufb02 ict with their responsibilities of their primary organizations. Members represent a cross section of China\u2019s PLHIV community, coming from 22 di\ufb00 erent provinces. Some are from small towns and some from big cities; some have university degrees, while others never \ufb01 nished school. \u201cThey are uni\ufb01 ed by the desire to join together and make a real impact on stigma and discrimination against PLHIV in China,\u201d said Xiaokang, the Positive Talks \ufb01 rst programme manager. They are paid to design and conduct trainings, even though all have other jobs, most in NGOs or HIV-related treatment, prevention or care projects. Positive Talks: What does it do? To date (May 2010), Positive Talks has participated in 474 workshops, trainings, and meetings, both speaking and leading participants through activities aimed at challenging the misunderstandings that allow stigma and discrimination to persist. Positive Talks: Conducted anti-stigma and basic HIV awareness trainings for sta\ufb00 of a number of di\ufb00 erent UN agencies under the UN Cares programme including: UNDP, UNAIDS, UNFPA, ILO, FAO, WFP, UNIFEM, UNESCO, WHO, UNHCR, UNEP, UNV, etc. Worked with Chinese government departments to organize and conduct anti-stigma trainings for national and local level government o\ufb03 cials. Collaborated on the design and provision of a journalist training package for use in training Chinese journalists on HIV reporting with China AIDS Info, with support from UNAIDS. Conducted a number of large-scale trainings for foreign and Chinese companies, including Standard Chartered Bank, Total, Areva, Lafarge, Nike, Anglo American, and Pinglang Coal Mine. Received a national UN Volunteer through the UNDP-Total partnership on strengthening the capacity of civil society organizations. Participated in trainings for Global Fund programme sta\ufb00 and local implementing partners around China. Worked with UN Volunteers (UNV), UNAIDS, Beijing Communist Youth League, and the Red Cross Society of China to train 7,500 Beijing Olympic Volunteers in 2008.

The collaborative structures created by the group\u2019s members\u2013 including a \u201cclass leader\u201d modeled after those in Chinese schools and an internal newsletter \u2013 have allowed the project members to build a close-knit community of their own. Second, the project included intensive training and preparation time \u201cup-front\u201d, and continued support and more trainings and workshops, for the \u201cteam\u201d of PLHIV. This sort of \u201cfront-loaded\u201d technical support is fundamentally di\ufb00 erent from other NGO projects that aim to build up a group or network capacity, and which usually include only one or two trainings and limited or no follow-up support. Third, members of the Positive Talks community have regular opportunities to meet, share experiences and learn new skills, creating a powerful support structure for their community. The members also set up their own website, online blog, QQ-group (an online discussion forum), and an email group for their internal communication. Fourth, the project relied on strong principles of equality, unity and participation among its members, and had a very clear long-term goal of becoming self- sustaining \u2013 no similar model has been used in China. In addition, the HIV-positive trainers see themselves as professional trainers on HIV and are being paid for their e\ufb00 orts, making it a potentially self-sustaining business model. Fifth, the project is \ufb01 lling a large gap in the HIV programming landscape in China. Despite the recognized need for skilled and well informed PLHIV to design and conduct trainings and workshops, most participation to date has been tokenistic and does not include or link to support to build up the capacity of PLHIV.

Current funding runs until the end of 2010, but Positive Talks members say they are committed to continuing the work and are trying to make the project as self- sustaining as possible. The current model includes a sliding-scale fee structure for organizations who invite them to participate in trainings or workshops, which reduces the need for external funding sources. While the project is not yet \ufb01 nancially self-sustaining, this model raises the possibility of creating a viable and sustainable structure for providing strong PLHIV-led participation in a range of AIDS-related programming. Positive Talks: Can it be replicated? While this model has not been directly replicated, its impact should not be underestimated. Many of the Positive Talks members have already started their own local PLHIV Speakers groups, or joined existing groups or networks, and have successfully mobilized funding for these groups. Through their participation in Positive Talks, they report that they understand NGOs not as a sort of \u201cclique\u201d that provides bene\ufb01 ts for its members, but rather as a communal body that can provide bene\ufb01 ts for the broader community and society. Indeed, the scope for replication is enormous, as there is a large and well-recognized need for motivated, articulate men and women living with HIV who are willing to speak openly about their status. Given the number of international and national projects and organizations working in China, and the emphasis placed by the Chinese government on reducing stigma and discrimination, the 30 members of Positive Talks will hardly be able to \ufb01 ll the need. Building a \u201cpositive\u201d community Members of Positive Talks commonly use two words to describe their participation: \u201cempowering\u201d and \u201clearning\u201d. Members call one another \u201cclassmate\u201d and form \u201cclasses\u201d with one person appointed as the \u201cclass monitor\u201d (mimicking Chinese university structures). While this structure may seem hierarchical, it is important to note that it was created by the Positive Talks members themselves, rather than imposed or determined by an external agency, and has functioned better than many other coordination models used in NGO projects. 6 Lessons Learned Identi\ufb01 ed by \u201cPositive Talks\u201d Successful \u201ccapacity building\u201d requires intensive and long-term support, but also requires real empowerment if community members are going to come away with the independence, con\ufb01 dence, and abilities it takes to have an impact on both society and the epidemic. In the current environment for NGOs in China, it is essential to avoid joining the internal battles that often divide community members. Instead, they should focus on the basic issues such as stigma and discrimination against PLHIV. It is important to avoid becoming a channel or mechanism to provide funds to community groups. Despite the importance of funding for CBOs in China, playing such a role would make it di\ufb03 cult for the network to keep above personal and political in-\ufb01 ghting, and ultimately reduce its impact. NGOs in China have few strong role models, and no proven governance structures to fall back on \u2013 the best way to build these groups is through mentoring and peer support. 7 Photos provided by the Positive Talks Project, Marie Stopes International China, Humphrey Wou, and UNDP China.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f202ab2-c632-4df0-8199-6c88bdcee771": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f202ab2-c632-4df0-8199-6c88bdcee771", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-positive-talks", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Innovative Approaches - Positive Talks", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-positive-talks", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "87a77fc19aac7b982351ca8111e8da57dca2ffd96ccb46eb5472b7dd0340877b"}, "2": {"node_id": "294ddd5c-7882-441b-8e6c-fcf988f2c34d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-positive-talks", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "968440e5ea337bb86178d5d7307cf65af593a574abeb6e6496d0b73bcbbbba56"}}, "hash": "bcc0d74ed2ec9bc24fe04fa90c9e5a627c90d4478924c8dfbfa3785c00b52c3c", "text": "For more information on the \u201cPositive Talks\u201d project please contact: Henny Ngu Team Leader Democratic Governance UNDP China henny.ngu@undp.org Lily Liu Country Director Marie Stopes International \u2013 China Beijing, China lilyliu@youandme.net.cn Edmund Settle Policy Specialist Human Rights and Sexual Diversity HIV, Health and Development Team UNDP Asia-Paci\ufb01 c Regional Centre edmund.settle@undp.org UNDP China 2 Liangmahe Nanlu Beijing, China 100600 Tel: +86-10 8532 0765 Fax: +86-10 8532 0900 http://www.undp.org.cn Marie Stopes International, China Building 18, Room 103, Euro-classic Compound 172 Bei Yuan Road Chao Yang District Beijing 100101 China http://www.youandme.net.cn For more information on other Greater Involvement of People Living with HIV initiatives in the Asia-Paci\ufb01 c region please contact: Kazuyuki Uji HIV Programme Specialist HIV, Health and Development Team UNDP Asia-Paci\ufb01 c Regional Centre kazuyuki.uji@undp.org January 2011 UNDP partners with people at all levels of society to help build nations that can withstand crisis, and drive and sustain the kind of growth that improves the quality of life for everyone.

Around three million migrants from neighbouring countries (Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar) are estimated to be working in many di\ufb00 erent industries, including agriculture, construction, the \ufb01 shing industry (both \ufb01 shing boats and related industries), and many other occupations. Though Thailand provides health insurance for documented migrant workers, most migrants are not registered with the government, which acts as a barrier to accessing health care and other services, including HIV prevention services. It is estimated that for every registered migrant worker, there are three unregistered ones.1 Numerous barriers to HIV prevention and care for foreign migrant workers exist in Thailand, including: lack of health insurance; restrictions on the use of Thai government budget to provide services to migrants; negative attitudes of health workers; language barriers; fear of police harassment or arrest; and restrictions on migrants\u2019 mobility. Migrants are also particularly vulnerable to HIV infection, especially those young men working on \ufb01 shing boats. After weeks of strenuous work at sea, the young, sexually active men with cash in hand are given shore leave, which gives them the opportunity to drink alcohol and visit entertainment and sex workers. Most of these men lack a proper understanding of HIV or STI prevention, and government condom promotion \u2013 normally quite e\ufb00 ective - does not target them. Five years ago, HIV prevalence among migrant \ufb01 shermen was as high as 5% in some provinces. Unprotected sex was the main mode of transmission, as re\ufb02 ected in a baseline assessment which revealed that more than 50% of migrant workers in the \ufb01 shing industry did not use condoms during sex with casual partners. 1 Prevention of HIV/AIDS Among Migrant Workers in Thailand, powerpoint presentation by Raks Thai Foundation Raks Thai and the PHAMIT Programme Given this rather stark situation, the PHAMIT programme (Prevention of HIV/AIDS Among Migrant Workers in Thailand) was launched to reduce the number of new HIV infections among migrant workers in Thailand and to contribute towards the reduction of HIV/AIDS in the sub-region (Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar). The programme received a $12 million, \ufb01 ve-year grant from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria in 2003. The PHAMIT programme \u2013 the name means \u201cfriendly skies\u201d in Thai - was led by Raks Thai (the Principal Recipient for the Global Fund grant), and included NGO and government partners. It worked in nineteen coastal provinces in Thailand and three non-coastal provinces along the border with Myanmar. Activities mainly focused on migrant workers and their families from Myanmar and Cambodia. In the coastal provinces, most bene\ufb01 ciaries were migrants working in \ufb01 shing and seafood processing, while those working in other jobs such as factories, construction, and agriculture were the main bene\ufb01 ciaries in non-coastal provinces. At all project sites there was a special focus on sex workers and entertainment workers, a group that includes both cross-border migrants and Thais. In all, there were nine implementing partners (eight NGOs and one government agency).2 Each implementing partner was chosen because they were already actively providing migrants with HIV prevention activities at their respective sites. This allowed partners to scale-up activities quickly, with some partners expanding activities into adjacent provinces. The inclusion of the Ministry of Public Health\u2019s Department of Health Services Support (DHSS) in the PHAMIT Programme was of particular importance as a means to advocate for o\ufb03 cial support for \u201cmigrant-friendly health services\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e96ba264-acf1-4950-925c-fcdbd487f9f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "e96ba264-acf1-4950-925c-fcdbd487f9f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-prevention-hiv-and-aids-among-migrant-workers-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Innovative Approaches -

Why it Succeeded Simply put, the PHAMIT programme succeeded because it targeted an urgent need and engaged the a\ufb00 ected communities. The work done with hospitals and government departments helped support these e\ufb00 orts by \ufb01 lling gaps in health care and HIV prevention services for migrant workers. PHAMIT \ufb01 lled these gaps by developing a broad network including NGOs, hospitals, government departments, local governments and employers, and by designing services to \ufb01 t the realities of migrant communities. The overall impact has been magni\ufb01 ed by strategic advocacy aimed at various government agencies, the ability to be \ufb02 exible and adjust project activities to re\ufb02 ect realities on the ground, and an inclusive approach that aims to protect the health and rights of all community members, foreign migrants and Thais alike. Key strategies and activities that created real impact and bene\ufb01 ts for the program\u2019s target populations include: NGO-Government Cooperation A core strategy of the PHAMIT programme was to partner with NGOs already working with migrants, health departments and other in\ufb02 uential agencies to address the lack of HIV prevention and supportive health services for all migrant workers in Thailand. In addition to the implementing partners for the Global Fund grant, the program was allied with other in\ufb02 uential external agencies including the Department of Disease Control (DDC) in the Ministry of Public Health, the Canada Southeast Asia Regional HIV/AIDS Program (CSEARHAP), and the United Nations Regional Task Force on Mobility and HIV Vulnerability Reduction in South East Asia and Southern Provinces of China (UNRTF).3 \u201cMigrant-Friendly\u201d Services PHAMIT partners worked with the Department of Health Services Support and provincial health facilities to promote systematic changes that will lead to the adoption of \u201cmigrant-friendly health services\u201d. Ten \u201cfocus\u201d provinces were designated as pilot sites to demonstrate how \u201cmigrant-friendly health services\u201d can be implemented. Through a partnership with the Department of Health Services Support and PATH, PHAMIT worked with hospitals in these sites to adopt the service model. Migrant Health Assistants An important innovation of this program and a key element to \u201cmigrant-friendly health services\u201d was the creation of \u201cMigrant Health Assistants.\u201d These people are registered migrants living in Thailand who were recruited and trained to serve as skilled support personnel for migrants accessing public health services. These assistants provided guidance and translation between migrants and Thai health sta\ufb00 to make health services less intimidating to migrants and to improve proper diagnosis and treatment. 3 Note that UNTRF has changed its name to \u201cThe Joint United Nations Initiative on Mobility and HIV/AIDS in South East Asia (JUNIMA)\u201d. 4 Outreach and Behaviour Change Thai and migrant project sta\ufb00 reached migrants by visiting their homes, work sites, and entertainment centers with the help of community-based volunteers. Both project sta\ufb00 and volunteers helped to distribute a wide variety of information and educational materials produced by PHAMIT partners on a range of topics, primarily aimed at reducing high-risk behaviour among migrants. This included printed materials, as well as audio, video, and karaoke discs. The programme reached more than 442,000 migrants and more than 20,000 entertainment workers with HIV and reproductive health information through these activities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92288268-7770-4617-a610-a2a34306b077": {"__data__": {"id_": "92288268-7770-4617-a610-a2a34306b077", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-prevention-hiv-and-aids-among-migrant-workers-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Innovative Approaches - Prevention of HIV and AIDS among Migrant Workers in Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-prevention-hiv-and-aids-among-migrant-workers-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ec3d1ee10e786d159525c40398126ef82eccae700c8671882b44c6308984ff3"}, "2": {"node_id": "1fd8195c-c9fd-4db4-8011-d216c33f1932", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-prevention-hiv-and-aids-among-migrant-workers-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82125f17392219150d784be1a0b968f0627a2d4db6819aa9ef8bc06da23f0cf9"}}, "hash": "efb25071205701cc0f294d2bc032ee51ab52f23368674a81c67ca3d5d162a024", "text": "Drop-in Centers The programme opened a total of 38 drop-in centers in 20 provinces in order to provide a safe and convenient place for migrants to access information and services.

Although all children in Thailand have the right to education by law, there are many practical barriers that prevent children of migrant workers from entering Thai schools. To reduce the chances that these children go unattended or end up assisting their parents in the workplace, PHAMIT partners provided life-skills and basic education, such as Thai and native language instruction, to over 27,460 migrant children, and 20 centers were established to help care for children, many of which were linked to drop-in centers. The programme has also aimed to improve migrants\u2019 understanding of their rights and advocate for the implementation of policies that protect their rights. Under the project, more than 150,000 migrant workers received information and training on health and labour rights, including regular updates about the migrant registration policy. In addition, the programme sensitized more than 13,000 government o\ufb03 cials, employers, and journalists regarding migrants\u2019 rights and relevant government policies. Government Policy Advocacy PHAMIT partners continue to advocate for changes in Thai government policy to support \u201cmigrant-friendly health services.\u201d At the broad policy level, some successes have been the inclusion of migrants as a major population group under the National Plan for Multi-lingual Information As language is a major barrier for non-Thai speaking migrants, a fundamental strategy of the program was the development of materials and the provision of outreach activities on HIV prevention and health promotion in migrants\u2019 native languages. Health Services: Increased Access and Quality The programme aimed to improve both migrants\u2019 access to health services and the quality of these services. Access to services was improved through referral to health services through community volunteers and at drop-in centers, with translation and support for transportation also provided. These mechanisms helped more than 7,400 migrants and entertainment workers to receive testing and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STI). Mobile health clinics were also sent to both communities and drop-in centers to provide health services to migrant workers and their families. HIV Testing and Counselling Programme partners have developed and used a training module for Migrant Health Assistants on HIV voluntary and con\ufb01 dential counselling and testing (VCCT). Through this work, more than 2,760 migrants received VCCT, which also led to an increased need for HIV-related services. In response, PHAMIT partners expanded the scope of their services, eventually providing home-based care to 1,940 HIV-positive migrants and assisting 1,750 PLHIV to receive treatment for opportunistic infections. Condom Distribution In addition to information, condom distribution was a key activity of the programme. During Phase One of the programme, nearly 7 million condoms were distributed through outreach activities and 1,920 distribution points, involving volunteers and condom boxes. 5 Another concern is the sustainability of ART provision to migrants. Although Thailand produces its own generic ARVs and provides it to the public at no cost under the National Health Insurance Scheme, ARVs being supplied to migrants are currently funded by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. There are also a number of barriers that still need to be resolved to formally support Migrant Health Workers: The Ministry of Labour has not recognized an o\ufb03 cial occupational category under the migrant registration for \u201cMigrant Health Workers\u201d because it is considered a skilled job, although in 2009 a category was created for \u201csocial workers employed by foundations\u201d; Government hospitals are prohibited from o\ufb03 cially hiring migrants because government agencies are not allowed to hire migrants; Only a few government hospitals utilizing Migrant Health Workers have demonstrated that they will use their own budgets to support or develop these people - it is not systematic; and The Royal Thai Government\u2019s central health authorities have not issued any directives or conducted planning to support the expanded use of Migrant Health Workers into other hospitals not under PHAMIT. Phase Two of the PHAMIT programme has been initiated. While expanding its geographic coverage to provide migrant workers in Thailand with e\ufb00 ective HIV prevention measures, the programme will also continue to pursue institutional and policy changes to support migrants\u2019 health and rights. In these ways, PHAMIT will continue to focus a spotlight on the needs and rights of cross-border migrants in Thailand.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1db8f3ed-554d-465f-b605-b626806900de": {"__data__": {"id_": "1db8f3ed-554d-465f-b605-b626806900de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-prevention-hiv-and-aids-among-migrant-workers-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Innovative Approaches - Prevention of HIV and AIDS among Migrant Workers in Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-prevention-hiv-and-aids-among-migrant-workers-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5635ed8c1bfc105a4d3c48799549806e70ae41ce07301b95de463f639dd91fde"}, "2": {"node_id": "885f785d-2a17-4fe4-ba7d-70550b1378ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-prevention-hiv-and-aids-among-migrant-workers-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5daa53e5a3efba31542f67559112ddc452225ce3b606d6d08e334498aa98f7d"}}, "hash": "a08a8a93bed9b0baaea0040f99c2dbaf4499eef23a4abd401ae287d68264daa2", "text": "Strategic and Integrated HIV and AIDS Prevention and Alleviation 2007 \u2013 2011, and the drafting of the Ministry of Public Health\u2019s \u201cMigrant Health Policy.\u201d One of the most important advocacy issues is to have \u201cMigrant Health Assistants,\u201d who are a key element of \u201cmigrant-friendly health services,\u201d recognized by the government as an o\ufb03 cial occupation.

In the short term, civil society organizations have several advantages and can work around existing policy barriers to \ufb01 ll much of the gap, but the long-term solution requires government systems and hospitals to integrate services into existing public systems, including providing public health coverage to all migrant workers. Sustainability of the Programme PHAMIT achieved some success in reducing HIV- vulnerability among migrants in Thailand by changing behaviours and by paving the way for greater access to health services, but there remain huge needs. Policies are still the main obstacle. A recent change in the overarching migrant registration policy has created confusion about health insurance coverage for those who are registered, and left undocumented migrants to continue to pay for health services out of pocket. 6 Photos provided by Wiroj Koungyuttamongkol.

Innovative Approaches - UNDP Philippines Country Philippines Focus area Sexual diversity, strategic information Audience National and local government officials, local community members, community groups Contact Philip Castro philip.castro@undp.org Strengthening Community Leadership among Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and Transgender Persons Key features of this novel HIV programming and partnership-building initiative: Generating and utilizing strategic information for policy development and programme planning Facilitating partnership building between community groups of MSM and transgender persons and national and local governments Capacity building of MSM and transgender groups for advocacy and local programming 2011 2 increase in HIV through well focused and targeted programmes. However, as TLF Sexuality, Health, and Rights Educators (TLF-SHARE) \u2013 the MSM-sectoral representative to the Philippine National AIDS Council (PNAC) \u2013 noted in 2007, government budgetary backing for HIV and AIDS was not providing the needed resources for adequate HIV prevention, treatment, care and support programmes at the national level. The dramatic rise in HIV cases within the MSM and transgender communities also raised a more fundamental concern \u2013 were past intervention programmes that once seemed to be helping stem the tide of HIV, like outreach activities, learning group sessions, and condom distribution, still effective under these changing circumstances? Understanding and Empowering MSM and Transgender Communities As the convening UN agency supporting empowerment of MSM and transgender persons, UNDP and the UN Joint Team on AIDS determined that more effective interventions were needed to slow the spread of the disease in these two key populations. As discussions progressed, it became clear that institutional knowledge of these populations and their characteristics was low. While MSM were acknowledged as a distinct group, transgender persons were viewed at best, as a subset of the MSM population, and mistakenly as MSM dressed as women. Service providers and government officials alike viewed MSM as a homogenous population defined almost solely by their sexual behaviour, with very little understanding of the complexities and variations that exist in any community. Thus UNDP, along with PNAC and the UN Joint Team on AIDS, developed Component 4 of UNDP\u2019s HIV Programme, \u2018Strategic Information and Community Leadership among Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and Transgender Populations\u2019 in order to strategically develop, disseminate, and utilize key information and knowledge. The programme would undertake research to build greater understanding of the behaviours, motivations, needs, and background of MSM and transgender persons, and also to assess current interventions to identify the most effective approaches. This information could then feed into national and local policy-making, programmatic planning, and sharing of best practices and strengthening of South-South cooperation through the USAID and UNDP Multi-city MSM and HIV initiative. The Work UNDP partnered with two non-governmental organizations - Health Action Information Network (HAIN) and TLF-SHARE to implement Component 4. Background The UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic in 2010 noted that the Philippines was one of only seven countries in the world where HIV incidence grew more than 25 percent in the past 10 years. Figures show that from 2007 to 2011, the average number of new reported cases jumped from one per day to over six per day1. This dramatic acceleration of new infections reflects the many risk factors that face the country. It is however, also driven by stunning trends in two at- risk populations. Five of the six Filipinos being infected with HIV each day in the country in 2011 are MSM. MSM and transgender persons are arguably the two most at-risk populations in the entire country. HIV in these groups already resembles an epidemic, even if the overall HIV and AIDS situation in the Philippines does not yet. Transmission trends have clearly shifted from heterosexual to male-to-male sex. In 2011, sexual transmission through male-to-male sex represented 82 percent of all new cases reported, up from 56 percent in 2007. More disturbing is the absolute numbers of newly infected people identifying either as homosexual or bisexual, growing from 37 total cases in 2001 to 1,842 in 20112. Further, the underlying risk factors for these two populations are worrying. The 2009 Integrated HIV Behavioural and Serologic Surveillance (IHBSS) showed that prevention programmes reached only 29 percent of the estimated 690,000 MSM, while only 35 percent have correct knowledge on HIV. In addition, only 32 percent of the people who practice anal sex reported the use of a condom. Given these inherent gaps between real behaviour and preventative behaviour, the current growth in HIV cases may very well be just the start of a period of explosive, exponential growth in HIV amongst MSM", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "45253209-8e6e-4a2c-9f1f-4888da3dd1f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "45253209-8e6e-4a2c-9f1f-4888da3dd1f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-strengthening-community-leadership-among-men-who-have-sex-men", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Innovative Approaches - Strengthening Community Leadership among Men who have Sex with Men", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-strengthening-community-leadership-among-men-who-have-sex-men", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "022ef7b930615978fc0b057859220c77f5e5d830371196588b7fcfa774b8291c"}}, "hash": "022ef7b930615978fc0b057859220c77f5e5d830371196588b7fcfa774b8291c", "text": "and transgender populations.

Together, they would be responsible for expanding the knowledge about MSM and transgender persons and for assessing the existing programmes targeting these groups. Key to the work have been workshops, group discussions, and most importantly, three major reports \u2013 an assessment of MSM and transgender persons data from the 2009 IHBSS, a qualitative survey of behaviour and motivations complimenting the quantitative data from the 2009 IHBSS, and an assessment of current MSM interventions across the nation. HAIN\u2019s work with the National Epidemiology Center (NEC) of the Department of Health (DOH) to analyse data from the 2009 IHBSS was the first major research initiative and aimed to assess MSM and transgender persons by disaggregating the IHBSS data. Work started on analysing the data to get a clearer picture of infection rates within the populations as well as to better understand the behaviours, exposure to intervention programmes, information gaps, and key risks that the two populations faced. The work has resulted in the only analytical report on a key population published from the 2009 IHBSS. In July of 2009, the Programme convened the first ever national consultation with MSM and transgender community based organizations working on HIV. Over 100 attendees from across the country came to the \u2018National Consultation on MSM, Transgender, and HIV in the Philippines\u2019. The event did more than just underscore the need for MSM and transgender specific programmes in HIV prevention, or validate the need for more data to be generated; it also brought together the major stakeholders from across the nation for the first time, laying the foundation for future cooperation and meaningful partnership. A follow-up conference, the \u2018Visayas and Mindanao MSM and Transgender Conference on HIV\u2019 aimed at expanding participation of organizations outside Metro Manila, was held in late 2010 in Davao City. Attended by over 100 local MSM and transgender leaders, the conference resulted in the Davao Declaration, which underscored the MSM and transgender communities\u2019 demand to be recognized, respected, and provided with appropriate services. The UNDP Project was able to give opportunity for MSM and TG groups and organizations to be capacitated in terms of governance, advocacy and organizational development. Moreover, it helped create an opportunity for stakeholders and duty bearers to come together towards greater and cooperative approaches to halt and reverse the HIV and AIDS epidemic affecting MSM and TG Filipinos. - Anastacio Marasigan, Jr., Executive Director, TLF-SHARE Tangible Impacts The Programme\u2019s strategic approach to researching, analysing, and disseminating information about HIV and AIDS in the MSM and transgender populations have resulted in a number of significant national and local advances in the AIDS response. Information on MSM and transgender persons was integral in the Programme\u2019s contributions to the 5th National AIDS Medium Term Plan, and also informed the drafting of a specific strategy targeting these two key populations \u2013 the National Comprehensive Strategic Plan for MSM and Transgender Populations. The analysis of disaggregated data from the 2009 IHBSS combined with qualitative data gathered through the Programme\u2019s independent study has played an important role in improving the data gathering about MSM and transgender persons on the future IHBSS surveys. The work in convening LGUs and community groups of MSM transgender persons has resulted in a deeper understanding and awareness of the unique development challenges that face these communities in stopping the spread of HIV, as well as increased participation of MSM and transgender groups in LGU activities and greater funding by LGUs for MSM and transgender specific HIV interventions in some cases (e.g., Cebu City, Davao City). Likewise, greater awareness has directly resulted in greater support by policy makers in Cebu City and Davao for the adoption of broader local anti-discrimination ordinances. 4 existing projects that could be duplicated in other countries. The Impacts While all three major reports are significant in their own right, their impact goes well beyond the publication of new knowledge. The engagement of the MSM and transgender persons during the process of designing and generating these reports has significantly increased the skills, abilities, and access of community organizations and individuals for development planning and policy implementation.

More importantly though, the knowledge generated by the Programme has contributed significantly to the development of national level HIV policy and planning while also helping guide local innovations and implementation. The importance of addressing HIV among MSM and transgender persons is now reflected in the national 5th AIDS Medium Term Plan, and through Throughout the first half of 2010, the Programme began to undertake a qualitative study, Assessing the Risks and Vulnerabilities of Men who Have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Three Key Cities, internally referred to as the qualitative study, grounded in a social-cultural approach which would serve as a compliment to the quantitative data from the 2009 IHBSS. Building on the partnerships from the first National Consultation, draft plans and questionnaires were distributed to stakeholders from around the nation. With many of the consulted parties being members of MSM or transgender groups, the review process served to endorse the relevance of the study as well as help to focus on issues least understood and most important to MSM and transgender persons. During the summer of 2010, focus group discussions with respondents in three \u2018burden\u2019 areas of Metro Manila, Cebu City, and Davao, were conducted. By 2011, the results of the qualitative study was providing decision makers and stakeholders with new, important insights on the behaviours and mind set of MSM and transgender persons, who have the highest infection rates in the nation. At the end of 2010, the third major research piece of the Programme was started. The programme identified key groups implementing projects at the local levels and undertook an assessment of their interventions and effectiveness. Initial workshops were conducted in Cebu City and Davao in November 2010, and a follow-up workshop that included groups from Metro Manila was conducted in early 2011. The workshops applied a standardized set of evaluation measures to the programmes in place, allowing a comparison of effectiveness that spanned geographies and intervention types. The work fed into an initiative to generate a Comprehensive Package of HIV Services for MSM and transgender persons, building on successful Davao Declaration \u201c\u2026to be treated as equals of everyone\u2026without prejudice to our sexual orientation, identity or behaviour and without distinction as to our religion, age, ethnicity, or our HIV status\u2026\u201d The Davao Declaration, adopted at the \u2018Visayas and Mindanao MSM and Transgender Conference on HIV,\u2019 acknowledged the danger of the growing HIV epidemic in the Philippines and the need to address it. Based upon a fundamental recognition that \u201chuman rights promotion and defense are fundamental to the response to the HIV epidemic\u201d the Declaration puts forth that the rights of MSM and transgender persons to equality and non- discrimination, privacy and confidentiality, health, participation, safe sex, formation of associations, family and relationships, and the same civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights as others, are inviolable. The declaration holds both members of the community and the government accountable for upholding these rights. For the community, it is stated that \u201cThe obligation imposed upon ourselves (is) to respect and recognize the rights of other people while we strive for the respect and recognition of our right.\u201d At the same time, \u201cThe State, being the primary duty-bearer, should evolve, enact, enforce, evaluate and monitor policies, programs and other mechanisms, together with realistic, practical and strategic responses to ensure that our rights are appropriately promoted, protected and fulfilled.\u201d \u201d The Council (PNAC) believes that concrete ways forward to strengthening Council-to-community engagement will be aided by the gains the UNDP project achieved with capacity-building initiatives with MSM-TG communities. - Glenn Cruz, MSM and TG Focal Person Philippine National AIDS Council (PNAC) Secretariat 5 Advancing interventions with Local Government Units (LGUs) The greater awareness of the specialized needs of MSM and transgender persons served as a basis for an expansion of cooperation between local MSM and transgender groups and LGUs.

One area where this has yielded immediate results is the cooperation between LGUs and MSM and transgender organizations in launching local anti-discrimination campaigns. These have taken the form of both local initiatives as well as support for more national programmes like \u2018Human Soul.\u2019\u201d The (Visayas and Mindanao MSM and TG) Conference was such an important step in the formulation of local ordinances and other programmes on MSM and TG (in Davao City) guided by the Davao Declaration.

The success of the Programme\u2019s research initiatives in affecting national planning is also something that may be applicable in other countries, and the sharing of lessons learned with other countries in the region has been another important impact. Contributing to national planning for HIV and AIDS Building on the extensive knowledge generated by the 2009 IHBSS analysis, the qualitative study, and MSM and transgender focused workshops and conferences, the Programme provided significant input to the development of the 5th AIDS Medium Term Plan. In presenting the information generated by the Programme to PNAC\u2019s MSM and Transgender Working Group, the Programme supported greater emphasis on policies directed at limiting the spread of the epidemic among MSM and transgender persons. Indeed, the strong contribution of Component 4\u2019s outputs has resulted in TLF-SHARE, HAIN, and UNDP all becoming members of the MSM and TG Working Group. More importantly, the findings from these studies helped inform the National Comprehensive HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan for MSM and TG. National network of MSM and transgender organizations A key output of the Programme\u2019s push to profile MSM and transgender organizations and to assess the success of interventions directed at them has been the gathering of relevant organizations from around the country. Whereas many of these organizations have often worked alone, or in smaller regional or urban- focused networks, the Programme sought to bring them together to share innovative practices and facilitate future communication and partnerships. Finally, the Programme and the engagement processes has helped laid the groundwork for the development of one in the future by building an informal network of groups now, led by people who have personal relationships with leaders and champions from around the Philippines. Building capacity of local MSM and transgender organizations and individuals The emphasis on involvement by members of the MSM and transgender persons groups served to build the skills and capacities of community members, allowing them to be more meaningfully involved in designing and implementing solutions. To facilitate their participation, the Programme provided training on research methodologies and the process of completing the tasks in Component 4 provided significant field experience. In addition, MSM and transgender groups were also trained on advocacy, organizational and programme development, as well as monitoring and evaluating interventions to assist in determining how effective existing programmes were. 6 the workshop stressed the importance of a participatory approach and establishing strategic partnerships. Factors for Success Component 4 has largely been able to not only produce and disseminate key information about the MSM and transgender populations, but also to ensure that this knowledge is put to use by relevant policy makers and leaders. There are a number of factors that have contributed to Component 4\u2019s success. Key to the success of the research initiatives on MSM and transgender populations undertaken in the UNDP HIV programme was the expansion of partnerships between groups that did not traditionally work together. For the analysis of the 2009 IHBSS data, the partnership between NEC and HAIN represented the first of its kind. Indeed, this was actually the first time that the NEC released raw data from the study to an NGO for processing and analysis and reflected an important step forward in the relationship between NGOs working on HIV and the government. Just as importantly, the Programme engaged and sought the participation of stakeholders from multiple sectors. Government partners, civil society, local champions, local governments, and community members were all intimately engaged throughout the process, providing input and critical endorsement of study design, analysis, and data assessments.

In other words, the participatory approach was essentially a three year period of awareness building, advocacy, and knowledge levelling for key development actors working on preventing the spread of HIV. In this way, the Programme contributed not only to generating knowledge needed for better policy making and programme planning, but also to building a strong coalition of development partners. The participatory process ensured that decision makers owned and valued the knowledge in the reports, and directly resulted in the wide utilization of the reports as a foundation for policy formulation at both national and local levels. A third factor for success has been the Programme\u2019s flexibility in the face of new information or new needs. This was shown most prominently in the design of the qualitative study, which went through numerous iterations throughout the first half of 2010 in response to feedback from various stakeholders. The review process with leading MSM and transgender organizations Fighting discrimination against MSM and transgender persons By the first quarter of 2011, UNDP sponsored the awareness building multimedia and online exhibit \u2018Human Soul\u2019. Initiated by two French journalists, the exhibit was an innovative advocacy campaign centred on a combination of photojournalism and multimedia recordings. Based on the idea that the theoretical notion of discrimination must be humanized for people to take action, especially in societies that may take certain aspects of discrimination as normal, Human Soul attempted to provide human faces to stories of discrimination and obstacles that MSM and transgender persons face in society. Initially launched at the Philippine Congress on 16 May 2011, on the eve of the International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia, the exhibit toured around the nation making stops in all three major urban areas \u2013 Metro Manila, Cebu City, and Davao. It brought significant national press to the issue of discrimination based on sexual orientation and identity, engaging community members and building support for national and local anti-discrimination legislations. South-South cooperation In May 2011, UNDP hosted the \u2018Multi-Country Training on Strategic Information on HIV among MSM and Transgender People\u20193. This was a follow up to the USAID and UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre supported Six-City MSM and HIV Initiative, which assessed six mega-cities across Asia Pacific for their capacity and potential to scale up HIV interventions to MSM and transgender persons. This strategic training aimed to provide skills on crucial research methods to support strategic information that can impact policy and programme development. Following the experience of the Programme in the Philippines, the training provided a venue for South-South cooperation where 20 participants from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines discussed adapting a proven model to local socio-religious contexts. Taking lessons learned from the implementation of Component 4 in the Philippines, 3 Supported by Asian Development Bank, UNAIDS RST and UNDP APRC. 7 and researchers led to changes in research tools and to more relevant targeted participants for the focus group discussions. As the information gathered through, the Programme began to highlight the needs of communities at the local level in terms of working more closely with local governments and in advocacy against discrimination, new initiatives, like the Human Soul exhibit, were undertaken or supported\u2013 another reflection of the Programme\u2019s flexibility in contributing to real effects on these two most-at-risk populations. Lessons Learned The \u2018Strategic Information and Community Leadership among Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender Populations\u2019 component of UNDP\u2019s HIV programme in the Philippines has successfully demonstrated the importance of understanding the MSM and transgender persons and helped inform national responses to the spread of HIV within these two key populations. For the major research components of this programme, the engagement of key stakeholders was necessary to ensure that the results were not only valid but also accepted as the basis for forward-looking policies and planning. While the participatory process was integral to the widespread impacts of the Programme, it is by its very nature demanding in terms of time and resources. Gathering stakeholders together is difficult, and chasing them down individually equally so. Initial planning could have better taken into account unforeseen delays due to the highly participatory nature of this programme component. Instead, timelines were compressed and \u201d The fight of the LGBTs (lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender) for their rightful place in this world is also our fight.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ca9fb78-00eb-4d18-9ebe-77334d0cb6e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ca9fb78-00eb-4d18-9ebe-77334d0cb6e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-strengthening-community-leadership-among-men-who-have-sex-men", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Innovative Approaches - Strengthening Community Leadership among Men who have Sex with Men", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/innovative-approaches-strengthening-community-leadership-among-men-who-have-sex-men", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a8119b05250b297939b8c97f615bb4c09cab39201a8efb7fa678a51d306a57ef"}}, "hash": "a8119b05250b297939b8c97f615bb4c09cab39201a8efb7fa678a51d306a57ef", "text": "Not only should we manifest our solidarity with them, we should take on with greater fervor their issues and concerns\u2026 - Hon. Luzviminda Ilagan, Representative, Gabriela Women\u2019s Party the Programme ambitiously attempted to almost concurrently undertake three large-scale participatory research projects. Initially, the Programme faced a problem of high turnover within government and civil society organizations which impeded its continuity and the long-term benefits of awareness and capacity building. It became clear from an early point that key leaders and group members would have to be identified in order to sustain the work and gains from the Programme. This was especially important because research capacities at the local levels and within the MSM and transgender community groups were low; people would need to be trained and supported in order to undertake the research activities needed, but high turnover could continuously challenge the ability to deploy sufficient human resources. Sustainability Component 4 has played a large role in ensuring that national policy on HIV and AIDS takes into account MSM and transgender persons. The three year programme has resulted in a marked increase in the understanding of these two key populations for HIV in the Philippines. The MSM- specific analysis of the 2009 IHBSS, the qualitative study of behaviours and motivations, the assessment of existing interventions, and the comprehensive package of HIV interventions for MSM and transgender persons are all extremely important sources of information on how best to address these populations going forward. However, dissemination of the knowledge generated through this programme continues to pose a challenge to its long-term impacts. While the participatory process has ensured that the information is relevant and valid, thus far those who have participated also constitute the bulk of the audience for this new knowledge. Currently, there is still a disconnect in important government agencies at both the national and local levels; while some departments may be well-versed in the findings, others remain uninformed. Likewise, government departments and development NGOs that do not traditionally deal with HIV or these key populations may also have little or no access to the knowledge generated Lessons Learned Key lessons were learned through this programme. It has shown that when relevant and strategic data and information exist, national policy and programme planning can be more robust and effective. Building the partnerships and relationships, as well as ensuring there is institutional buy-in to the data, prove to be invaluable to guarantee utilization of the data. 8 by the Programme. In order to sustain the gains made, the Programme must broaden the base of people who have access to the information and encourage them to utilize it in their development planning. It is only by expanding the audience and communicating the importance of the information gathered that HIV, and specifically challenges facing the MSM and transgender persons, can be addressed from a development perspective instead of solely a healthcare one. The qualitative study is undoubtedly useful and informative, as its citation by high-ranking officials from the DOH and other agencies shows. Despite this, there have thus far been no concrete decisions about making the qualitative study a regular part of the IHBSS. The 2011 IHBSS does not include a qualitative component. The importance of having access to updated qualitative data for future planning cannot be overstated, and resources need to be put behind continued data gathering to ensure that the information \u2013 and resulting policy making \u2013 reflects current realities. It is important that the qualitative study is not treated as a one-off activity; behaviours, motivations, and situations are constantly changing and having a regular qualitative study will assist not only in ensuring relevance of HIV interventions but also in monitoring and evaluation of current initiatives. Finally, the partnerships and relationships created through this programme should continue to be nurtured and expanded. While the Programme, in other components as well as this one, has faced challenges with high turnover rates of government staff, officials, and NGO leaders, as these people spread out to other agencies and responsibilities, they can take with them the knowledge and awareness gained from their work with the Programme. At the same time, organizations working on MSM and transgender HIV interventions can also better target their training and awareness efforts at identified leaders in the field to minimize the potential negative impacts of staff movement. Finally, still greater attention can be paid to building deeper institutional relationships so that the government and civil society can together be more agile in addressing key populations and changing circumstances.

account for 0.058 percent (0.046-0.070 percent) of the total population making china still a low-prevalence country. however the epidemic is severe in some areas. at the end of december 2011, 31 provinces (or autonomous regions, municipalities) had reported hIV cases. 93.2 percent (2,885 of 3,095) of counties (or districts) had reported hIV cases. Variations in reported numbers of cases were quite significant between provinces. the six provinces with the highest number of reported hIV cases (from highest number: yunnan, guangxi, sichuan, henan, xinjiang, guangdong) accounted for 75.5 percent of the total number of reported cases nationwide. the seven provinces with the fewest reported cases of hIV (tibet, Qinghai, ningxia, Inner Mongolia, gansu, tianjin, hainan) accounted for 1.2 percent of the total number of reported cases nationwide. the 20 counties (or districts, cities) with the highest number of reported cases of hIV were all located within yunnan, guangxi, xinjiang, henan and sichuan.5 the 2012 China AIDS Response Progress Report describes china\u2019s hIV epidemic as exhibiting five major characteristics: i) national prevalence remains low, but the epidemic is severe in some areas; ii) the number of PlhIV continues to increase, but new infections have been contained at a low level; iii) there is gradual progression of hIV to aIds resulting in an increase of the aIds-related deaths; iv) sexual transmission, particularly among men who have sex with men, is the primary mode of transmission, and continues to increase; v) china\u2019s epidemics are diverse and evolving. one of the major challenges that emerged in this context is the high cost of antiretroviral medicines (arVs), the bulk of which continues to be imported today, due significantly to patent protection granted to foreign manufacturers. as discussed below, today there is the dichotomy of china being the world supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients for arVs, without a corresponding production of generic arVs for its citizens and millions of patients in other developing countries. Interface between HIV and tuberculosis (TB) hIV and tb are so closely connected that they are often referred to as co-epidemics or dual epidemics. there is growing concern that successes in battling tb are being undermined and may even be negated by co-infection of hIV and tb, as well as increasing resistance to tb drugs. People living with hIV are 21-34 times more likely to develop tb in a given year than hIV-negative people. tb is a leading killer of people living with hIV, causing one quarter of all deaths. In 2010 and 2011, the proportions of people estimated to be co-infected with hIV and tb who received combined treatment for hIV and tb stood at 44.8 percent and 35.6 percent respectively.6 china was one of the 22 countries with the highest tb burden as identified by the Who in 2008. china, however, has made dramatic progress in tb control. between 1990 and 2010, the tb death rate in the country fell by almost 80 percent and the total number of people ill with tb dropped by half.7 It also has the largest dots (directly observed treatment, short-course) programme, a key element of World health organization (Who) stop tb strategy8, in the world.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a14e4613-da37-4803-9e15-23ffa142f2e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "a14e4613-da37-4803-9e15-23ffa142f2e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Intellectual Property Rights and Access to Affordable ARVs in China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb43568b4694825f19dd8fbe0724c0d206bdefb7423c87b3c3b073ebfef331ec"}, "2": {"node_id": "a1187c3a-ea5a-4f29-bfba-76e904396914", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de978934cbf4a45805c4021c0101f540a26cbf89293a280d96122cada71cbda8"}}, "hash": "575cca35a1487540dfaa65256df2b67f44cfa3f63ae40e7548c2d9b28c8b0e83", "text": "there was a national tb control Programme (2001-2010) under which the government increased spending and strengthened capacity to deal with the disease. free diagnosis and drugs have been provided for all active pulmonary tb cases. the new national tb control Programme (2011-2015) further acknowledges the challenges with the increasing epidemic trend of multi-drug resistance tb (Mdr-tb) and sets the goal of expanding the treatment and control on Mdr-tb. treatment under dots involves a 6-month course of drugs to be taken under supervision every other day. the china programme obtained drugs on the international market at competitive 5 Ibid. 6 see footnote 2. 7 http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs104/en/index.html (March 2012) 8 see http://www.who.int/tb/strategy/en/ (last visited on december 5th 2012) 7 a.

ARVs for chronic hepatitis B according to an epidemiological study conducted in 2006 by Moh, there were 93 million people in china who are hepatitis b carriers.12 hepatitis b in china poses a serious public health problem. each year over a million hepatitis b infections are reported. hepatitis b is estimated to account for 280,000 deaths annually in china.13 In 1992 china implemented the Who recommendation and included hepatitis b in its vaccination programme. yet, the coverage of hepatitis b vaccination was low especially in poor and remote areas because families had to pay the cost. In 2005 hepatitis b was designated as one of the four high priority diseases for control in the country and the provision of free expanded Programme on Immunization (ePI) vaccines to infants was put in place under the new immunization regulation. china\u2019s current 5-year Program of Plan of action on health (2011-2015) sets the goal on hepatitis b prevention and control as to reduce the hbsag14 carrier rate among the general population to less than 6.5 percent by the end of 2015. the cost of routine vaccination is high and where universal immunization is a government policy as in china, it constitutes a significant expenditure in the public health budget. according to the Who, \u201cIn the mid-1990s, vaccines to provide \u2018basic\u2019 coverage for tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and measles cost about us$1 per child. Inclusion of vaccines for hepatitis b and haemophilus influenzae type b (hib), raises the vaccine cost alone to us$7-13 per child (not including administration and injection equipment) in the developing world.

In 2011, china issued the National Free Antiretroviral Treatment Handbook, revising criteria for initiation of treatment, prioritizing testing for drug resistance, in order to manage switching of drug regimens. at the end of 2011, a total of 3,142 facilities providing art were in place nationwide, located in 2,082 counties (or districts) within 31 provinces (and autonomous regions, municipalities).27 In 2011 the total number of people ever receiving and currently receiving treatment increased from 81,739 and 65,481 respectively in 2009 to 155,530 and 126,448. of these the total number of children under 15 ever receiving antiretroviral treatment was 2,788, and the number currently receiving treatment 2,322. 18,703 adults and 216 children are currently receiving second line treatment. the proportion of reported adults and children meeting treatment criteria who were receiving art treatment increased from 67.2 percent in 2010 to 76.1 percent in 2011 and the proportion remaining alive and on treatment after 12 months increased from 82.3 percent in 2009 to 86.9 percent in 2011. building on the \u2018four free, one care\u2019 policy, china issued the Guidance Regarding Strengthening Protection for Orphans in 2010, creating an initial basic welfare, treatment, recovery, education, employment and accommodation protection mechanism.28 ARV treatment regimen the first-line regimen of zidovudine (or stavudine) + lamivudine + nevirapine is provided free of charge through the national free antiretroviral therapy Programme. limited amounts of combinations of zidovudine + lamivudine (combivir) and of efavirenz are also available within the national free antiretroviral therapy Programme. Prophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child transmission consists of zidovudine from 28 weeks and during labour and a single dose of nevirapine for the mother at the beginning of labour and to the infant within 72 hours of birth. In 2011, china revised the National Free Antiretroviral Medication Handbook. the new edition contains revised guidelines on treatment initiation times, stipulating that all patients with cd4+t cell counts lower than 350/mm3 should receive treatment. Patients with cd4+t cell counts of 350- 500/mm3 who meet certain criteria were also recommended to receive treatment. all pregnant women and PlhIV within serodiscordant households were recommended to initiate treatment, regardless of their clinical phase, as defined by the Who, or cd4+t cell count.29 25 see footnote 18. 26 see footnote 2. 27 Ibid. 28 Ibid. 29 Ibid.

Work was also carried out on hIV drug resistance epidemiological monitoring, and capacity building and quality control among drug resistance testing laboratories. analysis of drug resistance shows that drug resistance amongst patients exhibiting virological failure has increased, and that the issue of drug resistance requires additional attention. at the end of 2011, 18,703 adults and 216 children were using second line treatment regimens.31 While the inclusion of tdf for first line treatment was welcomed by the health community and csos, the prohibitive price of this patented medicine is a major obstacle for access. as the number of paediatric cases increased, some paediatric drugs have been included in the plan for domestic production.32 given this important policy decision, it

In addition, because the fdc was not available in china, the regimen had to be given in separate pills. table 3 and the accompanying graph present the prices of part of arVs in china in 2011 following patent expiration of certain drugs, and negotiations with drugs companies. comparing with 2006, although reduction of prices of certain drugs, such as lPV/r, is notable, patent protection and insufficient generic competition still keep prices of the three arVs listed below much higher than the best international generic prices. especially, when china is not Intellectual ProPerty rIghts and access to affordable arVs In chIna 16 categorized by multinational pharmaceutical companies as eligible for differential pricing scheme, it is also not benefit from the lower prices from the originator.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce6625f0-c8f3-4882-aa9c-cfb457fe8c76": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce6625f0-c8f3-4882-aa9c-cfb457fe8c76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Intellectual Property Rights and Access to Affordable ARVs in China", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5fd956ea474741ff4191c09be236ce1f7ee2a60cbcfae968b1a3b111f58ec2f9"}, "2": {"node_id": "cdae177d-ea19-42e8-9cf9-20e13ca0ba31", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/intellectual-property-rights-and-access-affordable-arvs-china", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e671309ef10753d2989d815bcbe335ee4cf1d1785b9b0a5de99ab0ec7f35e825"}}, "hash": "a874cc635c3e5eb38369b4f79eb0bf000083baf40175fa464200f76f53add2d8", "text": "Table 3: Prices Comparison of Selected of ARVs in China (2011) (unit of price: us$, per patient/year) International originator lowest offer Originator offer to China Originator offer (second category of price) International lowest generic offer Chinese lowest generic offer ABC 300 mg 38236 N/A 19537 341.1138 Lopinavir/ ritonavir (heat-stable tablet) 41039 90040 100041 40242 N/A (patent) TDF 300 mg 204 396 360 76 N/A (patent) 0 500 250 750 1,000 ABC 300mg LPV/r TDF 300mg Generic ofer to China International generic lowest ofer International orginator ofer to 2nd category of countries Originator ofer to China International orginator lowest ofer Notes: 1.

For instance, for TDF, the lowest international originator price now is US$207 pp/y, and the lowest international generic price had been reduced to US$57 pp/y.43 table 4 highlights the patent status of key arVs in china as of 2010.44 given the wide range of patents granted in this field, patents may constitute a major obstacle to domestic production and import of generics and a source of high prices for arVs in the country.
