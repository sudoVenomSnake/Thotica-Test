The In every country across Asia and the Pacific, pervasive gender inequality remains a barrier to progress, justice and social stability, and deprives the region of a significant source of human potential. Inequality persists despite robust growth and progress, and cuts even deeper for poorer or otherwise excluded groups. It is time to catalyze change by focusing on institutions in three arenas\u2014economics, politics and the law. Deliberate public policy choices, combined with attitudes and assessments that favour social justice can foster progress towards gender equality. Report focuses on institutions in three arenas \u2014economics, politics and the law\u2014that can usher in far-reaching change. Each involves distinct challenges. But deliberate public policy choices, combined with attitudes and assessments that favour social justice, show these \u2018windows of opportunity\u2019 can accelerate rapid progress towards gender equality. Where Asia-Pacific Stands on Gender Equality In viewing gender equality through the \u2018lens\u2019 of human development, the Report finds that many Asia-Pacific countries have made formal commitments to this key development goal. In the region as a whole, women now live longer and are better educated. In a few countries, girls are outperforming boys in education, with a widening gap in favour of girls in tertiary schools. The gap in labour force participation is narrowing as a higher percentage of women goes to work. A handful of countries are also above global averages in women\u2019s political participation. Of equal importance, discriminatory laws have been Power, Voice and Rights A Turning Point for Gender Equality in Asia and the Pacific Overview ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2 discarded in some cases and national policies adapted to systematically pursue gender equality. Despite these achievements, Asia-Pacific lags on some aspects of gender equality in relation to other developing regions of the world\u2014and in terms of where it could be with the right attention and political commit- ment. Large disparities exist between sub- regions: While East Asia and the Pacific are pulling ahead, progress in South Asia has stalled on important issues. Indeed, South Asia\u2019s rankings for many gender gap indica- tors\u2014health, adult literacy, economic partici- pation\u2014are often close to or lower than those in sub-Saharan Africa. At the same time, Asia has the highest male-female sex ratio at birth in the world, with sex-selective abortion and infanticide leaving a trail of 96 million \u2018missing\u2019 women in some countries. Women comprise 51 per cent of the population in most regions worldwide, yet they account only for 49 per cent of the total population in Asia-Pacific. Women in the region are also more vulnerable to poverty than men, not simply because they have lower incomes, but also because their ability to access economic opportunities is constrained by discri- minatory attitudes that restrict their mobility, limit employment choices and hinder control over assets. In its rates of women\u2019s political participation, Asia-Pacific still falls short of all other regions except the Arab States. A large number of countries in the region have no laws on domestic violence. Even where domestic violence laws exist, legislation is not effectively implemented. Why Isn\u2019t Asia-Pacific Closer to Achieving Gender Equality? Asia-Pacific is behind the curve on gender equality because the efforts of individual countries have not yet been broad, deep, sustained or serious enough to undercut the severe forms of discrimination that persist. In particular, sufficient focus has not been given to the systemic economic, political and legal changes that could make progress take root on multiple fronts. Women\u2019s chronic under-representation in economic, political and legal institutions across the region has produced deficits in power and voice, which in turn allow inequa- lities to go unchallenged. Lack of knowledge contributes in no small measure to power deficits. In many countries, women may have literacy rates on par with those of men, but they may not be aware of their rights or, for various reasons, cannot exercise those rights. Many policy decisions also are still made by men; these decisions might not be the ones many women, or even some men, would make. Unquestioned attitudes shape laws, poli- cies, public institutions and their operation, even those commonly viewed as \u2018gender- neutral\u2019 that are designed to uphold equal citizenship. Where notions of women\u2019s second-class status remain entrenched, they become a steep barrier to change, often despite public policy measures and commitments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "256caa80-aee2-4a87-b6db-2af704f1ee34": {"__data__": {"id_": "256caa80-aee2-4a87-b6db-2af704f1ee34", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "181a1f759f13d32f992ca61dad1de2758a29f762b68eac559546d94213743833"}, "2": {"node_id": "a69b5159-2a73-4937-87ea-97972ff786e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b00b67245f341109bff4528b63beb02ea8e96fb61babcf45a2358ab2a5a6aba9"}}, "hash": "0e6c2f3f3cddda52bfdc399be5f4f62511efc4b3e973faf8c78f6d56dc787a94", "text": "A Asia-Pacific Often Ranks Low on Gender Indicators Asia-Pacific Often Ranks Low on Gender Indicators Asia-Pacific Often Ranks Low on Gender Indicators Asia-Pacific Often Ranks Low on Gender Indicators 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.90 1.00 1.10 Ratio of F/M life birth, 2007 expectancy", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e1f7457-3a86-4bd1-83b5-e391d376d66d": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e1f7457-3a86-4bd1-83b5-e391d376d66d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a2aafe4775e1962ee08d4b0a96d736b2c27332da9201e47965830bc3e5d5c067"}}, "hash": "a2aafe4775e1962ee08d4b0a96d736b2c27332da9201e47965830bc3e5d5c067", "text": "at Ratio of F/M adult literacy rate, 2007 Ratio of F/M secondary enrolment rate, 2006 Ratio of F/M adult f labor orce participation rate, 2007 Ratio of F/M seats held proportion of in national parlia- ments, 2008 EAP SA SSA World Note: EAP \u2013 East Asia and the Pacific, SA \u2013 South Asia, SSA \u2013 Sub-Saharan Africa.

Making institutions responsive to these needs would improve both functioning and delivery. Thus, Asia-Pacific has persistent gender deficits in both capabilities and opportunities. Women acquire fewer capabilities than men across much of the region; they still have less education and much poorer health, for example. But even when they do have capabi- lities, they face shortfalls in opportunities; such as when well-educated women end up in jobs that do not use their skills, as is often the case. The two deficits tend to reinforce each other, since capabilities are required to obtain opportunities which in turn help build capabilities. Too often, a piecemeal approach is taken to policies that could advance gender equality. This occurs in part because the issue of gender is conventionally perceived as being \u2018just about women.\u2019 But gender concerns not only women, but also men and people with other gender identities and sexual orien- tations. While the large gaps in the status of women in Asia-Pacific justify an intensive focus, achieving gender equality involves assessing all gender norms and gender per- ceptions, and how these may operate in preventing people from pursuing genuine choices and opportunities. Why Do More For Gender Equality\u2014 and Why Now? The case for gender equality is often pitched as a human rights or social justice argument, but a growing body of evidence reveals that gender equality is good economics as well. For instance, over the last 10 years the increase of women workers in developed countries is estimated to have contributed more to global growth than has China\u2019s remarkable eco- nomic record. Reaching the same level of women\u2019s labour market participation in the United States\u2014over 70 per cent\u2014would boost GDP in countries, for example, by 4.2 per cent a year in India, 2.9 per cent in Malaysia and 1.4 per cent in Indonesia. The gains would be greater where current female participation rates are the lowest. Gender equality appears as a win for women and a loss for men only if it is narrowly understood as just granting expanded benefits to women. However, if a more inclusive approach is taken, men also stand to benefit from investigating the gender norms that govern their lives. Questions can be raised about why men dominate certain hazardous forms of employment, or are more likely to die violently. Some men are more suited to relationships based on cooperation, but live in societies where they are expected to be dominant over women. These confining patterns can place tremendous strains on men, leading many to make choices in conformity with social protocols, not based on what they may genuinely want and need. Integral to respect for human diversity, gender equality supports true long-term social stability and harmony, not just a surface calm. The route to achieving cohesion can be marked by questioning, resistance and turbulence in the interim. Over time, however, this expands the space for people with all gender identities to interact and negotiate on fair grounds, providing oppor- tunities and choices for people to pursue what they value in life and to fulfil their aspirations. It supports the cultivation of strong and healthy families, and gives each child the opportunity to be born, grow and develop into adulthood. It removes sources of injustice, oppressive traditions, disaffection and dissent. As an intrinsic good, equal rights confer dignity, foster freedom and provide opportunities and choices for people to live lives they value. Democratic societies, grounded in the principle of equal citizenship and equal rights, ensure people share respon- sibilities and benefits. Restricting women\u2019s ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 4 participation and voice is inconsistent with democracy. Asia-Pacific is now better positioned than ever to make rapid progress towards gender equality. Change is in the air, in no small part because more and more people are experienc- ing the benefits of development, seeing that change is possible, and demanding more of their leaders and themselves. Demographic dynamics\u2014the large share of young people combined with a growing, consumer-oriented middle class\u2014are powerful forces that can change attitudes, nullify constricting norms and accelerate gender equality.

Institutions have improved, more resources are available, political commitment has grown, and poten- tial for changing attitudes is far greater than before. Above all, making greater progress towards gender equality in Asia-Pacific will require a number of deliberate policy steps, as this Report makes clear. Gender discrimi- nation will not decline on its own, and may not be automatically corrected in the course of development. No single policy intervention will be the \u2018magic bullet\u2019 that ends gender discrimination. The three areas chosen by the Report\u2014economics, politics and the law\u2014 must be considered in terms of how they relate to each other and how they play out across the different arenas where gender discrimination occurs. Three broad directions further frame the Report\u2019s analysis: Institu- tions have to be right, attitudes have to be in tune so that institutions function as intended, and assessments have to be continuous to reveal gaps and monitor progress. Building Economic Power All human beings, irrespective of gender, must have equal opportunities to seek out economic opportunities. People access resources and livelihoods for survival and sustenance. But beyond that, economic power helps them acquire capabilities that enlarge choices for satisfying and creative lives. As noted above, a growing body of evidence shows that gender equality is good economics. Lack of women\u2019s participation in the workforce across Asia-Pacific costs the region an estimated US $89 billion every year. Another estimate, using long-term data from 1960 to 2000, suggests that a com- bination of gender gaps in education and employment accounts annually for a signi- ficant difference of up to 1.6 percentage points in per capita growth rates between South Asia and East Asia. Over that period, East Asia made long leaps in life expectancy and education for women, while pulling a record number of them into the workplace. In turn, this sub-region grew faster than all others worldwide. Gender equality has not progressed rapidly in Asia-Pacific in part because serious barriers continue to restrict women\u2019s full entry into the economic arena. In the owner- ship and control of assets and the ability to earn incomes, two fundamental pathways to economic well-being, women still lag far behind men in much of the region\u2014and Asia- Pacific as a whole lags behind much of the rest of the world. Leveraging Assets Two dimensions\u2014ownership and control\u2014 need consideration for assets to make a mean- ingful contribution to gender equality. It is not enough for women to own an asset and then be unable to determine how it is used. Control without ownership may provide some short- term benefits, but can be a tenuous position over a longer period. In general, assets are critical to rectifying development imbalances. Certain assets\u2014land, housing, livestock, POWER, VOICE AND RIGHTS: OVERVIEW 5 common property resources, businesses, health, finances\u2014are critical because they can be leveraged to acquire other assets, sustain enterprises or diversify livelihoods. The poorest people, however, may have only health as an asset, plunging into destitution when this is weakened through hunger, illness or accident. Women\u2019s overall access to a variety of assets across Asia-Pacific is poor compared to other regions. The Food and Agriculture Organization has found that in most regions of the world women headed 20 per cent of farms; in Asia-Pacific, the figure was a mere seven per cent. Interestingly, in contrast, for as recently as 2007 more than 65 per cent of female employment was in agriculture in South Asia, with more than 40 per cent in East Asia. Patterns of ownership and control over land and other assets are diverse within the region; reflecting the fact that many practices, particularly those related to property, extend far back in time and custom. Some have arisen as part of complex social arrange- ments. For the most part, patterns of asset ownership and control make men more likely to inherit, own and manage larger stretches of land, while women\u2019s activities remain confined to small household plots. At the same time, women are more likely than men to start businesses out of need than to seize entrepreneurial opportunities. Severe gender inequality is also giving rise to heightened HIV vulnerability among women. The proportion of women among people living with HIV in Asia is growing, from 19 per cent in 2000 to 24 per cent in 2007. In South Asia, for example, more than 60 per cent of over one million HIV-positive youths aged 15-24 are women. The impact of HIV is most evident at the household level in Asia. Women as care givers, workers and surviving spouses, generally bear the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e328d7c5-2bd2-41d2-9e54-7d0ec095d9e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "e328d7c5-2bd2-41d2-9e54-7d0ec095d9e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "24d1f5d340feb2554c483395f576c57cd77679db95f2d6c998f9aabafb3bcf8c"}}, "hash": "24d1f5d340feb2554c483395f576c57cd77679db95f2d6c998f9aabafb3bcf8c", "text": "brunt of the consequences. Severe household impacts from HIV often forces women into distress situations, including sexual exploitation, that heighten their vulnerability to HIV. Most of the women living with HIV in Asia have been infected by their partners. On the death of the husband the woman is often blamed and, in the worst instances, deprived of rights to land and housing. Equal inheritance and property rights can critically improve women\u2019s ability to help prevent and cope with the impact of HIV/AIDS especially when coupled with appropriate social security schemes. Multiple ways exist for women to acquire and use assets, including through direct purchase, marriage and kinship ties, and inheritance. Yet they confront difficulties with each method: Direct purchase requires resources that many women do not have, along with supportive social norms that encourage women\u2019s ownership. Inheritance and marriage customs tend to protect the continuance of male ownership and control over assets, and may be tolerated or endorsed by legal systems. The benefits of asset ownership and control begin with economic options and extend across many other aspects of women\u2019s empowerment and well-being. Expanding access can therefore spur progress towards gender equality on multiple fronts. Women who own land, for example, have greater say in household decision-making than women without land. Asset ownership also influences fallback positions in times of crisis, whether that involves divorce, sickness, domestic violence or natural disaster. In some cases, women already play major roles in managing assets, but this has been mostly obscured by a lack of attention. Public policies that recognize these roles might build on them, both to achieve gender equality and reap economic benefits through unleashing potentials for greater productivity. Despite obstacles to credit and capital, for example, the flow of women into business in Asia- Pacific is steady; up to 35 per cent of small or ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 6 medium enterprises in the region are headed by women. Paid Work Opens Doors In recent decades, high economic growth rates and changing social norms in Asia-Pacific have brought women into the paid workforce in record numbers. Paid work is important to women for income\u2014and because it can help them cultivate new capabilities and develop a greater sense of autonomy. When paid work takes place outside the home, it can bring women into contact with new people and ideas and break restrictive social conventions. Assumptions about women\u2019s role in the labour market, reflected in the policies of many Asia-Pacific countries, however, may not actually benefit women. One assumption is that paid work of any kind can be the path out of poverty. This has fed a heavy emphasis across the region on deregulation to boost the creation of jobs, with much less focus on social protection or even the quality of employment. It has helped obscure the fact that the labour market is rife with gender inequalities, so that women in Asia-Pacific consistently end up with some of the worst, most poorly paid jobs\u2014often the ones that men don\u2019t want to do, or those assumed to be \u2018naturally\u2019 suited to women. Where these biases go unchecked, policy- making remains partially blind to the poten- tial of women in the paid workforce, as well as to the principles of fairness and equal opportunity. It may also overlook associated economic costs. East Asia, the most success- ful sub-region in Asia-Pacific in terms of growth rates, has the smallest gender gap in the world in the employment-to-population ratio, and lower segmentation of jobs by gender. A number of factors catalyze women\u2019s entrance into paid work. Improved literacy and school enrolment rates are coupled with shifting attitudes towards women\u2019s work, including growing social acceptance of women employed outside the home. Women\u2019s work can be an economic imperative for survival for individuals or families, or part of aspirations for a better life. Nonetheless, on the whole, women still fall short of men in the region in their employment rates, pay and job opportunities. Most employed women in Asia-Pacific are in vulnerable employment\u2014 broadly defined as self-employed or own- account workers and contributing family workers. These trends hold despite consider- able variations among countries. Gender also affects the types of employ- ment women can choose. In countries where men are migrating from rural areas to seek opportunities elsewhere, a growing number of women are expected to remain behind to run family farms. Recent trends show that more women from Asia-Pacific are making the move to new areas. Mobility broadens women\u2019s employment and life choices; remit- tances, as a source of foreign exchange, contribute significantly to developing econo- mies. But women migrants can be highly vulnerable", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5081ff82-a4c1-4d62-b485-bb7c8d806a0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "5081ff82-a4c1-4d62-b485-bb7c8d806a0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6eaa9811aafdca4ab4a3aa5aa8384c71f8abf06c45bf7d2fa42e0505aca8a359"}}, "hash": "6eaa9811aafdca4ab4a3aa5aa8384c71f8abf06c45bf7d2fa42e0505aca8a359", "text": "to HIV, for example, among Asian women working in parts of the Arab States. This stems from the vulnerabilities they face at different stages of the migration cycle. The isolated nature of household work in unfamiliar and harsh conditions, combined with inadequate local labour laws, put domestic workers in particular at greater risk to verbal, physical and sexual abuse. Migrants found to be HIV positive are often dismissed from their jobs and summarily deported. Strengthening the rights and conditions under which women move is essential to their health and well-being, and critical for job opportunities. Throughout Asia-Pacific, more women than men enter the service sector, possibly because of job preferences and the lower requirements for job skills compared to manufacturing, where men predominate. Service jobs also encompass many forms of POWER, VOICE AND RIGHTS: OVERVIEW 7 employment that conform to stereotypes about women\u2019s capabilities, such as nursing and care work. Still, women workers in the manufacturing industry are increasing in low- paid and subcontracting jobs. While these jobs can provide opportunities, workers are also vulnerable to the growing competitiveness faced by export-based industries such as garments. Despite laws guaranteeing equal pay for equal work, women still earn only 54 to 90 per cent of what men earn in Asia-Pacific countries. Wage gaps arise from women\u2019s predominance in lower-paid positions; inter- ruptions in their work life, often related to family concerns; and the lower valuation of typically female occupations. Other obstacles include biases of some employers and women\u2019s generally weak bargaining power. Gender wage gaps vary across countries and economic sectors and change over time, persis- ting not only in marginalized informal activi- ties, but also in professions such as computer programming, accounting and teaching. For example, female computer programmers make 80 per cent of what men do in Singa- pore, and 90 per cent in the Republic of Korea. Several factors combine to keep women in low-paying and vulnerable urban jobs. They use informal networks of neighbours, friends and relatives to find employment, often close to where they live. But neither the networks nor the location may offer diverse choices. Women in low-paying jobs also often do not have the means to build capabilities that might allow them to move to a higher level. In comparison, male workers\u2019 contacts as well as mobility are greater. In the after effects of the economic downturn, gender disparities are now also apparent in the disposability of female workers. Employers have reportedly pres- sured women to waive severance, leave and social insurance benefits, knowing they may not understand their rights or have the means to protect them. While women\u2019s paid work can make im- portant contributions to women\u2019s empower- ment, it cannot be looked at in isolation from the work that women perform at home, such as childcare, cooking, cleaning and shopping. This is usually unpaid and under-recognized, but a tremendous absorber of time and energy. Domestic care work continues to be consi- dered women\u2019s responsibility, even when women work long hours outside the home. Some feminist economists in Asia-Pacific and elsewhere have argued for calculating the value of women\u2019s unpaid domestic work to validate women\u2019s economic contributions. Development for All The obstacles to women\u2019s equal participation in Asia-Pacific economies need to be overcome as a matter of justice, and to benefit women, societies, and economies at large. The barriers are not insurmountable. Progress is coming from many directions, fueled at times by growing recognition of the potentially huge economic contributions women can make. Further steps can direct and speed up this process. Promoting Political Voice Access to the political arena is essential for men and women to articulate and shape solutions that unleash progress for them- selves and society at large. Gender equality in political participation is socially just and basic to the notion of democracy. In Asia-Pacific, women have demon- strated the political contributions they can make. They have been vibrant voices in formal political institutions such as legislatures and local governments, along with civil society activism. They have led countries, political parties and ministries. They have been part of the impetus behind political crisis and conflict, as well as processes to forge peace and social transformation. Women scholars ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 8 have contributed cutting-edge research into critical public policy questions; this is changing the way politicians and governments approach basic tasks such as budgeting. Nonetheless, despite women\u2019s desire and proven abilities to contribute in political forums, and despite rapid gains in basic human development parameters, only 18.2 per cent of legislative seats in Asia and 15.2 per cent in the Pacific are held by women.

The Pacific sub-region alone has four of the six countries in the world that have no women legislators at all. Social, political, economic and, in a few cases, legal barriers hinder women\u2019s parti- cipation in formal and informal politics, as well as in higher levels of government. These are expressed in different ways in the private and public spheres. Husbands and families convey the message that women cannot be leaders, but instead belong at home. Political parties avoid female candidates because they may come with fewer campaign resources and links to influential constituencies. In some cases, religion is used as a basis for gender- based restrictions. Quotas: Boosting the Numbers Quotas for political participation aim at providing a \u2018quick fix\u2019 to counter historical disadvantages, raising numbers in a relatively short time. Only about a third of Asia-Pacific countries have some kind of gender quota system in place for political participation. In countries without quotas, the women\u2019s parti- cipation rate in elected offices is around 14 per cent, rising to 20.4 per cent in countries that have them. Quotas should be considered for elected offices, as well as for the civil service, judiciary and other critical public leadership positions where the gender gap is wide, and growing. Despite indications of their value for improving women\u2019s political participation, quotas remain controversial across Asia- Pacific\u2014even illegal in some countries. The reasons for this are linked to social norms around gender, as well as political traditions and ideology. Fundamentally, quotas quantify sudden shifts in political power that stir resistance among those who perceive they will lose out. On the surface, quotas seem to contradict the principles of democracy and equal opportunity for all. They can be read as leading to the election of candidates based on gender, not qualifications, and as preventing the election of more qualified candidates. Arguments favouring gender quotas include the idea that quotas are not a form of discrimination but a way of compensating for the steep barriers that keep women out of office, especially at the higher levels. Women in some Asia-Pacific countries have contended that when political parties are freely allowed gender-biased choices in nominations, this in itself is undemocratic and blocks the full exercise of voters\u2019 rights. Laws are an important initial step in determining how successful a quota can be. In general, if constitutional or electoral provisions require parties to field women as a condition for access to seats, they are more likely to do so, particularly when sanctions for non-compliance are enforced. When quotas for political parties are too small or parties are allowed to adopt voluntary quotas, however, only those with an ideological commitment to gender equality are likely to comply. The numbers bear this out: In Asia- Pacific, the average number of women elected under constitutional quotas for parliaments is 23.4 per cent and 21.1 per cent under electoral regulations. Tokenism in party quotas has meant that women have about the same chance of being elected with or without them. The ingredients for effectiveness of quota systems include sound laws, well-designed quotas that match electoral systems and build POWER, VOICE AND RIGHTS: OVERVIEW 9 on political incentives, clear guidelines and timeframes, countermeasures for backlash, and sanctions for non-compliance. Another aspect entails equipping women with the knowledge and training to understand the political process and make it work for themselves and their constituents. This helps improve the quality of governance and minimize complaints about the competency of \u2018quota candidates\u2019. Not Often Invited to the Party Political parties are the gatekeepers to the political system in most Asia-Pacific coun- tries. They provide funds, mobilize voters en masse, produce and advocate for party plat- forms, and transmit an image that may have broad public recognition. Candidates who affiliate with a party essentially step into an apparatus that generally has experience in how to campaign and win. Because parties are intended to consoli- date and gain political power, much of their behaviour is oriented around this objective. Parties may view women as risky candidates, perhaps because there is a limited history of women in office and women bring fewer re- sources and political connections to the table. Women candidates tend to benefit from clearer party rules that make some attempt at treating individuals alike, regardless of gender, or that go a step further to compen- sate for exclusion. This is possible not only through active quota systems, but also rules to position women candidates in rankings on party lists where they can be elected or agreements that women should comprise a percentage of the members of party", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a27c69ef-88a5-447f-9cbf-f69a088b973d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a27c69ef-88a5-447f-9cbf-f69a088b973d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c52f4d57a2e9969a33544844e8a7b184e92440b05f6a8fb1b507406fbdaae372"}, "3": {"node_id": "773250e2-e462-4783-bc61-164edff2cf2c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45dc4d189a149fc7e6e3753b951e0d9fdc6445eb1a2054301a239de62b8e503d"}}, "hash": "a524b58fdd6a90ea844d5da31c92eb1666743495d6eef24ebe424059fc4af2d0", "text": "nomi- nating committees. Because finance is increasingly a determinant of entry to political systems, campaign financing patterns also should be reviewed both within parties and by electoral management bodies, not just in light of women\u2019s inequitable access, but also for cleaner political processes. Women\u2019s growing track record\u2014both as elected politicians and as voters\u2014can also be an argument for parties to take them more seriously. In some cases, the perceptions of voters on the value of women in politics may be further ahead than those of mainstream politicians. Yet both inside and outside poli- tical systems, women need to see that they can and should participate, aim for high positions and make a difference that is mean- ingful to them and their societies. Supporting women\u2019s knowledge, capacity and interest in public positions can come through high- quality mentoring programmes or other opportunities to build their skills. Encourag- ing men\u2019s involvement could also expand political support for women. Achieving More Inclusive Elections Electoral systems operate within a complex web of their own rules, along with social norms and political practices. Electoral rules are considered easier and faster to change in favour of gender equality than cultural norms that hold women back, although both must be addressed. Parties can make more funds available to women and adjudicate how money can be raised and spent. Controls on campaign financing can also cut patron-client relationships where elected politicians end up dishing out favours, typically at public ex- pense, for large donors. As a general principle, men, women and societies as a whole benefit from well-managed elections that are more inclusive and prevent factions from using violence or corruption for political benefit. Election rules can facilitate efforts of civil society or educational groups to advocate around gender equality in a politically neutral way\u2014through voter education or training on gender equality for male and female candi- dates and parties from all backgrounds. Women Participate in War and Contribute to Peace Women play surprising roles during and after ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 10 conflict\u2014surprising because their presence is large and mostly ignored. In non-state armies they face living conditions and risks similar to those of men. Conflict can intersect with the issue of women\u2019s political participation in several ways, including challenging tradi- tional norms. Women may have specific in- sights into the causes of conflict, its resolution and moving towards peace. Many of the skills they acquire in war can be transferred to good use in peacetime. Post-conflict periods offer opportunities for peacetime political agreements that dis- rupt past patterns of dominance, often by select groups of men. They have the promise of more egalitarian representation for both women and men. Women survive specific forms of violence that need to be considered in reconciliation processes, but their needs are frequently overlooked. This threatens the stability of communities, especially when large numbers of men have been killed. It also hinders prospects for national recovery and long-term development. Some post-conflict countries have made laudable efforts to expand women\u2019s political role, starting with high-level positions in peace processes. Peace agreements offer opportu- nities to advance an agenda of inclusiveness, democratic reform and gender equality, in- cluding through the demonstration effect of women\u2019s participation. Initiatives designed to reach them can include psychological support and help them transfer their wartime capabi- lities into marketable and socially productive skills. Transformation Through Participation Asia-Pacific\u2019s record on women\u2019s political participation falls short of its development achievements and ambitions. A handful of countries can claim significant progress at national and local levels, but again, the region as a whole lags behind much of the world. Women\u2019s political participation should be part of a broader aim for societies that are democratic, stable and grounded in genuinely equal citizenship. If a wide cross-section of women can come to the political table, they will bring new perspectives, talents and inte- rests to decision-making. Politics and policy- making might become more responsive to a more inclusive array of public concerns\u2014and more complete in decisions about the use of public resources. At first this may not be easy. But by deepening democracy, it can lead to transformation for citizens at large.

Most legal systems in Asia-Pacific have been buffeted by competing influences\u2014from colonialism to domestic demands to inter- national human rights standards. This ex- plains in part why many have ended up with contradictory or archaic statutes and discri- minatory practices. But in the drive towards human development, and in the embrace of modern societies grounded in the principle of equal citizenship, more attention needs to be paid to how the law holds women back and how this can constrain further advancements for women, men, and societies at large. The region falls far short of where it could be on basic issues such as protecting women from violence, upholding entitlements to pro- perty, or even allowing people to divorce in an informed and reasonable way. Two barriers are in place: The first comes from the POWER, VOICE AND RIGHTS: OVERVIEW 11 construction of laws themselves, which may be overtly discriminatory, full of gaps or contradictory. The second barrier is restricted access to the legal system and to justice within it. This involves all the reasons that women\u2014 because they are women\u2014may not go to police or the court or other mechanisms for justice, or may not find equal treatment even if they do. Shortfalls in the Substance of the Law All legal systems draw on certain basic principles. Three principles outlined by the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) are particularly relevant to gender equality and have been articulated in most Asia-Pacific constitutions; these are State obligation, the principle of equality, and non-discrimination. When these principles are poorly or generally defined, as is the case in many of the consti- tutions, they give court systems wide latitude in interpretation, including ways that can perpetuate discrimination. One result is gaps in legal systems on issues related to women and gender equality. An area in Asia-Pacific where gaps in laws are wide and longstanding is violence against women. In South Asia, nearly half of the countries have no law on domestic violence; in the Pacific the situation is even worse, with more than 60 per cent of countries without relevant legislation. In East Asia, meanwhile, more than three-fourths of countries have drafted legislation on domestic abuse, some within the past few years. Still, many coun- tries lack sanctions for gender-based violence or narrowly define the circumstances under which it may take place. Discriminatory laws are often justified as stemming from gender differences. Some- times this is the case with protective labour legislation that attempts to steer women away from jobs deemed unsafe for them. Some are unconscious holdovers from the past; others reinforce ongoing gender stereotypes about a woman\u2019s physical or mental ability, or simply her capability to work outside the domestic sphere. Some Asia-Pacific countries have statutes that single out women in different communi- ties that may follow their own personal laws, mainly influenced by religion. Family, property and inheritance laws are among those most prone to following diverse legal paths. This lack of standardization explains in part why Asia has more reservations to CEDAW related to \u2018compatibility with traditional codes\u2019 than any other region in the world. By comparison, Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, along with Latin America, have no reservations on these grounds. Access to Justice Depends on Gender A variety of factors come into play in reducing women\u2019s access to judicial systems. Courts may be far away, and transportation is often less available to women. Sometimes social conventions dictate that women should not leave their homes or travel or be active in public spheres. Because women at large are responsible for a disproportionate share of household tasks, they may be less able than men to take time for complicated legal pro- cesses and repeated meetings with lawyers. If they work for wages, as noted, they will generally be paid less than men and confront poorer working conditions. This, in turn, likewise reduces the affordability and raises the risks of spending time on legal matters. Women may face physical threats, including violence, if pursuing a legal remedy involves challenging their husbands, other family members, or even the broader status quo. They may fear losing children or eco- nomic sustenance. They themselves may have internalized discriminatory norms that insist on women remaining quiet and suffering in ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 12 sexual acts. Discriminatory rules for trial procedures and evidence diminish or distort women\u2019s voice in court in a number of Asia- Pacific countries. One of the most obvious ways in which courts fail women is when they are reluctant to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b40432f3-1590-4afb-ac94-601b5ef22ed9": {"__data__": {"id_": "b40432f3-1590-4afb-ac94-601b5ef22ed9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "10944677c831f4ac7e5ac53a39c35dc176925987cb159cdd7089e6838356c5c9"}}, "hash": "10944677c831f4ac7e5ac53a39c35dc176925987cb159cdd7089e6838356c5c9", "text": "uphold judgments or pursue crimes against women.

Use the Law to Tear Down Gender Barriers For women to have equal access to oppor- tunities for human development, including those that come through political and econo- mic power and voice, they must enjoy equal rights and protection under the law. This is not currently the case in any Asia-Pacific country. Even those states that have tried to remove overtly discriminatory statutes still have gaps in laws and legal practices that fail to check gender biases. Divorce, inheritance, gender-based violence, labour rights, rules of evidence, citizenship\u2014the list of legal issues that deserve immediate attention is long and worrisome. Yet the gaps can be narrowed and at some point eliminated, as some countries are begin- ning to demonstrate. Recognizing that the law cannot claim to be fully impartial is an impor- tant step forward. The law deeply influences development in different ways and also shapes the outcomes of many non-legal interventions. The legal process and the law thus need to be crafted in ways that genuinely advance gender equality. Laws and legal practices, de jure and de facto alike, need to be designed and imple- mented in ways that tear down gender silence, and that define women as being less and deserving less. Women across Asia-Pacific who do find the means to turn to judicial mechanisms to resolve disputes\u2014whether state courts, the police, lawyers, or local resources\u2014still face obstacles. Judicial practices are also subject to discriminatory social norms that do not acknowledge women\u2019s rights or concerns, or treat them seriously or fairly. Legal complexities that require onerous court proceedings represent one reason that women fail to obtain justice. For example, beyond the fact that men\u2019s reasons for divorce are often taken more seriously than women\u2019s, most countries in Asia-Pacific have a fault- based divorce system. This requires a process of proving charges such as adultery, desertion for a required number of years, willful refusal to consummate the marriage, habitual cruelty and so on. The parties must hire lawyers, file court cases and bring witnesses to court to provide supporting evidence\u2014a tremendous burden, particularly for poor and rural women. Throughout the region, the stark reality of economic inequality appears when women struggle to obtain custody of their children during divorce. Some countries follow the principle of acting in the \u2018best interests of the child,\u2019 often interpreted in terms of financial advantages that mostly belong to men. Women typically start out at a financial disadvantage because they have less education and access to jobs and assets, or may have been econo- mically dependent on the men they want to divorce. Court systems continue to carry out procedural indignities that can leave women doubly victimized. While more countries in the region are moving to non-public trials for sensitive issues such as rape and domestic violence, women may still be expected to narrate their experiences in great detail, including to male personnel in cultures with strong taboos against public discussion of POWER, VOICE AND RIGHTS: OVERVIEW 13 barriers. This does not imply a kind of legal favouritism for women and other margina- lized groups. But it requires acknowledging, at the minimum, that if people cannot even get to court or will be judged mainly on their gender, then justice is not being served. Legal reform cannot be limited to fixing the laws when compliance cannot be taken for granted. Countries in the region have made com- mitments to equality before the law and to banning discrimination through their cons- titutions, the supreme law of the land. Progressive legal initiatives, both judicial and legislative, testify to intended advances in gender equality. The promise of these mile- stone legal achievements should be upheld, as in the end that is what matters. Towards Equal Power and Voice Thus, Asia-Pacific finds itself at a defining moment. Many more people today are aware of the benefits of gender equality, for indivi- duals and societies. It is time to catalyze this change by moving beyond partial attempts to achieve it. This calls for deliberately strengthening policies and programmes on women\u2019s empowerment, including by embed- ding gender analysis as a routine requirement for framing them. Full political and legal backing then can make them central to\u2014and transformative of\u2014the broader mainstream.

Many institutions in Asia-Pacific maintain discriminatory patterns because they are acceptable, invisible or against the interests of powerful groups. Transforming institutions goes beyond traditional gender mainstreaming exercises, which have often had little impact because they have simply treated gender as an \u2018add-on\u2019 to existing institutions that do not, in the end, genuinely serve the cause of gender equality. Trans- formational mainstreaming implies looking at the places where power, wealth, knowledge, capabilities and rights intersect, and aligning these with principles of equality and justice rather than allowing the status quo to go unchecked. For transformation to be sustained, attitudes also must change, both within institutions and in society at large. As long as women continue to be viewed as somehow less than equal citizens, progress will be limited. Assessing gaps and change through measurement is part of both transforming institutions and changing attitudes because it reveals what is actually taking place. Many gender equality issues have been simply obscured because they are not measured. An Agenda for Action While individual Asia-Pacific countries have their own choices and needs in pursuing gender equality, some overarching strategies are common to all. The following eight recom- mendations summarize broad directions for action across the three areas covered in the Report. 1. Make international commitments a reality. Countries should ratify and use interna- tional conventions that promote human rights, respect for diversity and equality for all. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides a foundation that was made specific to gender equality in CEDAW. Particular attention should be paid to removing the region\u2019s high number of reservations to CEDAW, paving the way for bringing domestic legislation in line with it. Both protective and em- powering measures should be integrated into policies and practices. 2. Craft economic policies to support gender equality. Too often, the gender-blind nature of economic policy-making results in choices that deny women opportu- nities, even if they are not intended to do ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 14 so. A more deliberate focus on gender and how it affects women\u2019s economic options is required\u2014particularly in targeting poverty interventions to provide equal opportunities for women and men. Governments should ensure that fiscal and monetary policies help unleash women\u2019s leadership and entrepreneur- ship. Monetary policy can be attuned to be more supportive of inclusive growth and human development\u2014for example, through directed lending to poor women for productive purposes. Fiscal policy should include gender-based budgeting, covering revenues and expenditures across all budget categories. 3. Make the content of education more gender- equal. Because education systems still perpetuate gender stereotypes, national and local governments should develop awareness of gender in such systems, such as through teacher training. Civil society groups and gender experts can be brought in to guide the assessment and development of textbooks and question materials that overtly enforce stereotypes or do so by omission. Schools should promote female leadership and active decision-making, in part, to provide positive role models to girls. 4. Boost political participation. Legislatures, political parties and political leaders should recognize the importance of women\u2019s political participation to demo- cracy and equal citizenship. Special actions to boost the number and quality of female representatives and women in upper echelons of government might include quotas, political party reform, gender-orientation and capacity develop- ment. All these measures need to be approached in the spirit of genuine change, avoiding tokenism or mani- pulation for political gain. National and sub-national political leaders should assure better gender balance in leadership across all aspects of crisis management, whether involving natural disasters, con- flicts or a sustained economic downturn. 5. Pursue gender-equitable laws. Parlia- ments can benefit from reforming gender discriminatory laws and making new ones where needed. This should include ironing out discrepancies between custo- mary and formal laws that perpetuate discrimination, as well as gaps between laws and constitutional principles. Coun- tries should have gender-specific consti- tutional provisions on equality and non- discrimination. This will narrow the wide latitude of interpretation currently en- joyed by courts and law enforcement agencies. Legal systems should be sub- jected to an overall gender equality review of national legislation, as some countries have done, including for CEDAW comp- liance. 6.

Civil society, the media, academic institutions, religious organizations, businesses and other groups involved in shaping social POWER, VOICE AND RIGHTS: OVERVIEW 15 attitudes should be enlisted in influencing them to support gender equality. Concrete advocacy tools can be developed and new channels of advocacy and communication explored. A strong push should be made to include men in the understanding of gender equality and steps to achieve it, recognizing their transformative role. Making Change Take Root Piecemeal implementation of this gender equality Agenda for Action in Asia-Pacific will not be adequate. Instead, progress towards gender equality requires deep, concerted efforts within each of the eight focus areas. This agenda for change needs to be put in place simultaneously on the economic, legal and political fronts, bearing in mind connec- tions among the three, and maintained over time. Boundaries need to be pushed so that changes take root and begin to generate their own momentum. Increased gender equality is central to achieving human development in the region, so that people at large can make choices and have access to capabilities and opportunities to lead fulfilling lives. These should never be taken away or diminished solely on the basis of gender. Human development rests on the principles of equality and parti- cipation. It is the only route forward that is efficient and sustainable\u2014and extends justice to all. CHAPTER 1: A CASE FOR GENDER EQUALITY 19 A Case for Gender Equality In every country across Asia and the Pacific, pervasive gender inequality remains a barrier to progress, justice and social stability, and deprives the region of a significant source of human potential. In fact, there is hardly any country of the world1 where women have the same or better opportunities overall as men. Inequality persists despite economic, political and social changes, rapid globalization and robust growth\u2014and cuts even deeper for poorer or otherwise excluded groups. It is a global challenge flagged by the Beijing Decla- ration and Platform for Action 1995 and embedded in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). With the world only five years away from the 2015 deadline for reaching the goals, and a 15-year review of the Beijing initi- atives in progress, achieving gender equality is more relevant than ever. Yet today, Asia-Pacific is at a crossroads: Whether gender equality is pushed aside or pursued with greater energy, amid the after effects of the recent global economic down- turn, depends on actions taken or not taken now by governments and other stakeholders. A conjunction of forces is throwing up opportunities and challenges\u2014progress in the economic, social, health and gender realms; rising inequality; some gender equality rever- sals; a growing young population that is seeing the bridging of education gaps; a bulging middle class with significant spending power; and further economic liberalization and Gender inequality limits choices for women and men, and puts a brake on human development. Pervasive gender inequality in Asia and the Pacific deprives the region of a significant source of human potential. The case for gender equality, though often viewed as a human rights or social justice argument, is also good economics. Gender equality promotes prosperity and enhances the well-being of societies. globalization. While the economic downturn is especially high on public policy agendas, it should not be seen as an excuse to delay gender equality, but rather as an opportunity to promote long term progress and stability. Women, in particular, face increased hard- ship during such periods, and the present one is no exception: The \u2018down\u2019 phase of econo- mic cycles constricts policy space even more tightly and reduces available resources, with significant implications for women and other disadvantaged groups. But over the long run, consistent support for reversing gender inequalities can reduce these groups\u2019 vulner- ability to economic distress. This Regional Human Development Report makes clear that gender inequality limits choices for women and men, and puts a brake on human development. The Report responds to demands from within Asia and the Pacific for current analysis exploring links between gender and human development, and for considering how this can be far better reflected in public policy- making. Gender encompasses all aspects of life, but the following chapters deliberately focus on institutions in three arenas\u2014economics, politics and the law\u2014that can usher in far- reaching change. Each of these involves distinct challenges.

Throughout history, women have strug- gled for equality. By the 20th Century, aspira- tions for a range of freedoms were enshrined in numerous international conventions and declarations, which have established norms and obligate States Parties to promote equal rights for women and men. For example, Article 2 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights reads: \u2018Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex\u2026.\u20192 The interna- tional Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) links the equality of opportunities, secured by a framework of laws, policies and institutions, with the equality of outcomes.3 The empowerment of women is not a \u2018Western\u2019 notion, foreign to Asian and Pacific cultures. Nor is it the result of recent globalization. Historical records and folklore from the region show that women exercised power and influence, and demonstrated intelligence and creativity, much before feminist ideas came into the global political discourse. Is There a Common Understanding of Gender Equality? The concept of equality in general, and gender equality in particular, is complex. Numerous debates have taken place on how to define and achieve equality. This Report advocates that equality is based on fairness in freedoms and choices and is inherent to the idea of human development. Gender equality does not imply that all women and men must be the same. Instead, it entails equipping both with equal access to capabilities, so that they have the freedom to choose opportunities that improve their lives. It means that women have equal access to resources and rights as men, and vice versa. The concept encompasses the notion that all people are inherently valuable, and that historical disadvantage, unequal access, social position and discrimination based on gender need to be taken into account in policies, plans and programmes. Gender-based inequalities are sometimes justified on grounds of maintaining a given \u2018order\u2019. In other contexts throughout history, prioritizing \u2018order\u2019 over justice has been used to limit basic capabilities for some people. This has led to grave injustices \u2013 \u2018untouchability\u2019 based on caste, colonialism, apartheid and slavery are extreme examples. Centuries of human experience show that \u2018order,\u2019 which does have a value, cannot be sustained unless it is grounded in fairness. Yet modern states, based on ideas of equal citizenship, cannot envisage second-class citizens or sub-citizens. If something is a human right, it should be a legitimate right for all. The decision about conferring such a right should not be made by any nation, society, community or family\u2014it is inherent to being human. Societies cannot successfully pursue human development in the absence of gender equality; such an approach is not sustainable, equitable, just or morally defensible. Limiting participation based on gender leads to partial information and incomplete solutions. Overall public good is undermined, even when some in privileged positions reap advantages. Gender equality is essential to advancing the lives of women and other people marginalized by gender, but it also benefits society as a whole. Every society can improve its record on gender equality by embedding appropriate steps in its legal, political and economic institutions. Yet results are often mixed; entrenched attitudes, hardened values and historical privileges can all stand in the way. Public policy-making has taken several approaches. Narrowly interpreting equality as \u2018non-discrimination\u2019 means treating males Equality is based on fairness in free- doms and choices and is inherent to the idea of human development CHAPTER 1: A CASE FOR GENDER EQUALITY 21 Whatever the form and wherever it may take place, gender inequality cuts across all countries, regardless of the level of economic development.

As one of the so-called top recipients of trafficked women, the Japanese Government has taken steps to cope with this trans-border gender issue in 2004. In the following year, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, a protocol to the Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, was ratified. The Gender Equality Office was upgraded to the Gender Equality Bureau in the Cabinet Office in 2000, serving as Japan\u2019s national machinery and insti- tutional mechanism for the promo- tion of gender equality. To implement the Basic Law for Gender Equal Society, the Bureau formulates a Plan of Action every five years to be approved by the Cabinet. In accordance with the Basic Law, 22 per cent of Prefectures (pro- vinces) adopted their own ordinance and 57 per cent of the local government authorities have adopted action plans to promote gender equality. 95 per cent of all Prefectures have public centres for women or for gender equality. Furthermore, the government has esta- blished a system that provides services to victims of domestic violence and gender discrimination at the work place. Achievements and challenges. Japan has been an active member of the UN Commission on the Status of Women and an eager participant in the past four World Women\u2019s Conferences and the Special Session of the General Assembly: Women 2000. The documents from these meetings have been instrumental in shaping Japan\u2019s policies for promoting gender equality. The mandatory nature of national reporting to the CEDAW Committee has kept the government and NGOs sensitized to the progress made and the challenges that remain. It is fair to say that Japan has made a considerable advancement in building the legal and institutional frameworks for promoting gender equality prior to the turn of the century. The Gender Equality Bureau, however, has expres- sed its concerns over Japan\u2019s Gender Empowerment Measure ranking by UNDP, Japan being 58th among 108 countries in 2008, while it was the 8th on HDI (out of 179) and the 12th (out of 157) on GDI scales. What is there to bring such a large gap between HDI and GEM? It is now clear that economic development is not necessarily a pre- condition for gender equality. Inter- estingly Japan\u2019s ranking on GEM shows a downward trend since 2001, but its values have slightly increased. This means that those countries which made statistical data available for GEM calculation in the past decade had higher values than Japan. Although women\u2019s full access to education has long been achieved, particularly on the primary and the secondary levels, higher education has not generally prepared women to enter career tracks and professional paths. The Japanese Government admits that the pace of advancement towards gender equality by the international standard has been slow and that latecomers advanced faster in a short period of time. Japan\u2019s ranking on the Gender Gap Index (developed by the World Economic Forum) is 98th among 130 countries in 2008. Critical variables used in both GEM and GGI are extremely low for Japan in comparison with many other countries. These are as follows: 1) the estimated earned income; 2) the ratio of female professional and technical workers, legislators, senior officials and managers; and 3) women in parliament and in ministerial positions. Japan obviously lags greatly behind other countries despite the impression that women\u2019s visibility in society has increased over the years. What are the reasons for continued gender gaps in economics and politics? The main reason for gender gap in the labour force participation is the disrupted work career of women owing to childcare. Surveys on the pattern of women\u2019s labour force participation have shown a continued trend of the so-called M- shaped curve, indicating a distinct drop in women\u2019s labour force participation among those in the child-rearing age brackets. The number one reason for women disrupting their careers and leaving the work is \u2018childcare\u2019. Despite the high rate of women workers using their legal rights to take the parental leave, particularly in the private sector, many of them do not or can not return to the same job they left behind because of the work conditions and the corporate culture, but also the shortage of support for childcare. It is hard for women with small children to get husband\u2019s support partly because some men and their parents still believe that mothers are responsible for childcare, and partly because of long work hours particularly of men who are in the life stage of parenting small children.

This requires legisla- tion that is gender-neutral. Here the focus is on equal treatment, but without adequate attention to wide gaps in outcomes and the fact that males and females can face very different circumstances. For example, policies aiming at equal enrollment of boys and girls in schools may not guarantee the same level of participation, performance or completion. Restricted female mobility, the burden of un- paid household work, or norms about female segregation can lead to large gender gaps. The \u2018protectionist\u2019 approach acknow- ledges male-female differences and qualifies different treatment based on gender. This approach emphasizes gender-based social values, often considering women as weak and subordinate and men as strong and domi- neering. While the weak certainly require protection in all societies, policies should not systematically create the \u2018weak\u2019 by limiting capabilities for one gender and then endea- vouring to protect them. Such policies may be well-intentioned; nevertheless, perhaps unconsciously, they penalize women or reinforce stereotypes about their capacities. Prohibitions on night work or restrictions on overseas employment opportunities are examples. The \u2018corrective\u2019 approach to gender equality recognizes that different genders can experience the same institutions differently. Laws, policies and budgets, for example, affect men and women in dissimilar ways. The \u2018corrective\u2019 approach is concerned with equality in institutions, but focuses much more on outcomes. It aims to ensure that imbalances are progressively redressed.4 Without adequate attention to wide gaps in outcomes, males and females can face very different circumstances young fathers are willing to share the childcare responsibility, they have little time to spend at home. Therefore, women who wish to continue the work career may reluctantly avoid the risk of having more than one child, if any. Those who have a choice of continuing their work and going up the ladder for higher positions are single or childless or are regular employees who are able to find resources for childcare. This is possibly one reason why women make up only 10 per cent of those in managerial positions today. Income is related to the duration of work career and the position at work. Underlining these facts is the strong gender norm defining men as breadwinner/producer and women as housewife/caregiver. Only 11 per cent of seats in Parlia- ment (the Lower House of the Diet) are held by women in 2008. The culture of political parties, the electoral system, the perception of the voters, and limited resources\u2014including a lack of training accessible by women to run for public offices\u2014all contribute to the low parti- cipation of women in public decision- making. Overcoming gender passing and gender bashing. The majority of the country\u2019s population does not understand the concept of gender equality. Therefore, flagging \u2018gender equality\u2019 as an in-depth and serious concern would not gain positive reactions easily at this point in time. Indifference or \u2018gender passing\u2019, so-to-speak, could take place. On the other hand, when anti-gender-equality minded people took over the leadership positions, there were tormenting waves of \u2018gender bashing\u2019 against gender- related policies. Under these circumstances, it helps to pay attention to the government\u2019s policy priorities. One is \u2018violence against women and children\u2019 and the other is \u2018work and life balance.\u2019 There are two different kinds of thought and rationale for the general acceptance of these gender-related policies. The first is a type of paternalism which evokes a sense of sympathy towards the victims. This is not a rights-based approach, but it is a successful case of bringing a private issue to a public domain of national concern. The second is an utilitarian rationale which advocates gender equality as an instrument to achieve another goal which is a major policy matter specific to the country. The need to balance work and life are voiced by women, men and some business sectors for different reasons, but mea- sures are taken with support from the business sector.

CHAPTER 1: A CASE FOR GENDER EQUALITY 23 This Report advocates the \u2018corrective\u2019 approach to gender equality, aiming for justice by recognizing that people\u2019s develop- ment options are related to their gender. It argues against development exclusion identi- fiable along gender lines. People who make and influence policies must argue on behalf of recognizing current circumstances as well as historical disadvantages. No society can be fair and just\u2014regardless of culture, history, ethnicity or religion\u2014if freedoms and choice for all people are not a reality. This can only be accomplished if men, women and those with other gender identities can take equal rights for granted. This position is, of course, difficult to maintain and pursue in countries where men have been privileged historically, and where traditional practices continue to be invoked to keep women tied to conven- tional roles. Where Asia-Pacific Stands on Gender Equality In viewing gender equality through the lens of human development, the Report finds that many countries in Asia and the Pacific have made formal commitments to this key deve- lopment goal that has spurred progress. In the region as a whole, women now live longer and are better educated. In a few countries, girls are outperforming boys in education, with a widening gap in favour of girls in tertiary schools. The gap in labour force participation is narrowing, as a higher per- centage of women are now going to work; some, as migrant workers, have begun making huge contributions to remittances, which are important for both their families and national economies. A handful of countries are above global averages in women\u2019s political parti- cipation. Of equal importance, discriminatory laws have been discarded in some cases and national policies adapted to systematically pursue gender equality.5 Yet despite these achievements, Asia- Pacific lags behind on several key aspects of gender equality in relation to other developing regions6\u2014and in terms of where it could be with the right attention and political commitment. Large disparities exist between sub-regions as well. While East Asia and the Pacific are pulling ahead, progress in South Asia has stalled on some important issues. More data will be presented throughout the following chapters, but some highlights suggest where the region stands on basic capabilities required for gender equality and human development. Overall, women remain hindered by barriers in many areas of daily life. In the region, South Asia\u2019s rankings for many gender gap indicators are often close to or lower than those in sub-Saharan Africa, such as health, adult literacy and economic participation (Figure 1.1). Political participa- tion of women shows the largest gaps. Females cannot take survival for granted: Asia has the highest male-female sex ratio at birth in the world, with sex-selective abortion and infanticide leaving approxi- mately 96 million missing women in seven Figure 1.1: Asia-Pacific Often Ranks Low on Figure 1.1: Asia-Pacific Often Ranks Low on Figure 1.1: Asia-Pacific Often Ranks Low on Figure 1.1: Asia-Pacific Often Ranks Low on Gender Indicators Gender Indicators Gender Indicators Gender Indicators Note: EAP \u2013 East Asia and the Pacific, SA \u2013 South Asia, SSA \u2013 Sub-Saharan Africa.

Across the region, women head only seven per cent of farms, for example, compared to around 20 per cent in most regions of the world.13 Women in East Asia and the Pacific, at 66.7 per cent, are above the global average labour force participation14 rate of 52.7 per cent.15 But South Asian women are far behind, at 35.7 per cent, a statistic that has remained almost unchanged since 1995.16 Asia-Pacific also remains short of almost all other regions in rates of women\u2019s political participation, and higher only than the Arab States. Women in South Asia enjoy higher rates of parliamentary participation than those in East Asia, which is at par with sub- Saharan Africa. The Pacific has four of the six countries in the world with no women legislators.17 Large numbers of women in Asia-Pacific are among the four billion people who are globally excluded from access to justice.18 Many countries maintain different evidential requirements for men and women, including on corroborating sexual offences. Nearly half the countries in South Asia and more than 60 per cent of those in the Pacific have no laws on domestic violence, despite the wide- spread prevalence of this stark violation of women\u2019s rights.19 Even in countries where domestic violence laws exist, they are not effec- tively implemented. Laws and policies to opera- tionalize CEDAW also are not taken seriously. Why Isn\u2019t Asia-Pacific Closer to Achieving Gender Equality? Asia-Pacific is behind the curve on gender equality because the efforts of individual countries have not yet been broad, deep, sustained or serious enough to undercut the severe forms of discrimination that persist. In particular, sufficient focus has been lacking on the systemic economic, political and legal changes that could make progress take root on multiple fronts. Several factors explain the shortfall. Deficits in Power Throughout Asia and the Pacific, women\u2019s movements initially found inspiration, energy and resources from women\u2019s significant participation in the independence and freedom movements during de-colonization, which brought large numbers of them into public life as political actors and participants. Often, this engagement evolved into a struggle for equal rights. As with all democratic gains, however, both advances and reversals have occurred. Women\u2019s chronic under-representation in economic, political and legal institutions across the region has produced deficits in power and voice, which in turn allow inequa- Asia-Pacific is behind the curve on gender equality because the efforts of individual countries have not yet been broad, deep, sustained or serious enough CHAPTER 1: A CASE FOR GENDER EQUALITY 25 lities to go unchallenged. Lack of knowledge contributes in no small measure to power deficits. In many countries, women may have literacy rates at par with those of men\u2014but they may not be aware of their rights or, for various reasons, cannot exercise those rights. For example, a woman physically abused by her husband may not seek redress if she is unaware of domestic violence legislation in her country. Moreover, even if she is aware, social pressure and stigma may prohibit her from exercising her rights. Resistance to women\u2019s advancements comes from many sources, from women as well as men, and takes many forms. Patri- archy represents a dominant source of such resistance, where systems of social organiza- tion are fundamentally structured around the idea of men\u2019s superiority.20 Many policy decisions and choices are still made by men. These decisions might not be the ones many women, or even some men, would make. Gaps in Capabilities and Opportunities As with deficits in power, Asia-Pacific experi- ences persistent gender deficits in both capa- bilities and opportunities. Women acquire fewer capabilities than men across much of the region\u2014they still have less education and much poorer health, for example.

Gender Is Not Just About Women Too often, a piecemeal approach is taken to policies that could advance gender equality. This occurs in part because gender is con- ventionally perceived as being \u2018just about women\u2019. Typically, the issue is shunted off to a women\u2019s ministry or department, with few resources and limited visibility, and ignored in mainstream policy frameworks. But gender concerns women, men and people with other gender identities and sexual orientations.21 This wide range includes heterosexual and homosexual men and women; people who adopt the dress and man- nerisms of other gender identities (tran- sexuals); people who choose to change their sex (transgender people); and intersex per- sons, i.e. those born with atypical genitalia. All should be full and equal partners in the process towards human development.22 While the large gaps in the status of women in Asia-Pacific justify an intensive focus, achieving gender equality involves assessing all gender norms and perceptions, and how these may operate in preventing people from pursuing genuine choices and opportunities. Can Some Things Not Change? One common understanding of gender is that it is \u2018static\u2019, or set at birth, based on male or female genitals and chromosomes.23 This leads to policy-making that either enshrines notions of biological difference or ignores possibilities for intervention because \u2018things are the way they are\u2019. Interestingly, some parts of the region seem to have an opportu- nistic view of gender, holding one view or the other as convenient\u2014for example, feminism Gender concerns women, men and people with other gender identities and sexual orientations ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 26 is criticized as a \u2018Western import\u2019, even as sports such as cricket are soundly embraced. Then some traditions accept no other gender identities besides male and female, which are fixed based on biological sex assigned at birth. Yet, while biology plays a role in who people are and what they may do, gender encompasses notions constructed by societies and individuals, beyond biological sex. Even if these are deeply rooted in social norms, they can\u2014and have\u2014shifted over time as people explore new human possibilities and freedoms. Both the tendency to hold on to traditional attitudes and the desire for exploration are evident in Asia-Pacific today. Some countries in the region are opening to the voices of people from a broader spectrum of gender identities, giving them space to air views and demands. Social Norms and Attitudes Numerous influences have shaped attitudes towards gender across Asia and the Pacific, along with the policies and public institutions that perpetuate gender equality gaps. Diverse sources of tradition, including those expres- sed through religion, both support and constrain gender equality. Some date back thousands of years. These traditions coexist, uneasily at times, with the remnants of colonial systems of law and politics, and with today\u2019s imperatives of globalization and rapid change. Conflict, natural disasters and climate change add other elements\u2014globally, the region is home to the greatest incidence of natural disasters. Every society, regardless of where it has come from or where it hopes to go, has ideas about what men and women should be and do. Some of these support gender equality, some do not. They can be firmly embedded in history and tradition, and intertwined with notions of perceived order, family and sur- vival. They can be valuable to social cohesion, but hard to discard even with evidence that they may be harmful or unsuited to present ways of living as defined by diverse societies. Unquestioned attitudes shape laws, poli- cies and public institutions, including those commonly viewed as \u2018gender-neutral\u2019, and render them blind to distinct gender needs while erecting steep barriers to change. Where notions of women\u2019s subordinate status remain entrenched, they become a steep bar- rier to change, often despite public policy mea- sures and commitments intended to support gender equality. A seemingly \u2018neutral\u2019 entity can also function in a prejudicial way because of institutional \u2018blindness\u2019 to distinct gender needs. Making these institutions responsive to these needs would improve both function- ing and delivery. Countries in Asia and the Pacific are rife with examples of how this works: Laws perpetuate gender inequalities through speci- fic discriminatory provisions or by omission, and at times run counter to anti-discrimi- nation clauses in constitutions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbac793c-40f4-4013-a69e-43e4733cf265": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbac793c-40f4-4013-a69e-43e4733cf265", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e3e7e42a1a8dc44852cc98fb47aee04fa4382815aba57f14dd9c99ddd20f85e"}, "2": {"node_id": "befabd87-5eb1-410b-97db-c651bf8f75eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e9fe9e66567695e1addbf94728401a3fafae2953eceeae55ae5a7be9004d433"}}, "hash": "5133268e44f7efceb205e8aa5c123b95cc638e9acbabc8e956d99f5b07ebe873", "text": "Inheritance practices upheld by custom and/or law pre- vent women from gaining ownership of land and other assets.

Equality Is Good Economics \u2018The challenge of increasing the economic growth of a country is \u2026 to a considerable extent linked Unquestioned attitudes shape laws, policies and public institutions, and render them blind to distinct gender needs CHAPTER 1: A CASE FOR GENDER EQUALITY 27 to the role played by women in the society. The costs of discrimination towards women in education and employment not only harm the women concerned, but impose a cost for the entire society.\u201924 The case for gender equality is often pitched as a human rights or social justice argument, but a growing body of evidence reveals that it is good economics as well, promoting prosperity and enhancing the well- being of societies. In turn, rising income can affect gender equality and human deve- lopment.25 Put another way, societies and economies pay a high cost when they maintain discri- minatory attitudes and limit freedom, choices and opportunities for women and other marginalized groups. Low levels of female participation in a country\u2019s workforce constrain its growth potential. These linkages and feedback effects need to be understood if Asia-Pacific is to continue on its trajectory of rapid economic growth and development. Several studies using both microeconomic and macroeconomic data confirm that narrowing gender differentials in education and health have positive social and economic effects. Recent research has concluded that reducing the gap between male and female educational attainment will boost growth.26 Higher female educational attainment also lowers fertility rates,27 which decreases infant mortality rates and raises life expectancies.28 Many studies have concluded that increased schooling of mothers is good for child health, schooling and productivity. These benefits are higher for additional schooling for mothers than fathers.29 Meanwhile, if the labour supply is artifi- cially reduced by discrimination against women, the average ability of the active workforce is reduced.30 Women with decent work and earnings also have greater bargain- ing power in their homes, which can improve their status and lead to other growth- enhancing effects, such as increased savings rates, higher investments in children\u2019s health and education, and greater credit repay- ment.31 Commercial interests have already recognized the purchasing power of women, as demonstrated by growing diversity in products, services and advertising. Overall, rising income can contribute to reducing gender inequality, but with limita- tions. Growth does not automatically lead to gender equality: The Asia-Pacific region has several high-income countries, such as Japan, that score poorly on indicators of women\u2019s empowerment.32 This leads to a larger point: No single measure itself is sufficient to take on entrenched and persistent gender inequalities. Policies to stimulate growth must be accompanied by measures to change norms that block women\u2019s progress. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) make these interrelationships obvi- ous. The third Goal, fostering gender equality and empowering women, is monitored through tracking the ratio of girls to boys in education, the share of women in non-agri- cultural wage employment and the proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments. This Goal is in fact central to the attainment of all other MDGs, as countries aim to end poverty and hunger, universalize schooling, ensure better child and maternal health, combat HIV/AIDS and achieve other core development objectives. Genuinely equal access to opportunities and resources, regardless of gender, is key. Equality Benefits Both Women and Men If gender equality is only narrowly under- stood as granting expanded benefits to women, it appears as a win for women and a loss for men. But if a more inclusive approach is taken, men also can investigate gender norms that govern their lives. Questions can be raised about why men dominate certain hazardous forms of employment, for exam- ple, or are more likely to die violently. Some The case for gender equality is often pitched as a human rights or social justice argument, but it is good economics as well ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 28 men are more suited to relationships based on cooperation, but live in societies where they are expected to be dominant over women. These confining patterns can place tremendous strains on men, leading many to make choices that conform to social protocols, not based on what they may genuinely want and need. Similar considerations apply to homosexuals and people with other gender identities.

Ultimately, relationships could improve, producing happier and less fractious fami- lies\u2014and societies. Equality Promotes Social Cohesion Integral to respect for human diversity, gender equality supports true long term social stability and harmony, and not just a surface calm. But the route to achieving cohesion can be marked by questioning, resistance and turbulence in the interim. Over time, how- ever, this expands the space for people with all gender identities to interact and negotiate on fair grounds, and provides opportunities and choices for people, regardless of sex or gender, to pursue what they value in life and fulfil their aspirations. It supports the cultivation of strong and healthy fami- lies, and gives each child the opportunity to be born, grow and develop into adulthood. It removes sources of injustice, oppressive and archaic traditions, disaffection and dissent. In the Asia-Pacific region, which con- tinues to face widespread conflict, a high number of natural disasters and economic crisis, gender equality can be part of the \u2018glue\u2019 that helps countries recover more quickly from such upheaval. When women are more prone to abuse and discrimination during crises, as is often the case, some may resort to high-risk behaviour, such as sex work, in order to survive and care for their children.33 In doing so, they cannot contribute effectively to strategies for recovery. Equality Is a Right Equal rights are an intrinsic good. They confer dignity, foster freedom and provide oppor- tunities and choices for people to live lives they value. Democratic societies grounded in the principle of equal citizenship and equal rights ensure people share responsibilities and benefits. Restricting women\u2019s parti- cipation and voice is inconsistent with democracy. In an unequal world, the principle of equal rights can seem abstract. But important historical reference points can be found in the elimination of slavery, colonialism and apartheid.34 Once a critical mass of people understand that certain practices are morally untenable and harmful to their standing in a globalized world, they will agitate against them. Changing institutions and attitudes, recurring themes in this report, are thus of cardinal importance in the struggle against gender inequality. The Time Has Come \u2018I\u2019m not afraid of people, and I\u2019m not afraid to speak the truth. There is too much corruption in this country. There are women in villages living in caves. There are boys killing for the Taliban.

Change is in the air, in no small part because more people are experiencing the benefits of development, seeing that change is possible, and demanding more of their leaders and themselves. Demographic dynamics\u2014a large share of young people, combined with a growing, consumer-oriented middle class\u2014 are powerful forces that can change atti- tudes, nullify constricting norms and accele- rate progress towards gender equality. The closing male-female gap in school enrolments, and examples of women outnumbering men entering universities in some countries, are also providing a fertile ground for inter- generational change. Institutions have im- proved, more resources are available, political commitment has grown, and potential for changing attitudes is far greater than ever before. Better Institutions, More Resources Prosperity, modernization and better education mean that many parts of the region have more effective institutions in place to respond to diverse needs of citizens, including women and other disadvantaged groups. In countries that have successfully capitalized on the global economic surge of recent decades, more resources are available to invest in human development, including gender equality. And despite the current global downturn, the region as a whole may continue its stronger economic growth compared to other parts of the world.37 Even if public spending choices tighten, gender equality must remain a crucial element in any", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "044f3372-58e4-49ee-b7e4-5f14f04b05e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "044f3372-58e4-49ee-b7e4-5f14f04b05e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a53d78763a998e16e573158712d4bea1a36c9c60537df012aa0a4a3cda54d3e5"}}, "hash": "a53d78763a998e16e573158712d4bea1a36c9c60537df012aa0a4a3cda54d3e5", "text": "strategy to foster long-term growth, improve economic resiliency and promote \u2018larger freedoms\u2019 for all.38 Greater Political Commitment The push towards gender equality is much more than a technical fix\u2014it is funda- mentally a political process.39 Political commitment in this regard may have been spotty in individual countries, but it has gained momentum overall. Discussions on the issue can now be found in political party platforms and election debates. Some coun- tries are making systematic attempts to inject gender equality into policy-making so that discrimination becomes visible and is addressed; for example, Asia-Pacific has pioneered initiatives to assess public budgets in terms of how they may differently affect men and women. Numerous countries have passed legisla- tions to guarantee women\u2019s political and economic rights, such as through quotas reserving seats for women in legislatures. A handful of these countries, typically but not always through quotas, have reached the global upper echelons of women\u2019s parti- cipation in national legislatures. Political commitment also may come about through bottom-up pressures for governments to take a more proactive stance for change. Building support for this can be done via mechanisms such as the media and civic engagement. Growing Public Awareness Awareness of and expertise on gender issues has grown, championed in some cases by influential men and women. Women them- selves have become a force as advocates and in voting booths\u2014and some politicians and parties have changed their campaign plat- forms to appeal to this influential consti- tuency. Special impetus for achieving gender equality now comes from the growing number Institutions have improved, political commitment has grown, and poten- tial for changing attitudes is far greater than ever before ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 30 of people in the region, women and men, who want and expect a more just society. These comprise families who take pride in the educational attainments of daughters, women who appreciate the autonomy of an indepen- dent income, and men who enjoy being an equal participant in raising their children. These shifts in attitudes are in a nascent phase in much of Asia and the Pacific. But they are there and flourishing, cultivated to different degrees by the media, advocacy groups, rising literacy rates, political move- ments, consumer aspirations, population demographics and rapid exchanges of information made possible by technology. Moving Forward Faster \u2018It cannot be forgotten that discrimination is the antithesis of equality and that it is the recognition of equality which will foster dignity of every individual.\u201940 \u2013 From the 105-page judgment of the New Delhi High Court in overturning a 150-year-old ban on homosexual acts as discriminatory and a violation of fundamental rights Gender discrimination will not decline on its own and may not be corrected automatically in the course of development, as the mixed record on gender equality in some developed countries suggests. Making greater progress towards gender equality in Asia-Pacific will require a number of deliberate policy steps, as this Report makes clear. No single policy intervention will be the magic bullet that ends gender discrimination. The three areas chosen by the Report\u2014 economics, politics and the law\u2014must be considered in terms of how they relate to each other and how they play out across the different arenas where gender discrimination occurs. Economic policies that bolster gender equality will not come about without political will. A woman may have the right to vote and speak her mind, but without decent employ- ment she may be too absorbed in the struggle to survive to participate in any meaningful way in the life of her country or community. On all issues, what is needed is a combination of freedom of action and freedom of thought, including the ability and willingness to question habitual attitudes. Three broad directions further frame the Report\u2019s analysis: Institutions have to be right, attitudes have to be in tune so insti- tutions function as intended, and assessments have to be continuous to reveal gaps and monitor progress. Institutions: Transforming the Mainstream Too often, gender mainstreaming is treated as an \u2018add-on\u2019 to existing policies, rather than as a process of transformation from within\u2014 a process that should touch all aspects of development, and involve women, men and people with different gender identities.

Beyond access, this involves questions of quality and links to empower- ment. Meaningful progress cannot be made if the worst scraps from the table continue to be overallocated to those who are poor and female. Capabilities must be considered through their links to opportunities that strengthen the power, voice and rights of excluded women and men, and that loosen\u2014 not maintain\u2014entrenched patterns of discri- mination. Changing Attitudes Attitudes must be examined for institutional and policy reforms to be initiated, and to ensure they succeed. Without deliberate attempts to shift deep-seated attitudes that fuel gender discrimination, even if reforms take place they will largely remain on paper, since people will not be convinced to implement them. Efforts to change attitudes can best be tackled through sites that tend to perpetuate them, such as the media, schools and religious institutions. These may encourage individuals to embark on change in their own lives, and/ or tap into changes in attitudes and behavi- ours that are already occurring. In general, attitudinal changes happen at both the individual and collective levels, although typically one triggers the other (Box 1.1). Leaders and role models can inspire people to adopt new ideas, as can new legislation and advocacy campaigns. Attitudes to gender can be positive or negative. They can produce immediate results, such as reducing gender-based violence. They may deepen poverty and deprivation\u2014for example, when people think Ideally, mainstreaming is comprehensive and innovative in digging deep to uproot gender discrimination by \u2018embedding gender- sensitive practices and norms in the struc- tures, processes and environment of public policy\u2019.43 Awareness raising, technical train- ing and gender statistics are among the tools widely used. Specific plans, budgets and indicators are developed according to how they affect women and men differently. The region has varied models of national mecha- nisms on gender, from high-level commissions in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and the Philippines to full ministries in Malaysia and the Republic of Korea. However, further efforts are required to ensure effective implementation of mainstreaming practices. In the Beijing+10 Review of 2005, the Commission on the Status of Women evaluated the progress of mainstreaming 10 years after the Beijing Platform for Action. One major finding was a continued lack of understanding of gender equality and gender mainstreaming among national governments. The review cited inadequate financial and human resources, the lack of political will and commitment, insufficient sex-disaggregated data, and marginal links to civil society as persistent barriers.44 In many Asia-Pacific countries as well, attempts to adopt gender mainstreaming have run into problems typically related to an overly narrow and/or unfocused interpre- tation of the concept. For example, growing female labour participation in export- oriented industries is sometimes cited as an example of successful mainstreaming, even if women in the sector mainly end up with poor- quality jobs.45 Mainstreaming, if applied well, should shift attention away from reactive attempts to satisfy individual and group needs that already exist, some of which are defined by gender norms.

People\u2019s self-interest needs to be explained and fairly connected to capabilities and opportunities, so that all see the benefits of more gender-equal societies for themselves, their families and communities. Assessing Gaps In its many proposals for reaching gender equality, the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing stressed measurement, indicators and sex-disaggregated data.47 This emphasis recognized that many gender issues go unnamed and unaddressed because they are poorly defined \u2013 and thus remains invisi- ble even to policy-makers otherwise suppor- tive of gender equality. Choosing to assess gender disparities through concrete measures is a critical step to reducing these disparities. In general, measurement and analysis of gender inequality across the region remains selective or absent in many areas. Very little Measurement and analysis of gender inequality across the region remains selective or absent in many areas A starting point for our understanding about, and attitudes towards, gender is that gender is a culturally constructed concept, which, as a result, is different across societies and time. For example, in the past, Western notions of the \u2018exotic\u2019 Orient viewed the women there as \u2018sexually free\u2019 in contrast to \u2018Victorian\u2019 women in Europe. This has now changed to a stereotypical understanding of Asian women as oppressed and Western women as \u2018liberated\u2019. The colonial legacy in the Asia- Pacific influenced ideas about what were considered appro- priate male and female gender roles. Transgender indivi- duals\u2014in many societies accepted as a \u2018third sex\u2019\u2014were marginalized by lawmakers\u2019 insistence that there were only two legal sexes: male and female. Colonial rule has come to an end, but many of the laws and related legal codes of practice still exist. Nevertheless, there are signs of change\u2014in no small part due to advocacy efforts of civil society organizations, which became more vocal and effective with resources springing from growing concerns around HIV. Thus, policy makers must continue to increasingly recognize the fluidity of gender definitions and sexualities. In 2009, the Delhi High Court in India declared as unconstitutional the colonial era Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalizes homosexuality. Directly res- ponding to accelerating HIV prevalence rates among men who have sex with men in China, the National Center for AIDS/ STD Prevention and Control worked directly with civil society to design and launch a national programme to reduce HIV among men who have sex with men. In India and Nepal, new passport forms allow for a third gender category besides \u2018male\u2019 and \u2018female\u2019. In 2006, the National Conference on Women\u2019s Movements held at Kolkata, for the first time featured dis- cussions about transgender people and the participation of transgender women. And, in Thailand, a school in Sri Sa Ket province opened separate toilet facilities to accommodate their many transgender students in continued efforts to provide a safe space for all their students. Despite these signs of progress, instances of stigma and abuse of sexual minorities (including transgender) continue, directly increasing their vulnerability to HIV. Sexual orien- tation and gender identity continue to be ruled by socio- cultural attitudes that emphasize conformity with majority (heterosexual) norms, especially in rural areas. Negative family and community attitudes can lead to low self- esteem which, combined with the need for intimacy and the desire for sex, can lead males to engage in unsafe sex, potentially jeopardizing their well-being. Removing punitive laws, discriminatory and stigmatizing policies and practices and enhancing social protection allows men who have sex with men, including gay and transgendered persons, to contribute to society, as fully accepted and productive citizens.

Some Asia-Pacific countries, such as India, have conducted time-use surveys, recognizing the fact that many women\u2019s activities take place at home and in the informal sector, outside more conventional data-gathering systems.48 These surveys encourage better- quality gender analysis and improve the accu- racy of forecasting potential policy outcomes. Several countries also are adopting gender budgeting tools, which can assess and reveal gender differences in the raising and spending of public funds. Some research is being devoted to developing economic and public policy models to systematically measure and anticipate gender impacts. One study on labour segmentation, for example, concluded that women face lower wages during periods of economic reform. Flanking policies may be necessary to mitigate their exclusion from potential benefits.49 Contours of the Report The following chapters examine how deficits in women\u2019s power, voice and rights in three areas\u2014economics, politics and the law\u2014 entrench patterns of discrimination that hinder progress towards gender equality in Asia and the Pacific. Policy choices can set the course for change in all three areas. These areas are all strategic, as shifts within them can influence other spheres. The Report asses- ses both the challenges in the region and positive steps being taken to address them. Chapter Two. Gender discrimination stands in the way of the assets and livelihoods that women need to acquire capabilities and opportunities. This chapter proposes ways to remove institutional and attitudinal barriers in accessing assets, expand paid employment, foster gender equality in education and make migration safe for the growing number of women relocating to pursue new livelihoods. Chapter Three. Participation in political deci- sion making is integral to the notion of democracy, but women\u2019s voice is far from being even half-representative. This chapter looks at why the numbers of women in office are still so low and explores mechanisms for greater state accountability to women, such as legal quotas and gender budgets. Chapter Four. Despite promises of equal citizenship and equality before the law, gender norms mean that women and men experience the same legal systems differently. This chapter analyzes deficits in laws and legal practices that prevent women from accessing justice. Reforms will depend on making the legal system more responsive overall to gender. Chapter Five. From the analysis of the Report, this chapter distils an eight-point agenda for change. ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 34 WHERE THE REGION STANDS: A SNAPSHOT Major Indicators of Gender Gaps The Asia-Pacific region has made much progress in advancing gender equality in life expectancy, school enrolment and labour force participation, with the most rapid gains occurring in East Asia and the Pacific. In South Asia, by contrast, large gender gaps remain, even in basic capabilities such as education, health, nutrition and employment opportu- nities. To place the region in a broader context, this snapshot compares Asia-Pacific sub-regions to other regions50 of the world on several indicators for survival, capabilities and empowerment (Appendix Table 1.1 and Figures 1.1 to 1.13). These selected indicators and figures also assess where the region is with regard to international commitments on gender equality, such as achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action 1995. The Male-Female Sex Ratio Widens More boys than girls are born in Asia as a whole than in any other region of the world. And the divide is increasing over time. East Asia has the highest male-to-female sex ratio at birth\u2014119 boys for every 100 girls. This exceeded the world average of 107 boys for every 100 girls during the 2000-2005 period (Figure 1.2). The high sex ratio indicates a strong preference for male children and the deliberate use of certain means to achieve it\u2014 a form of gender inequality that begins even before birth. Large Numbers of Missing Women Close to 100 million women in Asia are esti- mated to be \u2018missing\u2019,51 having died because of discriminatory treatment in access to health and nutrition or through pure neglect \u2013 or because they were never born in the first place.

This suggests that even when women have capabilities, they may not have adequate opportunities to use them.54 Based on a wider set of indicators than the GDI or the GEM, the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Index (GGI) calculates gender gaps on the basis of 14 indicators grouped around four dimensions: economic, political, education and health. The GGI shows no significant association with levels of development (Figure 1.14 above). These broad indices aside, it needs reiterating that economic growth by itself does not automatically translate into gender equality. Figure 1.14: Even with Capabilities, Women May Lack Opportunities Notes: Countries within each income category have been ordered by HDI value. The HDI ranges between 0 (minimum) to 1 (maximum). Higher values indicate high human development. The GDI ranges between 0 (minimum) to 1 (maximum). Higher values indicate greater gender equality. The GEM ranges between 0 (minimum) and 1 (maximum).

CHAPTER 2: BUILDING ECONOMIC POWER 45 In Asia and the Pacific, gender discri- mination continues to stand in the way of women acquiring capabilities and opportu- nities, even after decades of discussion. It is a conundrum that the region has raced so far and fast in expanding its economies but has extended only a limited share of the benefits to women and other disadvantaged groups. A time of economic crisis in particular, where all available resources must be mobilized, calls for understanding that gender equality is both an issue of social justice and economic pragmatism. A growing body of evidence shows that gender equality is good economics. For instance, over the last 10 years, the increase of women workers in developed countries is estimated to have contributed more to global growth than has China\u2019s remarkable economic record.1 Reaching", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7b7ec7f-af47-41e7-9a42-9e048bfab3ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7b7ec7f-af47-41e7-9a42-9e048bfab3ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "945ce50af59a8dee4b0e1b30d937950d61f5545f841d4cc450c77a489d22dd87"}}, "hash": "945ce50af59a8dee4b0e1b30d937950d61f5545f841d4cc450c77a489d22dd87", "text": "the same level of women\u2019s labour market participation in the United States, over 70 per cent, would boost GDP in countries, for example, by 4.2 per cent a year in India, 2.9 per cent in Malaysia and 1.4 per cent in Indonesia.2 The gains would be greater where current female participation rates are the lowest. Lack of women\u2019s participation in the workforce across Asia-Pacific cost the region an estimated US $89 billion every year.3 Another estimate, using long-term data from 1960 to 2000, suggests that a combination of gender gaps in education and employment accounts annually for a significant difference of up to 1.6 percentage points in per capita growth rates between South Asia and East Asia.4 Over that period, East Asia took long leaps in life expectancy and education for women, while pulling a record number of them into the workplace. In turn, this sub-region grew faster than all others worldwide.5 In the ownership and control of assets and the ability to earn incomes, two funda- mental pathways to economic well-being, women still lag far behind men in much of the region\u2014and Asia-Pacific as a whole lags behind much of the rest of the world. This results in lost opportunities for economic growth and fairer societies that can build upon the advantages of human diversity. When women have equal opportunities to obtain assets and earn incomes, their overall social and economic standing improves, leading to an expanding circle of oppor- tunities, such as in politics. They also develop a stronger position to bargain and negotiate within their homes, which means that male relatives are no longer the sole reference point for decisions they make. This frees women to make possibly different choices\u2014including getting out of oppressive situations\u2014that can improve their own welfare as well as that of their children and families. Incomes and assets also leave women much better equipped to cope in times of crisis, supple- menting the major role of social protec- tion systems. All human beings, irrespective of gender, must have equal opportunities to seek out economic opportunities. People access resources and livelihoods for survival and sustenance. But beyond that, economic power helps them acquire capabilities that enlarge choices for satisfying and creative lives. This is the promise of human development. In the ownership and control of assets and the ability to earn incomes, women still lag far behind men in much of the region Building Economic Power Chapter2 ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 46 Across Asia and the Pacific, achieving equal opportunities to own assets and earn incomes depends on new approaches to economic policy-making that make this a basic and systematically pursued objective, rather than something assumed to trickle out of growth. Political will and legal protections, the subjects of the next two chapters, are crucial elements to broaden the reach of these commitments. Good education also has clear economic returns for individuals and societies. Learning linked to job opportunities opens up remune- rative employment options. At a more basic level, a woman who can read with under- standing is better able to decipher a land deed and will know if she is being cheated of her entitlements. But the economic benefits of education are not automatic. Transformative potential depends on the level, content and quality of education, opportunities to use the knowledge for productive purposes, openings for continual learning, and exposure to different ideas, experiences and ways of doing things. Mobility also is strongly linked to the freedom to pursue new choices. Increasingly, women are seeking economic benefits through migration, although marriage remains a driver as well. The outcome of migration is not always positive, but a record number of women in Asia-Pacific are moving from the country to the city, or from their own countries to others, often on their own. In the process, many are acquiring incomes and assets. Some gain a new sense of confidence about their ability to make choices and manage their lives. Collectively, their efforts make an enormous economic contribution through remittances, which for some Asia- Pacific countries now rival or exceed sums from foreign direct investment. Migration hints at how powerful an economic force women can be\u2014and how capable many women are in carving out new opportunities. On their own initiative and supported by public policy, women can strengthen their capabilities, make informed choices and invent new roles, unobstructed by gender constraints. Leveraging Assets Assets come in many forms\u2014from land and livestock to knowledge, pension plans, busi- nesses and good health. Men and women around the world use economic assets6 as the building blocks for better lives.

Women who can acquire, retain and control assets\u2014and by themselves, not just through husbands or relatives\u2014rise in social and economic standing. This can translate into greater bargaining positions in households and a stronger voice in public affairs.7 Two dimensions\u2014ownership and control \u2014need consideration for assets to make a meaningful contribution to gender equality. It is not enough for women to own an asset and then be unable to determine how it is used. Control without ownership may provide short-term benefits but can be tenuous over a longer period. In general, assets are critical to rectifying development im- balances. A measure of the gender asset gap could be an effective indicator of pro- gress towards MDG 3 on achieving gender equality.8 Certain assets\u2014land, housing, livestock, common property resources, businesses, health and financial assets\u2014are critical because they can be leveraged to acquire others, sustain enterprises or diversify livelihoods. The poorest people, however, may have only health as an asset, plunging into destitution when this is weakened through hunger, illness or accident.9 This Report considers all these types of assets except financial assets, due to a lack of data for the region. Women who can acquire, retain and control assets rise in social and economic standing CHAPTER 2: BUILDING ECONOMIC POWER 47 Diverse Practices, Consistent Shortfalls Despite the basic importance of assets to gender equality, women\u2019s overall access to a variety of assets across Asia and the Pacific is poor compared to other regions. Land ownership data are not available by gender regionally, but surveys in individual countries provide some inkling of the imbalances. A 2001 household survey in Pakistan found that women owned less than three per cent of plots.10 According to the 2001 Population Census in Nepal, \u2018only 11 per cent of house- holds reported some land under female legal ownership\u2019, but around 90 per cent owned less than one acre.11 The agricultural census of the Food and Agriculture Organization from 1989 to 1999 gives another indication. It found that in most regions women headed around 20 per cent of farms: in Asia-Pacific, the figure was a mere seven per cent (Figure 2.1).12 Interes- tingly, in contrast, for as recently as 2007 more than 65 per cent of female employment was in agriculture in South Asia, with more than 40 per cent in East Asia.13 Patterns of ownership and control over land and other assets are diverse within the region, reflecting the fact that many practices, particularly those related to property, extend far back in time and custom. Some have arisen as part of complex social arrange- ments. In many parts of South Asia women can inherit land, but do not actually do so. A study in Gujarat, India, for example, shows that women commonly refrain from claiming land in favour of their brothers, whom they see as a source of social support.14 Asset patterns are also affected by current laws and economic pressures and by the distribution of power within households, communities and political systems. Most societies in the Pacific islands, for example, are patrilineal. In some communities, like Gaua in Vanuatu, the land inheritance practices have swung back and forth between customary matrili- neal and patrilineal systems (Box 2.1).15 When colonial laws were introduced in Fiji, Tokelau, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, they contradicted communal approaches by enforcing private, often male, ownership. More recently, women have lost access to land from interaction with outsiders (immigrants), who tend to engage primarily with men based on the assumption that men own the land.16 Yet, not all practices of asset ownership and control work against women in the region. In Bhutan, 60 per cent of rural women hold land registration titles; the law provides equal inheritance rights to men and women.17 While Islamic law traditionally favours inheritance for men, a few Muslim commu- nities in Sri Lanka practise a system of matrilineal inheritance where women inherit land and men have rights to use it.18 For the most part, however, patterns of asset ownership and control make men more likely to inherit, own and manage larger stretches of land, while women\u2019s activities remain confined to small household plots. Men tend to harvest and sell timber, while women collect wood for fuel and non-wood forestry products sold for smaller profits. Men own cattle and larger, more valuable animals; while smaller animals, such as goats and poultry kept near the house, are women\u2019s domain.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6bc3dff-1b76-4474-a480-eac544c9baa2": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6bc3dff-1b76-4474-a480-eac544c9baa2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c7b662fb180d526ac53236b85c79ca65c673ce624c7a8dc476f08795b9885758"}, "2": {"node_id": "0c444324-39b9-4f59-829f-19bdff5808a9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0777fb18d900cf08e7c1bd711a23b2193cbf6ab8c15cada1ccf06f9b74ab6132"}}, "hash": "5a8ae30f7a191375fd69388d421cb9fe1eb0af38b7043c781743618310bea1b5", "text": "Women are more likely than men to Patterns of asset ownership and control make men more likely to inherit, own and manage larger stretches of land, while women\u2019s activities remain confined", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13a91d7c-7e3d-40ec-9ce0-e5ddc980f59d": {"__data__": {"id_": "13a91d7c-7e3d-40ec-9ce0-e5ddc980f59d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e669976ade9a9e38a71e75097dce45e19db7ef7a5ebf865d73b185a0e3a65aad"}, "3": {"node_id": "60d0709d-e295-4741-8fc9-0c5afc78d2b6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "afea720ba377b2c04b91e839c1321c31fb0173eb3a9029b9f599cf0db63f74b9"}}, "hash": "2cfbf92abfae1a3ca8412bf2e7af441ceef3a5fc582338d58a832318fa66d054", "text": "to small household plots Figure 2.1: Hardly Any Women Farm Owners in Asia-Pacific Figure 2.1: Hardly Any Women Farm Owners in Asia-Pacific Figure 2.1: Hardly Any Women Farm Owners in Asia-Pacific Figure 2.1: Hardly Any Women Farm Owners in Asia-Pacific Per cent of Farmland Owned by Women Source: FAO n.d.-b.

Their basic tenets were matrilineal dominance in land, a two-tiered system with varying levels of usufruct rights, and flexible customary practices. Women possessed authority and influence directly connected to their matrilineal rights to land, with men having a complementary role as lineage heads in the public sphere, acting on behalf of the group. Men of the chiefly (irooj) class were iroojlaplap and women were lerooj, but the basic chiefly duties were left to the junior male relatives. In the exercise of power and duties, consultation with the lerooj was critical. Female and male chiefs sat in equal numbers in the Council of Irooj (Chiefs). The alap was the lineage head of the bwij, responsible for the overall productivity of land and for being a liason between the irooj and others. The alap was traced through the female line but both genders could be alap. Marshallese women today have a critical political power base because of matrilineal heritage, and they have direct power in decision-making over land. Nonetheless, there is an emerging political power structure dominated by men. Tensions have sprung up around the legitimacy of females to be alap and to participate in the public and political spheres. In 2005, the Republic of Marshall Islands High Court, with the concurrence of the Traditional Rights Courts, decided in favour of two female plaintiffs claiming alap and senior rijerbal rights on Kwajalein Atoll (where the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defence Site is located and which brings huge income to traditional land owners). Subsequently, two male senators of the Parliament introduced Bill 84 to codify Marshallese customary law so as to define the term alap only as a male elder person. Women United Together Marshall Islands (WUTMI), a woman\u2019s NGO, mobilized to defeat Bill 84. They conducted a strategic campaign relying heavily on the media, using especially the voices of the female lerooj in newspapers and radio. Community petitions targeted elected members of the Council of Irooj as the government monitors of custom. The lobbying effort was successful and demonstrates the extent of female authority in custom, as many women saw themselves not as radicals, but as traditionalists protecting Marshallese manit (custom). That said, WUTMI conducted a very modern, smart, strategic and media effective campaign, reminiscent of modern feminist campaigns to either pass or defeat proposed law.

Access to assets may be changing. One source of change is the law (Box 2.2), as also Women\u2019s activists in Nepal conducted a long advocacy campaign to secure legal recognition of women\u2019s property rights, finally achieving this aim in 2002 through the passage into law of the Eleventh Amendment of the Country Code Bill. The statute is sweeping in its scope, overturning a series of discriminatory laws. It is backed by sanctions for non-compliance. Among its provisions is the equal right to ancestral property for daughters and sons by birth. Previously, only unmarried daughters who had reached the age of 35 were entitled to this right. An earlier requirement that a widow could claim her share of property only after attaining the age of 30 and living separately was replaced with the right for a widow to claim her share when she requires, even if she gets remarried. Wives now have immediate rights to a share of the husband\u2019s property after marriage, without the previous waiting period. Property must be partitioned between husband and wife at the time of divorce, with alimony set on the basis of the husband\u2019s property and earnings.

But they confront difficulties with each method. Direct purchase requires resources that many women do not have, along with supportive social norms that encourage women\u2019s ownership. Inheritance and marri- age customs that tend to protect the conti- nuance of male ownership and control over assets22 may be tolerated or endorsed by legal systems. Historically, land ownership in particu- lar has been skewed towards men in much of Asia-Pacific, as in other regions, because many societies have defined agriculture as a male activity\u2014even if this is no longer technically accurate in many places\u2014and because land is so closely associated with economic and political power. Different systems of custo- mary laws still remain deeply embedded in traditions that are, in some cases, hundreds or thousands of years old. In India, for instance, Hindu inheritance practices are detailed in ancient texts such as the Mitakshara.23 It defines two types of pro- perty: joint family property\u2014which is jointly held by the family, and separate property\u2014 such as land that is self-acquired. While the rights of male heirs differ between the two types, women are prohibited from fully inhe- riting either. Widows and unmarried daugh- ters are entitled to inherit a limited income from a joint estate. From an independent property, widows can inherit if there is no son or grandson, but only for her lifetime. She cannot sell, mortgage or gift the property. For a daughter to inherit her father\u2019s land, there should be no son, grandson or widow. These concepts were codified in the 1956 Hindu Succession Act until a landmark amendment in 2005 finally defined a Hindu woman\u2019s right to inherit land as equal to that of a Hindu man. All daughters have a stake in Mitakshara joint family property,24 and they have the same rights as sons, whether they are married or not, to reside in or seek partition of the family dwelling house.25 Some Muslim countries continue to follow Islamic principles of inheritance, which stipulate that women inherit a smaller share than men.26 In Indonesia, for example, Article 176 of the Compilation of Islamic Law (Presidential Instruction No. 1 of 1991) states that where there is one son and one daughter, the inheritance ratio is two to one.27 Other barriers to the acquisition of assets can be found in Indonesia\u2019s Civil Code. Article 108 prevents married women from entering into contracts on their own behalf and from receiving any payment from individual business activities. Banking prac- tices also restrict women\u2019s access to loans to advance their businesses. Married women were using their husband\u2019s tax number,28 although this has changed. Marriage customs and laws that continue to make women subordinate to men pose other hindrances. Women are typically expected to move to their husband\u2019s locality, which may be distant from their own, reducing the chances that they will be able to maintain control over property they already own. Even women in matrilineal cultures can face pressure to marry from within a kinship group and remain in the ancestral village so the family can retain control over her land.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50d6559f-d027-4a5d-a375-1edea3e2964a": {"__data__": {"id_": "50d6559f-d027-4a5d-a375-1edea3e2964a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3e3fd248f2e40bca35f59d34bd00d35a189fa66403262cd8b16c1c5b234abe65"}, "2": {"node_id": "8eeccdde-8dbb-417b-9dee-db30def28249", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e69d03cac97451adb0334b799c3e5007cac51ee21866c6e5bff978cac53d792f"}}, "hash": "8a01da9e0f34fd49042b4b719737ee6532a11cafdbbbba0f274e2de9217191c0", "text": "In South Asia, although women may continue to own land and other assets brought to the marriage through dowry, husbands Multiple ways exist for women to acquire and use assets, including through direct purchase, marriage and kinship ties, and inheritance.

With or without laws or customary prac- tices, more general social pressures discourage women from aspiring to acquire assets or asserting their rights over them. Afghanistan provides limited inheritance entitlements under Islamic law, yet women are likely to turn away from these because of social conventions that brothers are expected to care for their sisters in times of need.30 When women follow traditions such as purdah and female seclusion, they have little ability to use land or other assets outside the household. Ideas about what topics women and girls \u2018ought\u2019 to study partly explain why education systems equip women with fewer technical or business skills to manage assets. These defi- cits are compounded by financial and business practices that favour well-established men. Women can find it difficult to become part of all-male networks that can be critical to starting and expanding a business.31 Institu- tional credit that drives investments in existing or new assets is not easily available The past decade has seen a growing global recognition that women\u2019s com- mand over immovable assets, such as land and homesteads, can be critically important for theirs and their children\u2019s economic and social well-being and overall empowerment. Command over such assets\u2014implying both access and control\u2014adds significantly to livelihood options, economic and social security and poverty alleviation.32 It also increases the likelihood of children surviving, attending school and receiving health care;33 and reduces the risk of families falling into poverty and destitution following widowhood, spousal desertion, protracted family illness, or husbands dying of HIV/ AIDS.34 Recent research also suggests signi- ficant links between women\u2019s owner- ship of a house or land and a reduced risk of marital violence. In a study in Kerala (India), for instance, 49 per cent of the property-less women reported long term physical violence by spouses relative to 18 per cent and 10 per cent of those owning land or a house respectively, and seven per cent if they owned both.35 These assets deter violence by visibly signaling the strength of a woman\u2019s fall-back position and tangible exit option and also provide an escape route should violence occur. Access to land or a house thus provides both physical and economic security. More generally, immovable assets increase women\u2019s bargaining power and hence their ability to negotiate a better distribution of goods and tasks within the family, and more status and voice in the community. Apart from gains in welfare, equity and empowerment, women\u2019s command over productive assets, especially land, could prove key to reviving agricultural productivity and enhancing food secu- rity. Across Asia, increasingly, farmers have a female face. We see a growing feminization of agriculture, with more men than women moving to non-farm work. In India, in 2004-2005, 65 per cent of female workers relative to 49 per cent of male workers were confined to agriculture.36 In Nepal, the relative percentages were 98 for women and 89 for men.37 In Asia as a whole, women constituted 45 per cent of all farm workers in 2006, with percentages as high as 55 in Cambodia, 52 in Bangladesh, 49 in Viet Nam and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and 48 in China.38 These percentages have been growing in recent decades. To revive and sustain agricultural growth, as well as adapt to or mitigate climate change, the role of women farmers will be central. How effectively they can contribute, however, will depend crucially on their having secure rights in the land they cultivate, as well as access to credit, technology, information and infrastructure. To what extent do women have command over assets such as land and house? Few countries collect compre- hensive data, but existing evidence indi- cates substantial gender gaps in most of Asia. In Nepal, only 16.3 per cent of rural women own land or a house.39 In India, the proportions are likely to be similar.40 In rural China, women consti- tute an estimated 70 per cent of those without access to their own land under the family land use allotment system.41 There are, however, significant regional variations in women\u2019s command over immovable assets across and within countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b51d159-b051-48aa-abad-b3ca6ac05af3": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b51d159-b051-48aa-abad-b3ca6ac05af3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "762cb878fb941ba0df88369053110f4746910d2e948a14772f106aeb740da025"}, "2": {"node_id": "dcd18498-146c-4f8a-b426-26f28790a41a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95132ca73caee36c256f1ca894f843bab99981cbb7a465b0fde4667347c33b20"}}, "hash": "23dec437d684bf151b7dcec5e7d9c92510b0b6fc13a71b99826d8e75d6d55afb", "text": "The gender gap is much larger in South Asia than in South-East Women can find it difficult to become part of all-male networks SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION WOMEN\u2019S COMMAND OVER IMMOVABLE ASSETS: A VITAL KEY Professor Bina Agarwal CHAPTER 2: BUILDING ECONOMIC POWER 51 Asia;", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f77fdc01-54fb-4634-b8ca-7bb50b5d7506": {"__data__": {"id_": "f77fdc01-54fb-4634-b8ca-7bb50b5d7506", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45bab2dac8df3c817ecbf6c7119190657c50eab136077742cf8cca86b6f1ff66"}, "3": {"node_id": "63e2c3df-8beb-4e9b-9ec6-020b532a6cc0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e00966c77008a932883ad6221a3b65a18ebc89e74353b7894b1c086ba5d5506"}}, "hash": "c04723fb1f1e1dd32eb8b1376de76e040525cf1707edb8ec7c25369bac6577b1", "text": "and in the northern belt of South Asia (northwest India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan) than in south India and Sri Lanka.42 Underlying these regional variations are differences in laws, cul- ture (especially post-marital residence and the ideology of female seclusion), ecology (e.g. women\u2019s work contribution is more visible in rice farming systems), ethnic and religious diversity, political freedoms and overall development. In Sri Lanka, for instance, historically all communities, irrespective of religion, recognized women\u2019s land claims, and the country\u2019s favourable social indicators (90 per cent female literacy, gender balanced sex ratios) cannot be delinked from women\u2019s historical advantage there in command over productive assets. How can women gain immovable assets? Mainly from three sources: the family (via gift or inheritance), the state (via land transfers) and the market (via purchase or lease). Access via families depends especially on inheritance laws and their implementation. Such laws are gender equal in several countries (e.g. Bhutan, Viet Nam, most communities in the Philippines and Sri Lanka), and are moving in that direction in many others. In India, for instance, the 2005 amend- ment of the Hindu Succession Act made inheritance laws gender equal for 80 per cent of Indian women who are Hindus.43 There are, however, substan- tial gaps between de jure and de facto rights in most Asian countries, due to poor legal implementation and social barriers, including male bias in bequea- thing property within families.44 Excep- tions include Bhutan, where women own an estimated 70 per cent of the land,45 and Sri Lanka where most women from landed families inherit some land, even if in amounts unequal to men.46 The effective implementation of laws will require not only trans- forming social norms and attitudes but spreading legal literacy, providing legal aid, and gender-sensitizing land registration officials and the judiciary. The media and civil society organi- zations can play a significant role in this. The state and the market are important additional sources of immov- able assets for women. At present, agri- cultural and homestead land distri- buted by governments under their anti- poverty, land reform or resettlement schemes goes largely to men, and limi- tedly to women\u2014either individually or jointly with husbands. Land titles trans- ferred solely to women could go some way towards compensating for male bias in inheritance. Governments can also facilitate women\u2019s market access to land and housing through subsidized grant- cum-credit schemes. In both State and market-related efforts, however, a group approach in increasing women\u2019s access to land and housing can prove more economically effective and socially empowering than transfers to individual women or joint titles with spouses. Although untried for housing, a group approach has been used successfully for increasing women\u2019s land access, albeit in small pockets. Catalyzed by the Deccan Development Society (DDS) in Andhra Pradesh (south India), for instance, poor, low-caste women, organized into groups of five to 15, have leased in or purchased land in groups, through various government schemes providing subsidized credit and/or grants. The women are now farming these lands in groups in some 75 villages.47 Working together has enhanced their ability to survey land, hire tractors, share labour, meet govern- ment officials, buy inputs and market the produce. Group members report improvement in family diets, healthcare and children\u2019s education, reduction in spousal desertion and violence, and enhanced social status in the commu- nity. Group farming is also being under- taken by women elsewhere in India, such as through a UNDP-Government of India project involving 50,000 women in three states,48 as well as in Bangladesh. There are examples too of women undertaking pisciculture collectively in many regions, and of Bangladeshi women\u2019s cooperatives acquiring minor irrigation equipment and rights to sell water to male farmers.49 A recent evaluation by IFAD-funded projects in Bangladesh also pointed to the potential of poor women working in cooperative arran- gements if provided with adequate credit.50 Basically a group approach, if pro- moted by governments and civil society organizations, can help women gain access to land or other productive assets through the market, which they can rarely do as individuals.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63e2c3df-8beb-4e9b-9ec6-020b532a6cc0": {"__data__": {"id_": "63e2c3df-8beb-4e9b-9ec6-020b532a6cc0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45bab2dac8df3c817ecbf6c7119190657c50eab136077742cf8cca86b6f1ff66"}, "2": {"node_id": "f77fdc01-54fb-4634-b8ca-7bb50b5d7506", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c04723fb1f1e1dd32eb8b1376de76e040525cf1707edb8ec7c25369bac6577b1"}}, "hash": "8e00966c77008a932883ad6221a3b65a18ebc89e74353b7894b1c086ba5d5506", "text": "It can also help them retain and use more productively the assets they obtain directly from, say, families and governments.51 The geogra- phic spread and reach of such innova- tive approaches, however, needs to be increased.

ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 52 to women, especially those without a track record or network of support. Agricultural extension services rarely acknowledge that men and women may use agricultural assets differently and therefore require targeted forms of assistance. Some barriers to assets have come through policy and development processes that fail to recognize the impacts that gender can have. Women have lost traditional land rights during procedures that deliberately issue titles to male heads of households. States that have assigned plots as anti- poverty measures for poor households have seen these go mainly to male heads of house- hold, unless there are deliberate attempts to ensure joint ownership rights.53 In India, community forestry pro- grammes have been designed to provide spaces for poorer people, including women, to access and manage forest resources. But these have sometimes run into strong male resistance within communities where public decision- making is traditionally the realm of men.54 One lesson has been that simply including women in this kind of programme may not be enough without efforts to address underlying gender norms. The Benefits of Expanded Access The benefits of asset ownership and control begin with economic options and extend across many other aspects of women\u2019s empowerment and well-being. Expanding access can therefore spur progress towards gender equality on multiple fronts. A number of surveys from South Asia have found that women who own land have a greater say in household decision-making than women without land.55 According to field research in Nepal, when women control the income from livestock, they can make decisions indepen- dently on managing these assets.56 Asset ownership also influences fallback positions in times of crisis, whether that involves di- vorce, sickness, domestic violence or natural disaster57 (Boxes 2.3 and 2.4). It opens opportunities for political participation, as women begin to feel more confident in expres- sing their demands, and for health and educa- tion, since women have more control over financial resources. With all the positive potential, the relationship between assets and gender-based violence is not always straightforward. When formerly powerless persons start to assert themselves, pre-existing power structures can feel threatened. In situations of changing power dynamics, such as through policy action, civil society encouragement or other- wise, male backlash can contribute to increase in gender-based violence. These complexities do not always come out clearly in studies, but would benefit from explicit recognition in policies. In some cases, women already play major roles in managing assets, but this has been mostly obscured by a lack of attention and data defining their contributions. Public policies that recognize these roles might build on them both to achieve gender equality and reap economic benefits through unleashing potentials for greater productivity. Despite obstacles to credit and capital (Table 2.1), for example, the flow of women into business in Asia-Pacific is steady. Accord- ing to a survey of Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM),58 across the region up to 45 per cent of women are owners of businesses.59 Up to 35 per cent of small or medium enter- prises in the region are headed by women.60 In a region which has 86 per cent of the fishers and fish farmers worldwide, women in some countries perform the bulk of fish processing, either in their own cottage-level industries or large-scale industries.61 The Philippines has produced several examples of innovations by women, including highly successful technology and methods that have helped the shrimp hatchery industry to grow. Both have driven up production yields.62 Asset owner- ship also influ- ences fallback positions in times of crisis, whether that involves divorce, sick- ness, domestic violence or natural disaster CHAPTER 2: BUILDING ECONOMIC POWER 53 Microenterprises in particular have become an important way for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbb44899-7519-4b1b-83ef-ecb25a3ac553": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbb44899-7519-4b1b-83ef-ecb25a3ac553", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "108221dfa2ab78efa1af613238be33768b46ce5daa59a1a6d957bedec7633c26"}, "3": {"node_id": "f857e9e6-80bb-43e6-8a5d-c6b990270ac6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d6073297225ae882fb433044b8b8a6266c707131e367fe78d9bbd18cee41fd0e"}}, "hash": "601263e8bc3549ce9ce378499533ceac6cf494cc171d4545860ccc48a71975b0", "text": "poor women to build assets.63 Nine out of 10 enterprises in the Philippines are microenterprises\u2014and among microentrepreneurs, women outnum- ber men two to one in the trade and repairs sectors, for example.64 Women also operate nearly 20 per cent of the 14,560 registered small and micro-businesses in Fiji,65 as well as a third of enterprises employing between one and 21 people in Mongolia.66 The microcredit programmes that often fund these initiatives were pioneered in Asia- Pacific and have spread throughout the world. Globally, Asia has the largest number of microcredit borrowers and the highest percentage of poor women borrowers\u2014 98 per cent of the total in 2006, compared with 66 per cent in Africa and 62 per cent in Latin America.67 Overall, outcomes of microcredit include improved individual and household well-being, better nutritional status and increased education for children.68 Employment rises as well\u201450 per cent of women borrowers from Grameen Bank in Bangladesh (and almost seven per cent of men) were unemployed before joining it.69 The average borrower also works more days, as additional employment is generated.

But in some cases, assets like houses and land can play a critical role in protecting them from violence within the home. The Indian state of Kerala, for example, has high levels of women\u2019s literacy and a generally egalitarian environment for women. However, according to a survey in one part of Kerala conducted in 2001, violence against women is pervasive even there. Though it is difficult to get accu- rate data on this issue, up to 35.7 per cent of women reported having experienced at least one incident of physical violence after marriage. According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3), in 2005-2006, 16.4 per cent of ever-married women experienced spousal violence in Kerala. The risk of physical and psychological violence appears to decrease if women have control over assets, as discussed in the special contribution by Bina Agarwal in this Report. Other factors reducing risk may include social support from family and neighbours, and the household\u2019s economic status; both are negatively correlated to violence.

BOX 2.4 MORE AT RISK FROM DISASTER During the 1990s, more than two-thirds of the deaths from natural disasters globally occurred in Asia, which was also the continent most frequently hit by this kind of crisis. In societies where the socio-economic status of women is low, they are more likely than men to die as a result of disasters. Existing patterns of discrimination that render women more vulnerable to fatal consequences are exacerbated. In one eastern coastal district of Sri Lanka, after the tsunami, female mortality rates were twice those of men. Mobility restrictions especially disadvantage women when a disaster occurs. A disproportionate number of women died in the 1991 cyclone in Bangladesh because of cultural norms restricting them to their homes. They were less likely than men to know how to swim and had few chances of escaping from the affected areas. More women than men died in the tsunami in Sri Lanka because they did not know how to swim or climb trees. Disasters disrupt economic activities and land ownership and use patterns by killing land titleholders, destroying land records and erasing boundaries.

Crops that can be quickly grown and harvested, even if they lead to soil erosion, will take precedence over long-term options, such as slow-growing trees needed for reforestation.72 In a number of Asia-Pacific societies, women have knowledge about natural fores- try and other environmental resources that may be valued locally, but otherwise goes un- recognized in broader strategies to respond to climate change. Women also often have more ready access to common resources in forests than to agricultural land. Independently, they acquire knowledge of forestry in gathering wood for fuel, and of non-wood forestry products for food, medicines, construction materials and resources to sell for income. Around 80 per cent of people in developing countries rely on these products to meet nutrition and health needs.73 Women have knowledge about natural forestry and other environmental resources that may be valued locally, but otherwise goes unrecognized in broader strategies to respond to climate change TABLE 2.1 GENDER POSES OBSTACLES TO CREDIT Institutional Level Individual Household Community/National Constraint Embeddedness \u2022 Lack of education \u2022 Traditionally limited \u2022 Customs restrict women\u2019s Religious/ and skills role of women in ownership rights cultural/ \u2022 Lack of information decision-making \u2022 Constrained women\u2019s mobility Traditional and experience with within household \u2022 Perception that economically obtaining credit independent women ruin families Institutional \u2022 Women are not \u2022 Lack of protection \u2022 Women\u2019s equal rights to assets Political/ environment aware of or lack (statutory and for collateral are not defined or legal confidence in claim- customary) of implemented ing their rights women\u2019s rights to \u2022 Banks do not see women as jointly owned assets potential market \u2022 Formal rights to land ownership are lacking/weak Governance \u2022 Women undertake \u2022 Unequal access to and \u2022 Women are locked in low-paying Economic/ structure activities that control of land, labour jobs transactional produce low returns and inputs \u2022 Stereotypes of economic role of \u2022 Lack of access to \u2022 Gender division of women in society credit from banks labour (domestic, agri- \u2022 Perception that men control in their own right cultural and manufac- money/men decide \u2022 Limited monetary turing) \u2022 Women borrowers/entrepreneurs support from not taken seriously informal credit Resource allocation \u2022 Lack of control \u2022 Men decide on how \u2022 Few community credit resources Resource over own income household money is available for women borrowers \u2022 Decision-making allocated on allocations of \u2022 Household credit money for busi- channeled to husband nesses or family Note: The downward moving arrows signify influence from the higher level going down.

CHAPTER 2: BUILDING ECONOMIC POWER 55 We achieve what we want to achieve, change what we want to change: it is our vision or lack of vision which makes things happen or not happen. We can build the world according to our liking only if we decide what is it that we actually like. People are not born just to somehow survive until death, but rather, to explore their potential, to unleash their energy and unshackle their creativity. All human beings, women and men, should get a fair chance to do so without the hindrance of social and economic deprivation. Poverty compromises human rights. Our 1976 experiment in Jobra village, Bangladesh, unshackled a force that makes it possible for women and men to share in economic prosperity, partici- patory democracy and live in dignity.74 Grameen is no longer a word restricted to its Bengali language meaning \u2018of the village\u2019. Going beyond Bangladesh, beyond South Asia, it has become a symbol of progress and em- powerment of the poor, particularly women. Transformed into a formal bank in 1983, by mid-2009 the Grameen Bank operates in around 84,000 villages of Bangladesh with a total of 7.87 million borrowers, an overwhelming 97 per cent of whom are women.75 Group-based, collateral-free lending reduced the mono- poly power of moneylenders in informal rural credit markets and provided the poor access to financial services.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ff5e244-d090-4a0f-87ff-eedf2af9526a": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ff5e244-d090-4a0f-87ff-eedf2af9526a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cca6a4d544b20adb0cdf8e4c2f32af00ad36784f4c8f5635fe8f8f8a147d11a2"}, "2": {"node_id": "aeaa9123-9227-4162-9e61-ca5bcfba0912", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66994577369731af0c788d1472ed4428f10ba5d382f7af960a4f8ff3f5252a71"}}, "hash": "627a9244166f5bf95513e71313e494959d182560313357e8f2e97681e6176395", "text": "The past two decades have seen a huge growth of microfinance institutions (MFIs) in developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America.

According to the Microcredit Summit Campaign, more than 106 million of the world\u2019s poorest families received a microloan by 2007, surpassing the goal of 100 million set ten years earlier. Notably, between 1997 and 2007, the number of microloans has grown from eight million to 106 million very poor women worldwide.76 Increase in women\u2019s incomes and assets. Globally, microfinance has had a strong female client base. Grameen Bank focuses on women because \u2018giving loans to women always brought more benefits to the family\u2019.77 The positive impact on income generation and entrepreneur- ship has been widely studied around the world.78 Overall, women\u2019s access to financial services has indeed led to individual and household economic em- powerment.79 In the case of Grameen, 68 per cent of borrower families who have been with Grameen Bank for more than five years crossed the poverty line.80 Under Grameen Bank\u2019s housing loan, 640,000 homes have been financed and legal ownership is with the women themselves.81 Studies from Bangladesh also show that credit to women incre- ased women\u2019s non-land assets.82 Ano- ther less recognized aspect is savings in women\u2019s own names, which contribute to economic security. Savings is a key product of Grameen Bank. Borrowers\u2019 total deposits amount to around US $539 million.83 A critical point is that bene- ficiaries are also shareholders in Grameen: they own the bank. Increase in social and public partici- pation. Going beyond the family, microfinance has enlarged the exposure of poor women to different public insti- tutions, increased their mobility, social networks, and interaction with govern- ment officials at the local and national levels. A number of studies have found positive impacts not just in Bangladesh, but also in other countries such as India. For example, one study noted that membership matters in attending panchayat (a local governance institu- tion) meetings for those previously socially excluded.84 In a study in Tamil Nadu,85 India, significant differences between members and non-members were noted: in the past five years members visited more places together, increased their circle of friends and made friends from other castes or communities. The study also found that 95 per cent of members voted during the last panchayat elections; many of them discussed the pros and cons of candidates during group meetings. Studies in Bangladesh showed positive impacts on women\u2019s access to government pro- grammes, voting in national and local elections and accurately naming the local level elected woman representative. Transformative potential: changing male attitudes. Microfinance has catalyzed mindset changes among men as well \u2013 particularly significant in strong patriar- chal societies. Women have benefited from greater voice, participation and support in the home and community. Impact studies have noted that women are empowered, not only through the process of making independent decisions on loans and enterprise profits, but also by participating much more actively with their husbands and other house- hold members in joint economic deci- sions.86 In countries where micro- finance is predominant, there are signs of transformation from within in terms of lower fertility rates, better health and nutrition and higher literacy rates for women. For example, in Bangladesh loans to women positively influenced children\u2019s education and contraceptive use, in addition to the more obvious economic benefits.87 Positive effects on individual women and on households were observed in India where men have also supported women\u2019s activity.88 In remote areas with difficult market access, men\u2019s support has contributed to the sustainability of women\u2019s income generating activities.

Despite the obvious rationale for basic health care for all, patterns of gender dis- parities exist in most Asia-Pacific countries. Because of better health services, life expec- tancy has improved for both men and women,89 especially in South-East Asia.90 But the ratio of female-male life expectancy is below the world average of 1.06 in several countries in the region, defying the biological advantages of women at birth.91 This dis- crepancy stems from a lifetime of gender dis- crimination, starting from the deliberate abortion of female foetuses and extending through nutritional shortchanges in the distribution of food. In some cases, gender norms also disadvantage men\u2019s health, particularly through stress on aggression and risk-taking. Men have higher rates of injury, including traffic accidents. In the mining sector in China and Thailand they suffer from high rates of respiratory infections and mercury poisoning, and have a lower body mass index than people of other occupations.92 Since good health is a condition for earning a livelihood, gender inequalities in health care also limit women\u2019s abilities to work and move up the economic ladder. Loss of potential or actual income results, further undercutting what may be an already limited ability to pay for health care. Across Asia- Pacific, women work longer hours than men and still spend a significantly higher propor- tion of their time on household chores. Being indoors longer than men, they are more likely to have an acute respiratory infection due to their exposure to pollutants from cooking and heating.93 The heavier workload also leads to greater musculoskeletal problems, including during pregnancy, and less time to access health care services.94 In Nepal, a study conducted among Tamang women indicated that their heavy workload produces a high incidence of uterine prolapse soon after delivery. One of their main tasks is to collect heavy wood loads, and they start working from the third day of delivery.95 Women in the garment industry in Fiji, who are required to sit in the same position as men, suffer from body pains, obesity, and bladder and kidney problems.96 Severe gender inequality is also giving rise to heightened HIV vulnerability among women. The proportion of women among people living with HIV in Asia is growing, from 19 per cent in 2000 to 24 per cent in 2007.97 In South Asia, for example, more than 60 per cent of over one million HIV positive youths aged 15-24 are women.98 The impact of HIV is most evident at the household level in Asia. Women as caregivers, workers and surviving spouses, generally bear the brunt of the consequences. Severe Gender inequalities in health care also limit women\u2019s abilities to work and move up the economic ladder CHAPTER 2: BUILDING ECONOMIC POWER 57 household impacts of HIV often forces women into distress situations, including sexual exploitation, that heighten their vulnerability to HIV. Most of the women living with HIV in Asia have been infected by their partners.99 According to a study in India, female victims of intimate partner violence show higher incidence of sexually transmitted infection or HIV prevalence. Abused wives face increased HIV risk based both on the greater likelihood of HIV infection among abusive husbands and elevated HIV transmission within abusive relationships.100 Women affected by communicable diseases associated with stigma, particularly HIV/AIDS, tend to lose jobs. Concentrated in the urban informal sector, subsistence farming or lower-paid jobs in the formal sector, they have little security in terms of income, insurance or social protection. Loss of income from an ill partner can force women without education and skills into hazardous occupations, including sex work, which further increase their vulnerability. On the death of the husband the woman is often blamed and, in the worst instances, deprived of rights to land and housing.101 In India, despite constitutional guarantees and legal safeguards, a study102 shows that as high as 79 per cent of HIV positive widows were denied a share in their husband\u2019s property. More than 90 per cent of the HIV positive widows had stopped living in their marital homes after the death of their husband. Labour and health laws lag behind desirable standards in much of the region. Anti-discrimination legislation mostly does not cover men and women with HIV, and laws have little to say on coverage of the health needs of sexual/gender minorities. Indonesia is one of the few countries to pass legislation on the right to health.103 Asia-Pacific has few mechanisms to hold either public or private market institutions accountable for providing basic health care or ensuring gender equality in that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6038665e-a879-44f0-99fa-47275fdce9a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "6038665e-a879-44f0-99fa-47275fdce9a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "587b70a5fb81a6f3b0a7a242c503c05a4932ff02c4758bd62b128020e0ba277d"}}, "hash": "587b70a5fb81a6f3b0a7a242c503c05a4932ff02c4758bd62b128020e0ba277d", "text": "process. The shift towards private health care has meant rising medical costs that affect poorer men and women most. Although no regional data exist on gender biases in health care expenditures, some studies show that biases within households reduce women\u2019s access to care. Particularly in homes with scarce resources, spending on women\u2019s health may receive low priority, as seen in many parts of South Asia. A study in Bangladesh observed that rural girls suffering from diarrhoea are less likely than boys to receive an antibiotic, and in urban areas are less likely to be seen by a licensed allopath.104 In rural China, women are more likely than men to go blind as a result of cataracts, corneal opacity and glaucoma, all of which are treatable.105 In parts of South Asia, an important health issue is the lack of female health professionals; women and girls are prevented by customs to seek treatment from male health professionals. Lack of awareness, combined with reliance on faith-based cures, can contribute to the poor health of women in particular. Paid Work Opens Doors In recent decades, high economic growth rates and changing social norms in Asia-Pacific have brought women into the paid workforce in record numbers. Paid work is important to women for income\u2014and because it can help them cultivate new capabilities and develop a greater sense of autonomy. When it takes place outside the home, it can bring women into contact with new people and ideas, and break restrictive social conventions. As is the case with assets, it may be an avenue for greater participation in public life, including through collective bargaining or broader political processes, as women acquire a sense of the value of their voice and contri- butions.106 In Bangladesh and India, studies of the impact of outside work on the domestic High economic growth rates and changing social norms in Asia- Pacific have brought women into the paid workforce in record numbers ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 58 balance of power have found a move away from decisions based on norms that favour male control. Decisions become joint, rather than a male prerogative.107 Bangladeshi women working outside the house in formal jobs have higher levels of savings, greater mobility and a lower incidence of domestic violence,108 though the number of women in formal-sector jobs is low. But women\u2019s entry into the labour market can also undercut a central aspect of masculine gender identity: the position of men as provider-protectors. Studies show that men can experience shame at perceived \u2018failure\u2019 to provide for their families. High expectations around such predefined gender roles can be a source of strain on men, who often face social pressure to demonstrate virility among male peers.109 This can result in depression, which is high among unemp- loyed men. Crisis situations can trigger extreme reactions, such as farmer suicides and gender-based violence. However, assumptions about women\u2019s role in the labour market, reflected in the policies of many Asia-Pacific countries, may not actually benefit women. One such assumption is that paid work of any kind can be the path out of poverty. This has fed a heavy emphasis across the region on deregulation to boost the creation of jobs, with much less focus on social protection or even the quality of employment. It has helped obscure the fact that the labour market is rife with gender inequalities, so that women in Asia-Pacific consistently end up with some of the worst, most poorly paid jobs\u2014often the ones that men don\u2019t want to do, or those assumed to be \u2018naturally\u2019 suited to women. Where these biases go unchecked, policy- making remains partially blind to the potential of women in the paid workforce as well as to the principles of fairness and equal opportunity. It may also overlook associated economic costs. By contrast, East Asia, the most successfully growing sub-region in Asia- Pacific, has the smallest gender gap in the world in the employment-to-population ratio, and lower segmentation of jobs by gender. Not Enough: Participation, Pay, Opportunity A number of factors catalyze women\u2019s entrance into paid work. Improved literacy and school enrolment rates are coupled with shifting attitudes towards women\u2019s work, including growing social acceptance of women employed outside the home.110 Women\u2019s work can be an economic imperative for survival or part of aspirations for a better life (Box 2.5).

In the early 1990s, a policy of trade and border liberalization resulted in the opening of checkpoints to allow the movement of people and goods, including at Sayaboury in 1996. While there is a long history of weaving and trade in woven cloth involving women in many villages in Sayaboury province, the war severely disrupted this aspect of the community\u2019s life. Since the mid-1990s, however, weaving and trading in material have once again returned as an important source of cash-income in an economically impoverished area. The government has also played a role in introducing weaving as a source of income among groups that did not have a history of it. The effect of the revival of weaving upon women\u2019s social position is interestingly linked to the ways in which weaving is perceived as a gendered activity. So, in villages with a previous history of weaving, it continues to be regarded as \u2018woman\u2019s work\u2019 that can be conducted when women have \u2018free time\u2019 on their hands. In villages where the activity has been newly introduced, there are few preconceived no- tions attached to it. Weaving is considered a major source of income.

These trends hold despite considerable variations among countries. In 2007, women\u2019s labour participation rate was less than 35 per cent in India and Pakistan, for example, compared to some 70 per cent or more in Cambodia, China, Papua New Guinea and Viet Nam (Figure 2.2). Even so, men\u2019s participation rate was higher in all of these countries. Nearly 70 per cent of women had paid employment in East Asia in 2007 compared to 58.9 per cent in South-East Asia and the Pacific and only 37.4 per cent in South Asia.111 The corresponding figures for men were 83.1 per cent, 87.8 per cent and 86.4 per cent, respectively. Female labour force participation reflects only partially women\u2019s contribution to the wider economy. Official statistics miss unpaid economic activities, such as work on family farms and enterprises and contri- bution to the care economy, which have many larger societal benefits. Women have a higher unemployment rate than men in every Asia-Pacific sub-region, except East Asia. In South Asia, South-East Asia and the Pacific, the differences between male and female unemployment figures in 2008 were twice the global average.112 Despite laws guaranteeing equal pay for equal work, women still earn only 54 to 90 per cent of what men earn in Asia-Pacific countries.113 Women also participate less in the labour market. The two factors contribute to lower earnings by females on average. The ratio of female-to-male estimated income in 2007 (in Purchasing Power Parity terms) is less than one for all countries in the region, varying from 0.18 for Pakistan to 0.87 for Mongolia114 (Figure 2.3). Wage gaps arise from women\u2019s predominance in lower-paid positions; interruptions in their work life, often related to family concerns; and the lower valuation of typically female occupa- tions. Other obstacles include biases of some employers and women\u2019s generally weak bargaining power. Gender wage gaps vary across countries and economic sectors and change over time, persisting not only in Figure 2.2: Fewer Women Than Men Participate in the Workforce Figure 2.2: Fewer Women Than Men Participate in the Workforce Figure 2.2: Fewer Women Than Men Participate in the Workforce Figure 2.2: Fewer Women Than Men Participate in the Workforce Labour Force Participation Rates of Women and Men, 2007 Source: Based on ILO 2009b.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18f8557e-4bfd-40b8-b26d-914072b5de99": {"__data__": {"id_": "18f8557e-4bfd-40b8-b26d-914072b5de99", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b084e2e052823801d28713493cea0744f3fe3e7e99d07bf3837aca4057b98073"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d783a92-845b-4494-ae85-5a942f46e754", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26d2f0a2975988b20860d92f378d3ecaf382b780eb7d0c7162427be0343920ad"}}, "hash": "1b862e59b16790aa29db16bc8b6278253e26ba07b60ddfcf803af61b530de8f4", "text": "Figure 2.3: Women Earn Less than Men Figure 2.3: Women Earn Less than Men Figure 2.3: Women Earn Less than Men Figure 2.3: Women Earn Less than Men Ratio of Female-to-Male Estimated Earned Income in Asia-Pacific, 2007, US $ PPP Source: Based on UNDP 2009.

For example, female computer programmers make 80 per cent of what men do in Singapore and 90 per cent in the Republic of Korea.115 Gender also affects the types of employ- ment women can choose. In countries where men migrate from rural areas to seek oppor- tunities elsewhere, a growing number of women are expected to remain behind to run family farms. In South Asia, the agricultural sector comprised more than 65 per cent of all female employment in 2007, the same level as in sub-Saharan Africa.116 Across Asia- Pacific, more women than men enter the service sector, possibly because of job prefe- rences and the different requirements for job skills compared to manufacturing, where men predominate (Figure 2.4). Service jobs also encompass many forms of employment that conform to stereotypes about women\u2019s capabilities, such as nursing and care work. Provisions for maternity leave vary and are frequently absent, although some encou- raging steps have been taken. In China, the Methods for Maternity Insurance of Enter- prise Workers provides for public pooling of insurance resources. Enterprises surrender maternity premiums, calculated according to a fixed percentage of a worker\u2019s wages, to designated insurers to establish a maternity insurance fund. Maternity benefits consist of a maternity allowance, leave with pay and health care. By presenting their maternity certificates, women workers may obtain allowances from the designated insurers and have maternity-related health care expenses reimbursed. The pay for women workers on maternity leave is fixed at the level of the enterprise\u2019s monthly average in the previous year and disbursed by the fund.117 Women\u2019s Work Involves Poorer Terms Across all job sectors, women\u2019s labour has certain common characteristics. Women workers are often in demand after available supplies of male labour are exhausted, or because women are willing to accept low wages and poorer work conditions. Most employed women in Asia-Pacific are in vulnerable employment, broadly defined as self-employed or own-account workers and contributing family workers.118 In 2007 this definition covered 61.4 per cent of women in East Asia, 66.2 per cent in South-East Asia and the Pacific, and 85.1 per cent in South Asia. The respective figures for men were 51.1 per cent, 58.9 per cent and 74.3 per cent. All these numbers are above the global averages of 53 per cent of women and 49 per cent of men.119 In the region as a whole, wage and salary employment is higher for men than women. Usually wage and salary employment increases through growth and development over time, although this is not consistently the case in Asia-Pacific. While many countries do not collect this data, numbers from the Maldives and Pakistan suggest that wage and salary employment may be dropping. Sri Lanka has also registered a slight decline.120 For women facing this tendency plus the barrier of fewer marketable skills, self- Figure 2.4: More Men than Women are in Industry, Figure 2.4: More Men than Women are in Industry, Figure 2.4: More Men than Women are in Industry, Figure 2.4: More Men than Women are in Industry, But Not in the Services But Not in the Services But Not in the Services But Not in the Services Female-Male Differences in Job Sectors, 2007 Note: Bars represent differences between the percentage share of total female workers and total male workers engaged in agriculture, industry and services in 2007.

Low pay is justified by the notion that men are the real breadwinners, perceived to be the heads of households, and \u2018deserve\u2019 to earn more. But segregated job markets not only limit women\u2019s employment options, but also reduce the wages they can expect to earn.122 Women have also become an essential source of labour in export-processing zones, a major source of new jobs in Asia-Pacific. Yet women working there face a series of well- documented problems. Many jobs offer only low-paying piece-rate work, at wages less than those earned by men and under poor working conditions. Sexual harassment can be com- mon.123 Labour organizing is discouraged.124 Women workers in the manufacturing industry are increasing in low-paid and sub- contracting jobs. In India, for instance, the share of women in manufacturing in a subsidiary capacity (not as the perceived prin- cipal activity of the women concerned) has been increasing since 1987-1988, currently accounting for 11 per cent of all women employed in manufacturing.125 An important reason for this is the growth of home-based sub-contracting for exports as well as domestic manufacturing. Pay is often poor and on a piece-rate basis and such work is not incorporated in employment statistics. This may explain the paradox that even while women\u2019s share of recorded employment in manufacturing has not increased much, the dependence of the sector on the productive contributions of women may well have increased. In 2004-2005, there were just under 15 million women workers in the informal sector. More than half of them were women involved in home-based work for different industries, mostly on a piece-rate basis.126 While these jobs can provide oppor- tunities, workers are also vulnerable to the growing competitiveness faced by export- based industries such as garments. In the midst of the after effects of the global economic downturn, gender disparities are also now apparent in the disposability of female workers. More than half of the 40,000 jobs lost in the Philippines were in export- processing zones, where 80 per cent of workers are women. By February 2009, Cambodia and Sri Lanka had shed 30,000 mostly female garment industry jobs. In addition, employers have reportedly pres- sured women to waive severance, leave and social insurance benefits, knowing they may not understand their rights or have the means to protect them.127 Informal Employment is Often the Only Option Tremendous population shifts have occurred in much of Asia-Pacific through the explosive growth of cities and migration away from rural areas. For millions of people, livelihood strategies have changed from eking out a living on a small plot of land to earning an income in urban service, business or industry. New employment options have opened up, but the nature of work is frequently insecure, with little fallback available. The share of informal employment in India exceeds 90 per cent of total employment, for example; in Sri Lanka, the figure is two- thirds.128 Informal work is one of the factors driving more people in the region to pursue diversified livelihoods, piecing together various sources of sustenance to make ends meet. Diverse factors influence the nature of informal work in urban and rural areas, but common to both is that gender norms Women have become an essential source of labour in export- processing zones, a major source of new jobs in Asia-Pacific.

Women\u2019s more tenuous employment paths, limited skills and restricted mobility help explain why they comprise more informal-sector workers than men in most countries (Figure 2.5). In India and Indonesia, nine out of every 10 women working outside agriculture hold informal-sector jobs, as do half or more of non-agricultural workers in parts of East Asia.129 In urban areas, evidence from some Asia- Pacific countries suggests that men and women are about equally engaged in informal work.130 Even so, women dominate certain segments \u2013 such as income activities based in homes. These are often statistically invisible. Fully counting them would likely increase both the share of women in informal jobs and the share of informal workers in the work force.131 Home-workers typically produce gar- ments, fashion accessories, toys and handi- crafts for domestic and export markets, fre- quently under exploitive and unstable condi- tions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "011e93b4-dc0a-439c-be30-ec2e40356dc0": {"__data__": {"id_": "011e93b4-dc0a-439c-be30-ec2e40356dc0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b24b7204247a88cd813aa4efd35ff48c97e21f3c439d5b4fe29b68cadcdecf9"}, "2": {"node_id": "d7fadbbf-78d7-465b-9215-787004061d33", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "07a5965e1ed18440c2152b386ed00bf8422b10bf8ebfa39bcfca5dec8b1dc645"}}, "hash": "234a7b10092a83f3571f6f929c86feb9106056214f0a3f4871fc477b6bba9e6a", "text": "Many live in cramped quarters, with detrimental effects on their own and their children\u2019s health.132 Some women choose such work because of the flexible hours, greater compatibility with family responsibi- lities and relative ease of entry.

A study of slum dwellers in New Delhi, India, found that several factors combine to keep women in low-paying and vulnerable urban jobs.134 They use informal networks of neighbours, friends and relatives to find employment, often close to where they live. But neither the networks nor the location may offer diverse choices. Women in low-paying jobs also often do not have the means to build capabilities that might allow them to move to a higher level. In comparison, male workers\u2019 contacts as well as mobility are greater. Despite their drawbacks, urban informal- sector jobs can offer new openings to women. In Taiwan, Province of China, the pattern of industrialization has generated a large and heterogeneous informal sector that draws heavily on married women, for example. In small family enterprises, wives contribute their labour as unpaid workers.135 A survey of 50 small family businesses in different industries found that men take charge of market relations and outside business contracts, and women manage the businesses from within the firm.136 Though women are usually subordinate to men in these arrange- ments, bosses\u2019 wives are often in an indis- pensable position in the family business, which bolsters their bargaining power at home as well as the workplace. In rural areas, changes in informal work mainly stem from the shrinking position of agriculture in transforming economies.137 As other sectors leap ahead, rural areas are being left behind, yet this is where about 80 per cent of the poor live. Women\u2019s work or manage- ment of farms due to male migration are curtailed when men return and take control over marketing crops women have grown. Women also have less access to credit, agricul- Figure 2.5: Gender Segmentation of the Informal Economy Figure 2.5: Gender Segmentation of the Informal Economy Figure 2.5: Gender Segmentation of the Informal Economy Figure 2.5: Gender Segmentation of the Informal Economy Source: Chen et al. 2004.

Men and younger women are leaving rural areas, while older women remain. Some evidence suggests that this provides a social safety net of food and care for migrants with risky urban jobs. The willingness of older women to manage farms also frees younger women to work in cities.140 Yet amid increased female migration, vulner- able forms of employment still dominate. In some countries, corporate farming is ushering in technological changes and the commercialization of agriculture in ways that have marginalized smaller farms, which women are more likely to own. Women who opt to work on corporate farms have jobs that are seasonal, long, less safe and insecure, and have no scope for advancement.141 In Punjab, India, about 60 per cent of labourers in corporate tomato farming are seasonal female workers.142 They earn about 60 to 75 per cent of what men do and face health and safety risks, and sexual harassment.

Some economists in Asia-Pacific and else- where have argued for calculating the value of women\u2019s unpaid domestic work. In Fiji, for example, recent research estimates the value of unpaid household work at almost FJD480 million (US $237 million), a figure greater than the income from sugar or tourism, the country\u2019s two largest industries. Sums like these have been helpful in drawing attention to women\u2019s immense but statisti- cally invisible contributions. They validate women\u2019s economic contributions instead of treating their unpaid work as being \u2018unpro- ductive\u2019.144 In 1993 the United Nations Statistical Division extended its System of National Accounts to include unpaid care work in national accounting systems as satellite accounts, a kind of alternative calculation of Gross Domestic Product. This can provide a fuller understanding of not just the economic value of unpaid work, but also how resources and time are allocated. It can further help in monitoring the impact of policies on services critical to welfare that are provided within households or from the market.145 Education for People and Economies Through constitutional guarantees of educa- tion as a basic right, targeted reforms and national development plans, a number of Asia-Pacific countries have tacitly recognized Combination of paid and unpaid labour forces women to make choices that may not be ideal for them or their families\u2014or even the broader eco- nomy if women\u2019s capabilities remain confined or untapped ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 64 the value of education as a social good and a source of human capital. Education has transformative potential for individuals and societies. It helps people make greater econo- mic contributions and gain more benefits through enhanced productivity and earn- ings.146 It is part of the process of changing social conditioning that limits the ways people see themselves and their society, including in terms of gender. The returns from educating girls are multiplied by the impact on fertility, which declines, and the schooling of the next generation, which improves.147 A seminal 1993 World Bank study demonstrated that high-performing econo- mies in East Asia, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Thailand, had been much more success- ful\u2014and quicker\u2014than others in eliminating gender gaps in school enrolment. At the regional level, a strong correlation exists between the increase in the number of years the average girl spends in school and the growth of per capita GDP.148 And in countries with higher initial education, a one per cent increase in the share of adult women with secondary school education may boost per capita income growth by 0.3 per cent.149 Shortfalls in Access and Quality In primary education, two-thirds of Asia- Pacific countries have achieved gender parity. However, South Asia scores much lower on female-to-male enrolment ratios for primary, secondary and tertiary education than East Asia and the Pacific.150 Its achievements are only marginally higher than in sub-Saharan Africa; girls start out relatively well in schools in South Asia, but start to disappear as education progresses. At the same time, while there are still fewer women than men in tertiary education across the region, their numbers are steadily growing. The average gender parity index climbed from 0.75 in 1999 to 0.94 in 2006; in some countries, including Mongolia, the Philippines and Thailand, women even have an edge over men.151 The parity index has climbed to 1.31 in the Pacific.152 A gender gap favouring men lingers in South and West Asia, though. Even as Asia-Pacific has moved towards closing male-female education gaps, issues of access and quality remain. Education systems still perpetuate gender stereotypes and fall short of adequately preparing women for the workplace. This can be a handicap in an era when a well-prepared, flexible workforce is key to managing rapid changes in the global economy. Gender stereotypes in textbooks, for example, commonly underscore that women and men are limited to certain roles. A study on primary Chinese-language school text- books in Hong Kong, China (SAR), published during 1995 and 2000 found that women and girls are underrepresented overall and rarely appear as main characters. They are more visible in family or household settings, while men and boys are more dominant in public settings.

An old Bengali saying reflects the view that resources invested in a daughter will be lost: \u2018Caring for a daughter is like watering a neighbour\u2019s tree\u2019. It is one of the arguments used to keep girls out of school in Bangladesh,154 although it produces a self-reinforcing cycle. When women do not acquire skills, they cannot exercise choice or attain better employment. Stereotypes Curtail Impacts Given the persistence of gender stereotypes in formal schooling, education does not auto- matically translate into the best jobs or transform one\u2019s social and political standing. In Hong Kong, China (SAR), China, and Thailand in 2005, for example, unemploy- ment was highest for males with only primary education and for females with secondary education.155 The political, economic and social climate in a country influences both gender parity in education and the extent to which it translates into more and better employment opportunities. This implies that education is only one element in a strategy to empower women; it is not a proxy for empowerment. Gender discrimination operates on many fronts, so even educated woman may still have limited control over decisions that affect their lives, including basic choices such as where to work and how to spend their earnings. In Indonesia, for example, girls are almost at par with boys in primary and secondary gross enrolment and are closing the gap in tertiary education. But school-to-work transition surveys show that perceptions of \u2018appropriate\u2019 gender roles and of the division of responsibilities between men and women continue to influence job opportunities for both. Young women are still expected to quit their work after marriage or after the birth of their first child.156 The ratio of male-to- female employment rates for youth in Indonesia is 1.8, indicating a significantly higher propensity for men to be employed. When women do enter the workforce, as in other countries, they tend to occupy low- paying and low-skilled occupations. Countries that now have more women than men in tertiary education, such as Mongolia and the Philippines, show women with an edge in service sector jobs. But they still do not match men in the generally higher- paying manufacturing sector. Only 14.8 per cent of Mongolian women\u2019s employment was in industry in 2005, compared to 18.9 per cent of men\u2019s. Similar patterns hold in the Philippines.157 In the Islamic Republic of Iran, higher enrolment of women in tertiary education compared to men has increased the number of female teachers, university profes- sors, researchers, health workers, scientists, physicians, artists, writers, poets, film- makers, lawyers, athletes and journalists whose activities are visible at the local and national levels. Yet even though female labour force participation rates have improved over time, they still stood at 32 per cent in 2007, less than half the male figure of 75 per cent.158 Education does not automatically lead to political voice either. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, despite the favourable changes for females in higher education, their level of participation in the political sphere is low.159 Women held only four per cent of the seats in the national Parliament in 2007.160 While education is not the only input into women\u2019s economic empowerment, it is a central one. It can provide an unparalleled expansion of choices, more so for those without physical assets. Education equips individuals with basic capabilities to develop intellectually, expand mental horizons and increase livelihood options. It is crucial, therefore, that all levels of the formal education system are gender-equal in access and quality and systematically eliminate all forms of bias.

Migration Trends Recent trends show that more women from Asia-Pacific are making the move to new countries or new areas within their own country for work, marriage or other reasons.161 The number of female migrants has risen over the last decade in all sub- regions except South and West Asia, reaching or exceeding the number of male migrants in some countries (Figure 2.6).162 Indonesia and Sri Lanka deploy more female than male migrant workers\u2014between 60 and 80 per cent of all legal migrants for work. In the Philippines, women migrants began outnumbering men as long ago as 1992,163 although by 2007 there were roughly equal numbers of men and women migrating.164 Single migrant workers represent a common phenomenon in the region, as does migration between Asia-Pacific countries and to the Arab States. Internal migration data are seriously constrained by inadequate official statistical systems. But an overview of research in four Asian countries suggests that migration within Asia is high and has increased during the last two decades.165 Men and women are on the move from rural to urban areas, usually seeking non-farm employment opportunities. For example, the sharp growth of tourism and manufacturing in Thailand has prompted more than 1.3 million women from rural areas to move to urban, municipal areas.166 While the recent global economic down- turn is expected to affect international migration and remittances, it is uncertain how severe the impacts will be. Huge job losses have already hit export manufacturing, trimming the ranks of male and female internal migrants from rural areas.167 Construction jobs have disappeared mainly for men, but impacts on export processing zones and call centres may affect women more, since they are employed in large numbers there. The need for women in care- giving is likely to remain relatively constant, but those engaged as domestic help would be more at risk of job loss.168 In China\u2019s Guangzhou Province, where many women professionals have moved in recent years to find employment, Home EZ Services has reported an uptick in the number of women with higher education applying for domestic work.169 Figure 2.6: Almost Half of Asia-Pacific Migrants Are Women Figure 2.6: Almost Half of Asia-Pacific Migrants Are Women Figure 2.6: Almost Half of Asia-Pacific Migrants Are Women Figure 2.6: Almost Half of Asia-Pacific Migrants Are Women Female Migrants as Percentage of All International Migrants in UNESCAP Sub-Regions, 1995, 2000 and 2005 Source: Based on UN 2009a.

As much as economic \u2018push\u2019 factors, social conventions guide whether or not women have the freedom to move to a new place, work in a job of their choice and make choices that will be respected by their family and community (Box 2.6). The major \u2018sending countries\u2019 in Asia-Pacific, Indonesia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka, have relatively open emigration policies for women. In several West Asian countries, however, the approach is more restrictive, compounded by customary practices. As is true of employment at large, women migrants are dominant in the care and enter- tainment sectors, where jobs are regarded as \u2018appropriate\u2019 for them, even if they possess different or better qualifications.

Many women who came to work in KIMA were motivated by the opportunity for urban life and work to provide a degree of freedom from familial control. But even as the zone drew in a large number of young women, the Indonesian state was propagating gender norms emphasizing women\u2019s roles as supportive wives and dutiful daughters. Instead of being viewed as \u2018respectable\u2019 breadwinners, women workers confronted stereotypes about the zones as sites of loose morality where women could mix freely with men. Bowing to social pressure, many women workers eventually presented their decision to work in the zone as a quest for finding a husband. Sources: Silvey 2000; Srivastava 2009b.

Sex work is largely unregulated and unquantified in Asia- Pacific, but one estimate from the 1990s suggested it was a major economic force, accounting for two to 14 per cent of GDP in four South-East Asian countries.176 Japan has deliberately encouraged Filipina workers in entertainment establishments by dubbing them skilled workers with special provisions under its Immigration Control Act.177 Rewards and Risks For developing countries with too many wor- kers and not enough jobs, labour migration \u2013 especially when it is temporary \u2013 can help improve the economy, the balance of payments and the lives of migrants. Remittances can ease families out of poverty and provide more money for health care and education. Migra- tion also benefits host economies by reducing cyclical labour shortages and filling jobs that nationals do not take up. Both sending and receiving locations benefit. Migration could enable women to find new employment opportunities, higher in- comes and recognition of the value of their work. The knowledge of conditions and possi- bilities elsewhere can have an important libe- rating effect, stirring momentum for positive social change and gender empowerment over time. Many women see migration as a tempo- rary means of achieving certain objectives, such as savings to build a home or educate children. These objectives are difficult to achieve in the short term, so women typically stay longer than expected. But delayed re- turns are not always because of inadequate savings or other constraints. Some migrant women workers start appreciating the auto- nomy that comes from earning their own livelihood and are willing to continue, even at significantly lower wages than those received by local workers, or under adverse and de- manding working conditions. Some evidence suggests that patterns of economic migration may be changing in ways that reflect women\u2019s growing empowerment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71035a7b-55ff-43aa-a69f-0dfc44395cd4": {"__data__": {"id_": "71035a7b-55ff-43aa-a69f-0dfc44395cd4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56de3094f43aabbcf63d90080556ec5d3a0a0f641ea8b47eff273260da07f17d"}, "2": {"node_id": "76565e00-ad20-4504-b15d-929c1187f27e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1800685c544fd2e3a1ef8befb1a0cf26b66d737f834d26b13907ed2641e54fc3"}}, "hash": "bd12cd35b02b30dfc2d4452f53955c161e77d610a3735bd30b618df77c38576e", "text": "The migration of women into Australia used to be dominated by less-skilled women accom- panying their husbands or entering as part of family reunification programmes.178 In recent years, more professional and skilled female entrants are coming on their own.

Women migrants also can be highly vulnerable to HIV, for example, among Asian women working in parts of Arab States.180 This stems mainly from the vulnerabilities they face at different stages of the migration cycle. The isolated and individualized nature of household work in unfamiliar and harsh conditions, combined with inadequate local labour laws, put domestic workers in parti- cular at greater risk to verbal, physical and sexual abuse. Migrants found to be HIV posi- tive are often dismissed from their jobs and summarily deported.

The barriers are not insurmountable. Progress is coming from many directions, fueled at times by growing recognition of the potentially huge economic contributions women can make. Sources of change include political commit- ments to gender equality, deliberate policy interventions, economic forces generating new sources of wealth and opportunities, and the choices women make to pursue new capabi- lities and livelihoods. Further steps can direct and speed up this process by freeing access to assets, expanding paid employment, connect- ing education to new opportunities, investing in women\u2019s health, and making mobility safe. All these areas require specific responses, but they have many levels of interconnection that should be considered as well. Remove Barriers to Assets Eliminate discriminatory laws and close legal gaps, particularly those relating to inheritance and marriage (Box 2.8). When rights are defined by law and formalized through specific legal procedures that are widely acknowledged and applied, people can be confident that their property will remain their own. They can also enjoy the freedom to use it to pursue other assets, including using it as collateral for loans. Laws in many cases need to move beyond assumptions about \u2018neutrality\u2019 to address the specific constraints that women face. Despite obvious discrepancies in land ownership bet- ween men and women in Asia and the Pacific, discussions on formalizing land rights under the law have made few references to these. Formalized rights are assumed to uniformly apply, even as women confront discrimi- natory inheritance practices and a variety of disadvantages in claiming legal rights, as will be discussed at greater length in Chapter 4. Improvements in statutes themselves should be coupled with initiatives to change public attitudes that tolerate unfair practices that are illegal. Given long-entrenched customs around asset ownership and control, results can be mixed when limited attention Laws in many cases need to move beyond assumptions about \u2018neutrality\u2019 to address the specific constraints that women face BOX 2.8 REFORMS EXTEND WOMEN\u2019S RIGHTS TO OWN LAND Several South-east Asian countries have attempted land reforms designed to deliberately combat discrimination in land ownership. In Cambodia, traditionally women had equal access to land through inheritance. But when land distribution took place in the 1980s, communal ownership was replaced by private land. This had a negative impact on women, since land was usually registered only in the name of the husband. The land law passed in 2001 aims to strengthen land tenure security, promote land distribution with equity and protect women\u2019s rights. The new law has brought changes in land titling. According to a 2007 survey, 20 per cent of titling is now in the wife\u2019s name, five per cent in the husband\u2019s name and 70 per cent under both names. But challenges continue to exist.

One study found that women often need their husbands\u2019 permission to include their names on land titles. If men decide to sell land, women are expected to defer to their choices. Women\u2019s limited knowledge of the law and the registration process may also reduce their abilities to claim their rights. Half of women farmers are illiterate or have less than a primary school education, compared to 29 per cent of men; 78 per cent of women farmers are engaged in subsistence agriculture. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, with an agricultural labour force that is 53 per cent female, also has a national law stating that men and women are equally entitled to hold property; any property purchased during marriage is regarded as jointly owned. Land owned by a woman prior to her marriage remains hers, as does any land she inherits from her parents. To help the law take hold, the Department of Lands has collabourated with the Lao Women\u2019s Union, which has worked at the grass-roots level on mass campaigns to teach people about women\u2019s land rights, helping to bring about a sharp increase in the number of land titles registered in women\u2019s names or jointly with their husbands.

ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 70 is paid to implementing progressive laws. A 1995 survey of property inheritance in Bangladesh revealed that only 25 per cent of widows had received their rightful share from parents and only 32 per cent from their husbands.183 One way of recognizing the gender pat- terns in land ownership is through joint land titling. Typically shared by male and female household members, it can expand women\u2019s household bargaining power and provide greater protection from dispossession through abandonment, divorce or death of a spouse. It can be particularly critical in natural dis- asters, when states issue land as compensa- tion to help people recover. Joint titling is not a panacea, however, as social conventions may continue to assign land-use choices to men. Review asset-related policies for gender dimensions. Most policies do not yet recognize the different constraints, opportunities and needs of women and men. Very little data is available to guide more informed and effective efforts to tap the proven economic potentials of women as part of a balanced and sus- tainable approach to human development. Some countries have started making policy choices to increase women\u2019s home and land ownership. In India, to encourage the registration of property in the names of women, states have introduced policies that lower property tax rates for women. The Indira Awas Yojana programme gives prio- rity to widows and unmarried women in constructing houses for poor people in rural areas.184 The National Housing Policy in Bangladesh also favours extra support for widows, single women and women who head households living below the poverty line. Nevertheless, a gap exists between promises and what really happens in these pro- grammes.185 Greater efforts and commit- ment by governments and more vigilant civil society and media can reduce discrepancies. Granting women assets to correct past exclusion can be an important initial step. Beyond that, policies might aim to help women grow as economic agents by building on existing assets or acquiring new ones, given their record of success in managing small loans and businesses. More attention could be paid to the ways that different cate- gories of assets might interact to create new opportunities\u2014having a home for many Asia-Pacific women means also having a place to do business, for example. Even marginal assets, such as a flock of poultry or a patch of forest, can be considered entry points, parti- cularly since they may be the only assets that poorer women have. Economic power, especially acquisition and control over resources, helps reduce the potential for gender-based violence. But tran- sition periods can result in increased male backlash and gender-based violence, where formerly assetless women start to acquire economic power or where public decision- making has traditionally been in the realm of men. These are complexities difficult to mea- sure, as attitudes towards gender and stereo- typing of gender roles operate as subtle and explicit barriers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eeb15930-3de9-46fd-9eb7-ad2f2ab83267": {"__data__": {"id_": "eeb15930-3de9-46fd-9eb7-ad2f2ab83267", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "341c662d3a064915603f65b6d0bfba9895cd82897fca0f884ae25a5c3e09ae2d"}, "2": {"node_id": "4186e3c0-6a22-4191-a93e-be2ff80c9420", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "17f20682ef8bae22407496007ef36e916e8b34f683de5fe48608424488b950d8"}}, "hash": "a42938804f17d542ed6ceaccd53a960ab8bc8b8e11e94aedf25837fe9815b17c", "text": "The interconnectedness of the factors that contribute to disadvantages based on gender require that solutions recog- nize and leverage the synergies.

Training and skills development can encompass skills to acquire and manage assets, basic literacy and numeracy, as well as steps to build confidence, and a sense of ability and independence. Providing assets without these skills is not always enough to counter social norms. Studies on microfinance programmes for women across South Asia indicate that women were passing on all or most of their loans to male family members under circumstances that gave them little say over the use of this capital.187 Ensure women\u2019s meaningful participation in forums that make decisions about assets. Many forums that make decisions about assets exist, both within public institutions and the private sector. While women\u2019s parti- cipation alone will not guarantee gender- responsive decisions, they should be able to participate as equal citizens, and they may offer diverse perspectives that render decision-making more accurate. Particular opportunities may come in the context of decentralization, where local bodies play a growing role in governance and service pro- vision. If local traditions are strongly patri- archal, women can be shut out of these, requiring a deliberate focus on both inclusion and quality of participation.

Countercyclical policies may reduce the possibility of job and income losses during recessions and can be critical in the absence of social protection schemes. Raising the mini- mum wage level and progressive tax policies are among the options to reduce income disparities and support decent work.188 Job creation should be viewed in terms of both quality and quantity and understood as a process that always has gender dimensions. These may correct or deepen inequalities; without a deliberate policy focus, the latter is more likely. Experiences in the region show what happens when a \u2018race to the bottom\u2019 produces more jobs, but under conditions that are not conducive to either gender equality or human development. Put a legal framework in place for fair employment. The labour market in much of Asia-Pacific is not operating on a level playing field. Basic laws should be adopted and upheld to restrict gender discrimination in hiring, promotion and pay, and to penalize sexual harassment in the workplace. Support women\u2019s work through targeted services and benefits. Safe transportation from home to work, accessible childcare and adequate health care improve women\u2019s job prospects. Maternity and paternity benefits acknowledge the importance of reproductive care work and the roles that both men and women have in it. Extend formal-sector benefits to informal work. Women in the informal sector have few fallback positions; a job loss, cut in income or health crisis can be a devastating blow. The struggle for basic survival also prevents many informal workers from developing the capabi- lities they need for better employment. Provi- ding health care, maternity/paternity leave, minimum wage guarantees and unemploy- ment insurance to them would ensure a strong social safety net and might encourage move- ment into better jobs over a long term. Extend options to acquire job skills and link education to employment. Opportunities to Job creation should be viewed in terms of both quality and quantity and under- stood as a process that always has gender dimensions ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 72 acquire job skills should be extended to informal-sector workers and women currently outside the labour market.

Strong links between education and employment should be considered in light of the fact that too many educated women in Asia-Pacific are not able to obtain jobs that match their skills. This deprives women of opportunities and is an inefficient use of resources\u2014it is, in effect, a damper on the acquisition of capabilities. It may hinder national or sub-national objectives in achiev- ing a workforce profile consistent with sustained future development. Social conven- tions around women\u2019s employment should be addressed in schools, where they often take root, and in workplaces, where they flourish through skewed hiring and promotion patterns. Give visibility to unpaid domestic work. This is a first step towards a fair and just distribution of household and reproductive care work between men and women. Time- use surveys can collect data for use by national statistical systems. They can clarify tradeoffs being made in individual households and the larger economy and contribute towards mapping policies to balance paid and unpaid work. Tradeoffs must be looked at through the lens of women\u2019s freedom to make choices, given the constraints that may be imposed by limited bargaining power in homes, political forums and the market. Share domestic work. A more equal distribution of unpaid work at home would earn women leisure and provide them with opportunities to undertake paid work. It would promote balance and emotional health among both women and men. While mater- nity leave and benefits are important to keep women in the labour force, provision of paternity leave is crucial to recognize and support men\u2019s role in childcare. Parental leave can be critical for single-headed households, more so in low-income situations. Sustained media campaigns could foster changing atti- tudes about sharing care and other unpaid domestic work, including by emphasizing the benefits. Advocate the value of women\u2019s economic role. Public institutions, the media and civil society organizations could highlight the contribu- tions working women make to economies and individual households. Advocacy messages could emphasize that these contributions should be taken seriously and encouraged. Deepen the Benefits of Education Extend access to education. Improving educa- tional opportunities for girls needs focused policy attention through prioritizing public expenditure on education. Steps to increase access continue to be needed, especially in South Asia. Higher education should be encouraged in cases where girls start out relatively well but disappear as education progresses. Issues related to the cost of educa- tion, physical access and transportation, safety, teacher shortages and attitudes of teachers continue to exist despite improve- ments. Interventions could be identified in consultation with communities, which can help identify priority needs and constraints. Awards and parental incentives for outstand- ing girl students and gender-responsive teachers, both male and female, could be considered. Teacher training should be made an essential part of this. Improve the content and quality of education. High-quality education overcomes gender stereotypes, with positive benefits for parents and children. It makes a contribution to thriving societies and economies, including by opening new employment options for women. Government at national and local levels needs to take the lead in strengthening the content and quality of education, High-quality education overcomes gender stereotypes, with positive benefits for parents and children CHAPTER 2: BUILDING ECONOMIC POWER 73 including curriculum reform making it more gender-equal. Civil society organizations can play a role in advocating for high-quality education, revealing gaps, and holding local and national governments and international organizations to their commitments. Look beyond primary education. Although essential, the completion of five to six years of schooling is far from sufficient for good literacy skills. The economic and social benefits of education may be unattainable with such limited schooling. The increase in the numbers of women in tertiary education across the region is a positive sign. Yet more remains to be done. Labour market policies could be instrumental in providing incentives for women\u2019s higher education if it is per- ceived as instrumental for better economic opportunities. Governments could ensure that higher education policies also receive due attention. Create incentives for educating girls. Policies, resources and sustained action are visible signs that girls\u2019 education has a tangible value. Female stipend programmes in Bangladesh have laid special emphasis on raising female literacy at the secondary levels since 1994. Initially started in targeted areas, the programme has expanded to most parts of the country. It covers monthly tuition fees, stipends, book subsidies and exami- nation fees for female students. There are provisions for discouraging early marriage.189 Since the health and nutritional status of girls is important for developing cognitive abilities and remaining in school beyond the primary level,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e645dc72-ad9f-4d0c-8a1c-437188bde72a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e645dc72-ad9f-4d0c-8a1c-437188bde72a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "291d563ec7336765675709f4c16df17be04858d4b10bafdf4cb1b9545aa2893c"}}, "hash": "291d563ec7336765675709f4c16df17be04858d4b10bafdf4cb1b9545aa2893c", "text": "food supplements in school and health camps for students represent other important incentives to encourage the poor to send their children, especially girl children, to school.190 Incen- tives are especially important for girls from poor families, for whom the direct and indirect costs of schooling can be minimized to enable them to study beyond primary education. Assess results. The ability to measure learning outcomes can be improved, going beyond the number of students in seats. National outcome measures are an important indicator, but results should also be disaggre- gated by region, gender, ethnic group and socio-economic status to locate specific areas of weaknesses and address them. Invest in Women\u2019s Health Prioritize public investments in health. Ill health is directly related to workdays lost, absenteeism and loss of earnings, apart from being a financial drain through treatment costs. Greater public allocations for health care should include increased public expen- diture on sexual and reproductive health, in line with women\u2019s needs. Special schemes, such as direct nutrition supplements and immunization for pregnant and nursing women and children under 36 months, would help improve gender equality in health among the poor. Provision of essential health services should be encouraged through female-friendly health facilities. Men and women should be counseled about the importance of supporting and seeking health care. Universal social health insurance would represent another positive step. Value the girl child\u2019s birth. Strict actions against sex-selective abortions are required to balance the sex ratio at birth in many countries in the region, specifically those with alarmingly high male-over-female ratios at birth, such as China and India.191 Even if laws exist against such abortions, their effective implementation remains a challenge. Health professionals, media and civil society have to act as watchdogs and influencers of attitudes. Often preference for sons comes from within the family, making awareness programmes critical for attitudinal changes. Affirmative actions linked with incentives for girl children can also help improve the balance between male and female children at birth. Labour market policies could be instrumental in providing incentives for women\u2019s higher education if perceived as instrumental for better economic opportunities ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 74 Invest in girls\u2019 health. Intra-household biases against females in health expenditure, care and food lead to higher malnutrition and health risks for women and girls. Attitudinal changes that recognize females as equally valuable members of the household, including in terms of their economic contributions, are essential. Monitoring by governments in areas such as the incidence of domestic violence, malnutrition among boys and girls, and the participation of women in reproductive health decisions would help strengthen corrective actions towards female health. Private-sector health services could also be made more accountable. To challenge dominant norms on masculinity that harm the health of women and men alike, NGOs could campaign for new attitudes among men and boys in households and communities, as well as among community and religious leaders. Protect women against vulnerabilities to HIV/AIDS. Increasing number of women are HIV/AIDS positive in Asia-Pacific, and their vulnerability mainly stems from the severe gender inequality prevalent in the region. Governments and donors must pay more attention to the health needs of HIV- vulnerable women as well as men, and policies and laws should be aimed at protecting them. There should be no discrimination of job opportunities on the grounds of HIV/AIDS. Equal inheritance and property rights can critically improve women\u2019s ability to help prevent and cope with the impact of HIV/ AIDS192 especially when coupled with appropriate social security schemes. Integrate gender and health with economic interventions targeted at women and sexual/ gender minorities. Health insurance, gender and health awareness, and awareness of health entitlements can be added to economic programmes targeted at women, as attempted by BRAC in South Asia. Great potential for doing this exists, given the scale of women\u2019s microfinance groups in the region. Make Mobility Safe Acknowlege the contributions women make and the threats they face. Women migrants have been overlooked in much official discourse, in both sending and receiving countries. State institutions should have a role in determining the patterns and outcomes of international female migration, keeping in mind the benefits for women, economies and societies when this is a safe process that allows women opportunities to fully use existing and potential capabilities. Ease the legal barriers constraining women\u2019s migration. Sex-specific bans and discriminatory restrictions on the basis of women\u2019s age, marital status, pregnancy or maternity status still exist in some countries and should be repealed, along with require- ments for permission to travel from a spouse or male guardian. Many laws and policies implicitly assume a male-breadwinner model of migration and overlook", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e92b4dbf-9258-40d8-889a-3f7cdb1c913a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e92b4dbf-9258-40d8-889a-3f7cdb1c913a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "67063046e51f36b5a64a535e25e50d306322dd0eacce924329601692f47dd1de"}}, "hash": "67063046e51f36b5a64a535e25e50d306322dd0eacce924329601692f47dd1de", "text": "independent access and protection for women. Some laws that seem designed to protect women \u2013 such as those mandating official emigration clearance for unskilled workers \u2013 can create another hindrance and encourage migration through informal and unsafe channels that can put them at even greater risk of exploitation and vulnerability. They need to be adjusted based on women\u2019s articulation of their own needs. Protect the basic rights of all migrants. Within countries, many citizenship rights are residence-based, requiring some paper proof of local residence. This affects not only political rights, such as the ability to vote, but also socio-economic rights, such as labour laws and unionization. Short-term and seasonal internal migrants end up losing these rights, as do cross-border migrants. These problems are particularly acute for women migrants, who require greater support in terms of nutrition and reproductive health services. States should also ensure that laws and labour codes provide the same rights to Equal inheritance and property rights can critically improve women\u2019s ability to help prevent and cope with the impact of HIV/AIDS especially when coupled with appropriate social security schemes CHAPTER 2: BUILDING ECONOMIC POWER 75 women migrant workers as to all other workers, including the right to organize to defend and further their professional inte- rests and collective bargaining.193 The legal validity of contracts for women migrants should be assured. Special attention should be granted to occupations where shortfalls in rights are particularly prominent, including domestic labour and sex work. Laws should not create barriers for migrants to accessing health and HIV related services. Discri- minatory and stigmatizing systems, policies and practices that violate migrants\u2019 rights, such as mandatory HIV testing as a pre- condition for employment and deportation on the basis of HIV status, should be eliminated. Strengthening the rights and conditions under which women move is essential to their health and wellbeing and critical for job opportunities. Foster cross-border cooperation. Bilateral agreements between governments of sending and receiving countries should recognize the rights of female migrants and create legal frameworks to protect them. These should focus on safety. The Royal Thai Government and the Government of Lao People\u2019s Demo- cratic Republic, for example, have a memo- randum of understanding on employment cooperation that sets the legal framework for procedures in labour recruitment and employ- ment between the two countries as well as steps to prevent illegal migration and illegal recruitment/employment networks.194 Broaden options for information and support. Both governmental and non- governmental channels can provide free or affordable gender and rights-based pre- departure and returning information and training programmes. These can increase awareness of legal rights and entitlements, job opportunities, the nature of contracts, problems that may arise in the journey or the destination, health related issues including HIV awareness, possibilities for protection at each stage of the migration process and agencies that provide help. Commercial recruitment agencies should be regulated in terms of their performance in meeting women\u2019s needs and protecting their rights. However, they should not be the only source of information and services related to migration; government agencies and NGOs should also play leading roles. Make remittances easier and safer for women migrants. Women migrants tend to use informal channels for remittances because of inadequate knowledge or lack of public access. Special measures should be taken to provide assistance to women in accessing formal financial institutions and safe money transfer options, at reasonable costs. Women should be encouraged to participate in saving schemes as well as safe and productive investment opportunities. Make policies, laws and services sensitive to the needs of trafficked women and ensure that their application does not re-victimise them. The complexities of trafficking and the economic forces driving women to migrate need to be borne in mind when designing policies, laws and services to respond. In particular, women should be treated as people with needs, difficulties and aspirations, not as helpless objects. Moralistic judgments and patriarchal attitudes have often crept into trafficking interventions. These should not be imposed upon women, their activities or their future movement. Improve the legal, social and economic conditions for returning women migrants. Women who wish to return to their countries or places of origin should be able to do so without threat of coercion, abuse or social sanction. Special socio-economic, psycholo- gical and legal services can ease women\u2019s reintegration. Public advocacy can seek to diminish stereotypes about women\u2019s \u2018morality\u2019 in venturing to new places, and encourage people to value women\u2019s attempts to seek opportunities to better their lives.

For internal migrants, local governments should strengthen urban management policies and programmes to respond to their specific needs for adequate settlement, both temporary and long-term, and provide access to urban infrastructure and social services such as health and education. Rights as citizens should be recognized, including through the provision of equal access to services and the easing of restrictive and exclusionary residence policies. Development for All Asia-Pacific is a fast growing and dynamic region, but women are not benefiting propor- tionately. Gaps in women\u2019s capabilities and economic opportunities, and thus their well- being, have been deep and persistent in much of Asia and the Pacific. Growing capabilities are not translating into equivalent opportu- nities. Attitudes about who should control resources have continued to relegate women to unpaid work, poor-quality jobs and inferior assets\u2014when they can even obtain them. But if they do have assets and jobs, they may still have little control over them, whether in deciding how to use land or voicing concerns about labour conditions through collective bargaining. Women and girls face a number of barriers to economic power\u2014visible and less visible\u2014due to continuing barriers to market access. These are synergistically intercon- nected with gaps in political voice and legal rights, as also with the subtler barriers in attitudes towards women. The latter operate at sites closest to women and girls\u2014the family and community. Attitudes also influence how institutions function. Primary responsibility for unpaid care work, unfair labour regula- tions, restrictions on labour mobility, corrup- tion that affects women much more than men, and gaps in education and access to justice all result in denying women equal economic opportunities. This exclusionary tendency coexists with visible and growing proof of the significance of women\u2019s economic contributions. Attitudes are slowly changing, in part because rising levels of education and economic liberalization are transforming perceptions about what women can do. Across the region, the dynamo of women\u2019s labour has allowed industries to grow and compete in the global marketplace. It is fueling the growth of the small- business sector even as it is maintaining agricultural productivity. Recognizing these contributions means policy makers can begin to systematically build on them. It is also important to leverage synergies between the interconnected factors that contribute to disadvantages based on gender. Fair development provides room for all human potentials to emerge, regardless of sex or gender. Despite disparities in the region, mounting evidence suggests the time to engender development has come. Attitudes about who should control resources have continued to relegate women to unpaid work, poor-quality jobs and inferior assets CHAPTER 2: BUILDING ECONOMIC POWER 77 ACTIONS AT A GLANCE BUILDING ECONOMIC POWER: TOWARDS A BETTER BALANCE Inequality in economic power between men and women in Asia and the Pacific thrives on discriminatory inheritance laws, inequalities in job opportunities, unequal pay, gender stereotypes in education, severely inadequate investments in health and a lack of policies for safe migration. Attitudes about women\u2019s roles perpetuate the gaps. A framework for action includes fixing institutions, changing attitudes and undertaking assessments. It should build on synergistic links with political voice and legal rights, and root priorities in local circumstances. Important components include steps to: Remove barriers to assets.

CHAPTER 3: PROMOTING POLITICAL VOICE 81 Gender equality in political participation is socially just and basic to the notion of democracy. A political system\u2014elected offices, but also other positions that influence public decisions\u2014where half the population cannot participate, defies the meaning of the term. Broad-based participation also has a clear practical dimension\u2014and a develop- ment rationale. It supports efficiency: More sources of information and voice make public policies more informed and responsive to diverse realities on the ground. That women are seriously underrepresented in elected offices is now in focus. Assessment of women\u2019s low share in other executive posi- tions of government has received much less attention, even though that is where political agendas are operationalized. Women, as a group, have different experiences than men. While some men may support women\u2019s issues in the halls of power, a more typical pattern is that without women expressing their own perspectives, these mostly go unnoticed. This hinders develop- ment through the failure to build on all available capabilities and pursue all potential opportunities. Social stability and harmony are further benefits when most people feel they have a voice and a stake in development. In Asia and the Pacific, women have demonstrated the political contributions they can make. They have been vibrant voices in formal political institutions such as legislatures and local governments, and in civil society activism. They have led countries, political parties and ministries. They have been part of the impetus behind political crisis and conflict, as well as processes to forge peace and social transformation. Women scholars have conducted cutting-edge research into critical public policy questions; this is changing the way politicians and governments approach basic tasks such as budgeting. Progress has been slow even since the commitments to take deliberate actions to increase women\u2019s participation were made by most governments at the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing. At that time global parliamentary representation hovered around 11 per cent; it had increased to just over 18 per cent in 2009.2 Despite women\u2019s desire and proven abilities to fully participate in political forums, and despite rapid gains in basic human development parameters across Asia- Pacific, the region is behind most of the rest of the world in women\u2019s political equality Promoting Political Voice \u2018We must ask whether the majority of women citizens of Indonesia are truly regarded as citizens or stakeholders in this nation\u2026. Democracy without the involvement of women is not democracy.\u20191 \u2013 Professor Chusnul Mar\u2019iyah, University of Indonesia and member of the Indonesian Election Commission Political decision-making touches all areas of human development and many aspects of people\u2019s daily lives. Access to the political arena is essential for men and women to articulate and shape solutions that unleash progress for themselves and society at large. Gender equality in political participation is socially just and basic to the notion of democracy Chapter3 ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 82 (Figure 3.1). When both houses are consi- dered, Asia-Pacific has the lowest percentages of women in national legislatures of any region outside the Arab states.3 Compared to the global average of 18.4 per cent, women in Asia occupy 18.2 per cent of legislative seats and in the Pacific only 15.2 per cent.

Existing levels of development do not correspond closely with women\u2019s political equality. Some of the most developed countries lag far behind\u2014women in the Republic of Korea have attained less than 14 per cent of legislative seats, and women in Japan occupy less than 10 per cent of seats in their lower house.6 This is not to suggest that having fewer women in politics is somehow good for development. Globally, the most developed countries rank the highest in women\u2019s political participation, although only the Nordic states can claim to be close to roughly equal numbers of women and men.7 A few Asia-Pacific countries serve as models for what is possible within the region, even with the severe disruptions of conflict and the drain of high levels of poverty. In part because of women activists, Nepal ended up with women in about 33 per cent of its Constituent Assembly seats. In Timor-Leste, women activists and freedom fighters put pressure on the constitutional drafting process after independence to guarantee women\u2019s political participation, which helped women capture 29.2 per cent of parliamen- tary seats. In its 2009 elections, Afghanistan had 342 female candidates at the provincial level and two women running for President.8 Its quota system guarantees women at least 27 per cent of seats in its lower house of the national legislature.9 In the evolution and maturing of its political systems, and in its pursuit of human development, the Asia-Pacific region has come a long way in recent decades.

These are expressed in different ways in the private and public spheres. Husbands and families convey the message that women cannot be leaders and should stay home. Political parties avoid female candidates because they may come with fewer campaign resources and links to influential constituencies. Political ideologies also define openness to women; some emphasize that individuals need to carve out their own opportunities, others that people who start behind deserve extra support. In some cases, religion is used to justify gender-based restrictions. Gender Norms Limit Participation Technically, laws and institutions guide the mechanics of governance and political participation. These may seem gender- neutral, such as when anyone older than 21, man or woman, can legally run for office or seek other executive positions. In reality, they intersect with ideas about the gender roles of women and men that influence their ability to take part in politics. Leadership, for example, is still considered a mostly male skill and prerogative across Asia-Pacific. And because of patterns of gender discrimination, women have less access to education, health care, wealth, mobility and other forms of social capital that allow people to stake a claim in the wider world.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e87124a-3763-40a9-9c50-b55f3c817db9": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e87124a-3763-40a9-9c50-b55f3c817db9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3f922f7c7bd9d656953e7f3a3e8c2f99e9d18133e115b614679cbd7ac4f44de2"}, "2": {"node_id": "06b89f56-4dbe-40fd-ae6a-7ce8fe56baad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d1119552db12bbaad2436fb3cd5eabee311f3980099fe0902c12b3c75c7db98b"}}, "hash": "56fe84d1dd652f026c2bfa226759aa9183d95792eb2e5d831534662560e7f63c", "text": "People of diverse gender identities have also struggled; although, like women, they are starting to achieve gains in the region (Box 3.1).

In the April 2008 elections, founder Sunil Pant gained a parliamentary seat under the Communist Party. Two developments have fostered the movement for greater rights in Nepal. The first was the significant change in the attitudes of the Maoists towards sexual and gender minorities, such that all three parties vying for elections included lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights in their election manifestos. But the real breakthrough came when Nepal\u2019s Supreme Court declared that sexual minorities are \u2018natural persons\u2019 deserving protection against discrimination. The Blue Diamond Society and three other groups had previously brought a lawsuit before the court, challenging a law against \u2018unnatural\u2019 sex, and demanding equal rights and an end to discrimination for LGBT people. Since the ruling, LGBTs in Nepal have found recognition in many ways. Several organizations, including a private bank, the Education Ministry and the Home Ministry, have added a box for the \u2018third gender\u2019 in their forms. The Home Ministry is also working on a policy that will soon be circulated in the districts to give citizenship identity papers to third genders all over Nepal. Pant maintains that much remains to be done. He estimates that it will take at least five more years to have effective policies, laws and a Constitution that respects the rights of LGBTs in Nepal, and another 20 years to change the real situation on the ground. But, as is the case with women, the opportunities of participation in governance structures are already apparent. Sources: Ireland 2008; Larssen 2008; Torres 2009.

Indigenous Fijian women, for example, are still regarded as the property of their fathers, then husbands.12 Men continue to construct themselves as fighters and warriors,13 while women maintain the home and bear many children. Pre-colonial traditions were re-shaped by Christianity, where \u2018[Christian] churches tend to keep women \u201cin their place\u201d\u2019.14 Women today are the mainstay of the extremely powerful Methodist church in Fiji, for example, but never its local or national leaders. In Timor-Leste, despite remarkable progress in bringing more women into the national legislature, longstanding conventions about leadership still rule at the local level, where men make the major decisions for their communities. Superstitions about avoiding the wrath of the ancestors by having the \u2018right\u2019 leader (i.e. a man) mean that women generally cannot become traditional leaders, even if they are from otherwise matrilineal clans. Some serve in village councils, but never in senior positions. At meetings, they sit on the sidelines or behind male leaders, and are more likely to be found serving food than participating in discussions.15 Indonesia provides an example of how gender norms can be married to political motivations. As part of the project of nation building, Suharto\u2019s New Order policies16 sought to homogenize the diversity of indigenous gender roles throughout the archipelago into nationally promoted, ideal male and female roles, in which women were supposed to be traditional and subordinate to men.17 The regime enshrined the patriarchal ideology of Bapakism\u2014literally, rule by the father. When Megawati Sukarnoputri, the country\u2019s first female President (2001-2004), was nominated for Vice-President in 1999, a major objection was that a woman could not, by definition, lead.18 Conservative gender norms can clash directly with political conventions.

Being poor and marginalized means not only having more limited resources to run for office, but also being treated as less deserving of a political voice. Due to a reservation system, a record number of women now serve as elected representatives in India\u2019s panchayat (local government) system, for example. But members are not paid, leaving the system open to corruption and domination by upper-class people who can afford to work for free. This can undercut the ability of poorer women to act effectively for their community or women at large.21 One indication of how women in Asia- Pacific are viewed in terms of political leadership comes from the distribution of political appointments to ministerial positions. The region echoes a global pattern in which women are slotted into \u2018feminine\u2019 health and family portfolios rather than \u2018masculine\u2019 finance and defence briefs. But it also has some of the lowest percentages of women ministers across all portfolios.

Women hold about 13 per cent of social and cultural posts, about half the number in the next- lowest region, Africa.22 Women are also poorly represented in other critical decision-making positions that are central to translating laws and policies into practice. Some progress has been made, but no country in Asia and the Pacific has achieved parity between women and men in positions such as ambassadors, judges and heads of universities;23 most are far behind. The Philippines has appointed women to 31 per cent of ambassadorial posts, but Nepal has no women ambassadors, for example. In Mongolia, the percentage of women judges has topped 41 per cent; Pakistan so far has only reached 2.8 per cent. University leadership reflects similar shortfalls. Men Set the Political Terms In politics, men set the norms and women are expected to live up to them. At times, norms are framed as standards of competence. Former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos once stated, \u2018The Filipino woman should be intelligent but demure. She can run her husband, but she should run him through the bedroom\u2019.24 Ideas such as this are unjust, and shut out the rich possibilities for public service that come from diverse experiences and ways of reasoning. Also overlooked is the question of whether or not current norms are desirable. Across Asia and the Pacific, politi- cal practices in systems dominated by men continue to emphasize competition over cooperation, violence over negotiation, and depersonalization over empathy.25 Some systems are notable for corruption, perso- nality politics, clientelism, and a preference for short-term profits over long term social investments. Current male norms in politics may not even be typical of most men or good for societies as a whole, but once they become entrenched, they benefit men who endorse them and have an interest in maintaining them. They also undercut the willingness of women or men from excluded groups to enter politics, as well as their effectiveness once they get there. Discrimination crops up in many places: The structure of politi- cal parties, access to campaign financing, parliamentary responses, and old-boy poli- tical networks. In many Asia-Pacific countries, the path to politics still lies through the male-dominated military or the legal profession.26 Across Asia-Pacific, even educated women who have functioned well in other spheres of life can have the perception that politics is a dirty, difficult game that contributes little and extracts a personal cost, particularly for those who do not enter it with substantive resources and connections. Many women who have been successful in politics in the region are well-to-do, or shielded by family ties and dynastic politics. At the opposite extreme, women politicians\u2014 particularly those with the extra vulnera- bilities of poverty or association with margi- nalized groups\u2014have been killed, raped or faced physical threats for challenging the status quo.

If they fail to be as vocal and expres- sive as men while in chambers, they can be unfairly rated as \u2018weak\u2019 and ineffectual leaders.29 One study of the New Zealand Parliament found that women made fewer personal attacks during debates than male colleagues, and were more often the subject of harassing remarks. But they also became more aggressive over time in an effort to adapt.30 While some female political leaders have been depicted as strong and authoritative, inordinate attention can still go towards their maternal and familial roles. Past news reports on former President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines and former President Chandrika Kumaratunga of Sri Lanka tended to focus on their parental and marital status, despite their contributions as public officials. Because they were both widows of previous politi- cians, there was a preoccupation with the theme of bereavement. Women politicians in general face undue focus on their physical appearances, clothes and hairstyles, while their political accomplishments are down- played.31 In 2008, as Rustriningsih campaigned to become Vice-Governor of Central Java, one of the most important parts of Indonesia, she traveled constantly. This was not in keeping with the conventional role of an Indonesian wife and mother (she is both). The opposition campaign emphasized her absence from home and alleged neglect of family duties. Respect- able Indonesian women, especially married women, do not work in situations where they must be out at night or working irregular hours in teams of men\u2014which are typical of the working life of female politicians and lawmakers. Rustriningsih successfully fought these stereotypes and won the elections, demonstrating to other women that a viable political career is possible for them too.32 Male-dominated political systems have been slow to recognize that women have extra responsibilities for household work and care of children. These do not fit easily with the demands of public service, in the absence of work-sharing at home. But rarely have even rudimentary forms of support been offered, such as childcare facilities in parliamentary or party offices. Laws and Customs Hinder Women\u2019s Presence \u2018It is good to swim in the waters of tradition but to sink in them is suicide.\u201933 \u2013 Mahatma Gandhi In a general way, legal systems in Asia and the Pacific support women\u2019s political participation. A number of Asia-Pacific BOX 3.2 WOMEN FACE THREATS TO LIFE AND LIBERTY Women panchayat members in India have faced some huge obstacles to participation\u2014some of which have resulted in tragedy. Forty-eight-year- old Dhoolla Ratnam was burnt to death along with her grandson in the village of Srungavruksham in Andhra Pradesh in 2007. She had dared contest the elections against the upper caste Kapu community, whose members distributed saris, and gold and silver idols to the villagers in order to win their votes. One of Dhoolla\u2019s first assignments, after winning, was to fight corruption by making sure that the fair price dealer in her village did not divert grain rations meant for the poor to the open market. The Kapus retaliated by burning her paddy fields. When this threat failed to deter her, she was killed. R. Sandhu, the Additional Secretary, Ministry of Panchayati Raj, says: \u2018Initially, many of these women receive support from their family members. But once they get deeply involved in panchayat-related work and executing projects, their family members complain that they are spending too much time away from home.\u2019 Illiteracy remains another major problem.

The Consti- tution (1954) states \u2018Women in the People\u2019s Republic of China enjoy equal rights with men in all spheres of life, in political, economic, cultural, social and family life\u2019. In 1995, this basic principle gained greater awareness, and was integrated with \u2018gender\u2019 as a concept. Promoting gender equality began to be seen as an essential factor to achieve social development and penetrates all facets of economic and social life. There are three main aspects of the Chinese Government\u2019s experience on promoting gender equality: 1. At the national institutional level, a comprehensive public system has come into being to protect the rights and interests of women and promote equality between men and women. Based on the Constitution, the system takes the Law on the Protection of Women\u2019s Rights and Interests as its main body, and also encompasses various specific state laws and regulations, local regula- tions and administrative regulations enacted by various Government departments. In order to ensure women\u2019s rights and their social participation, a range of policies and measures have been improved in areas of law, politics, economy, employment, education, resources allocation, right protection, marriage, family and health, striving for eliminating all forms of discrimi- nation against women. 2. At the civil and social level, three types of non-governmental organiza- tions are very active in the field of gender equality. First, the interna- tional organizations (such as United Nations agencies, the Ford Founda- tion, etc.) have entered the field of women and social development in China. In cooperation with the Government and civil societies, the international organizations initiate projects and carry out ongoing cooperation to promote gender equality. Second, Women\u2019s Federa- tions at various levels, Population and Family Planning Associations, Chinese Communist Youth League and other social groups serve as a link bridge between the government and public. Third, a variety of non- governmental organizations with different focuses (such as focus on research, service, recreation and other comprehensive interests) are developing rapidly and are playing an important role in social manage- ment and services provision. 3. Strategic and special actions have also been taken. In order to better target the goal of improving girls\u2019 living environment and promoting gender equality, specific actions have been taken to punish the behavior jeopardizing women\u2019s rights and interests. At the public policy level, the central and local Governments have issued a series of specialized public policies since 1986. Those policies strictly prohibit the abuse of the artificial insemination tech- nology, sex identification of foetus for non-medical purpose and termination of pregnancies for sex selection. The drugs of pregnancy termination and of accelerating ovulation are listed as prescription drugs. The Government also resolu- tely penalizes criminal acts such as drowning, discarding and abusing baby girls and trafficking in women and children. Other illegal acts also include discrimination against and abuse to women giving birth to female babies. Those efforts are made to protect women\u2019s right to life and survival. As regards to specific action, the \u2018Care for Girls\u2019 initiative since 2003 has been tackling the issue of imbalanced sex ratio at birth. It is a special national action taken by the Government that includes cash incentives and cam- paigns in the countryside to address the challenges for girls\u2019 survival. Its mission is to take the all-round human development as the core. Its goal is to ensure women and girls\u2019 rights to survival, to development, to protection by law, and to partici- pation, and other basic rights and interests. Through the establishment of behavioral constraints mechanism, interest-oriented mechanism and institutional innovation mechanism, we improve girls\u2019 living environ- ment, promote the social gender equality, build a harmonious society and provide a favorable population environment for the coordinated and sustainable development of China\u2019s society and economy. The laws, policies and actions mentioned above have played an active role in improving women\u2019s living and develop- ment environment as well as promoting gender equality in Chinese society.

Every woman in the region can now vote, except for those in Brunei Darussalam, where men cannot vote either.34 In 2008, Maldives finally amended a constitutional provision that used to ban women from serving as President and Vice-President.35 But for the most part, these legal promises have not been enough to counter strong gender biases in society and political systems. Most constitutions are vague in defining what sex discrimination and gender equality mean; some bar the passage of legislation that would allow quota systems. Quotas for underrepresented groups are not necessarily backed by sanctions and capacity development, meaning they can easily go ignored. Women continue to face disadvan- tages from the lack of laws or regulations constraining campaign financing, to which they have less access than men, and the impunity for violence and corruption that characterizes elections in some countries. The Pacific countries and territories face particular conflicts between customary practices protected under the law and calls for women\u2019s equal participation. In Fiji, Republic of Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands and Tonga, women do not have equal access to the customary title, chiefly or noble systems, all entry points for eligibility for political representation.36 The Bill of Rights in the Samoan Constitution specifically prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex37 and allows for affirmative action, but people who are not members of the traditional matai (chiefs) system cannot stand as candidates for the legislature. Because women only hold one out of every 19 chiefly titles,38 only about eight per cent of parliamentarians are female.39 Another challenge comes from the deeply rooted concept of fa\u2019aaloalo (respect), which can encourage women to pass titles to male siblings or family members. Real Participation Means an Equal Say While sincere efforts to improve women\u2019s political participation have occurred in Asia and the Pacific, there have also been activities that suggest tokenism or a superficial endor- sement. In Timor-Leste, a decision was made not to employ a quota system for the 2001 elections, since this was viewed as anti- democratic and culturally incompatible. Instead, incentives were offered to nominate women candidates, such as extra media time. A woman headed the Socialist Party, but after her party won only one seat she was removed and the seat given to the next person on the list, a man. While women did remarkably well in the election, garnering just over 25 per cent of the seats, the second- largest party fielded no women candidates at all.40 In India, the leading Congress Party has put forward more women candidates than the rival Bharatiya Janata Party. Both parties have female leaders and platforms that make commitments to gender equality. But often women are put into constituen- cies where they are less likely to succeed41\u2014 a common practice for parties that want to appear to embrace gender equality without actually having to disrupt the status quo. Some single-party states have relatively high averages of women parliamentarians: 25.8 per cent in Viet Nam, 21.3 per cent in China and 25.2 per cent in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.42 These achievements are important to recognize, but may be tempered by questions about the extent of voice and quality of participation.

Expanding Women\u2019s Voice In the general transition to greater democracy in Asia-Pacific today, political systems are being buffeted by multiple forces, among them globalization, conflict, rapid economic growth, exposure to new technology and ideas, and the newfound assertiveness of marginalized groups. All these shifts open opportunities for adapting political agendas, including to expand women\u2019s participation.43 Increasing women\u2019s political voice never happens through a single step. It may require a combination of elements such as new laws, voter education campaigns and revised regulation on campaign financing. A handful of common entry points are explored here, mostly applied to the legislative branch since that has received the most consistent atten- tion. They can, as appropriate, be extended to all other aspects of governance.

Equality of opportunities cannot be achieved in the face of tremendous disabilities and obstacles which the social system imposes on all those sections whom traditional India treated as second\u2014or even third-class citizens. Our investigations have proved that the application of the theoretical principle of equality in the context of unequal situations only intensifies inequalities, because equality in such situations merely means privileges for those who have them already and not for those who need them.\u201944 \u2013 From a \u2018Note of Dissent\u2019 published after the 1974 meeting of the Committee on the Status of Women in India Quotas for political participation invite direct attention to the under-representation of particular population groups. They aim to provide a quick fix to counter historical disadvantages, raising numbers in a relatively short time. Experiences globally and within Asia-Pacific suggest that they work best when they are effectively designed and enforced, connected to a meaningful definition of participation, and accompanied by steps to generate political and public support. An estimated 40 per cent of countries globally have adopted quotas for women in national legislatures, achieving an average participation rate of 22 per cent. In those countries without quotas, the average drops to 14 per cent.45 Of the 22 countries where women constitute more than 30 per cent of the national assembly, 18 have some form of quota.46 Quotas at the sub-national level or political party quotas for electoral candidates currently raise the number of countries with quotas to 111.47 Only about a third of Asia-Pacific coun- tries have some kind of gender quota system in place for political participation.48 In countries without quotas, women\u2019s participa- tion rate in elected offices is around 14 per cent, rising to 20.4 per cent in countries that have them.49 Quotas should be considered for elected offices, as well as for the civil service, judiciary and other critical public leadership positions where the gender gap is wide and even growing. The Magna Carta for Women of the Philippines, which was recently signed into law,50 has re-emphasised this. It calls for a 50-50 gender balance in Government posi- tions to be achieved within the next five years. Only about a third of Asia-Pacific countries have some kind of gender quota system in place for political participation ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 90 The Magna Carta also seeks at least 40 per cent women\u2019s representation in both member- ship and leadership positions of political parties, encouraging the integration of women in their internal policy-making structures, appointive and electoral nominating pro- cesses. This 40 per cent also holds for development councils and planning bodies from the regional, provincial, city and muni- cipal levels.51 While the region is far short of a percentage even approximately reflecting the number of women in the population, and while it lags behind most other regions on women\u2019s participation in politics and more broadly in public decision-making, quotas seem to be making some difference. Quotas can be defined in constitutions, electoral laws, party by-laws and in executive recruitments. In South Asia, quotas for women in parliament are a feature of the constitutions of Afghanistan (Box 3.3), Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.52 The Indian Constitution sets aside 33 per cent of seats53 for women in rural panchayats54 and local governments and bodies in urban areas. This provision has brought a record number of women into local politics. The Republic of Korea reformed its Political Party Law of 2000 to include a quota for women. The quota is applied to both its proportional and majority electoral systems for the Lower House. For the party list portion, where 56 deputies are elected to the House of the People, political parties are mandated to present candidate lists with women in 50 per cent of positions. For the majority portion of the election, where 243 representatives are elected in single-member districts, at least 30 per cent of candidates from a party should be women. The law has resulted in the number of women elected rising from 5.9 per cent to 13 per cent in 2004, and then to almost 14 per cent in 2008.55 In the Pacific, where women\u2019s partici- pation in politics is lower than the Asia- Pacific average, the French Territories stand out because they are subject to the French Law on Parity 2000. It requires all political parties to include women as 50 per cent of their candidates.

The reasons for this are linked to social norms around gender, as well as political traditions and ideology. Fundamentally, quotas quantify sudden shifts in political power that stir resistance among those who perceive they will lose out. For this reason, quotas can be viewed as socially disruptive or, more blatantly, as artificially reducing the natural prerogatives BOX 3.3 GENDER QUOTAS DELIVER RESULTS IN AFGHANISTAN The Afghan Constitution of 2004 stipulates a quota for each of the two main chambers of its national Parliament. There is also a quota for women to occupy at least 25 per cent of provincial council seats under Afghan electoral law. The lower house of Parliament, the Wolesi Jirga, consists of 220 to 250 parliamentarians, which is proportional to the population of each of the nation\u2019s 34 provinces. The quota provision states that an average of at least two female candidates from each province should become members of the Wolesi Jirga. This guarantees women at least 27 per cent of parliament seats. In case there are not enough women on the list of candidates in a particular constituency, the seat(s) in question remain vacant until the next election. For the House of Elders, the Meshrano Jirga, a mixed electoral system is used. The President appoints one-third of the members, and the gender quota regulation stipulates that 50 per cent of these should be women. This means women will fill at least 17 per cent of the seats. After the 2005 elections, women occupied 67 out of 242 seats in the Wolesi Jirga, or 27.7 per cent. In the Meshrano Jirga, women held 22 of 102 seats, or 21.6 per cent. Afghanistan currently maintains one of the higher levels of women\u2019s parliamentary participation in Asia-Pacific and the world.

On the surface, they seem to contradict the principles of democracy and equal opportunity for all. They can be read as leading to the election of candidates based on gender, not qualifications, and as preventing the election of more qualified candidates.57 Women themselves have at times rejected quotas because they want to be elected on their individual merits, not as women. In Bangladesh, one of the first countries in the region to adopt a quota system in 1972,58 the small allotment of seats to women soon became seen as the only way women could get into Parliament; all other seats were \u2018reserved\u2019 for men. Other countries have had similar experiences, with quotas being viewed as a maximum, rather than a minimum. Arguments favouring gender quotas include the notion that quotas are not a form of discrimination, but a way of compensating for the steep barriers that keep women out of politics, especially at higher levels. Women have the right to equal representation, and their experiences are needed for a political system to fully respond to the concerns and priorities of its citizens, including on key aspects of human development. Women in some Asia-Pacific countries have contended that when political parties are freely allowed to make gender-biased choices in nominations, this in itself is undemocratic and blocks the full exercise of voters\u2019 rights. Quota design. Laws are an important initial step in determining how successful a quota can be. In general, if constitutional or electoral provisions require parties to field women as a condition for access to seats, they are more likely to do so, particularly when sanctions for non-compliance are enforced. When quotas are too small or purely voluntary, only those with an ideological commitment to gender equality are likely to comply. The numbers bear this out: In Asia-Pacific, the average number of women elected under constitutional quotas for parliaments is 23.4 per cent and 21.1 per cent under electoral regulations.59 Tokenism in political party quotas has produced just under 14 per cent, meaning women have about the same chance of being elected with or without them.60 To be successful, quotas should be designed according to the requirements of the system and a substantive notion of women\u2019s participation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74e3c6c3-fb0a-4076-8730-46e1ad6baf47": {"__data__": {"id_": "74e3c6c3-fb0a-4076-8730-46e1ad6baf47", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3af6bd43059936d153adceeceba06eccb611847ca878fdaaaae977f5065c1958"}, "2": {"node_id": "e5ad46e0-f578-4af8-a7eb-0bc02bed66e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e833a9c7c06efc59a71ea2318af950e49f0d17095ab84abc8e94c349be1a2be9"}}, "hash": "3f7efd331187ce715e99410e698302fbcb4409617b58c3fc84a2b08e404c6edd", "text": "They should reflect political incentives so that parties and candidates\u2014 men and women alike\u2014will reap benefits and be more willing to comply with them (Box 3.4).

A quota for women was first established in 1981 at 25 per cent for internal jobs. It has since expanded to all positions and risen to 40 per cent. Now the party, which embraces strong support for gender equality in its platform, has also extended the quotas to men\u2014part of a new wave of quota systems positioned as gender-neutral. Starting in 2012, a 40:40:20 quota will be in place. This means that women are entitled to 40 per cent of positions, men to another 40 per cent, and either men or women to the remaining 20 per cent. It ensures neither men nor women will have more than 60 per cent, while allowing flexibility in choices for party staff and candidates. Source: Clark 2009. Quotas should be designed according to the requirements of the system and a substantive notion of women\u2019s participation ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 92 politically palatable because they imply greater choice in the electoral process, instead of a foregone result. Experiences with party quotas show that unless parties make a deliberate effort to put women candidates in electable positions, however, they end up running for office, but never arriving there. In proportional systems, they may be clustered exclusively at the bottom of the party list, with little chance of securing a seat. In majoritarian systems, they can be sent off to contest unwinnable seats. One debate over quota systems involves whether to make them temporary or perma- nent. Temporary quotas are meant to give people a leg up until they can stand on their own. Once people see that women can be effective politicians, they will start voting for them based on their qualifications or political ideas, so quotas will no longer be necessary. Yet experiences show that this process can take a long time and be fraught with obsta- cles. Bangladesh\u2019s provision for quotas for women in its 1972 Constitution, for example, lapsed in 1987. It was reinstituted in 1990, but lapsed again in 2000. The Parliament elec- ted in 2001 had no reserved seats for women, and the proportion of women legislators who took office that year was a meagre two per cent. By 2008, a quota was again in force, stipulating the reservation of 13 per cent of seats for women. The general election resulted in 18.6 per cent of seats going to women.62 Preventing backlash and non-compliance. Several countries in Asia-Pacific have had protracted debates about adopting quota systems, underscoring the need for measures to build public and political support. These may need to emphasize that quotas are not just about taking power from some groups to give it to others, but about distributing power more evenly among citizens as part of a fairer and more democratic system of governance.63 India has had a long-running, and at times violent, experience with reservations for people from the scheduled castes. Echoes of this experience could be heard around the adoption of local quotas for women politi- cians in 1993,64 with concerns raised about the biwi (wife) brigade about to descend on local governments, bringing few skills and acting mainly as proxies for men. While the record since then has proved significantly more mixed, combining both obvious failures and great successes, India has not moved forward on national quotas. Women obtained 10.9 per cent of lower house seats and 9.5 per cent of upper house seats in the 2009 elections,65 but this is still far below the global average. The Women\u2019s Reservation Bill that sought to provide a 33 per cent reservation for women in both houses of Parliament was defeated twice.66 The national Bill has in fact encountered another form of backlash related to caste and India\u2019s shifting political landscape, where political leaders from traditionally margina- lized groups have begun", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe99f330-1c83-4662-a9ef-e4cf2a57aed7": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe99f330-1c83-4662-a9ef-e4cf2a57aed7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "13004f993c10bded9924e7fd358b24682c67bf147b29c717914d0943a769653d"}, "3": {"node_id": "eb2d842b-8ac4-4246-a2a0-16f4b6497a75", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ed4f4d91fd413a5a7117eb22f5e046e8e3e1f7d216f92e8edf0edfb837e6ffe"}}, "hash": "ac053d792a35f64434b2f1ccf696a2adc950338a8e7db3c1d80e50c3630ee975", "text": "challenging the dominance of elites.

The result, so far, has been a standstill.67 Debates over quotas occur even after they have seemingly been accepted. A revision of Mongolia\u2019s election law in 2005 introduced a 30 per cent quota for female candidates nominated by political parties and coalitions. This was removed by another revision in 2007,68 just before an election.

For some years, the pro- portion of women in Indonesia\u2019s parlia- ment was dismal. Despite affirmative action, it hovered around 10 per cent. With democratization beginning in 1998, however, the movement for women\u2019s representation has picked up momentum and visibility. Supporters were able to lobby for the inclusion of a provision in the Election Law passed in 2004 requir- ing all political parties to apply a 30 per cent quota for women to their candidate list. The provision lacked teeth, resulting in only a few parties adhering to it, but it was considered a historic achieve- ment in Indonesia. It generated an awareness that, as a first step, resulted in increasing the proportion of women representatives in the national parlia- ment by 25 per cent in 2004. Even more significant results were produced in 2009. The new election law passed in 2008 combined a 30 per cent quota for party lists with a \u2018zipper\u2019 system in which for every three candi- dates fielded by political parties, at least one had to be a woman. But the Consti- tutional Court in late 2008 issued a ruling that negated the quota and required the election to be decided wholly by the popular vote. While the decision was meant to curb the power of political parties and transfer it to the voters, it effectively dismantled affirma- tive action for women representatives. Many women\u2019s activists expressed pessi- mism about any possibility of increasing women\u2019s representation. Amidst this setback, however, the affirmative action debate generated greater interest in the issue of women\u2019s representation, and galvanized the efforts of different stakeholders. Civil society organizations launched activities to spread awareness of the importance of having a gender-balanced parliament. These efforts were backed by a number of political parties and some government agencies, such as the State Ministry on Women\u2019s Empowerment, the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the General Elec- tion Commission. UNDP and bilateral donors also actively supported the efforts of Indonesian stakeholders through civil society voters\u2019 education initiatives, media campaigns, and public consulta- tions among political parties, academics and civil society. The results took even activists by surprise. Many more parties took the 30 per cent quota seriously, even in the absence of legislation. As many as 70 per cent of the 38 parties competing in the 2009 election nominated women for more than 30 per cent of their candi- dates. The election has considerably increased the number of women in parliament\u2014shattering the 100 seats ceiling in the DPR (lower house). Though still below the 30 per cent mark that many activists set as their target, women\u2019s representation in the two chambers of Parliament has never been higher. The share of women repre- sentatives in the DPR has increased by 63 per cent. In the newly constituted upper house, the House of Regions or DPD, where only individuals may be candidates the increase was 77 per cent. This brought women\u2019s membership to 27.3 per cent, or just three per cent shy of the 30 per cent target.

ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 94 lobbying by some members of Parliament and women activists, and a veto by the President, the quota was not restored. As a result, the June 2008 election saw a decline in women parliamentarians, from five to three. A draft Gender Equality Law was submitted to Parlia- ment in July 2009; re-introducing the 30 per cent quota is its most-debated provision.69 A major obstacle to quotas making a meaningful contribution to women\u2019s political participation is non-compliance, particularly when there are no associated sanctions. Indonesia requires parties to field a one-third ratio of women candidates, yet the 2009 elections resulted in women obtaining only 18 per cent of parliamentary seats.70 It has no legal sanctions for non-compliance and no rules about where women should be placed on parliamentary lists71 (Box 3.5). Fulfilling their promise. One part of using quota systems to make a meaningful contri- bution to women\u2019s participation involves the systems themselves. As described above, the ingredients for effectiveness include sound laws, well-designed quotas that match electoral systems and build on political incentives, clear guidelines and timeframes, countermeasures for backlash and sanctions for non-compliance. But another part of successful quotas entails equipping women who may be new to politics to understand the political process, and make it work for themselves and their constituents. This helps improve the quality of governance and minimize complaints about the competency of \u2018quota candidates\u2019. Leaving aside for the moment the reality that many under-qualified men also enter the political arena in Asia-Pacific, it is also true that women start behind men in their access to political competencies through inferior education and less exposure to professional skills. Research on the profile of local women politicians in Asia and the Pacific indicates that they are generally young, low-income earners, inexperienced in politics and poorly educated.72 Those with internalized notions of inferiority and submission are often unprepared to assert their independence and may end up under-confident and unable to perform even at the level of their existing capacities. They may be unequipped to manage the expectation that their first responsibility is to their families, leaving little time for the meetings, consultations and study required to take on community and national problems.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "535a1545-fc50-406c-813d-47996236b132": {"__data__": {"id_": "535a1545-fc50-406c-813d-47996236b132", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39b7ece3f62174d76a1d983e1b7b7968d9ca35fee345630049f1c1c8c5a67ebc"}, "2": {"node_id": "df610a40-9ebe-4727-8699-d1ccdaf0d06b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "48c438dd576ec3bdcdeaa438e3e9801ebd0dabaa84e6e553863c1f481fef62d5"}}, "hash": "b19c4adb2859f074fc31f08a73e99e2c772abbab2d369d6b87437e1c8a310fa5", "text": "Deliberate exercises to cultivate women\u2019s capacities have been proven to better prepare women for office and make them more com- petitive as candidates running for election.

Not Often Invited to the Party Political parties are the gatekeepers to politi- cal systems in most Asia-Pacific countries. They provide funds, mobilize voters en masse, produce and advocate for party platforms, and transmit an image that may have broad public recognition. Candidates who affiliate with a party essentially step into an appara- tus that has experience in how to campaign and win. Party configurations vary widely. There may be one party, as is the case in China or Viet Nam, or many. Different parties may operate on local and national levels. They may be highly centralized or completely decentra- lized, strictly or loosely affiliated with a particular ideology. Parties in presidential systems\u2014common across much of Asia- Pacific\u2014tend to be less structured, since the Deliberate exercises to cultivate women\u2019s capacities better prepare women for office and make them more competitive as candidates running for election CHAPTER 3: PROMOTING POLITICAL VOICE 95 failure to vote with one\u2019s party does not threaten to bring the government down. Members may be freer to identify with regional, ethnic, economic, gender or other divisions when considering policy issues or during election campaigns.73 Because parties are intended to conso- lidate and gain political power, much of their behaviour is oriented around this objective. From this perspective, parties may view women as risky candidates, perhaps because there is a limited history of women in office, and women bring fewer resources and politi- cal connections to the table. Space for women candidates may be particularly squeezed in unstable or hotly contested political environ- ments, although in any system, if parties are not supportive of gender equality and women candidates, women\u2019s representation will be low. Women in some Asia-Pacific countries have viewed parties with skepticism, seeing them as ineffective in advancing women\u2019s participation or campaign promises of gender equality. In Pakistan, women\u2019s activists have argued fervently against applying quotas for women through parties, maintaining that this will constrain women to parties with patriarchal structures and that are weak and corrupt in some cases as well.74 They have demanded direct elections instead. Women\u2019s ability to appeal directly to the electorate was clear in Bangladesh\u2019s 2008 national election, where 19 of the 64 successful women were directly elected by voters, without assistance from party quotas.75 In the Philippines, one novel response has been for women to form their own party (Box 3.6). Despite the reasons for working outside the party system, there may be more reasons for working with parties on a programme or reform from within. Possible steps to build the presence of women in parties include: Revise party positions and rules to support gender equality. Party positions and rules determine how parties operate, including in the crucial nomination process. They may be stated or unstated, with the latter typically allowing political patronage systems to flou- rish. Women candidates tend to benefit from clearer rules that make some attempt at treat- ing individuals alike, regardless of gender, or go a step further to compensate for exclusion. This is possible not only through active quota systems, but also rules to position women candidates in rankings on party lists where they can be elected or agreements that women should comprise a percentage of the members of party nominating committees. In Japan, party leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party chose candidates, rather than the party rank and file. While party leaders can espouse and help spread more progressive perspectives on gender equality, more typically they are the upholders of party traditions which in Japan have consistently kept women\u2019s representation low. Women won a total of 26, or just under nine per cent, of the 296 LDP seats in the 2005 elections.76 Some positive examples of parties adopting policies to compensate for women\u2019s financial constraints come from outside Asia- Pacific but could serve as models for the region. The New Democratic Party in Canada has a provision for child-care support for women candidates. In Nigeria, the People\u2019s BOX 3.6 A PARTY WOMEN CALL THEIR OWN In 1995, the Philippines revised its Party List System Law to provide 20 per cent of seats in the House of Representatives to candidates from excluded groups, including women. Voters chose both a district representative and a \u2018sectoral\u2019 party. GABRIELA, the largest alliance of women\u2019s organizations, fielded a candidate in 2001. She won, and was re-elected in 2004. In 2007, GABRIELA earned nearly four per cent of the total votes, enough to ensure it had two seats. GABRIELA representatives have lost no time in being active on behalf of women and other excluded groups, such as migrant workers.

Some positive examples of parties adopting policies to compensate for women\u2019s financial constraints come from outside Asia- Pacific but could serve as models for the region ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 96 Democratic Party has dropped charges for nomination forms for women, leading to a higher number of women contesting and winning elections.77 Establish women\u2019s party sections. Women who come together as a group within a party can lobby more concertedly for the party to take action on gender equality, encourage the recruitment of more women members and candidates, organize training and provide support systems for women new to the party\u2014as long as there is a conscious and concerted effort to avoid marginalization. Lesley Clark, a former Member of Parlia- ment from Australia, cautions that while a women\u2019s branch or committee can do much to challenge male attitudes and support women entering politics, it should also be treated as a formal part of the overall party structure so that party members as a whole take it seriously.78 Recognize that women can win. Women candi- dates have proven to be remarkably successful even in adverse circumstances. Data from India suggests that even though parties field far fewer women candidates than men, women consistently and in some elections substantially are elected in higher percentages than men.79 Make connections with voters. Women\u2019s grow- ing track record, both as elected politicians and as voters, can also be an argument for parties to take them more seriously. In Republic of Korea, for instance, the compara- tive success of women in the 2007 elections led parties to actively recruit women candi- dates to represent a \u2018women\u2019s agenda\u2019 and appeal to women voters.80 In some cases, the perceptions of voters may be further ahead on the value of women in politics than those of mainstream politi- cians (Box 3.7). In Afghanistan, 62 per cent of women and 40 per cent of men agree that women and men should share leadership equally. Half of men but only 20 per cent of women think that political leadership should be mostly for men.81 In India, political parties have proven more resistant to state and national quotas for women. One survey found that 75 per cent of men and women support quotas.82 One question raised about women\u2019s vot- ing, particularly when women are assumed to be strongly under the sway of men, is whether they cast their own votes or follow the inclinations of male family members. Since the early 1970s, researchers from the Centre for Developing Societies in New Delhi have asked women voters in India whose advice they seek while casting their ballots. Fewer than 50 per cent of women vote based on what their husbands or male family members have to say. Since women\u2019s voter turnout has climbed, this means more and more women are making their own choices.83 Achieving More Inclusive Elections Beyond political parties, the structure and management of electoral systems also BOX 3.7 PEOPLE WANT MORE WOMEN IN OFFICE, BUT\u2026 The low numbers of women in political office may not necessarily reflect what the general population would like to see. In Thailand, for example, an opinion poll in 2005 found a contradiction between women\u2019s low representation rates and positive public perceptions of women in politics. Women currently have 11.7 per cent of the seats in Thailand\u2019s House of Representatives and 16 per cent in its Senate, both below the global average. Local elections tend to produce even lower numbers\u2014at around nine per cent. The poll, carried out by UNDP and Bangkok University, surveyed 6,000 people in urban and rural areas. It found that 85 per cent of respondents believe a woman would be a good prime minister, and 75 per cent would like to see more women in leading civil service positions and Parliament. Discriminatory attitudes were also apparent. Thirty per cent said they would choose a man if presented with equally qualified male and female candidates. About a third still did not believe that women are as good as men at making decisions and solving problems.

The average level of women\u2019s representation is appreciably higher in countries with these systems than in countries with plurality/ majoritarian systems.85 One explanation for this is that women have a greater probability of being included on a party ticket, particularly in larger districts with more than one representative. Parties and voters can hedge their bets, especially if supporting a woman candidate feels like a new and risky experiment. In plurality/majoritarian systems, a woman candidate usually has to compete one-on-one with a cross-section of male candidates, only one of whom will emerge the winner. In the Asia-Pacific, 15 countries are in the top half of 187 countries ranked by the percentage of women in a lower or single- house legislature. Eight have proportional or mixed electoral systems; seven have plurality/ majoritarian systems. Nine countries have some form of quota in place. Those countries that seem to do well without quotas\u2014aside from New Zealand, which is number one in the region\u2014tend to be clustered in South-East Asia. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Singapore and Viet Nam have participation rates around 25 per cent under plurality/ majoritarian systems.86 From a perspective of women\u2019s partici- pation, majoritarian systems that operate without quotas do less well in the Pacific. A survey of 12 countries and territories where women hold less than 10 per cent of legislative seats found that more than two-thirds employ majoritarian, first-past-the-post electoral systems, where the person with the most votes wins. None have quotas in place. This combination of the lack of quotas and electoral systems that tend to perpetuate existing patterns of power has not been enough for women in the region to overcome often-daunting social and economic cons- traints on participation. Of the six countries in the world that still have no female mem- bers in their national Parliaments, four are in the Pacific\u2014Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. Three use first-past-the-post systems.87 Electoral systems operate within a com- plex web of their own rules along with social norms and political practices. They do not hold all the solutions to increasing women\u2019s political voice, but they may contain some and deserve to be analyzed accordingly. For one thing, electoral rules are considered easier and faster to change in favour of gender equality than the cultural norms that hold women back, although both must be addressed.88 Some possible steps within current structures include: Implement existing quota provisions. These may need to be better defined, monitored and encouraged through incentives and sanctions, possibly through an election management board or similar mechanism. Examine rules, codes of conduct and election logistics. Often assumed to be gender-neutral, these should still be reviewed from a gender perspective, considering any specific cons- traints that women may encounter. Assess campaign financing. In Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world, elections are becoming more expensive, a disadvantage to women. Parties can make more funds available to women, but electoral systems can also have a role in adjudicating how money can be raised and spent. Public financing and campaign contribution limits can help make access to funds more democratic, for women and men, as can requirements for detailed reports on campaign spending. Controls on campaign Electoral rules are considered easier and faster to change in favour of gender equality than the cultural norms that hold women back ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 98 financing can also cut patron-client relation- ships where elected politicians end up dishing out favours, typically at public expense, for large donors. Singapore, for example, allows candidates to spend a maximum of US $12,00089 on a single election.90 Control violence and corruption. As a general principle, men, women and societies as a whole benefit from well-managed elections that prevent political factions from using violence and corruption for political benefit. Women in Asia-Pacific have at times taken public stances against violence and corrup- tion, but may also be more hesitant to enter a campaign where they may be at risk, including being deliberately targeted for gender-based violence.

Armed movements can themselves be a form of political expression, or spark counter-movements that may be violent or attempts to find peace.

They may promise more egalitarian representation for both women and men. BOX 3.8 EDUCATING PARTIES, VOTERS AND CANDIDATES PAYS OFF In Cambodia\u2019s 2007 local and 2008 national elections, a civil society group called the Committee to Promote Women in Politics trained women politicians, convinced political party leaders to support women\u2019s leadership and conducted campaigns to educate voters on women\u2019s leadership potential. In three of the provinces targeted by the group, the number of women commune councilors successfully contesting the election doubled and tripled. The committee was active in convincing national party leaders to put women at the top of candidate lists and to adopt a \u2018sandwich system\u2019 of alternating male and female names. These activities helped the overall number of women commune councilors rise from 8.5 per cent to 15 per cent, and the number of parliamentarians increase from 12 per cent to 22 per cent. Polls of voters found that more feel confident that women are good leaders, and fewer believe that men are better leaders than women. Cambodia has quotas for women\u2019s representation at the village level and in the civil service, but not in national politics\u2014so the experience illustrates in part how much can be done by mobilizing people to change their minds.

Conflict can intersect with the issue of women\u2019s political participa- tion in several ways, including challeng- ing traditional norms CHAPTER 3: PROMOTING POLITICAL VOICE 99 Women can play surprising roles during and after conflict\u2014surprising because their presence is large and mostly ignored. The participation of women and girls in armed conflicts is observed in Africa, Asia and Latin America. In Asia\u2014Indonesia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Timor-Leste\u2014females in non-state armies have shared similar conditions and risks as men. Less formal institutional struc- tures and the pressure to utilize every human resource fully can lead to the blurring of tradi- tional gender-roles, with women and girls expected to face risks similar to those of men. Yet they have often been marginalized in post- conflict power sharing, depriving countries of skills and perspectives which have the poten- tial to be used productively in peacetime.92 One incentive to recruit women is the perception that they will be more obedient and easier to train, although this notion does not always hold true. In Aceh, Indonesia, female warriors are traditionally seen as heroines of exceptional character, who are noble, fearless and ready to die as a martyr in the interests of society.93 Women join for many reasons.

In formal negotiations and within their families and communities, women have played essential, if mostly unacknowledged, roles in efforts to foster peace. Where they are seen as unaffiliated with the fighting of different factions, they can serve as emissaries to plead the case of peace before different groups, at times crossing lines that would be impossible for men. Around the world, women who have struggled to protect their families and communities have offered a powerful symbol for the greater social good achieved by ending hostilities (Box 3.9). They are also significant in holding together local economies, including by performing tasks ordinarily assigned to men.

Some post-conflict countries, such as Nepal (Box 3.10), have made laudable efforts to expand women\u2019s political role, starting with high-level positions in peace processes. Peace agreements offer opportunities to advance an agenda of inclusiveness, democra- tic reform and gender equality, including through the demonstration effect of women\u2019s participation. This can set the stage for women to gain experience and visibility that can later be used in peacetime political institu- tions such as parliaments. As social consen- sus grows around ideas of equality and wider participation in nation-building, it may foster greater acceptance of concrete steps such as affirmative action measures that can reduce male-female gaps and contribute to stability and development in a relatively short time.

They may have particular insights into the causes of conflict and the people fomenting it\u2014including themselves\u2014as well as into what is needed to resolve it and move towards sustainable peace. Women\u2019s economic needs, in particular, are frequently over- looked in countries like Afghanistan.

It also hinders prospects for national recovery and longer-term development. Put women\u2019s new skills to work.

Initiatives designed to reach them can include psychological support for a peaceful transition, and help them transfer their war- time capabilities into marketable and socially productive skills. Under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325100 on women, peace and security, some interesting steps have already been taken. In Liberia, for example, female supporters were identified as \u2018women asso- ciated with the fighting forces\u2019 rather than \u2018camp followers\u2019 so as to be included in the disarmament and reintegration process. Women then represented 24 per cent of those demobilized.101 Some female ex-combatants have themselves taken active steps to carve a place for participation in rebuilding. The Acehnese Women\u2019s League (Liga Inong Aceh, or LINA) emerged in 2006 to help female combatants get their dues.102 Women at the grass-roots level in Afghanistan have also used Resolution 1325 to lobby for partici- pation in peace-building, post-conflict elec- tions and the rebuilding of their societies.103 After conflict, the successful reintegration of women and men into normal civilian lives helps individuals be productive, and reduces disaffection and alienation. It means that women and men can make livelihoods, be protected by the law, and have a peaceful poli- tical voice to express grievances and aspira- tions. Treating women involved in conflict as valuable assets heightens the chance of achieving\u2014and maintaining\u2014these gains.

The gains were made by setting a 50 per cent quota for the proportional represen- tation segment of the election. A partnership initiative between local activists, lawyers, parliamentarians and public officials, facilitated by UNIFEM and the UN Democracy Fund, helped contribute to this. Nepali women, who played prominent roles in the country\u2019s Maoist movement during a decade of conflict, have so far found a place in peacemaking. But the focus has also been on what they can contribute to gender equality from that position. Towards that end, the UN partnership has assisted in a review of foreign constitutions, including the Rwandan Constitution, which explicitly refers to equal rights between women and men and establishes quotas for women.

Women also lead civil society organizations and are an obvious presence at ballot boxes. Political positions have proven to be open to women with resources or family connections; civil society movements to people willing to work for political change and new understandings of development. Where women\u2019s political participation has tended to fall short is in the whole range of formal institutions of public decision-making that lie anywhere between the top post and the person on the street. People intent on discouraging an influx of women leaders often raise the issue of how effective women can be in office. Women have had this debate themselves\u2014but more often it is linked to the effectiveness of the gover- nance system and the capacity of women in leadership positions to support gender equality. In Bangladesh, for instance, the quota system for parliamentary seats was originally designed so that winning parties could nominate 15 women candidates.105 This led to treatment of the 15 seats as a kind of parliamentary vote bank. The women parliamentarians were both a small minority and completely dependent on the parties, essentially rendering them powerless. The number of reserved seats for women increased in 2004 to 45, which were to be distributed among the parties according to elected representation.106 Women activists, in many countries, have spent years petitioning for direct election to reserved seats, as is the case on the sub-national level. In Bangladesh\u2019s 2008 national election, 19 of the 64 women elected to Parliament were in a direct process.107 This experience suggests that women politicians, public executives, activists and voters all need to be engaged in an agenda that promotes fair representation across all levels of government as a right of citizenship. The example also demonstrates that gender equality and democracy should build on all forms of political participation. Politics may never be an easy, straight road. But women and men can work together to make sure it heads in the right directions. Women\u2019s Representation Boosts Effectiveness The starting point for women\u2019s political participation is that it is a matter of fairness and representation. After that, like men, women will be naturally responsive to competing influences such as party expecta- tions, constituent demands and political ideologies. No assumptions can be made about women politicians as individuals, although some general patterns do emerge in two areas: Issues. A recent global survey by the Inter- Parliamentary Union found that women parliamentarians as a whole tend to empha- size issues such as childcare, equal pay, parental leave and pensions. They highlight reproductive rights, physical safety and gender-based violence, human development, the alleviation of poverty and the delivery of services.108 Similar patterns have been found in Asia- Pacific, where they have been studied. In New Zealand, a study carried out over 25 years\u2014 as the portion of women in Parliament rose from 4 per cent in 1975 to 29 per cent in 1999\u2014tracked debates on childcare and parental leave. It found that women were far more likely than men to prompt parlia- mentary debates on these issues, and at times were the only representatives calling attention to them. A decline in discussion of the two issues was noted when the number of women representatives dipped as well. One of the changes that occurred over that time was the acceptance of parental leave provisions for women and men.109 It is also true that women representatives helped vote down the 1998 Paid Parental Leave Bill, which would have brought New The starting point for women\u2019s political participation is that it is a matter of fairness and representation CHAPTER 3: PROMOTING POLITICAL VOICE 103 Zealand in line with international standards for paid leave.

A local woman politician in western Rajasthan reported: \u2018I was beaten by\u2026when I prevented him from beating his wife\u2026 I raised this in the Gram Sabha, and the members said this is not the place to raise personal issues and waste the precious time of the panchayat.\u2019112 The anecdote illustrates not only how patterns of gender discrimination continue to operate, but also how male-dominated groups find it natural to dismiss or ignore issues that challenge their authority or are not relevant to their concerns. This may explain some of the significant gaps in gender-responsive legislation that are explored in the next chapter. Another indication of this frequently occurs in crisis situations, where women are almost always heavily under-represented in decision-making forums that might make a difference to their survival. Natural disasters that take place in more equal societies, by contrast, have a more even-handed affect on life expectancy.113 The \u2018critical mass\u2019 theory has always maintained that enough women need to be in political positions for them to make a difference, and to push back against experi- ences like the one in Rajasthan. This notion is behind calls for ensuring that women comprise at least a third of political positions. But numbers alone, aside from an equity perspective, are a relatively blunt measure- ment for the gender equality impact of women\u2019s political participation. Women parliamentarians and civil society groups in Afghanistan fought hard against the April 2009 law allowing the minority Shia community to control women\u2019s move- ments outside the house and prevent married women from refusing sex.114 Even though Afghanistan has one of the highest percen- tages of women parliamentarians in the region, however, women across ongoing parliamentary debates have proven to be just as divided as men on the lines of ethnicity, class, language, political affiliations and regions. One review of the first 18 months of the Parliament\u2019s operation concluded, \u2018The discrepancy between women\u2019s political presence, and their ability (or indeed willingness) to represent or prioritize their collective \u2018gender interests\u2019 has become evident.\u2019115 Leadership and decision-making. Research on diverse groups in general shows they tend to make better decisions, draw on multiple sources of talent and have a better under- standing of risks.116 When women are involved, this does not imply that decisions will conform to gender stereotypes about the style of women\u2019s leadership\u2014plenty of examples exist of women leaders in Asia- Pacific who have put to rest notions about In crisis situations, women are almost always heavily under-represented in decision-making forums that might make a difference to their survival ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 104 women automatically pursuing more \u2018feminine\u2019 or \u2018pacifist\u2019 policies. A survey on local women leaders from Asia-Pacific countries, however, found that many characterize their leadership style as being more inclusive, consultative and colla- borative than that of men who traditionally dominate politics. They perceive themselves as more tolerant of different points of view, people-oriented and encouraging of participa- tion, with a focus on issues instead of perso- nalities.117 In Bangladesh, people report a higher rate of satisfaction with the decisions made by local women representatives in terms of the distribution of public resources and allocation of projects.118 Experiences in Cambodia119 and India120 suggest that local women leaders are more accessible to women in their communities and thus may have exposure to a broader range of constituents.

Gender balance in ministries like finance, public works, commerce, industry, municipal administra- tion, rural and urban development, health, home and education, a gender balance can influence progress towards development goals. Some action points that may contribute to linking progress on women\u2019s representation and democracy to advancements in human development include: Encourage women and men to act collectively on gender. Gender equality is about and stands to benefit both women and men. Both can be involved in advocating for gender equality and may be more and more willing to do so as gender norms become more balanced. Enco- uraging men\u2019s involvement can expand political support. It also helps reduce the impression among some men that for them, gender equality is a zero-sum game designed to strip them of power and privilege. Social, economic and political benefits can all accrue when diverse groups participate in the full exercise of democracy and citizenship. Make gender equality part of common politics. While often associated with more liberal political philosophies, gender equality can be and has been a point of common ground for people from the full political spectrum. Alliances can form around advancing gender equality, even in the presence of disagree- ments about other issues. For Fiji\u2019s progressive Family Law Act 2003, the overwhelming majority of female representatives in Parliament not only championed and supported the proposed law during parliamentary debates, but lobbied within their parties for it to be passed across party lines.124 In an informal coalition, women parliamentarians mobilized along A more balanced configuration of men and women may be more effective not just in forwarding a gender equality agenda, but also human development CHAPTER 3: PROMOTING POLITICAL VOICE 105 gender and across racial lines\u2014the latter an unprecedented step in Fiji\u2019s legislative history. This spurred the building of new alliances, and in the end, only one indigenous Fijian female MP, a high chief, refused to support the new law.125 In Viet Nam, the Women\u2019s Union is a mass organization that mobilizes women from the grassroots to the Central Committee. It has successfully advocated the adoption of laws, policies and programmes for women\u2019s poverty reduction, education and reproduc- tive health care. At the local level, the union nominates women for election to Party committees, the National Assembly and people\u2019s councils. It has played a significant role in getting out the vote for women nominees among its constituencies. Union- sponsored training courses equip women nominees with skills to win in the People\u2019s Committee elections.126 Support women\u2019s participation inside and outside the formal political system. Women\u2019s movements in the Asia-Pacific region have had long debates about whether it is better to work towards gender equality inside or out- side the formal political system. Some acti- vists have chosen to remain outside political systems for some of the same reasons as potential women candidates. They contend politics is male-dominated, overtly discrimi- nates against women or is riddled with \u2018dirty\u2019 political practices. Common alternatives have entailed pursing equal rights through legal means and grassroots mobilization. At the same time, women in a number of Asia-Pacific countries have been strong proponents of increasing the number of women in political offices. Both approaches have yielded achieve- ments, suggesting they can be mutually reinforcing and should be pursued in tandem. Some evidence shows that women are more effective inside political institutions when they enjoy the support of women mobilizing outside. Women and others interested in deepening democratic institutions are also active in educating voters, advocating for the passage of laws, creating networks and channelling information about gender equality issues into the political system. Increasingly, civil society groups have helped prepare women for political positions, especially in local government. In South-East Asia, informal women leaders have become the logical choices of their community associations to represent women\u2019s interests in local councils or governments. Other women elected to local legislative bodies may be homemakers, small-scale producers, village teachers or volunteer workers for livelihood, health and nutrition programmes.

Inside formal political systems, the menu of options for action on women\u2019s political participation includes adopting and imple- menting well-designed quotas. These should take into account local circumstances and the electoral system, and be backed by legal com- pliance mechanisms. Constructive public debate around quotas can raise public aware- ness and political interest, helping to push boundaries where political parties are unlike- ly to provide more balanced opportunities on their own. Quotas should be considered for elected offices, as well as for the civil service, judiciary and other critical public leadership positions where parity lags behind. Engaging political parties, along with traditional leaders and bodies, is another important step. They can help extend support for gender equality and minimize possible backlash against a growing political role for women. Gender sensitization training, includ- ing through study tours within or across countries, can be conducted for political candidates and leaders before elections, and politicians in office after elections. Inside formal political systems, the menu of options for action on women\u2019s political participation includes adopting and implementing well-designed quotas ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 106 As discussed earlier in this chapter, some of the elements for parties in particular include revising party positions and rules to support gender equality, consciously promot- ing women candidates through higher place- ments on party lists, and understanding the political benefits that can come from appeal- ing to women and other voters. Since finance is increasingly a determinant of entry to poli- tical systems, campaign financing patterns should be reviewed both within parties and by electoral management bodies, not just in light of women\u2019s inequitable access, but also for cleaner political processes. Both inside and outside political systems, women need to see that they can and should participate, aim for high positions and make a difference that is meaningful to them and the societies in which they live. Supporting women\u2019s knowledge, capacity and interest in public positions can come through high- quality mentoring programmes or other opportunities to build their skills. Education systems should also support direct experience of democratic processes as part of schooling. School elections for positions like \u2018head boy,\u2019 \u2018head girl\u2019 or \u2018prefect\u2019 can provide early training on campaigning, voting, accepting and conceding power, and providing a healthy opposition. Future generations would benefit from such exposure, as against teachers picking the most obedient or best-performing students. Know, use and change the rules. Institutional rules generally dictate the functioning of, for example, a parliament, with impacts on the conduct of parliamentarians and the passage of legislation. Women should learn about these, apply them to their advantage and change them where necessary. If laws or their interpretation inhibit political participation, legal reform can provide all citizens with equal opportunities in public life. Some areas of focus in terms of gender equality include securing institutional procedures that are gender-friendly, such as provisions for childcare; reviewing committee positions for gender balance; providing on- going support for women entering parliament and serving in leadership positions once they get there; initiating and building political support for legislation that advances gender equality; and parliamentary discourse that routinely integrates and therefore normalizes gender equality as a core component of political debate.127 Electoral rules can address barriers such as unsafe campaigning spaces and restrictions on female mobility, opening up more space for women to step forward. Recognize the value of women as role models for others. Women in public office, especially when they excel, demonstrate to other women that it is possible for them to succeed in public life\u2014and that politics does not need to be about just the usual faces and patterns of behaviour. If women are proactive or greater in number, they show that women can influence political events, shape and operationalize political voice and introduce issues that are otherwise ignored. New ground can be broken as women interact with new groups of people, acquire the skills to verbalize and address the interests of constituents, and gain confidence as active agents of social change. When women are conscious of their capacity as role models, they can deliberately use this to encourage other women\u2019s participation. Systematically tracking information on women in a full range of positions\u2014including in the executive and legislative branches, political appointments, the civil service, the judiciary and non- traditional ministries\u2014can demonstrate the diversity of political opportunities available for future generations of both women and men. Women\u2019s political participation can also shift dynamics within families, extending from there into the community.

Women are seen as persons in their own rights, rather than in relation to male family members.128 Explicitly seek out women\u2019s voices in crises and after. Women and men face conflicts and natural disasters, playing varied roles in times of crisis. They share insecurity, poor living conditions and danger. Both may join armed combat. While women and girls are vulnerable in specific ways, such as through gender-based violence and restricted mobility, they make active contributions and have useful inside information. They also pick up a variety of skills in crises, some of which are transferable to normal life, and valuable in formulating policies and programmes for the aftermath. Women\u2019s engagement should be explicitly sought in all relief, early recovery and rehabilitation programmes, as well as across all phases of peace negotiations, disarma- ment, demobilization and reintegration. Post- crisis initiatives that ignore gender complexi- ties can miss out on women\u2019s enormous potential, and the potentially different needs of women and men.

Women\u2019s poorer health, economic standing and education are barriers to poli- tical participation. Equally, steps to improve women\u2019s standing on these issues should be connected to efforts to ensure that women can hold the political system responsible for sustained progress. This issue is increasingly relevant to local governments in countries undergoing some variation of devolution or decentralization, given the greater role local officials are playing in the delivery of services. In Bangladesh, advocacy and monitoring by civil society groups led to increases in the number of physicians in 12 sub-districts. Now there are seven to eight physicians, up from two to four, in each sub-district health centre. They include an obstetrician/ gynaecologist.129 The groups Mahila Samakhya (Educa- tion for Women\u2019s Equality) and Vanangana (Daughters of the Forest) have worked in some of the most economically backward regions of India, and among some of the poorest people in these regions, to improve social and economic conditions and enhance political voice. Mahila Samakhya has trained poor lower caste and tribal women as handpump mechanics, sparking a new consci- ousness among the women about caste, class and gender issues and inspiring in many a deep desire to pursue formal literacy.130 The two groups have collaborated to directly address deaths related to marriage dowries. Street plays in villages use local idioms and folklore to critique the common notion that sons-in-law must be revered and that parents should \u2018befriend their daughter at her birth, but not in her fate\u2019\u2014where her fate is her marriage.131 The performances generate intense debate, with many women in the audiences drawing connections between women\u2019s lack of access to resources and their devaluation and vulnerability to violence inside the household.132 In the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, an anti-arrack (a type of alcohol) movement was created out of the awareness stirred by the mass literacy campaign of the National Literacy Mission. Most of the groundwork was done locally, with women collectively protesting against arrack in their villages. As the movement gathered momentum, political parties became involved. The resulting political pressure changed the state leader- ship. Overall, the experience demonstrated how women\u2019s issues can align with the larger issues of state and society.133 Women\u2019s poorer health, economic standing and education are barriers to poli- tical participation ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 108 Expand mechanisms for accountability. An increase in women\u2019s representation, and even the adoption of a gender equality agenda, means little in countries with limited state capa- cities for implementation and mechanisms to hold politicians to account. Implementation capacities can be a matter of insufficient pub- lic resources, but questions also need to be raised about political choices made to disburse funds that are available. Although money is often seen as being gender-neutral, choices about how to raise and spend it have gender dimensions.

India: In 1999, the National Development Council, one of India\u2019s highest policy-making bodies, made empowering women and socially excluded groups a specific objective of the Ninth Five Year Plan. The National Institute of Public Finance and Policy subsequently embarked on a comprehensive study of gender budgeting, coming up with an innovative strategy lauded by national and international experts in the field. Among its features is the ability to assess the benefits of budget allocations, and track the link between fiscal policy and gender development. Based on the study, the Ministry of Finance called upon all government ministries and departments to establish gender budget units and prepare benefit analyzes linked to gender. In 2005, it asked 18 ministries and departments to submit targets benefiting women in their annual reports and performance budgets, and a separate statement on gender and budgetary allocations appeared in the 2005-2006 Union Budget. Over 50 government ministries and departments now prepare gender budgets. The 2008-2009 Union Budget pointed out that gender- specific allocations increased over the previous year from US $3.7 billion to US $5.5 billion. Nepal: The process of mainstreaming gender into macro policy-making began in 1994 when four different sectors of the Eighth Plan\u2014agriculture, energy, tourism, labour and industry\u2014were analyzed through a gender perspective. A gender-auditing module was incorporated into the Ninth Plan in 1997, after which the process became a gender budgeting exercise covering both taxation and expenditure. Guidelines on gender budgeting were prepared for ministries to undertake gender budgeting, and revised for sub-national governments. In 2005, the Ministry of Finance began issuing a Gender Budgeting Statement and instituted a Gender Budgeting Committee. Nepal is now working on a system to score allocations by their impacts on gender, using markers such as increases in women\u2019s participation and employment options. In 2008, a Gender Budgeting Statement revealed that 13.9 per cent of the total budget comprises allocations that directly respond to gender issues; 35.4 per cent are indirectly responsive and 50.6 per cent are gender-neutral. More recent gender budgeting statements for 2009 and 2010 reveal improvements: 17.3 per cent, 36.4 per cent and 46.3 per cent respectively. The Philippines: Gender-responsive budgeting initiatives began in 1995 with a decision to earmark at least five per cent of all departmental expenditures on programmes for women in national and sub-national budgets. This approach proved problematic, resulting in the misallocation or lack of use of earmarked funds. Gender issues became marginalized in mainstream budgeting, as some departments construed floor limits as a spending ceiling. Targeting expenditures based on the identification of appropriate programmes for women or reprioritizing expenditures based on a generic list of appropriate programmes and policies might have been more effective. A few local gender budgeting initiatives, particularly in the municipalities of Sorsogon and Hilongos, have made attempts to identify specific gender needs before budgeting. They have moved from quota-based gender budgeting to the identification of entry points for results-oriented budgeting. In the process, they have come up with specific targets, such as strengthening the agricultural sector to provide women with more income options and reduce forced migration.

Transformation Through Participation Asia-Pacific\u2019s record on women\u2019s political participation falls short of its development achievements and ambitions. A handful of countries can claim significant progress, either at the national or local level, but the region as a whole lags behind much of the rest of the world. The unrest felt in some parts of the region suggests that a groundswell of people is pushing back against limits imposed by political systems that are not participatory, either by design or practice. Women\u2019s political participation should be part of a broader aim for societies that are democratic, stable and grounded in genuinely equal citizenship. If a broad cross-section of women can come to the political table, they will bring new perspectives, talents and interests to decision-making. Politics and policy-making might become more responsive to a more inclusive array of public concerns\u2014 and more accurate in decisions about the use of public resources. At first, this may not be easy or straightforward. But by deepening democracy, it can lead to transformation through improved human development prospects for citizens at large. The depth and effectiveness of gender budgeting depends on it being placed firmly on political agendas, as budgets are a political process ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 110 ACTIONS AT A GLANCE BOLSTERING VOICE: A GENDER EQUALITY AGENDA Gender equality in political participation is socially just and basic to the notion of democracy. A political system where half the population cannot participate defies the meaning of the term. Broad- based participation also has a clear practical dimension\u2014and a development rationale. It supports efficiency: More sources of information make political decision-making more informed and responsive to diverse realities on the ground. Through access to the political arena, men and women can articulate and shape solutions that unleash progress for themselves and society at large. Progress in political voice and decision-making is therefore critical in shaping issues of economic power and legal rights. Linking progress on women\u2019s representation and democracy to progress on gender equality and human development includes actions to: Encourage women and men to act collectively on gender. Promote men and women\u2019s public involvement in advocating for gender equality \ufffd Encourage men\u2019s involvement to expand political support. Make gender equality part of common politics. Support issues of gender equality as common ground for people from across the political spectrum \ufffd Form alliances between governments, civil society organizations and others around advancing gender equality, even in the presence of disagreements about other issues. Support women\u2019s participation inside and outside the formal political system. Adopt and implement well-designed quotas in legislatures, political parties, the judiciary and civil service \ufffd Back quotas with legal compliance mechanisms \ufffd Review campaign financing to ensure equitable access for women \ufffd Support women\u2019s and civil society groups mobilizing around gender issues, including by educating voters, advocating for the passage of laws, creating networks and channelling information about gender equality issues into the political system \ufffd Cultivate women\u2019s knowledge, capacity and interest in public positions through high-quality mentoring programmes or other opportunities to build their skills \ufffd Make direct experiences of democratic processes part of education systems. Know, use and change the rules. Provide opportunities for women to learn about institutional rules that dictate the functioning of parliament, parties and other institutions of governance \ufffd Promote legal reform when laws or their interpretation inhibit political participation \ufffd Address barriers during elections related to security and restrictions on female mobility, opening up more space for women to step forward. Recognize the value of women as role models for others. Show women the opportunities they may find or the gaps they can fill by systematically tracking information on women in a full range of positions \u2013 including in the executive and legislative branches, political appointments, the civil service, the judiciary and non-traditional ministries. Explicitly seek out women\u2019s voices in crises and after. Engage women in all relief, early recovery and rehabilitation programmes, as well as across all phases of peace negotiations, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration \ufffd Encourage political leadership to work with civil society to genuinely \u2018build back better\u2019. Link political voice to all other human development issues. Factor in women\u2019s disadvantages in health, economic standing and education as barriers to political participation \ufffd Identify ways to ensure that women can hold the political system for sustained progress to improve women\u2019s standing on all issues linked to their capabilities and opportunities.

CHAPTER 4: ADVANCING LEGAL RIGHTS 113 Despite constitutional provisions on equality before the law, gender norms seep into legal systems unnoticed and unchallenged. This means that women and men experience the same laws and legal systems differently.1 But should they? Gender equality requires un- covering biases in the legal process, so that both the substance of laws and how they are upheld become powerful tools to advance equality, including by adhering to the prin- ciple of the rule of law and applying corrective measures to redress past discrimination. The alternative, prevalent in much of Asia-Pacific today, is for laws and legal prac- tices to allow\u2014even encourage\u2014discrimi- nation to fester. They can be overtly biased or silent on the imbalances in the social, economic and political standings of women and men, even when these mean that not every citizen has equal access to justice. They may be inconsistent, offering broad protec- tions of rights on the one hand, often in constitutions, while stripping away these guarantees on the other, typically through inconsistent laws or practices within the daily running of the justice system. Asia-Pacific now has more laws that support the advancement of women than at any point in history. This achievement deserves to be recognized and is the foun- dation for continued progress. At the same time, not nearly enough has been done. More than half the countries of East Asia and Pacific and over three-fourths of the South Asian countries are marked by medium to high level of discrimination in economic rights. The social rights situation is even worse and deteriorating.2 Most legal systems in Asia-Pacific have been buffeted by competing influences, from colonialism to domestic demands to inter- national human rights standards. This explains in part why many have ended up with contradictory or archaic statutes and discriminatory practices. But in the drive towards human development, and in the embrace of modern societies grounded in the principle of equal citizenship, more attention needs to be paid to how the law holds women back, and how this can constrain further advancements for women, men and societies at large. The region falls far behind where it could be on basic issues such as protecting women from violence, upholding entitlements to property\u2014or even allowing people to divorce in an informed and reasonable way. Two barriers are in place: the first comes from the construction of laws themselves, which may be overtly discriminatory, full of gaps or contradictory. The second barrier is restricted access to the legal system and to justice within A country\u2019s legal system touches every aspect of human development, human rights and gender equality. In regulating rights and imposing duties, the law and legal practices influence how women and men seek opportunities and make choices to better their lives. They affect the capabilities of men and women and determine physical security, relations within the family, workplace conditions and voice in public discourse. The ability to access the justice system also has an impact on whether or not these laws touch people\u2019s lived experience. Advancing Legal Rights The region falls far behind where it could be on basic issues such as protecting women from violence, upholding entitle- ments to property Chapter4 ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 114 it. This involves all the reasons that women\u2014 because they are women\u2014may not go to police, the court or other mechanisms for justice, or may not find equal treatment even if they do. Too often, gender discrimination in the region\u2019s legal systems remains justified on the basis of conventional notions about the needs and capabilities of women and men. These have not always been examined in light of whether or not they truly serve current priorities or a future of human development. Rarely are women themselves consulted about how the law could be a lever for change, rather than a source of deepening inequalities. In April 2009, scores of Afghan Shia women protested against the controversial provisions of the Shia Personal Status Law. They argued that the new law \u2018insults the dignity of women\u2019 and must be withdrawn because it was imposed on them without consultation.3 The law was passed anyway, containing many provisions that deny women their rights. It grants custody rights for children exclusively to fathers and grandfathers, and stipulates that a woman can leave the house without her husband\u2019s permission only if she has \u2018reasonable legal reasons\u2019.4 Legal rights are critical to back gains in economic power and political voice. Legal systems that support gender equality and human development provide consistent guarantees of equality in all spheres: constitutional, civil and criminal,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fece76d-a6e7-41be-8a78-93d0bafe74ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fece76d-a6e7-41be-8a78-93d0bafe74ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "493073faa3d34c5ffcf8cd708ef122224ba8853ad04cd81931abfdcc80094b79"}}, "hash": "493073faa3d34c5ffcf8cd708ef122224ba8853ad04cd81931abfdcc80094b79", "text": "public and private. This implies eliminating overt discrimination, filling gaps and removing contradictions. CEDAW, signed by 35 countries in the region, can be an important reference point. It focuses on substantive equality, which means that all people, regardless of gender, have the same status in respect to specific rights and obligations.5 While there is no perfect legislation in the arena of human relationships, this chapter explores how legislation can pave the way towards more balanced interactions between women and men. In doing so, it provides protection and opens new opportunities for both to acquire capabilities and pursue human development. A Tangle of Legal Influences People do not make or enforce laws in isolation. Multiple influences, from colonia- lism to indigenous customs, have shaped the legal systems of Asia and the Pacific\u2014not always in desirable or consistent ways. These factors determine the foundation of the law itself, as well as its evolution and ongoing interpretation. Varying political, economic, religious, social and cultural reference points with a mixed record on gender equality mean that women in the same country may not be equal before the law. Some are born into commu- nities governed by different laws; others lack the knowledge and economic resources to access the justice system. Examining past and present influences throws light on the roots of legal inequalities, as a starting point for rectifying them. It also reveals signs of progress pointing the way towards further advancements. Colonial Legacies Persist Legal systems across Asia and the Pacific still bear the marks of former colonial powers. Archaic 19th Century legal codes permeate laws in many of the former British colonies of South and South East Asia, for example. Three main pieces of British-based legisla- tion\u2014the Penal Code, the Evidence Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure\u2014are the foundation of the criminal justice systems in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, although changes have been made in each country.6 Pre-colonial India based its law on sacred religious texts, unlike England where canon or ecclesiastical law gradually disappeared Archaic 19th Century legal codes permeate laws in many of the former British colonies of South and South East Asia CHAPTER 4: ADVANCING LEGAL RIGHTS 115 from the legal system. For Hindus, the divinely inspired Vedas and Dharamshastras \u2014the oldest of which was the Code of Manu believed to have been written during 200 BC to AD 100\u2014contained, among other things, the rules of right conduct. For Muslims, the Quran was the source of legal norms. The function of the state was restricted to enforcing the law. It was not involved in making laws since these were already complete and enshrined in the sacred texts and customs. Legal procedures were not highly institutionalized with formal rules and rituals. A typical legal proceeding in pre- colonial India was likely to be conducted by a village headman or committee consisting of local men of status.7 When the British colonialists arrived, they had some input into family law in South Asia, but generally opted not to interfere in this area. Extremely diverse family law systems were maintained, with each commu- nity following its own set of rules and regula- tions and with different kinds of legislative interventions. The British did leave their imprint on other forms of law, believing that British laws should be the model for other countries, regardless of their values and interests.8 Prevailing British norms called for protecting the honour of the individual and his or her family, for example, over punishing an injury to a woman. All British colonies also inherited laws criminalizing sodomy and sex work, some of which still remain in force. Rape laws contain narrow definitions, such as excluding marital rape and considering consent from the view of the offender. The advent of colonization in the Pacific meant that some traditionally matrilineal areas\u2014including in Fiji, Tokelau, Republic of Marshall Islands, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands\u2014gradually became patrilineal. Women no longer had the same rights to assets or inheritance. In Pohnpei in Federated States of Micronesia, German law awarded \u2018each adult male a piece of land\u2019, so land is now commonly transferred from father to son, although daughters can also inherit it.9 Customs Can Open the Door to Discrimination Women and men in different Asia-Pacific societies find strength in traditions, customs and beliefs, including those derived from religion. But these can also be a source of discriminatory gender norms that at times affect systems of justice, even in officially \u2018secular\u2019 or \u2018modern\u2019 societies. They may remain uncodified in laws, but enforced in a de facto manner by local leaders or informal courts. They can also be codified and enforced by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8bf12e78-1472-48ad-b2d4-2bfb3a89247d": {"__data__": {"id_": "8bf12e78-1472-48ad-b2d4-2bfb3a89247d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "030ec826ca3a7a7c2b29d7b7d170403c2507b70a3329c643227330154fe50e78"}, "3": {"node_id": "e511f830-0b8b-4275-91cf-842afd5a9eb0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "179a2bf08936adf0aaacab7240b19f05642b204bbc82e6f51f3a6e20d97f6eb0"}}, "hash": "2a3c5af958f67084d4d43c2ea43606b5acd439b61b0678239074273f299bc872", "text": "mainstream courts, or broadly recognized within constitutions so that courts must determine how they fit with other laws. Afghanistan, for example, attempts to strike a balance through legal provisions that require courts to rule in accordance with general custom, provided that the custom does not contradict existing laws or the principles of justice.10 This kind of attitude, while intended to respect and accommodate prevailing norms, has not been sufficient in scrubbing out practices that harm women. Since customs and religious beliefs are deeply rooted in the social and cultural ethos, they can enjoy a kind of extra-judicial authority\u2014an exception to the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of gender, or even the notion of all citizens being equal before the law\u2014so that different communities may end up with different legal rights. Too often, customs and religious beliefs have become a rationale for laws and legal systems to ignore or soft-peddle or even, in the worst cases, justify issues such as discriminatory inheritance practices and the multiple forms of violence that specifically target women.

Bhutan\u2019s Inheritance Act of 1980, for exam- ple, guarantees equal inheritance for sons and daughters, but traditional inheritance prac- tices may also be observed. For most Bhutanese, these stipulate that daughters inherit family land. As a result, 60 per cent of rural women hold land registration titles \u2013 a higher figure than anywhere else in South Asia. Inheritance practices favouring daugh- ters also account for the large number of women who own shops and businesses. 11 In Viet Nam, by contrast, there has been a deliberate attempt to modernize legal statutes, including those related to land. By law, the land belongs to the people; the state leases land and issues land-use rights certificates. The names of both husband and wife must be mentioned on the certificate as stipulated in the revised Land Law 2003.12 Since the law was amended, 90 per cent of newly-issued land use right certificates have the name of both husband and wife. However, existing certificates issued before the revised Land Law still remain in effect and are used in current transactions.13 The Viet Nam Household Living Standards Survey 2004 reveals that for agricultural land, 15 per cent of those households with land user certificates held them jointly, while 66 per cent were held by men and 19 per cent by women.14 At times, customs and religious beliefs can be deliberately mixed with the law to consolidate political, economic and social power to the detriment of less powerful women and men. In Pakistan, a local jirga pronounced the judgment of gang rape on a village woman\u2014Mukhtar Mai\u2014in 2002. Her 12-year-old brother had been seen walking with a girl from the more influential tribe. The tribe demanded Mai\u2019s rape to avenge their \u2018honour\u2019.15 A few Pacific countries and territories still have archaic laws against witchcraft and sorcery that are couched in gender-neutral language, but applied exclusively to older women. Public killing of those suspected of witchcraft and sorcery is not uncommon. As recently as January 2009, a woman in rural Papua New Guinea was bound and gagged, tied to a log and set ablaze on a pile of tires, possibly because villagers suspected her of being a witch.16 Courts in the Pacific struggle to manage a complex brew of customary laws and prac- tices, constitutional provisions, longstanding notions of women\u2019s subordinate status and emerging expectations around women\u2019s rights to equality. These are reflected in the laws themselves and how they are interpreted. In Vanuatu, the traditional Malvatumauri (House of Chiefs), supported by church leaders, attempted to pass a \u2018new\u2019 customary law in 2005 to prevent ni-Vanuatu women from wearing trousers, shorts, pants or jeans. The Vanuatu Women\u2019s Centre challenged this with a media campaign saying the dress code was unconstitutional and against their rights. The code was withdrawn, but is still enforced intermittently and informally.17 In Tuvalu, there is a common practice called moetolo where a man creeps into the fale (traditional house) and rapes a woman, while others are sleeping or pretending to sleep.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e511f830-0b8b-4275-91cf-842afd5a9eb0": {"__data__": {"id_": "e511f830-0b8b-4275-91cf-842afd5a9eb0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "030ec826ca3a7a7c2b29d7b7d170403c2507b70a3329c643227330154fe50e78"}, "2": {"node_id": "8bf12e78-1472-48ad-b2d4-2bfb3a89247d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a3c5af958f67084d4d43c2ea43606b5acd439b61b0678239074273f299bc872"}}, "hash": "179a2bf08936adf0aaacab7240b19f05642b204bbc82e6f51f3a6e20d97f6eb0", "text": "If the rapist is taken to court\u2014a long shot, since this crime is mostly unreported\u2014the court may maintain that if a woman was really being raped, someone would have taken action to stop it.

In most cases, the man will only be charged with trespassing.18 Patterns of social organization, often reflecting religious or customary beliefs, also influence notions about gender that in turn are reflected in legal systems. Patriarchal societies, found in much of Asia-Pacific, are premised on a notion of male superiority. Women are seen as weak, biologically inferior and incapable of decision-making.19 These Courts in the Pacific struggle to manage a complex brew of customary laws and practices, constitu- tional provisions, longstanding notions of women\u2019s subordi- nate status and emerging expecta- tions around women\u2019s rights to equality CHAPTER 4: ADVANCING LEGAL RIGHTS 117 attitudes appear in the creation and interpretation of laws when the husband is automatically perceived as the \u2018head of the family\u2019 while the wife is a \u2018home-maker\u2019.20 In child custody issues, the father is the \u2018natural guardian\u2019 of the child. Violent behaviour in the home can be treated as a normal male prerogative that does not require the justice system to intervene. In Viet Nam, the Confucian concept that men are responsible for the \u2018education\u2019 of their wives and children underpins acceptance of physical violence. 21 Politicized Religion Sees Rights as Threats The politics of religion remains a contentious issue in Asia-Pacific, one that is reflected in laws and legal practices. Provisions for reli- gion in some constitutions have made it a potent legal and political force, with consequ- ences for how women experience the justice system. Fundamentalist voices have raised the spectre of women\u2019s rights as a threat to religi- ous freedoms, sidestepping the reality of di- verse interpretations and cultural practices.22 In Pakistan, women\u2019s rights debates with political and religious overtones have gone back and forth for decades. The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance was passed in 1961, with provisions to discourage polygamy and protect women\u2019s rights in divorce, among others. It drew much criticism from religious leaders and had to be protected in 1963 by the Fundamental Rights Bill, the first amend- ment to the Constitution, which specified that the ordinance was not open to judicial review.23 Zia-ul-Haq\u2019s military regime later imposed an \u2018Islamization agenda\u2019 to pacify religious factions.24 He introduced the draco- nian Hudood Laws in 1979.25 The harsh Zina Ordinance required rape victims to produce four male witnesses as evidence for the crime or face adultery charges. A bill to amend the discriminatory law was introduced in the National Assembly of Pakistan in 2004. The proposed legislation led to a split and divi- sions among the Assembly\u2019s members. Conservative groups felt that the law made in the \u2018name of Islam\u2019 should not be abolished. Liberal groups contended that customs and laws that discriminate against women must be repealed.26 The law was finally overturned in 2006 through the Women Protection Bill.27 In some countries, the principle of respec- ting diversity, while a valid one, has been used to allow discriminatory laws grounded in religion. This argument has been used in India, where the Constitution gives equal rights to women under civil law, but Muslims, Hindus and Christians can adhere to their personal laws in marriage, divorce and other family matters. The Indian state has aimed to establish a uniform civil code, taking steps such as the Special Marriage Act of 1954, which provides that any couple can marry, irrespective of community, in a civil cere- mony. Yet a uniform civil code is still not in place. Many members of the religious hierarchy in the Pacific adopt an orthodox and patriar- chal interpretation of religion that has led them to become politically engaged in fighting against legal reform benefiting women. In 2003, the Methodist Church in Fiji attempted to stop the passage of the Family Law Act, which removed systemic discrimination against women in family law, on the basis that it was un-Christian and anti-indigenous Fijian. The church was ultimately persuaded not to officially oppose the act by the ruling government party, closely aligned to the church at the time, and by various prominent individuals.28 In Vanuatu, some Christian churches and traditional chiefs challenged the Family Protection Act 2008, designed to protect women from domestic violence.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92467dcc-831f-4947-817a-6aada6601b26": {"__data__": {"id_": "92467dcc-831f-4947-817a-6aada6601b26", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79f2f522428576dd98059f76dcd5e40e1aa491cde147127f84029ef8241c7414"}, "2": {"node_id": "a1d28318-6c8b-4c64-bd71-953a0c2ab1cb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f226f3aa3ae908e5739893beecc3f4902293faa09c270a17ed87ff55a72d963a"}}, "hash": "7ac8f05c7e128cc42f2f1989a8e56f8f800659eb7240a5c5426474b025373d37", "text": "They maintained the law contradicts ni-Vanuatu custom as well as Christian and Melanesian values in the preamble of the Vanuatu Constitution.29 The Supreme Court ruled in late November 2008 that the new law is consistent with the Constitution.

The Government has adopted the Catholic Church\u2019s line of opposition to contraception, with adverse impacts on the country\u2019s family planning programme.31 National Reforms Produce Impetus from Within Countries in Asia-Pacific have pursued modern reforms of their legal systems for a number of reasons, including to adapt to new national priorities, eliminate outdated statutes, conform to international commit- ments and respond to demands from citizens. Some reforms relate to gender equality, but progress is not always consistent or straight- forward. Over the years, national legal reforms have generally occurred in two ways: through legislative changes and judicial precedents. In South Asia, Sri Lanka\u2019s Penal Code of 1883 has undergone many amendments since 1995, taking into account some criminal offences and their adverse impacts on women in particular. To curb violence against women, the Code now includes provisions on sexual harassment, grave sexual abuse, incest, sexual exploitation of children and trafficking. In addition to these new legal provisions, it also imposes stiffer sentences now. In the case of rape, for instance, the minimum sentence increased from zero to seven years.32 Several East Asian countries have enacted laws against violence against women in the past few years.33 Cambodia, China and Viet Nam have reformed their land laws to confer equal rights to land titling. Viet Nam and the Philippines enacted the compre- hensive 2006 Law on Gender Equality and 2009 Magna Carta of Women respectively. These laws uphold women\u2019s rights in the public and private spheres.34 Indonesia reformed its discriminatory Citizenship Act in 2006 by conferring the right to pass on nationality to children irrespective of gender, marital status or spouse\u2019s nationality.35 In 2007, Nepal\u2019s Supreme Court, res- ponding to a coalition of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual and intersex groups, ordered the Government \u2018to formulate appropriate legis- lation or amend existing legislation\u2019 in order to end discrimination against these commu- nities.36 The following year, the first official identity card was issued describing a person as a \u2018third gender\u2019, instead of the usual male and female categories.37 Judicial precedents have advanced women\u2019s standing in Bangladesh, where the High Court gave a landmark judgment in a case in which female students of Jahangirnagar University challenged a sexual harassment inquiry set up by the university. The court ruled that the decision to exonerate the perpetrator and expel the female students was \u2018without lawful authority\u2019.38 The verdict sets a precedent that will deter future per- petrators. The court also expressed the opinion that rigid rules of corroboration are not always required to substantiate allega- tions of sexual harassment, highlighting an emerging progressive trend in the region. Precedents can also have negative impacts. In 2008 the Sri Lankan Supreme Court, in a rape case, concluded that the law setting a minimum mandatory sentence for rape was tantamount to interference with judicial discretion by the legislature. The court observed that a minimum sentencing guideline conflicts with the Constitution. It maintained its right to impose a sentence that it deems appropriate.39 The International Community Weighs In International agreements can be important reference points for gender equality. Countries in Asia-Pacific have proactively used them to Countries in Asia- Pacific have pursued modern reforms of their legal systems. Some reforms relate to gender equality, but progress is not always consistent or straightforward CHAPTER 4: ADVANCING LEGAL RIGHTS 119 improve their own domestic legislation. One of the most important agreements is the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). It offers a comprehensive framework for gender equality based on the principles of equality, non-discrimination and state obligation.40 Out of 39 countries in Asia-Pacific, 35 states have ratified or acceded to the Convention.41 But this signal of commitment to gender equality has not come without \u2018reservations\u2019\u2014a device that allows countries to opt out of certain parts of the Convention. The nature of reservations varies and is influenced by factors such as religion and national constitutions and laws (Figure 4.1).

To have teeth, they must be supported by widespread acceptance of their validity and vigorous implementation. At the same time, by introducing new concepts and reforms, laws can be an essential platform for progress towards gender equality. Looking at laws in terms of gender equality requires understanding both the overarching principles that guide legal systems\u2014normally expressed in constitu- tions\u2014and the framework of statutory provisions that then translate these principles into what most people experience as the rules that govern their lives. Three Principles should be Enshrined in Constitutions All legal systems draw on certain basic principles, both to create and implement laws. Looking at laws in terms of gender equality requires understanding both the overarching principles that guide legal systems and the framework of statutory provisions that then translate these principles into what most people experience as the rules that govern their lives CHAPTER 4: ADVANCING LEGAL RIGHTS 121 Malaysia is a country that can be justi- fiably proud of the achievements of her female citizens. Education is virtually free in government schools and most girls attend school and go on to higher education, resulting in a majority of the enrolment in universities being female. Many women work outside the home and some hold high posts in Govern- ment and the private sector, ranging from the Governor of the Central Bank to various corporate executives. Malaysia\u2019s population is multiethnic, multicultural and multi-religious, with Muslims forming the majority faith. Historically, when it comes to family laws governing marriage, divorce, cus- tody and inheritance, Muslims are sub- jected to syariah laws while civil laws govern the personal lives of non- Muslims. This has resulted in a dis- parity in the rights between the two groups, particularly for women. For instance, civil law has outlawed polygamy for non-Muslims while it is still allowed for Muslims. However even for Muslims, polygamists had to comply with several conditions that protect existing wives before they were allowed to take additional wives. Unfortunately these laws, considered the most pro- gressive in the world in the 1980s, have now been amended in a regressive direction, offering less protection for women than before. For instance, previously men intending to take on another wife had to obtain the written permission of his first wife but this requirement is now no longer necessary. Although the Federal Constitution was amended in 2001 to disallow discrimination on the basis of gender, there still remain vestiges of such discrimination especially for Muslim women. For example, it is still unclear whether Muslim women can now be guardians to their own children includ- ing the right to sign legal papers for them. Previously much hardship was caused by the need to have fathers\u2019 signatures on school registration forms, for instance. Muslim women seeking divorces and maintenance have had to suffer an inef- ficient and lackadaisical syariah court system, often leaving them impove- rished when husbands have neglected or simply refused to comply with court orders to provide for their children. Efforts to pursue these errant husbands have had some success but the majority of cases remain frustrated. As one female syariah lawyer ruefully re- marked, \u2018If I can get RM300 (less than US $100) a month for my client and her kids, I would consider that a success already\u2019. Part of the problem is Malaysia\u2019s federal system where Muslim religious issues are controlled by the individual 13 states and Federal Territory. This has resulted in discrepancies between the Muslim Family Laws in each state which has in turn allowed men to \u2018shop around\u2019 to find the most suitable laws to suit them. For instance, if the con- ditions for polygamy proved too difficult in one state, men have gotten married in another state with more lax laws, or eloped to southern Thailand. All he needs to do upon his return to his home state is to register the marriage and it will be considered valid. In recent years, efforts have been made to standardize these laws in all states to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34fc9038-01c8-46b9-8c0e-31a02c509e11": {"__data__": {"id_": "34fc9038-01c8-46b9-8c0e-31a02c509e11", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "02d4eebdc82987730d471cc8cbf8fc1a49d7894eb9b09dedf1ed0201ba4aa7b2"}, "3": {"node_id": "aca32387-c0bb-44fe-b2f3-793e424e731e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a752b862a50efc3a1c05ac9277371e2fce7e5b4db60e404cecae99d9ab86f7e"}}, "hash": "f99a3bf7fa32efe46e40a57a7a4bae9cd2bbbb0e8ef8f8d6e48cc6026258488d", "text": "prevent these abuses. Unfortu- nately the standardization has not resulted in a better deal for women when the result has been amendments to the laws that are detrimental to them. In 2006, the Federal Territory Islamic Family Law was passed through Parliament despite strong protests by women Senators in the Upper House and by many women\u2019s groups. Amend- ments made to the laws in the interests of \u2018gender-neutrality\u2019 resulted in many women\u2019s rights being given to men without reciprocal men\u2019s rights being also given to women. As an example, previously whatever assets a woman brought into a marriage remained hers and were not regarded as communal property to be divided equally in the event of a divorce. With the amendments, these assets are in- cluded in communal property resulting in men being able to freeze them upon dissolution pending division. However men\u2019s rights to polygamy or to pro- nounce divorce by using the right of \u2018talak\u2019 have not been given to women. The Federal Territory Islamic Law was not gazetted pending further discussions between the Attorney- General\u2019s Chambers, NGOs and reli- gious bodies to amend them to make them fairer to women. The FT laws provide the template for the other states; thus it is imperative that they are improved substantially so as not to discriminate against women. Apart from the laws, society\u2019s attitudes towards women have not changed despite the many advances that Malaysian Muslim women have enjoyed. Their roles as wife and mother still remain the primary expectation of most women, and \u2018failure\u2019 to play these roles \u2018adequately\u2019 sometimes result in vio- lence. Despite the passing of the Domestic Violence Act in 1996, Muslim women still face obstacles ranging from husbands who believe their religion gives them the right to beat their wives, to uncooperative police when women complain. Groups like Sisters in Islam, a women\u2019s group that has been fighting for justice and equality for Muslim women for 20 years, have had some success countering these beliefs by providing alternative interpretations of the Quran. Having the Domestic Violence Act has also helped to highlight the right of women not to be abused by their husbands or other relatives. One example of the patriarchal atti- tudes towards women, especially Muslim women, is the mandatory premarital HIV testing for all Muslim couples. Although it is touted as one that would help prevent women from getting SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION CAUGHT IN BETWEEN: THE DILEMMA OF MUSLIM WOMEN IN MALAYSIA Marina Mahathir ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 122 Three principles outlined by CEDAW are par- ticularly relevant to gender equality and have been articulated in most of Asia-Pacific cons- titutions: these are State obligation, the prin- ciple of equality and non-discrimination.53 State obligation may be legally defined but is also a matter of political commitment and philosophy. It is premised on the notion that the state should be an architect in eliminating gender discrimination, in law and legal practices, rather than leaving it solely up to free market forces, for example, or the less predictable process of social change over time. From the standpoint of jurisprudence, there are three main legal approaches to gender equality: traditional, protectionist and corrective.54 Each has repercussions for what gender equality means and how it is attained. The traditional approach has been one of \u2018treating likes alike.\u2019 This is based on the sameness principle and \u2018equal treatment\u2019 and ignores the gender differences between men and women. But this notion needs to be examined against the backdrop of gender discrimination\u2014not for every issue, but for many. Women start from a different place than men facing different social, economic, political and institutional obstacles to acquiring rights and capabilities. Aside from the many instances of laws in the region that still overtly discriminate against women, women have less education to understand the law and fewer resources for expensive court battles, to cite only two obvious examples. In many cases, even with \u2018neutral\u2019 laws in place, courts view women through the prism of gender stereotypes and render judgments accordingly. The protectionist approach to gender equality recognizes differences between men and women and reinforces them by sanctioning different treatment. It is based on the notion of \u2018likes are to be treated alike.\u2019 It takes note of biological difference, but relies on social assumptions as a standard for the roles and capacities attached to men and women.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aca32387-c0bb-44fe-b2f3-793e424e731e": {"__data__": {"id_": "aca32387-c0bb-44fe-b2f3-793e424e731e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "02d4eebdc82987730d471cc8cbf8fc1a49d7894eb9b09dedf1ed0201ba4aa7b2"}, "2": {"node_id": "34fc9038-01c8-46b9-8c0e-31a02c509e11", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f99a3bf7fa32efe46e40a57a7a4bae9cd2bbbb0e8ef8f8d6e48cc6026258488d"}}, "hash": "2a752b862a50efc3a1c05ac9277371e2fce7e5b4db60e404cecae99d9ab86f7e", "text": "The corrective approach recognizes that women were historically disadvantaged, and that corrective measures must be taken in order to end discrimination.

This principle also includes indirect discrimination, which operates from assumptions that men and women already have equal opportunities, when in fact they do not. One place for establishing these principles in national legal systems is the constitution, as the supreme law of the land and the basis for securing rights. Constitutions may also maintain discrimination (Box 4.1). Most East Asian countries prohibit discrimination on the grounds of sex and mention equality in their constitutions. South Asian countries infected, there has been no evidence that it has worked, nor does it empower women to protect themselves. Indeed it has not stopped women from becoming infected by their husbands later in their marriage after having had several chil- dren. A study in Kota Bharu, Kelantan state among 300 HIV-positive widows showed that many of them married drug users without knowing their vulner- ability to HIV and subsequently became infected after several years of marriage. Their AIDS widowhood brought on the additional hardship of stigma and discrimination on top of poverty. Some of them remarried HIV-negative men but could not convince their new husbands to use condoms out of fear of being left once again, so great was their dependency on these men. Efforts to prevent women, Muslim or not, from infection must hinge on an overall change in attitudes towards women. Laws that are non-discriminatory help as well as greater understanding that sexist beliefs do not have any basis in religion. Thus the work by women\u2019s groups such as Sisters in Islam is highly important in providing alternative interpretations of the Quran that rein- force the equality of women to men. Marina Mahathir is an HIV/AIDS and women\u2019s rights activist, writer and blogger. She led the Malaysian AIDS Council for 12 years, has written several books and is a newspaper columnist and the executive producer of a TV pro- gramme for young women, 3R\u2014Respect, Relax and Respond. There are three main legal approaches on gender equality: traditional, protectionist and corrective. Each has repercussions for what gender equality means and how it is attained CHAPTER 4: ADVANCING LEGAL RIGHTS 123 also provide general constitutional guarantees of equality and non-discrimination for various groups, including women. With the exception of Nepal, however, they refer to the biological definition of sex, rather than the broader definition of gender, which includes socialized roles and behaviours.55 Discrimi- nation is not defined, and the prohibition mostly applies to the state, excluding the growing private sector. This lack of constitutional definition gives laws and court systems wide latitude in interpretation, including in ways that can perpetuate discrimination. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam have gone further in defining the specifics of gender equality and non- discrimination in their constitutions. Both have consequently been able to assign penalties for discriminatory acts through legal provisions.56 In 2001, Malaysia added the word \u2018gender\u2019 to a constitutional provi- sion against discrimination that includes religion, race, descent and place of birth. This seemingly simple change prompted a broad review of all legislation, including laws on domestic violence, marriage and divorce, and land ownership.57 While there is still no clear definition of \u2018discrimination against women\u2019 in Malaysian law, the change has eliminated any legal argument that gender-based dis- crimination, unlike other forms of discri- mination that had been mentioned, is permissible. A cautionary tale related to legal principles comes from Vanuatu, reflecting some of the legal practice issues delved into later in this chapter. The Penal Code there makes unlawful discrimination a criminal offence, an unusual provision in the Pacific.58 But no one has ever been prosecuted in Vanuatu for a breach of this section, despite the high level of sex discrimination against ni-Vanuatu women in both conventional and kustom law systems. A clear example of how legal systems in Asia-Pacific stray from the principles of equality and non-discrimination is in nationality rights, part of the foundation of citizenship itself. Based on the conventional idea that men are the head of the family and everything should flow through them, many Asia-Pacific governments deny female citizens the right to determine the nationality of children born to a foreign spouse. Foreign spouses of women do not have the right to obtain citizenship. Male citizens do not face similar constraints. Pakistan has amended discriminatory laws to allow women married to foreign nationals to determine the nationality of their children.59 In South East Asia, only Viet Nam grants mothers the right to determine the nationality of their children.

In this case, pension funds were paid to the father of the deceased, rather than to the deceased\u2019s widow. The father then distributed the funds at his discretion, giving nothing to the widow. The court ruled that this was in accordance with the relevant custom, where inheritance was by patrilineal succession. The widow could not object on the ground that the custom was discriminatory, as the Constitution specifically exempts custom law from the general prohibition on discriminatory laws. The result of this decision has a long-term impact on widows, whose only source of income following the death of a \u2018breadwinner\u2019 may be their pension funds.

A clear example of how legal systems in Asia-Pacific stray from the principles of equality and non- discrimination is in nationality rights ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 124 and gender equality. These may be invisible or dismissed as insignificant. Gaps also occur when the law does not anticipate attitudes within the justice system or larger society that ensure a statute will not be fully enacted. An area in Asia-Pacific where gaps in laws are wide and longstanding is violence against women. This is despite the mounting evidence of the prevalence of different forms of violence, including domestic abuse, rape, trafficking, harmful traditions such as honour killings, sex-selective abortions and biases in the distribution of food that cause disproportionately high rates of malnutrition among girls in some countries. A groundbreaking 2006 global study on violence against women by the United Nations Secretary-General compared national surveys on one form of violence: the prevalence of physical assaults on women by their male partners. Prevalence rates in Papua New Guinea were among the highest in the world at 67 per cent61; the incidence in Bangladesh crossed 47 per cent in multiple surveys; in Viet Nam the figure was 25 per cent. The Philippines had the lowest prevalence rate in Asia-Pacific at 10 per cent.62 The report suggests that domestic violence extracts billions of dollars from national economies each year, in part through greater burdens on health care systems. A World Bank study has estimated that five per cent of the disease burden for women aged 15 to 44 in deve- loping countries arises comes from domestic violence and rape alone.63 Laws in Asia-Pacific have been slow in catching up to this reality. In South Asia, nearly half of the countries have no law on domestic violence; in the Pacific the situation is even worse, with more than 60 per cent of the countries without relevant legislation. In East Asia, meanwhile, more than three- fourths of the countries have drafted legislation on domestic abuse, some within the past few years including Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Republic of Korea, Thailand and Viet Nam. This testifies to a positive change there in tackling violence against women.64 In many instances countries lack sanc- tions for gender-based violence or narrowly define the circumstances under which it may take place. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, for example, mentions domestic violence in its 2004 Law on the Development and Protection of Women, but stops short of suggesting it be penalized.65 In case \u2018violence is not serious\u2019, the law insists upon mediation through family members, close relatives or a village mediation unit rather than prosecution of the perpetrator.66 Its Penal Code 1990 defines rape as involving force, drugs or other means to make women unconscious for the purpose of rape.67 This implies that a con- scious woman could not be raped. Viet Nam\u2019s Penal Code considers a women\u2019s ability to defend herself\u2014not the issue of whether or not she has given consent. Prior sexual con- duct can be used to establish \u2018consent\u2019.68 Across Asia-Pacific, sexual assault laws remain focused on the limited definition of penile penetration, rather than other forms of sexual assault. Most Asia-Pacific countries have little to offer in legislation on sexual harassment at work places, despite surveys suggesting that 30 to 40 per cent of women workers report some form of harassment \u2013 verbal, physical or sexual.69 Cambodia, the Philippines and Thailand have laws against sexual harass-", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8f5c273-6640-4915-bd2b-f0474820797e": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8f5c273-6640-4915-bd2b-f0474820797e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56bb69144eda5a2034c5d32420a81f4357d2baab271f47624871a921fc589042"}}, "hash": "56bb69144eda5a2034c5d32420a81f4357d2baab271f47624871a921fc589042", "text": "ment\u2014although these provisions have limita- tions on their definitions of abuse. In the Philippines, supervisors, employers and managers with \u2018authority and influence\u2019 are penalized for acts of harassment in the workplace but the law remains silent on sexual abuses committed by co-workers.70 Even in countries such as India where there has been a strong labour movement, unions have not taken this issue seriously. Under- standing is emerging only slowly in the region, An area in Asia- Pacific where gaps in laws are wide and longstanding is violence against women CHAPTER 4: ADVANCING LEGAL RIGHTS 125 despite the growing number of women in the paid workforce.71 Maternity leave is another area of emp- loyment legislation where the law seems to be inadequate, including in terms of providing paternity leave for men. Most South Asian countries allow maternity leave, but the con- cept of paternity leave has been introduced in India only in central government employment. In East Asia, only a few countries have pro- visions for paternity leave. Malaysia and the Philippines grant seven days to fathers of newborns.72 In the Pacific, most countries and territories provide for paid maternity leave in varying degrees to female civil servants, but not to women working in the private sector. None of the nine countries examined by the CEDAW legislative (de jure) indicators study in the Pacific met the standard of 14 weeks of paid maternity leave recommended by the Convention.73 The ILO\u2019s C183 Maternity Protection Convention 2000 also specifies that maternity leave should be not less than 14 weeks.74 Some countries are making progress to bridge legal gaps that allow discrimination against women. The 2002 Acid Attacks Crime Repression Act and Acid Control Act in Bangladesh aims to stop the practice of disfiguring women by throwing acid on them; it goes so far as to provide for the death penalty for perpetrators.75 A legal milestone in India was the 2005 Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. It recognizes physical abuse, mental abuse, sexual abuse and economic abuse as forms of violence, and acknowledges the concept of the shared household. Regard- less of marital status or the application of different communal family laws, women can secure protective orders and file cases against defendants in the same residence.76 Contradictions Produce Discrimination Contradictions in laws commonly arise when constitutions offer loosely defined promises of gender equality or non-discrimination that open the door to inconsistencies in laws and legal practices. China\u2019s Constitution stipu- lates that men and women should enjoy equal rights in all spheres of life but does not clearly define discrimination.77 It lacks specific legal provisions on many issues integral to achiev- ing gender equality, such as a guarantee of equal pay for equal work despite a persistent wage gap.78 In the Pacific, the principle of equality for women is not firmly embedded in most constitutions, even though some outlaw discrimination. Virtually all constitutions state that the constitution is the supreme law but recognize customary laws.79 At the same time, it is unclear whether the con- stitution or the customary laws should take precedence when they conflict, and no country has standalone, comprehensive anti- discrimination legislation. Some Pacific constitutions allow exceptions to the prin- ciple of non-discrimination for customary laws.80 This means that even though state legislation derived from the constitution may not discriminate against women, custo- mary forms of discrimination still legally take place. Discriminatory laws are often justified as stemming from gender differences. Some- times this is the case with protective labour legislation that attempts to steer women away from jobs deemed unsafe for them. Certain laws may genuinely warrant this kind of thinking\u2014maternity leave, for example, recognizes the sheer physical reality that women alone go through in giving birth and nursing. But too many others simply deprive individuals of rights, opportunities and choices based on their gender. Some are unconscious holdovers from the past; others reinforce ongoing gender stereotypes about a woman\u2019s physical or mental ability, or simply her capability to work outside the domestic sphere. A number of Pacific countries and territories restrict women\u2019s employment Contradictions in laws commonly arise when constitutions offer loosely defined promises of gender equality or non- discrimination that open the door to inconsistencies in laws and legal practices ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 126 choices by banning them from night work and industries such as mining.

The Bangladesh Supreme Court, in the case of Dalia Parveen vs. Bangladesh Biman Corpora- tion struck down a rule that allowed the travel industry to prefer young attractive women.85 Although the Fiji Ministry for Employment still has discretion to limit the types of work that women do, it removed restrictions from legislation some years ago in response to lobbying from women\u2019s organi- zations.86 Discriminatory notions about sexuality and gender roles persist in some legal systems (Box 4.2). India\u2019s 1860 Penal Code treats adulterous acts by men and women diffe- rently. Section 497 criminalizes adultery by a man with the wife of another man \u2018without his consent\u2019. But it does not penalize adultery committed by a married man with an unmar- ried woman, a widow or a married woman when her husband consents to it. In an example of how sexual assault laws can discriminate against men and boys, India treats non-consensual anal sex as an offence \u2018against the order of nature\u2019, not as rape, including when it happens to young boys.87 While many injustices against women in the areas of land rights and inheritance are perpetrated more as a matter of custom than law, as discussed in Chapter 2, discrimi- natory statutes are at work as well in some countries. In Tonga, the 1875 Constitution and 1927 Land Act established that the eldest male of the male line is preferred over others and women in inheritance. If a woman\u2019s husband dies, she does not have an automatic right to live on her husband\u2019s land. She can remain until she dies, remarries or \u2018fornicates\u2019. This means that once a widow has sexual relations with another man, she loses her right to live in her home.88 Among indigenous peoples in the region, women are the most vulnerable and face discrimination in terms of gender, geographi- cal remoteness and often poverty as well. Legal discrimination against them is often two-pronged: Gender biases within the custo- mary personal laws and formal laws that marginalize women. Customary inheritance laws tend to be openly discriminatory, such as by preventing women from claiming paternal property as a matter of right; only sons can do so.89 At times more progressive customs run into discriminatory formal laws. In Indonesia indigenous women are BOX 4.2 ERASING SOME FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION, NOT OTHERS IN THE PHILIPPINES The Philippines provides an example of how countries can have a mixed record of both retaining and removing discriminatory statutes. Articles 333 and 334 of the Revised Penal Code 1930 in the Philippines define sexual infidelity differently for men and women, for instance. A wife is criminally liable for adultery with a man who is not her husband. On the other hand, a husband\u2019s adulterous act with a woman not his wife is not a crime. The husband can be criminally liable for the crime of \u2018concubinage\u2019 only if he is caught with another woman \u2018under scandalous circumstances\u2019 or when he cohabits with another woman in the conjugal dwelling or in any other place. A bill is under consideration to amend articles 333 and 334 of the Philippines Penal Code. The Philippines has moved forward in its rape laws through the 1997 Anti-Rape Act, which reclassified rape from a crime against chastity to the far more serious charge of a crime against a person. The Rape Victim Assistance and Protection Act followed the next year, mandating the establishment of a Rape Crisis Center in every province and city in the country, providing standard government services for all rape survivors, and prescribing rules to be followed in the investigation of rape cases.

Different com- munities follow their own personal laws, which are mainly influenced by religion. Family, property and inheritance laws are among those most prone to following diverse legal paths. This lack of standardization explains in part why Asia has more reser- vations to CEDAW related to \u2018compatibility with traditional codes\u2019 than any other region in the world. By comparison, Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, along with Latin America have no reservations on these grounds.92 In Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, marriage and divorce laws twist and turn through the requirements of Hindu, Muslim and Christian communities. In India, people from these communities may be married under their community law, under an optional civil law or under the Special Marriages Act for inter-religious marriages. One unfortunate aspect of the Act is the requirement for a one to three month notice in the office of the marriage registrar. This allows radical religious organizations to track these notices and then harass the families, particularly if the marriages involve people from different castes or religions.93 Divorce regulations in South Asia also vary by community. The Islamic triple talaq, where the divorce is complete by pronouncing the word talaq three times in the presence of two witnesses, is practised in Muslim com- munities in Afghanistan, India, Islamic Republic of Iran, Nepal and Sri Lanka.94 Bangladesh and Pakistan have banned this procedure in favour of legal processes that stress reconciliation.95 Because post-divorce maintenance laws for Muslims are also influenced by Islamic traditions, a woman may not be entitled to maintenance beyond the conventional three-month period of Iddat or, if she is pregnant, until the birth of her child (Box 4.3). The law of divorce for Hindus in India is based on matrimonial wrongs, where the spouse who seeks divorce has to prove cruelty, adultery, desertion or other grounds listed in the statute.96 Christian men can seek divorce on the grounds of adultery or other reasons; Christian women can only file based on adultery. Hindus in Bangladesh and Pakistan cannot obtain divorces since they are BOX 4.3 SUCCUMBING TO COMMUNAL PRESSURE IN INDIA Discussions on the rights of different communities in diverse societies, while valid in principle, have often taken on political overtones that overshadow concerns about women\u2019s rights and welfare. In India, under the Code of Criminal Procedure, wives of all religions used to be entitled to maintenance as part of divorce. A Muslim husband challenged the constitutional validity of this provision, arguing that it is anti-Islamic. The Supreme Court dismissed his case, sparking communal tensions. The Government then passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act 1986. The Act restricted maintenance to Muslim women through the period of Iddat. The law stipulates that a former husband is required to give \u2018a reasonable and fair provision, and maintenance\u2019 to his ex-wife within the Iddat period. In a separate case of maintenance in 2001, the Supreme Court held that at the time of divorce, a Muslim husband is required to contemplate the future needs for the entire life of the divorced wife, and make preparatory arrangements in advance for meeting them. This judicial precedent, however, is not always followed in practice. Note: Iddat implies a specified period of time that must elapse before a Muslims widow or divorcee may legitimately remarry.

In Fiji, some 27 per cent of Muslims enter religious marriages that are not technically legal. Women then do not have legal protections on issues such as divorce, property and custody of children.99 Access to Justice Depends on Gender Globally, four billion people\u2014most of the world\u2019s population\u2014are excluded from the rule of law.100 This figure covers a significant number of women in Asia-Pacific, even in countries where laws are relatively sound (Figures 4.2 and 4.3). Specific barriers, rooted in gender, prevent women from getting to court or other judicial mechanisms, or finding fair judgments once they are there. This propensity worsens when the laws themselves ignore or discriminate against women, as described in the previous section. Effective justice systems are particularly critical when power is imbalanced, and people with a weaker voice and fewer options for recourse\u2014like women\u2014have limited options for redress. Women are often more vulnerable to injustice to start, and more in need of measures to protect their legal rights. Impoverished women carry an additional burden. The extra powerlessness of poverty makes them even more prone to criminal and human rights violations, and more likely to fall further into poverty through the lack of redress. They may also not be able to use justice mechanisms as tools to overcome deprivation due to the costs of litigation and their greater likelihood of being illiterate and lacking legal awareness.101 These tendencies, which can be found in many parts of Asia-Pacific, are bad for women. But they also weaken state account- ability and erode public faith in the value of Figure 4.2: Women Face Deep Discrimination in Economic Rights Figure 4.2: Women Face Deep Discrimination in Economic Rights Figure 4.2: Women Face Deep Discrimination in Economic Rights Figure 4.2: Women Face Deep Discrimination in Economic Rights Note: The figure classifies regional groups as cited in UNIFEM 2008.

The percentage of countries with high economic or social discrimination edged upward across Asia and the Pacific (Figures 4.2 and 4.3).102 In East Asia and the Pacific, the percentage of countries with high economic discrimination increased from zero in 2004 to over seven per cent in 2007, while the percentage of countries with medium to high levels of discrimination remained as high as 59 per cent in 2007, declining slightly from 63 per cent in 2004. In South Asia, the share of countries with high economic discrimination increased from 33 per cent to 44 per cent during the same period. A decline in medium levels of discrimination can be attributed to some countries climbing from the medium to high level of economic discrimination.

Sometimes social conventions dictate that women should not leave their homes or travel or be active in public spheres. Women are responsible for a disproportionate share of household tasks, which means they may be less able than men to take time for complicated legal processes and repeated meetings with lawyers. If they work for wages, they will generally be paid less than men and confront poorer working conditions. This, in turn, likewise reduces the affordability and raises the risks of spending time on legal matters. Women may face physical threats, inclu- ding violence, if pursuing a legal remedy involves challenging their husbands, other family members, or the broader status quo. They may fear losing children or economic sustenance. Internalized discriminatory norms require women to suffer in silence, and define them as being less and deserving less.103 Information from Cambodia illustrates why many women never access justice systems.

Those who do report these crimes could confront beliefs that violence is a private issue and a prerogative of men. Over 60 per cent of local officials and police tend to believe that a husband can threaten his wife with a weapon when she questions him. Nearly a third of men maintain that different forms of violence are appropriate at times in their marriages.107 A few countries have taken steps to make judicial mechanisms more accessible to women. India has moved forward on stopping sexual harassment by requiring workplaces that employ women to set up commissions that are at least 50 per cent female to receive and act on complaints of sexual harassment.108 Malaysia has pio- neered one-stop centres in hospitals that provide easy access to medical care, social services and specially trained police units for victims of domestic or sexual violence.109 Justice Systems Fail to Deliver Women across Asia-Pacific who do find the means to turn to judicial mechanisms to resolve disputes\u2014whether state courts, the police, lawyers or local resources\u2014still face obstacles. Judicial practices are also subject to discriminatory social norms that do not acknowledge women\u2019s rights or concerns, or treat them seriously or fairly. For women, the lofty provisions for equality in many of the region\u2019s constitutions, while important in their own right, have little bearing on the ways in which justice is actually meted out. Legal complexities that require onerous court proceedings represent one reason why women fail to obtain justice. Beyond the fact that men\u2019s reasons for divorce are often taken more seriously than women\u2019s, most countries in Asia-Pacific have a fault-based divorce system. This requires a process of proving charges such as adultery, desertion for a required number of years, wilful refusal to consummate the marriage, habitual cruelty, and so on.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2fd60b06-3507-4bbc-85dc-9ffd97229102": {"__data__": {"id_": "2fd60b06-3507-4bbc-85dc-9ffd97229102", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "22cbe2fb212679af5da3cce1bae54b38641c32b989860d50e9ab01ed33a99249"}, "2": {"node_id": "bcc30eb9-f013-4b08-9cb6-5ecdcc943f24", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff1591f9678fcfdf0936f565e1c40a531c9af2717142d9e921afb294451c1ee2"}}, "hash": "6b24ae892df8f5fe69d81a571a3ef86a5cb764a8044cb5de5db8efd58c1f5837", "text": "The parties must hire lawyers, file court cases and bring witnesses to court to provide supporting evidence\u2014a tremendous burden particularly for poor and rural women.

Women typically start out at a financial disadvantage because they have less education and access to jobs and assets, or have been economically dependent on the men they want to divorce. These hindrances also appear in and are compounded by the unfair distribution of matrimonial property and establishment of maintenance awards. Maintenance is often based on actual financial contributions to family resources, ignoring women\u2019s long hours of unpaid household work and work in the informal cash economy. In late 2008, a court in Fiji, drawing on a new law on the more equal division of property, finally took into account domestic contributions and awarded a wife of 37 years half the marital assets.110 In the Pacific, only Fiji specifies comprehensive guidelines on the amount of maintenance, most other court systems award grossly inadequate amounts of maintenance. Stereotypes around women\u2019s Legal complexities that require onerous court proceedings represent one reason why women fail to obtain justice CHAPTER 4: ADVANCING LEGAL RIGHTS 131 sexuality have led to some cases of reversing maintenance or child custody decisions in women\u2019s favour due to the impression of \u2018loose\u2019 or \u2018immoral\u2019 behaviour.111 Court systems continue to carry out procedural indignities that can leave women doubly victimized. While more countries in the region are moving to non- public trials for sensitive issues such as rape and domestic violence, women may still be expected to narrate their experi- ences in great detail, including to male personnel in cultures with strong taboos against public discussion of sexual acts. Many trial courts in India still insist on archaic tests for proof of rape or raise the issue of whether or not she follows a promiscuous lifestyle.112 Discriminatory rules for trial procedures and evidence diminish or distort women\u2019s voice in court in a number of Asia-Pacific countries. In Pakistan the value of a woman\u2019s testimony in court is considered half that of a man\u2019s in financial matters and future obligations under Qanoon-e-Shahdat Order 1984.113 Many Pacific Island countries and territories continue to require proof of resistance in sexual assault cases and/or allow the admission of past sexual history. These requirements discourage rape victims from reporting this crime, on top of the already heavy social sanctions against speaking out against it, and a personal reluctance to possibly re-live the experience through a trial. One of the most obvious ways in which courts fail women is when they are reluctant to uphold judgments or pursue crimes against women (Box 4.4). This tendency appears in a lack of human and financial resources for enforcement; a lack of sanctions against judicial personnel who make overtly biased decisions, including those who unnecessarily stretch or even contradict the law; and the absence of training for police and court officials on gender and the specifics of gender- based crimes. In Fiji, before enforcement mechanisms were tightened for maintenance payments after divorce, 50 per cent of main- tenance awards were not paid or enforced, a further 35 per cent of orders were enforced only intermittently and just 15 per cent of fathers paid maintenance regularly under orders.114 On crimes involving gender-based vio- lence, in addition to the lack of effective legislation in Asia-Pacific, there is an unwill- ingness to exercise powers of arrest, file charges and pursue criminal prosecutions. Because the cases are considered low prio- rity, less-experienced judicial personnel are assigned to them. Untrained police and court personnel may rely more on stereotypes than on current knowledge of why gender-based violence occurs and the serious damage it can inflict. In the Pacific, non-molestation, protective orders or injunctions are generally available for people threatened by violence, but without the legislative basis for providing such protection in cases of domestic violence. The courts exercise their discretionary power sparingly and inconsistently. Only married women, and not de facto wives or girlfriends, may be entitled to seek orders.

T maintained that he was so intoxicated that he did not know what he was doing, that he had apologized for his actions and had later reconciled with his wife.

Discriminatory rules for trial procedures and evidence diminish or distort women\u2019s voice in court in a number of Asia-Pacific countries ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 132 are granted and disobeyed, the police habi- tually do not enforce them through imprison- ment, because the orders are vague and no laws set out clear guidelines. Imprisonment requires lengthy and complex contempt of court proceedings. Given that domestic vio- lence is not high on the police list of priorities, the perpetrator is usually summoned to the police station or court, reprimanded and allowed to leave. Pacific courts rarely award prison sen- tences that reflect the seriousness of domestic violence as a crime, despite the fact that it can be a repeated, habitual offence. They tend to give probationary orders that command the offender not to commit another crime for a specified period. If the offender does commit the crime again, he will be punished for the original crime. This is in effect a \u2018keep the peace\u2019 order. In practice, courts usually refuse to imprison a male breadwinner even when a further crime is committed. Many examples of bias in judicial systems arise from unconscious or unquestioned assumptions, some of which can be corrected through training and stricter laws and proce- dures. But there are also cases of extreme judicial injustice where the legal system is deliberately used to harm women. Courts in India and Sri Lanka have also allowed the defense of \u2018grave and sudden provocation\u2019 to continue as a hangover from common law.115 Such a defence mitigates the heinous nature of crimes such as murder. Despite an amendment in the Pakistan Penal Code, the mitigation of sentences for the so-called honour killings has continued unabated.116 Running away from home is not a crime in Afghanistan. But many girls and women are in prison, some for as long as 10 years now, for having done so.117 Biases Remain in Customary Justice Systems Some countries retain customary or commu- nity dispute mechanisms that operate in parallel with the national court system. These include traditional customary justice and alternate dispute resolution systems. They may function independently or be connected to the state courts (Box 4.5). They have some value in bringing justice closer to people, being less expensive and time-consuming, and in enforcing decisions quickly through commu- nity consent. The Musalihat Anjuman system in Pakistan, constituted under the 2001 Local Government Ordinance, resolves conflicts through arbitration and mediation. It encou- rages parties to identify issues, explore areas of compromize and generate options to resolve the dispute amicably.118 But unless mechanisms likes these func- tion in communities where equality is valued and women already have a strong voice, they are prone to upholding social conventions that discriminate against women or other less powerful groups. In India, community justice mechanisms connected to caste have carried out violent sentences against members of Dalit communities for crimes such as marry- ing someone from another community.119 BOX 4.5 MOBILE COURTS PRODUCE INNOVATIVE LEGAL PRACTICES Lacking enough qualified legal personnel to serve all parts of Afghanistan, the Government has introduced the concept of mobile courts as a possible solution to the problems of accessibility and security. Teams of experienced judges, prosecutors, lawyers and administrative officials make periodic visits to places that are too remote, insecure or small to have permanent staffing. Mobile courts are also active in Bangladesh, China, India and Indonesia. In India, at least two states have founded mobile courts\u2014 buses complete with computers, records and seating that are stationed in remote towns on a rotating basis. In Indonesia, mobile courts were used in the wake of the 2004 tsunami, which destroyed the state\u2019s capacity to deal with routine tasks like land ownership claims. In China, mobile courts are increasingly being deployed to improve access to the formal justice system in rural areas For mobile courts and other alternative dispute mechanisms to be effective on gender issues, they must be able to imaginatively resolve disputes, while being located firmly in constitutional provisions and rights. If they are used mainly because the formal system is overburdened, the focus can shift to the case disposal rate and other statistics, rather the effectiveness of justice.

They may decide petty matters, such as disputes over lost livestock. But they can also weigh in on serious issues such as adultery and murder. The jirga system that operates in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan, and the shalishi (mediation) system in rural Bangladesh are informal dispute resolution mechanisms that make decisions by consensus and impose punishments.121 Supporters of the jirga emphasize that it is more accessible to women than formal systems because it allows women to remain within their communities, since venturing outside to seek formal justice can be stigmatized as immodest. But jirga deci- sions are prone to gender bias, in part because so few women participate in them. According to a sample survey in 2007 conducted by the Afghan Centre for Socio-economic and Opinion Research, women comprised only two per cent of representatives on local jirgas. Elderly men constituted 65 per cent of the membership. Other members included mullahs, local leaders and commanders.122 Not Enough Women Serve in the Justice System Both men and women judicial officials can be advocates for gender equality within judicial systems, particularly if they have been trained to understand gender issues and how they affect the course of justice. That said, some evidence also suggests that increasing the number of women judicial officials improves women\u2019s access to justice. Women, through life experience, may be more aware of the specific problems other women face, helping them to clearly see the ways that laws and legal procedures conventionally overlook or overtly endorse gender discrimination. In Asia and the Pacific, the level of women\u2019s representation in justice systems remains low on average. In the Philippines, about 30 per cent of the judges in High Courts and the Supreme Court are women, a rela- tively progressive record. But India and Pakistan have only eight per cent and three per cent, respectively, in their higher courts.123 Globally, gender stereotypes have im- peded the progress of women in policing and played an unfortunate role in devaluing their work.124 Women police officers comprise from 2.2 to 19.1 per cent of police forces in parts of Asia-Pacific where data is avail- able.125 In Bhutan, the 1980 Police Act restricts women officers to investigating cases involving women, handling female prisoners or directing traffic.126 In India, the state of Tamil Nadu has become a frontrunner in recruiting women for the police. In 1997, the state took advantage of a labour law requirement to ensure that 33 per cent of new recruits were women. This has increased the overall level of represen- tation to 9.6 per cent, compared to a national average of 3.5 per cent in 2003. The introduction of 188 All-Women Police Units in the past few years, covering both rural and urban jurisdictions, has given women police more visibility. The units were set up to deal with crimes against women, including violence related to dowry problems, family disputes, marital problems, false promises of marriage, sexual assaults and rape. Increa- sing numbers of women now feel confi- dent in approaching them for help with domestic disputes, and they have inspired some younger women to seek careers in policing.127 Police forces in Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines and Sri Lanka have created women\u2019s units to open up opportunities for women to serve in the police, as well as to deal with the increased numbers of domestic violence cases now being reported.128 In Asia and the Pacific, the level of women\u2019s represen- tation in justice systems remains low on average ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 134 Taking Action: Enforcing Rights, Correcting Wrongs The law is meant to protect, but it can also empower, unleashing the full capacities of men and women to exercise choice and build on opportunities to achieve equality and fuel human development.

Achieve Inclusiveness Through Dynamic Reforms Legal reforms aimed at gender equality can address the substance and structures of the laws\u2014meaning the ways they are written and the judicial practices and institutions designed to uphold them\u2014as well as the surrounding social norms that feed into them (Table 4.1). Examples of reform include changes in the law, legal literacy campaigns, judicial training, community outreach, free legal aid and childcare services that allow people with domestic responsibilities to go to court. Reform choices are shaped by national priorities and needs, political opportunities and the demands of citizens and can be as much about advocacy and political positioning as about the technicalities of legal review. Some typical entry points include the following: International norms. International instru- ments such as CEDAW, the Beijing Declara- tion and Platform for Action, the ILO\u2019s Migrant Workers Convention, and the UN MDGs are useful global norms on gender equality. Many countries have used CEDAW to reform their civil and criminal laws. The effectiveness of national legal reforms, legisla- tive and judicial, can be further enhanced by aligning state laws with international stan- dards on gender equality. Constitutional provisions. When the principles of gender equality, non-discrimination and state obligation are well defined and set in the constitution, they can be used to challenge any form of gender discrimination on constitutional grounds, including those in laws and legal practices. Specific laws. Formal and customary laws and practices may be overtly discriminatory, full of gaps or contradictory. Those causing direct and immediate harm deserve priority. Gender equality laws can also be considered as part of general development strategies, such as to reduce poverty through updated employment and social protection laws. Economic barriers that limit access to justice need to be progressively removed. Judicial practices. Because the intent behind good laws can be defeated by discriminatory judicial practices, reform measures might combine training for court personnel and police with measured guidelines for handling steps from filing cases to interpreting laws. Progressive interpretation of religious texts. Liberal interpretation of religious texts is needed to reduce discrimination against women. Some countries are moving in the right direction.

If people do not uphold laws because they contradict longstanding social conventions that negatively affect women, advocacy and social mobilization campaigns can persuade people of the value of thinking in new ways and complying with the law. Because both gender equality and the law are complex, one critical aspect of building informed public opinion needs to be initial in- depth analysis. Examining the legal system requires looking within and beyond it. This might involve mapping the different elements in the law, legal practice and society that deepen or alleviate gender inequalities, and understanding how they intersect and reinforce each other and where discrimina- tory knots need to be untangled. Employment guarantees may be desirable, for example, but will they be minimized by the stiff competi- tion for jobs and the pressure to work despite harsh conditions? Market forces might close wage gaps over the long term, but what if employers refuse to hire women who might take maternity leave? If these factors are in play, how can the law be constructed and implemented to counter them? In most cases, changing legal and gender norms are long-term processes. Great tenacity, deliberation and a combination of political and people skills may be necessary, as well as strategic partnerships between people in civil society and government. Throughout, discri- mination and inequality need to be under- stood not just in terms of what is written on paper, but what is actually happening in Contd...

Note: Three main elements of the law that determine strategies to address discrimination against women include the substance of the law (legislation, common law, customary law, legal practices, and procedures and rules); the structures that implement the law (courts, court administration and law enforcement agencies); and cultural norms that influence justice (social conditions, economic conditions and attitudes of law enforcement agencies, judges, magistrates, court officials, police and the community).

The recognition that women face diffe- rent social pressures and expectations, have fewer economic resources and project a less prominent political voice can be considered in light of immediate steps for redress, such as laws for quota systems as discussed in Chapter 3. This can also be part of the ongoing process of examining and accommodating differences to maintain genuinely equal access to justice. Some of the more dynamic legal reforms in the region have embraced the notions of inclusiveness and engagement.

In Fiji women politicians and NGOs worked for 13 years, despite political instabi- lity and staunch opposition, to pass the Family Law Act 2003. Conservative churches and political actors fought the bill as threaten- ing Fijian values with same-sex marriages and no-fault divorce. Supporters of the bill worked inside and outside the legislature to secure passage. The law has broken new ground in Fiji and the Pacific. It is based on the no-fault principle of divorce, spearheads a non-adversarial counselling system and uses a specialist Family Division of the Court, which prioritizes children\u2019s needs and paren- tal support. It removes all forms of formal legal and financial discrimination against women in terms of their access to legal recourse under the law and grants them rights to enforceable custody and financial support.135 By contrast, Sri Lanka\u2019s 1995 law reform process demonstrates how reform can go awry. It resulted in more regressive legislation for people with diverse genders and sexual orientations. The text of the law criminalizing \u2018unnatural\u2019 sexual behaviour had been appli- cable only to men because it referred to \u2018he\u2019 throughout. A move to institute gender- neutrality in the law resulted in the word being changed from \u2018he\u2019 to \u2018person\u2019. This made the law applicable to women as well. Consensual sexual activity between adults of the same sex remains a crime under the Penal Code.136 Make a Case In Asia-Pacific countries where the law shifts not just through legislation but also through precedents, a strategy for reversing gender discrimination can be filing cases to establish new precedents. This can happen through the initiatives of lawyers and activists and the willingness of individual judges to reinterpret the law (Box 4.6). In Fiji, a gender discriminatory rule that required corroboration for rape was outlawed in a 2004 case, Balelala v State.137 The accused argued before the Supreme Court that it was dangerous to convict him on the defendant\u2019s words alone and requested that his conviction should be overturned. A re- quirement for corroboration in rape cases was not part of the law, but it had been a long- standing judicial practice in Fiji. The court examined its origin and said it was represen- tative of the practice in force in England in 1944 when evidence legislation was enacted. The court ruled that the practice should be removed since it was based on an outmoded and fundamentally flawed rationale that was unfairly demeaning to women and contra- dicted the Fijian Constitution. In Asia-Pacific countries where the law shifts not just through legislation but also through precedents, a strategy for revers- ing gender discrimination can be filing cases to establish new precedents ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 138 New precedents set in lower courts can vary and are vulnerable to being reversed by superior courts. In Kiribati, lawyers failed through litigation to outlaw the discrimi- natory corroboration rule for sexual assault crimes. The rule changed only when the legislature approved the Evidence Amend- ment Act 2003.138 Build on the Power of Civil Society Activism Civil society organizations, particularly women\u2019s NGOs, have been the driving force behind progressive legislation for gender equality being passed and implemented in many Asia-Pacific countries, and the signing and ratification of international human rights conventions. While the role of civil society varies across countries, it can be valuable in legal reform efforts for several reasons: Issue expertise. Civil society groups have grown in number and expertise in the last decade. Some now have highly trained experts in law and gender, many of whom have benefited from the exchange of experiences and know- ledge in regional and international forums. Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team (RRRT) is a widely recognized regional human rights project that covers 14 Pacific Island countries, for example. The group\u2019s lawyers, trainers and experts advise govern- ments and civil society on promoting human rights based on Pacific constitutional provi- sions and international standards. RRRT uses a unique combination of persuasive and challenging techniques and avoids the traditional \u2018naming, blaming and shaming\u2019 methods favoured by some human rights organizations. Over the past decade, the group has helped governments ratify CEDAW and prepare for reporting sessions. It has provided technical inputs for Fiji\u2019s Family Law Act 2003, Vanuatu\u2019s Family Protection Bill and the drafting instructions for a new Bill of Rights for Solomon Islands.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74f70343-ffad-4156-be5a-9302dc12460b": {"__data__": {"id_": "74f70343-ffad-4156-be5a-9302dc12460b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6be0fa60e3379fa6d1c5038b4beb9353b552bf1d34298a1683e280325e902427"}, "2": {"node_id": "58a92e3f-d0a5-4cb5-94ae-eef091785983", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a2c51a148c948c72923d9b284271c63679f36fad6cccb5f7f63c309461b854a4"}}, "hash": "683ab1e96552c5f208fee262594f87b62e18916b4400fb06d2355848ee6a3319", "text": "Other initiatives have brought about equal citizenship rights in Fiji and equal evidence laws in rape cases in Kiribati.

They filed public interest litigation seeking the enforcement of constitutional rights against legal wrongs. In public interest litigation, there is no adjudication on individual rights. At first, public interest legislation was filed by simple methods such as sending letters to the court enclosing news reports of violations. The court treated these as writ petitions and issued many directives. The traditional rule of standing, the strict rules of evidence and the language of the law were simplified. In a series of judgments, the court has given directives that have expanded constitutional rights to include the rights to livelihood, health, education, environment, a safe working environment free of sexual harassment and a fair trial process in the criminal justice system. It has also addressed concerns relating to the abuse of power and corruption. The court has read the provisions of international human rights treaties to which India is a party into domestic law. It framed guidelines on sexual harassment citing Article 11 of CEDAW, which directs the State to take appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the field of employment, including the prevention of sexual harassment.

Civil society organi- zations, particularly women\u2019s NGOs, have been the driving force behind progressive legisla- tion for gender equality in many Asia-Pacific countries CHAPTER 4: ADVANCING LEGAL RIGHTS 139 is constantly evolving. Civil society groups work on a smaller scale and may have the capacity to try new ideas to see if they are worth institutionalizing. In Mumbai, India, men run an NGO called Men Against Violence and Abuse. Instead of focusing only on the impacts of gender-based violence on women, it seeks to change male attitudes to mascu- linity and provide a forum for men to oppose violence against women. The group organizes prevention programmes, public discussions on violence against women, gender sensitiza- tion programmes, and mass awareness drives using media, street plays, posters and radio. It also provides counselling and guidance to couples facing marital conflict, organizes self- defence workshops for women and publishes a men\u2019s magazine that addresses gender issues.139 Understanding of national context. National and sub-national civil society groups are mostly staffed by people from a given country or locality. They understand what people think and why, and how to persuade people to adopt new ways of thinking, including through rationales for more gender-balanced societies. Political presence. Civil society groups play a prominent political role in some countries and are capable of mobilizing politicians and political constituencies around gender equa- lity and legal reform. Change Attitudes to Extend the Law\u2019s Reach As has been apparent throughout this chapter, the arm of the law is only so long. Social conventions around gender form the foundations of societies, drawing deeply on human biology and adaptive social norms. Some parts of these foundations are strong and deserve to be kept, but others are weak because they are harmful to women and men and a hindrance to human deve- lopment. It is up to each country to decide where changes need to be made and more positive norms pursued, keeping in mind commitments made internationally to basic principles such as gender equality. The law needs to be part of this endeavour\u2014but cannot be all of it. A look at some of the experiences with law and gender equality in the region explains why. In the Pacific, most attempts to change sexual assault laws have failed. In Fiji, draft rape laws have become embroiled in arguments about the rights of the victim over the right to due process of the accused, and about", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c428323-25b5-45e5-a958-70b6242a3905": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c428323-25b5-45e5-a958-70b6242a3905", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "67b805aea441e081c9a526bd34a914737f68089ac418ec30f9217f5419438721"}}, "hash": "67b805aea441e081c9a526bd34a914737f68089ac418ec30f9217f5419438721", "text": "concepts perceived as too \u2018Western\u2019, \u2018feminist\u2019, radical and counter to Pacific culture. The political instability in Fiji over the last twenty years has left little space for legal reform, much less for anything seen as controversial or social threatening. Another example can be found in the impunity for some crimes against women \u2013 which comes from judicial system failures in part, but also from the widespread beliefs, such as the notion that regardless of what the law says, men are really entitled to beat their wives. India, for example, has strict laws against dowry, child marriages and sex- selective abortion. While public awareness has grown about the harm from these practices and they even feature regularly in media re- ports, still all three openly take place in some communities. In Bangladesh, the minimum age of marriage for girls is 18 years, but child marriage continues to be widely practised.140 New ways of thinking can shift discri- minatory attitudes either to produce fairer legislation and judicial practices or to achieve the standards of what already exists. This process needs to work on three fronts: Inside the judicial system. This involves training police, judges and other judicial personnel not just on the technicalities of the law, but also about gender inequalities that It is up to each country to decide where changes need to be made and more positive norms pursued, keeping in mind commitments made interna- tionally to basic principles such as gender equality ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 140 disadvantage women and make legal prac- tices discriminatory, whether or not they are intended to be so. It requires asking legal personnel to reflect on what legal neutrality really means and on the potentially positive role of judicial interpretation in moving legal systems closer to that ideal. Judicial systems cannot claim to be effective if they are missing large numbers of crimes or imposing inaccurate penalties. Across the political arena. Many intersections exist between the judiciary and other branches of political systems. The legislature drafts and passes laws. Politicians may appoint judges. They assign budgets to courts, prisons, police and legal aid initiatives to assist the poor. Members of the executive and legislative branches who face election may also be sensitive to feedback from consti- tuencies on whether or not the legal system meets their needs. All of these intersections provide entry points for advocating how the law and its implementation can support the achievement of gender equality, including by building on political commitments that may have been made in national forums or through international instruments such as CEDAW. In the social sphere. Social mobilization can have any of a number of objectives, such as to convince people to use the law to protect them- selves or improve their lives; to persuade them of its value so they will comply with it, even aside from the threat of punishment; and to suggest that as citizens they can call upon the judicial system to be accountable to their needs and prerogatives. This kind of advocacy needs to operate in some of the places where social norms are transmitted such as schools, the media, religious organizations and com- munity groups. Use the Law to Tear Down Gender Barriers For women to have equal access to oppor- tunities for human development, including those that come through political and economic power and voice, they must enjoy equal rights and protection under the law. Based on overall patterns in the region, it is reasonable to say that this is not currently the case in any Asia-Pacific country. Even those states that have tried to remove overtly discriminatory statutes still have gaps in laws and legal practices that fail to check gender biases. Divorce, inheritance, gender-based violence, labour rights, rules of evidence, citizenship\u2014the list of legal issues that deserve immediate attention is long and worrisome. Yet the gaps can be narrowed and at some point eliminated, as some countries are beginning to demonstrate. Recognizing that the law is devised by human beings and cannot claim to be fully impartial is one important step forward. Step two is to accept that the law deeply influences development in different ways and that it also shapes the outcomes of many non-legal interventions. The legal process and the law thus need to be crafted to genuinely advance gender equality. As a third step, laws and legal practices, de jure and de facto alike, need to be designed and implemented in ways that tear down gender barriers. This does not imply a kind of legal favoritism for women and other marginalized groups.

Legal reform cannot be limited to fixing the laws when compliance cannot be taken for granted. Countries in the region have made com- mitments to equality before the law and to banning discrimination through their consti- tutions, the supreme law of the land. Progressive legal initiatives, both judicial and legislative, testify to intended advances in gender equality. The promise of these mile- stone legal achievements should be upheld, as in the end that is what counts. As a third step, laws and legal practices, de jure and de facto alike, need to be designed and implemented in ways that tear down gender barriers CHAPTER 4: ADVANCING LEGAL RIGHTS 141 ACTIONS AT A GLANCE ENFORCING RIGHTS, CORRECTING WRONGS A country\u2019s legal system influences how women and men seek opportunities and makes choices. Gender equality requires close attention to legal institutions so that both the substance of the laws and how they are upheld become powerful tools to advance equality. This calls for uncovering biases and taking corrective measures to redress past discrimination. Substantive equality in law provides legal backing for economic and political equality; political voice and economic power, in turn, influence legal systems. An action agenda should be rooted in local circumstances while benefitting from the best international norms. It should aim to: Achieve inclusiveness through dynamic reforms. Use international instruments to bring national laws closer to global norms on gender equality \ufffd Incorporate well-defined provisions on gender equality, non-discrimination and state obligations in national constitutions \ufffd Give priority to changing discriminatory and contradictory formal as well as customary laws and practices \ufffd Curtail discriminatory judicial practices through training and developing capacities to advance gender equality among court personnel and police \ufffd Promote progressive interpretation of religious texts to encourage acceptance of equality of all human beings and reduce discrimination against women \ufffd Foster public support for upholding laws through advocacy and social mobilization campaigns \ufffd Reinterpret laws and set new judicial precedents on gender equality by filing lawsuits or test cases through lawyers, activists and individual judges. Build on the power of civil society activism. Enhance the legal expertise of civil society groups through training \ufffd Support groups working with populations affected by discriminatory laws \ufffd Partner with those piloting innovative ideas that may be worth scaling up and institutionalizing \ufffd Work through national and sub-national civil society organizations rooted in local contexts to persuade people to adopt new ways of thinking and strive for more gender-balanced societies \ufffd Build on civil society capacities to mobilize politicians and political constituencies around gender equality and legal reforms. Change attitudes to extend the law\u2019s reach. Train police, judges and other judicial personnel inside the judicial system not just on the technicalities of the law, but also on gender inequalities that disadvantage women and make legal practices discriminatory \ufffd Orient and sensitize leaders across the political arena \u2013 members of the executive and legislative branches \u2013 on how laws and their implementation can support the achievement of gender equality \ufffd Mobilize people to use laws through advocacy in schools, the media, religious organizations or community groups. CHAPTER 5: TOWARDS EQUAL POWER AND VOICE 145 Many constitutions now endorse the equal worth of human beings, and modern states place great emphasis on the impartiality of economic, political and legal institutions. Citizens are not intended to be unequal. Beyond the fundamentals of these rights, gender equality is central to human deve- lopment and serves the practical purpose of influencing the efficiency and sustainability of development efforts. The empowerment and participation of all people advances when gender is no longer a hindrance. But at many points, gender discrimina- tion creeps in. Attitudes towards gender are deeply rooted in all societies, regardless of religion, race, ethnicity, level of economic development, or type of political system. Men and women experience institutions diffe- rently, in part because attitudes are either assumed to be true and unchangeable, or because they are ignored. Imbalances in power and voice entrench these patterns, as privi- leged groups are able to influence institutions to secure and perpetuate their own advant- ages. As a result, the idea that all human beings are equally valuable and should enjoy equal opportunities and rights continues to be contested. This contrasts with increasing acceptance that there is no legitimate reason why some people should be systematically deprived of equal access to the resources, capabilities, opportunities and choices required for human development. This acceptance needs to grow as a counter- weight.

A number of Asia-Pacific countries are already marked by disaffection and conflict. The social exclusion of minorities and alienation of other dis- advantaged groups remains prevalent, while some majorities feel like disadvantaged mino- rities. Inequalities intersect along the lines of gender, class, birth, religion, caste and loca- lity. Of these, gender is the most prevalent form of inequality, cutting across levels of development. The greater parts of most popu- lations in Asia-Pacific today face some form of exclusion, which is a threat to long term stability of the region. In turbulent times\u2014particularly if oppor- tunities for improving lives seem to dim\u2014 people can revert to exalting an imagined past, an illusory golden age. This is evident in attempts to control the freedom and choices of women and girls, whether the justification is a religious statute from a thousand years ago, or the belief that women should be fired first from jobs because men are the \u2018real\u2019 Pervasive and persistent, gender inequalities continue to overshadow even the considerable gains made by women and girls in Asia and the Pacific. But countervailing forces are also at work, at national and international levels. Institutions have improved in many countries. Catalyzing change requires establishing the priorities central to transforming the mainstream for a better balance in economic power, political voice and legal rights. To be successful, progress has to be rooted in the local context. Towards Equal Power and Voice Gender equality is central to human development and serves the practical purpose of influencing the efficiency and sustainability of development efforts Chapter5 ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 146 breadwinners. These tendencies are an obvious threat to the region\u2019s attempts to achieve gender equality. And they are unfolding in an environment where countries have chased growth at the expense of equality. This means that disparities have deepened in some cases, and that the foundation for establishing equality, particularly in the current climate, is weak. Catalyzing Change Fortunately, countervailing forces are also at work. The contrasts within the region in male-female survival rates, education, oppor- tunities for remunerative work and partici- pation show that things can change, as East Asia pulls ahead of South Asia on progress towards gender equality. Many more people today are aware of the benefits of equality for individuals and societies. They are also more willing and ready to demand equality, even if that means some level of upheaval and significant revisions to existing institutions. While divisions remain among different groups, connections also are greater, as people realize that tolerance for one type of disparity in the end produces a climate that can accommodate all types. For its part, the private sector, despite the fact that some businesses continue to use women as a cheap and easily disposable source of labour, is also recognizing that some women are becoming an economic power in and of themselves. They are consumers who make purchasing decisions. And they are professionals who add diversity to decision- making within businesses, which adds value in designing products and services, including those targeted to other women. Some coun- tries are debating the efficacy of quotas in the private sector, voluntary or backed by law, to encourage diversity and speed up transforma- tion. Regardless of the position on the specifics of quotas, the debate has brought the issue of equal opportunities to the forefront. The reality too is that institutions have improved in many countries, including through greater capacity for policy-making that can make a significant difference for gender equa- lity. More resources are available to imple- ment policies and programmes that can be geared towards shared benefits. Political will has grown, in tandem with domestic constitu- encies comprising women and men who insist on progress, and flagged by international commitments to gender equality. This is obvious in the ways that gender equality has entered political campaigns through party platforms and deliberate appeals to women voters. Laws have been changed to support gender equality through people cooperating across political lines, and even in the face of vociferous and well-organized opposition. Perhaps most significantly, ordinary people can now see the benefits of gender equality in their own lives. Women discover this when they acquire an asset or a job that allows them a much greater say in household decisions that used to be the province of men.

Some men have started to understand that gender norms can oppress them too and can be put aside in favour of new attitudes and behaviours that, for example, embrace cooperation over aggression.

Greater tolerance of gender identities is being spearheaded in urban areas and public spaces, such as in the media.

Societies are never \u2018finished,\u2019 with fixed institutions and attitudes\u2014institutions influence attitudes as much as attitudes alter institutions. The region is at a turning point, with complex changes already taking place and ever more people accessing information and thinking about and interpreting it for themselves. There is increasing questioning among women and men on circumstances seen as unjust. \u2018Social order\u2019 has sometimes been used as an argument to justify unequal institutions and attitudes. But prioritiz- ing \u2018order\u2019 over justice is costly to sustain when there is much turbulence below the surface. It is time to catalyze change by moving beyond partial attempts. This calls for strengthening policies and programmes on women\u2019s empowerment, including by embed- ding gender analysis as a routine requirement for framing them. Full political and legal backing can make them central to\u2014and transformative of\u2014the broader mainstream. Establishing the Priorities Gender affects all aspects of human life and development. Its breadth and complexity must be recognized, and priorities carefully chosen in the quest for gender equality. This Report has selected three arenas\u2014economic power, political voice and legal rights\u2014with the potential to catalyze wider change. Each involves far-reaching systems and institu- tions, so that once progress takes off in some dimensions, the resulting momentum can spur rapid advancement overall. Priority interventions in all three should be chosen for their potential to transform institutions, change attitudes and strengthen assessments of gaps and progress. Institutions require transformation be- cause they govern patterns of exchange that determine who has power and voice. By design or functioning, institutions can set rules that enable benefits for the greater good or hold back progress. Many institutions in Asia-Pacific maintain discriminatory patterns because they are acceptable, invisible or against the interests of powerful groups. Transforming institutions goes beyond traditional gender mainstreaming exercises, which have often had little impact because they have simply treated gender as an \u2018add- on\u2019 to existing institutions that do not, in the end, genuinely serve the cause of gender equality. Transformational mainstreaming implies looking at all the places where power, wealth, knowledge, capabilities, opportunities and rights intersect. It entails a commitment to aligning these with the principles of equality and justice, rather than allowing the status quo to go unchecked. This can be a challenging and time-consuming process, but it may be one that is also more sustainable and fairer in the long term. It allows societies to aim for protecting the rights and opportunities of all citizens, which has been proven as a far more efficient and effective path to development than the avenue of gross disparity. For transformation to take place at the operational level and be sustained, attitudes must change, both within institutions and in society at large. As long as women continue to be viewed as somehow less than equal citizens, progress will be limited. Attitudes to gender must also be understood in the way that they can confine men by insisting on dominant masculinities, rather than allowing the prerogative of individual choice. Greater openness to the fluidity of gender identity is a vital part of shaping attitudes for accepting diversity. Without this acceptance, the core promise of assuring human rights to all\u2014 regardless of sex or gender identity\u2014cannot be met. The process of changing attitudes\u2014and the behaviours that come out of them\u2014 requires awareness and a conscious effort to move forward. The process has to be holistic; This Report has selected three arenas\u2014economic power, political voice and legal rights\u2014with the potential to catalyze wider change ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 148 awareness at the group level is important, but driven by the notion that change starts with individuals.

It is premised on the idea that attitudes are fluid and can change\u2014and in fact may already be transforming, both for better or worse. These shifts are happening faster today as a result of the rapid exchange of information. Assessing gaps and change through measurement is part of both transforming institutions and changing attitudes because it reveals what is actually taking place. Many gender equality issues have been simply obscured because they are not measured, leading people to assume that there is no problem and thus no need for a response. Careful measurement can bring gaps into clearer focus and keep attempts to close them on track through monitoring. In each country in Asia and the Pacific, there exist practices that can restrict gender equality and also those that can support its achievement. These must be taken on board in shaping strategies to transform institu- tions, change attitudes and assess gaps. Pro- gress may not always be straightforward, especially if it is perceived as producing clear winners and losers, as happening too fast or as a threat to deeply held beliefs. These con- cerns must be respected and managed. Gender equality is not a prescription with a single form; multiple means to achieve it are available. In this, the involvement and endorsement of people who clearly under- stand how gender norms operate in a given society or locality can be invaluable. To be successful, progress has to be rooted in local contexts. An Agenda for Action While individual Asia-Pacific countries have their own choices and needs in pursuing gender equality, some overarching strategies are common to all. Chapters 2, 3 and 4 of this Report present specific action points covering essentials for a better balance in economic power, political voice and legal rights. The following eight recommendations identify key actors and summarize proposed directions for action. 1. Make International Commitments a Reality Countries should ratify and use international conventions that promote human rights, respect for diversity and equality for all. The range of fundamental human freedoms enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was made specific to gender equality in CEDAW. Particular attention should be paid to removing the region\u2019s high number of reservations to CEDAW, paving the way for bringing domestic legislation in line with it. Other important international refe- rence points include the 1995 Beijing Plat- form for Action and UN Security Council resolutions on women in conflict, particularly Resolutions 1325 and 1820, given the number of countries in conflict or post-conflict situations. Countries in the region have made specific commitments to achieving the MDGs by 2015, including the third goal on gender equality. Goal 3 is central to the other goals, which, in turn, are essential for achieving gender equality. Members of parliament and the judiciary should be oriented to gender concerns, and these global instruments presented both as sources of information about gender equality and as political commitments that should be upheld. In some countries CEDAW has also become internalized in the system of national laws and used to reform criminal and civil justice systems. National laws to protect women\u2019s rights should progres- sively become consistent with international commitments. International agreements, while com- Assessing gaps and change through measurement is part of both transforming institutions and changing attitudes because it reveals what is actually taking place CHAPTER 5: TOWARDS EQUAL POWER AND VOICE 149 posed of certain basic standards, can be viewed through the lens of respecting people\u2019s different priorities. Standards do not need to be uniformly imposed on everyone. But res- pect for diversity should be connected to equality of opportunity and human develop- ment, so that people as individuals can genuinely make their own choices. Stronger South-South regional and wider international agreements should be consi- dered to ensure women\u2019s safe migration and ease legal barriers, as single-person mobility with all the associated vulnerabilities repre- sents a major Asia-Pacific phenomenon. Migrant work is of growing significance for females, with huge transformative potential.

Craft Economic Policies to Support Gender Equality Too often, the gender-blind nature of econo- mic policy-making results in choices that deny women opportunities even if they are not intended to. A more deliberate focus on gender and how it affects women\u2019s economic options is required, particularly in targeting poverty interventions to provide equal opportunities for women and men.

Skills required for gender analysis should be cultivated among ministries of finance and planning, as well as in others like agriculture, rural development, industry and commerce. Governments should ensure that fiscal and monetary policies help unleash women\u2019s leadership and entrepreneurship. Monetary policy can be attuned to be more supportive of inclusive growth and human development. Directed lending to poor women for produc- tive purposes, protection of their incomes through micro-insurance, and the graduation of more women from microfinance to main- stream financial institutions of credit, insu- rance, investment and money transfer one some ways of doing so. Fiscal policy should include gender-based budgeting and the audi- ting of national and sub-national budgets, for both revenues and expenditures. These exer- cises should not be viewed as separate or dis- crete, but as integral to all budget categories. Publicly funded programmes for poverty reduction, livelihoods, employment and entre- preneurship should ensure that women and single-headed households are guaranteed equal opportunities, remuneration, rights of ownership and control over assets. This will contribute to correcting past exclusions and support the relatively vulnerable through land assignments, titling, bank accounts and more independent control over their economic circumstances. Such efforts should be backed by sustained programmes for girls\u2019 education, their longer retention in formal systems, skills development to bridge knowledge gaps, and enhancing their ability to compete and nego- tiate for jobs and other economic resources. Women may require specific forms of infrastructure to support their capacity to grasp economic opportunities, such as conve- nient childcare facilities and safe transpor- tation networks. Policies to redistribute unpaid care work, largely seen as women\u2019s obligation, would free women to pursue other options and take better advantage of market opportunities. These need to apply to both the public and private sectors. They should include quality physical infrastructure and affordable essential care services. Migrant workers have contributed enormously to the economies of sending and receiving locations alike. Given women\u2019s growing role in the provision of remittances and missing skills through migrant labour, safe and low-cost money transfer facilities should be available within countries and across borders. Governments should ensure that fiscal and monetary policies help unleash women\u2019s leadership and entrepreneurship ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 150 3. Make the Content of Education and Access to It More Gender-Equal Because education systems still perpetuate gender stereotypes, national and local govern- ments should develop awareness of gender in school curricula and teacher training. Civil society groups and gender experts can be brought in to guide the assessment and development of textbooks and question materials that overtly enforce stereotypes or do so by omission, such as when girls are never presented as leaders, leaving boys and girls with an impression that females do not normally lead or must be exceptional if they do so. Schools should promote female leadership and active decision-making, not only to provide positive role models for girls but also to make this perfectly normal and acceptable to boys. Not just content but also the space where education takes place can hinder girls from participating. Safe and non-discriminatory school environments are a must, given that the lack of amenities such as transport or toilets can hold back girls from coming to school. Hostels for girls and women can help retain them longer in formal education and access quality facilities that may be far away. Recognize and remove all barriers that affect retention to help ensure that all girls complete a full cycle of schooling. High-quality learning opportunities for women and girls, in formal systems as well as outside them, should be provided and backed by incentives as locally necessary. Some can be directly focused on market needs to add value to the time spent in remunerative work and to widen opportunities. 4. Boost Political Participation Legislatures, political parties and political leaders should recognize the importance of women\u2019s political participation to democracy and equal citizenship. Political leaders and parties can act if they want to. Special actions to boost the number and quality of female representatives might include quotas, political party reform, gender-equality orientation and capacity development. These methods should be considered at national as well as sub- national levels. All of these measures need to be approached in the spirit of genuine change, avoiding tokenism or manipulation for political gain. The success of quotas\u2019 in particular depends on incentives for compliance and sanctions for the lack of compliance. Quotas have a proven track record in many countries but may not automatically be the best mechanism for raising women\u2019s participa- tion, though they do have the potential to quicken the process.

There may be scope to adopt minimum quotas for both women and men, thus underscoring the principles of balanced representation and fairness. As elections grow more expensive, cam- paign finance reform is important in opening doors to women as politicians, especially new candidates. Women on average start from a financial disadvantage, with fewer of their own resources and more limited access to political networks that can provide them. One approach is to limit the sums spent by parties or candidates in the course of a single election. Other options include the equitable distribution of airtime on public television and radio stations, and political party commitments to channel resources into the campaigns of women candidates. Several countries in Asia and the Pacific face crises or are emerging from them. National and sub-national political leaders should assure better gender balance in leader- ship across all aspects of crisis management, Schools should promote female leadership and active decision- making, not only to provide positive role models for girls but also to make this perfectly normal and acceptable to boys CHAPTER 5: TOWARDS EQUAL POWER AND VOICE 151 whether involving natural disasters, conflicts or a sustained economic downturn. A token female politician will not be adequate for all voices to be heard and the particularities of gender addressed (such as female segregation, restricted mobility, sexual violence, invisibi- lity of female ex-combatants, male vulner- ability to recruitment, sudden job losses in export-oriented sectors, and HIV/AIDS). Highly unbalanced leadership may result in partial understanding, selective priorities and incomplete solutions in situations where these can do the most damage, including by destabi- lizing the prospects for full and rapid recovery. 5. Pursue Gender-Equitable Laws Parliaments should reform gender discrimina- tory laws and make new ones where needed. This should include ironing out discrepancies between customary and formal laws that perpetuate discrimination as well as gaps between laws and constitutional principles. Countries should have specific constitutional provisions on equality and non-discrimina- tion by gender. This will narrow the wide latitude of interpretation enjoyed by courts and law enforcement agencies. Harmful tradi- tional and customary practices, under cur- rent human rights standards, should be banned. Many countries in the region have al- ready set precedents to outlaw such practices. Where applicable, a process of building social consensus and buy-in should surround the adoption of new and/or improved legal statutes. This may include reaching out to faith-based organizations as important agents for change. Legal systems should be subjected to an overall gender equality review of national legislation, as some countries have done, including for CEDAW compliance. This Report has also identified a few categories of laws with extra urgency. To boost women\u2019s economic options, states should change discriminatory inheritance legislation, given the enormous disparities faced by women in establishing control and ownership over assets. Joint land titling can be an important step to counteract land inheritance practices guided by patrilineal succession, but it should be coupled with strategies to ensure that women are doing more than just signing their names to a deed. Legislation on gender-friendly employ- ment standards should be in place, along with mechanisms to ensure implementation. Key provisions comprise equal employment opportunities; equal pay for equal work; protection from sexual harassment sup- ported by accessible complaint systems; paid maternity leave for 14 weeks; and basic rights for migrant women, including those who are short-term seasonal workers. Marriage, divorce and maintenance laws continue to underscore women\u2019s second-class status and should be revised to support gen- der equality. A major legal gap in the region, while lessening, is in addressing gender-based violence. Laws need to be adopted and imple- mented effectively to reduce widespread impunity. They should not provide space for mediation. Offenders should be automatically prosecuted so that women and their families are not pressured into backing away from cases. In general, women should enjoy all legal rights independently from men and their marital status. Special vulnerabilities among widows, young girls and single women may dictate additional forms of protection. 6. Address Legal Discrimination and Close Gaps Between Laws and Legal Practice The justice system should ensure that legal practices are consistent with laws on the books and that access to justice is broadly available, whether that means taking justice to people through mobile courts or providing free legal aid to those with few resources. Countries should have specific consti- tutional provisions on equality and non-discrimination by gender; States should change discriminatory inheritance legislation ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fae9490d-fa54-4a33-bd11-879ef76241ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "fae9490d-fa54-4a33-bd11-879ef76241ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "274a885e64501f3e5c3c9cb0c006eed714202ea1bec35958ff3849dd780a6141"}, "3": {"node_id": "f6d1ff87-2063-4413-94bc-55f3fe26d1c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe42ae367ab6169a15beae3f7b9e93890460992a78adf614919f02756e4d7d2f"}}, "hash": "485ab9acb2085967f0bebc7820922ed244a490e1adb33b7547e3217ff692f752", "text": "152 Members of the judiciary as well as the police should be sensitized to the reality that, regardless of what the law says, men and women experience the justice system diffe- rently. This occurs due to issues such as affordability, stigmas faced by women and gender stereotyping by the judiciary, uncon- scious or otherwise. Professional training for lawyers, judges, magistrates and police should include an orientation around the needs of marginalized groups, with women being the largest of these categories. This may need to initially draw upon existing provisions in the national legal system that will be familiar to judicial professionals, before moving into the terrain of gender equality and social norms. Crimes against women should not be treated lightly, whether they involve harass- ment in the streets (also known as Eve- teasing) or honour killings and female infanticide, euphemistically called \u2018social deaths\u2019. These terms reflect disrespect and an affront to dignity that translate in turn into the reception women find in the legal system. Judges should set judicial precedents to up- hold women\u2019s dignity and strengthen their security. They should not treat domestic violence as a \u2018private affair\u2019. Prevention and response systems should be broadly available to survivors of violence so they can access all legal, administrative and social options available to press charges. More female judges and police officers should be recruited. All officials in the justice system should receive training on gender issues. Male police officials should also be trained to take seriously and to act upon reported cases of crimes against women through proper investigation and charges against offenders. Legal education and training in general should include gender analysis and orientation. 7. Collect Better Data and Strengthen Capacity for Gender Analysis National statistical systems should streng- then capacities to collect, report and analyze sex-disaggregated data, especially in over- looked areas such as for tracking the prevalence of gender-based violence and male- female gaps in asset ownership. Systematic and ongoing assessments should feed into policy efforts to close disparities, with infor- mation readily available on changes over time. All relevant line ministries should be engaged in monitoring, in addition to women\u2019s affairs, such as agriculture, commerce, education, finance, health, industry, infrastructure, labour and others. Both official statistical systems and administrative data should ensure gender-based assessments that serve as monitoring cross-checks. Measuring women\u2019s unpaid work can incorporate instruments such as time-use surveys, in recognition that many women\u2019s activities take place in the home or the informal sector, outside of conventional data gathering systems. To better understand patterns of female migration, data collection and sharing should improve between origin and destination countries and sub-national regions. While sex-disaggregated data is a neces- sary tool, it is not sufficient. Strengthen tech- nical capacities in gender analysis across all ministries, without taking such skills for granted. This will ensure that differences in male-female experiences and the barriers and opportunities they face are clearly understood and taken into account much more fully, systematically and on an ongoing basis, based on agreed frameworks. Locally relevant gender analysis frameworks should be deve- loped to help raise critical questions and analyse information through a gender \u2018lens,\u2019 which can feed into strengthening policies and programmes across the board. 8.

Have you ever been tempted to interfere with someone\u2019s rights based on gender because you could get away with it? Understand and respect diversity. This learning is important for yourself, as well as to help other people who may confront discrimination. Stop gender-based violence. Have you observed violence and harassment linked to gender, on the street, at home, at the workplace, at the train or bus station, or in an institution? Have you been a party to gender-based violence, perhaps unknowingly? Realize that gender-based violence is an extreme violation of human decency and dignity\u2014harmful for the victim and unwholesome for the perpetrator. Don\u2019t stay silent in the face of gender-based violence in your own home or elsewhere. Assist the victim. Approach local authorities and support agencies to expose, punish and deter offenders. Perpetrators may also need help through information and rehabilitation to avoid recurrence. Share responsibilities and respect rights at home. Is unpaid household work largely the \u2018default\u2019 responsibility of women in your home? If so, why? Joint sharing of household work and family decisions can create a healthy home environment and allow a better work-leisure balance for all. Mutual respect for spouse, sons, daughters and parents can strengthen voluntary bonds (as against those enforced through material dependence). Respect the right of spouses to control their earnings. As parents and grandparents, treat sons (and sons- in-law) and daughters (and daughters-in-law) equally. Provide equal access to opportunities for education. Encourage boys and girls to handle their own personal work and share common household responsibilities. As daughters and sons, don\u2019t give up your inheritance rights. Equally, support your family\u2014take away the stereotype that only sons care for parents in old age. Treat girls and boys equally in and out of the classroom and on the playground. As an educator, mentor or coach for young people from early childhood to adulthood, have you ensured that girls and boys receive equal attention? Encourage all students to explore a range of subjects. Ensure that girls are not guided towards stereotypes or kept on the sidelines during sports and extra-curricular activities. Options should be guided by aptitude and ability rather than gender. This builds confidence and skills for both girls and boys. Break gender stereotypes in the workplace. Is there respect for colleagues of all genders at work? Ensure that there is a well-documented and publicized policy on sexual harassment at work and that new recruits are made aware of the policy as part of normal orientation. Watch out for gender-based prejudices and stereotypes that might guide professional decisions. If you are a manager, remember that gender- sensitive actions can signal to employees core principles of equality and a harassment-free workplace. Nurture leadership potential of both males and females in the family and in the community. Are women and girls in your family and neighbourhood encouraged to aspire to leadership positions? Encourage women to explore their entrepreneurial and professional talents. Support them to reach their full potential through education, jobs, entrepreneurship and other opportunities. Support and join women\u2019s collectives, such as self-help groups, to bolster women\u2019s voices and decision- making. Cast your vote for candidates who promote gender issues. As a citizen have you petitioned your local representative to put \u2018gender equality\u2019 on the agenda? You can also support women candidates for local and national elections, and campaign for making elections affordable and safe.

Businesses can be brought on board through practices within their own firms as well as in advertising. In countries where businesses conduct market surveys to design products and advertisements, they may also be a ready source of information on how attitudes are changing and which advo- cacy messages can build on these. Enlisting people in changing mindsets to support gender equality may need to start with the development of capacities to understand how gender operates in societies and what benefits can come from addres- sing inequalities and embracing diversity \u2013 both for particular groups and society as a whole.

Dominant masculinities can be questioned, opening space to explore diverse interpretations of what it means to be a man. In general, there should be a strong push behind the inclusion of men in the understanding of gender equality and steps to achieve it, recognizing their transformative role. A particular area of focus needs to be in making societies more alert to gender-based violence, more so in crisis situations when normal social bonds may have broken down. The diagnosis and recognition of violent acts should extend to those that may be less visible, such as forced marriages. Male family members need to realize that domestic violence is an extreme affront to the dignity of a woman in denying her control over her own being. A Turning Point for Gender Equality Across all eight areas in this Agenda for Action, piecemeal implementation will not be adequate. Boundaries need to be pushed so that changes take root and begin to generate their own momentum. The region is at a turn- ing point. The agenda needs to be put in place simultaneously on the economic, legal and political fronts, given connections among the three, and maintained over time. The overarching goal of human develop- ment is that people at large should be able to make choices and have access to capabilities and opportunities for fulfilling lives. These should never be taken away or diminished on the basis of gender. Inclusive development rests on the principles of equality and partici- pation.

Electoral quotas Quotas entail a require- ment that identified minority or under- represented groups, such as women, consti- tute a certain number or percentage of the members of a body, whether it is a candidate list, a parliamentary assembly, a committee or a government. The quota system places the burden of recruitment not on the individual, but on those who control the recruitment process. The core idea behind quotas for women is to recruit women into political positions and to ensure that women are not isolated in political life. Electoral quotas for women may be constitutional, legislative or set by political parties. Electoral systems How the votes cast in an election are converted into offices/seats won by parties and candidates. The key variables are the electoral formula used (i.e. whether a plurality/majority, proportional, mixed or other system is used, and what mathematical formula is used to calculate the seat alloca- tion), the ballot structure (i.e. whether the voter votes for a candidate or a party, and whether the voter makes a single choice or expresses a series of preferences) and the district magnitude (not how many voters live in a district, but how many representatives to the legislature that district elects).

Gross tertiary school enrolment ratio The ratio of total tertiary enrolment, regardless of age, to the population of the age group that officially corresponds to this level of educa- tion. Tertiary education, whether or not to an advanced research qualification, normally requires, as a minimum condition of admis- sion, the successful completion of education at the secondary level.

As per the Bank\u2019s definition, aggregates for East Asia and the Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Middle East and North Africa do not include high-income economies. In South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, there are no economies classified as high income (see \u2018Notes\u2019 in World Development Indica- tors online, World Bank 2009b). For the Bank\u2019s classification of regions, see http:// go. worldbank.org/D7SN0B8YU0. 51. The term \u2018missing women\u2019, a phrase coined by Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen, refers to the number of females who have died as a result of discri- minatory treatment in access to health and nutrition (Sen 1990a; 1990b). Sen\u2019s esti- mate is based on the actual population sex ratio (the number of males divided by the number of females) against an \u2018expected\u2019 population sex ratio, given equal treatment of the sexes in the distribution of survival- related goods and services. If the actual ratio exceeds the expected, the excess constitutes the number of \u2018missing women\u2019 at that point in time. A subsequent debate refined Sen\u2019s estimates by using different demographic techniques, particularly with regard to the critical assumption about the expected sex ratio (Coale 1991; Klasen 1994). The latest and perhaps the most refined estimates of missing women for selected developing countries were given by Klasen and Wink (2002). They estimated the number and per cent of missing women for several countries (those with suspici- ously high sex ratios or other evidence of female disadvantage), using the most recent population census data. Based on Klasen and Wink\u2019s percentage figures for missing women (column 2, Appendix Table 1.2), the present Report updates those estimates for the countries in the Asia-Pacific region where updated population figures for 2007 were available. The new estimates for 2007 are shown in column 4 of the table. It is interesting to note that Sri Lanka does not have any missing women. The critical assumption underlying these new estimates is that the percentage used in 2001 is still applicable to 2007. In other words, the presumption is that preferences for sons and other factors that prejudice the survival of females remain unchanged. 52. Klasen and Wink 2002. 53. This result holds true so long as the value of the aversion to inequality parameter is greater than zero. If it is equal to zero, then GDI = HDI. Incidentally, the correlation coefficient between the two is very high\u2014 in 2007 it was 0.99 for Asia-Pacific coun- tries, as well as 0.99 for the 155 countries in the world for which data is available. This close association between the two indicates GDI and HDI move together. 54. Some exceptions are starting to emerge. For example, recent national statistics for Nepal show that GEM is showing higher values than the GDI, indicating potential for gains in opportunities even at lower levels of income (UNDP Nepal 2009).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90d74eff-304f-4bcd-8107-0d2672189e4b": {"__data__": {"id_": "90d74eff-304f-4bcd-8107-0d2672189e4b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f55d22263c9d79b4773b9e1b2e8cb0ef01e2b22c405977a0e7b47ec471fbc2a3"}, "2": {"node_id": "0343816d-603e-4e7d-a547-9a5406d5c234", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9cc7fa744bf09d9811b65bf9c2bf312861a1fb6de59be134f0c1315b9d961d4b"}}, "hash": "4aa63b35c7fe3212daa481500746a269923fd2611d3babd2aa501ce8e108bba3", "text": "Chapter 2 1.

Parts of some countries follow other sys- tems that could be advantageous to women, such as Bhutan, Cook Islands, India, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Repub- lic, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Ten per cent of the population of the Pacific traditionally follows matrilineal transmission of land rights (Crocombe 1994, cited in Smiley 2006). However, even in matrilineal sys- tems women\u2019s personal autonomy was limited. The senior male of the household had substantial control over property. In the contemporary context, in Kerala, for instance, \u2018\u2026reforms and the consolidation of marriage as the dominant framework of women\u2019s property rights speak directly to women\u2019s contemporary disadvantage in property rights through the \u201cthinning\u201d of parental inheritance and the growing importance of dowry and spousal inheri- tance\u2019 (Government of Kerala 2006). 23. Agarwal 1994. 24. Both the Mitakshara and Dayabhaga were two main schools of inheritance in Hindu law. The Hindu Succession Act of 1956 unified the system of inheritance following broadly a Mitakshara pattern. 25. Agarwal 2005. 26. Ramaseshan 2009a. 27. Bowen 1998. As per Article 176: An only daughter\u2019s share is half the entire value of the inheritance; if there is more than one daughter, the daughters collectively receive two-thirds of the entire value of the inheritance; and if there is one daughter and one son, the inheritance ratio is one to two. 28.

The limitations of the indicator are: (1) there might be people that carry a high economic risk despite the fact that they have a wage and salary job, and the latter should not be equated to decent work; (2) unemployed people are not covered even though they are vulnerable; (3) there can be people in the two vulnerable status groups who do not carry a high economic risk, especially in developed economies. Despite these limitations, vulnerable emp- loyent shares are indicative for informal economy employment, particularly for the less developed economies and regions (ILO 2009a). NOTES 165 119.

In Norway the promulgation of Reindeer Herding Act 1978 created a system of herding licenses. In the past reindeer herds belonged to the family but legislation removed the herds as family asset and made it the asset of the license holder only. The license holders, with very few exceptions, were generally men. This led to the alienation of women from this traditional activity, with very few women holding licenses under their own names even though they continue to do the same work as before. 92.
