 burns up about eight to ten truckloads of fuelwood to prepare food and beverages for the monks, devotees and lay people who congregate for the events. 3.1.2 Project description The project was started in October 1999 and ended in December 2000 at a total cost of US$33,069, of which SGP funding was US$25,670. The Bhutan Youth Development Association (BYDA), an NGO, was the main project proponent and actor, with the Trashigang District administration providing logistical support. The project was aimed at working with religious institutions and local communities to: \u2022 Reduce fuelwood consumption by half in selected religious community kitchens; \u2022 Significantly reduce the time spent by local people in collecting fuelwood for religious community kitchens so that they can channel the time and energy saved to other viable economic activities; \u2022 Raise community awareness about the con- sequences of deforestation and the need to use natural resources judiciously; and \u2022 Demonstrate the manifold benefits of improved cooking stoves to promote widespread adoption of the technology in the district. The main project intervention was the installation of shielded, cylindrical metal stoves with hot water jackets. The project installed two stoves each in ten religious institutions (see Box 3-1 for the names of the institutions). The installation of the stoves was abetted by community workshops to demonstrate the use and maintenance of the stoves and raise awareness for forest conservation. School/ college-going rural youths were mobilized during their holidays to assist in the implementation of activities. 3.2 Positive features 3.2.1 Significant wood energy conservation As envisaged during project planning, there has been a significant reduction in fuelwood consum- ption as a result of the installation of the shielded metal stoves. All the community kitchens reported fuelwood consumption dropping to at least half. Statistically, this would translate to about four to five truckloads of fuelwood saved each year by each institution or 40 to 50 truckloads of fuelwood a year by all the religious institutions where the stoves were installed.

While the primary aim of the intervention was to reduce fuelwood consump- tion and improve forest conditions, what appealed more to the beneficiaries were these spin-off benefits that affect their daily lives. 3.2.3 Good demonstration value and multiplier effect In selecting religious institutions where many people congregated and where religious festivals and ceremonies were conducted more often, the project not only targeted religious institutions with higher fuelwood consumption but also achieved high public visibility and demonstration value. As a result, the project had a multiplier effect \u2013 the Trashigang District administration, based on widespread positive public response to the intervention, has embarked on a project to install similar stoves in some 14 additional religious institutions with funding from UNDP. 26 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region Box 3-1: Religious institutions where the stoves were installed \u2022 Galing Lhakhang, Shongphu geog \u2022 Namdruchholing Lhakhang, Radhi geog \u2022 Chador Lhakhang, Bartsham geog \u2022 Kakani lhakhang, Bidung geog \u2022 Phongmey Lhakhang, Phongmey geog \u2022 Bikhar Lhakhang, Samkhar geog \u2022 Yonphula Lhakhang, Kanglung geog \u2022 Khaling Lhakhang, Khaling geog \u2022 Brekha Anim Dratshang (nunnery),Thrimshing geog \u2022 Khardung Anim Dratshang (nunnery) 27 People from eastern Bhutan and of Indo-Burmese or Tibetan origin are generally known as Sharchhopa. 3.2.4 Enhancement of BYDA\u2019s profile The project gave BYDA the first-ever experience of dealing with environmental conservation on the ground. Besides, the involvement of school/ college-going rural youths contributed to the organization\u2019s core mission and the concept of wholesome youth development. In so doing, the project has set a precedent for the youth development/environmental conservation linkage. 3.2.5 Linking energy and gender While the project was not gender specific, it did ensure that both men and women participated and benefited from the project. Two nunneries, namely Khardung Anim Dratshang and Brekha Anim Dratshang, were among the ten religious institutions that received the stoves and back-up training. 3.3 Limitations 3.3.1 Weakening of project impact as a result of change in project design Originally, the plan was to cover seven religious institutions with three stoves for each of them. Subsequently, on the insistence of the Trashigang District administration to cover more institutions, the project was modified to cover three more religious institutions but without altering the budget and total number of stoves. So, each religious institution received two stoves instead of three. Consequently, several institutions still used traditional open hearths alongside the improved stoves. The kitchen users explained that they are required to usually prepare rice, one or two items of curry and tea concurrently whereas the two stoves were only sufficient for rice and a curry. So, they have to use the traditional hearth for preparing tea and additional curry. 3.3.2 Centralized project implementation BYDA had no local presence. As a result, project implementation was centralized with BYDA volun- teers travelling all the way from Thimphu to supervise and carry out project activities. Trashigang District administration\u2019s role was limited to providing some basic logistical assistance. This affected the continuity and quality of project implementation, with some activities such as community workshops being organized in an ad hoc manner. 3.3.3 Nullification of experience After the completion of the project, the key people who spearheaded the implementation of the activities pulled out of BYDA. Their exit has nullified the experience gained from the project. 4. Overview of the Biomass Fuel Efficiency project, its positive aspects and limitations 4.1 Context Tsirang is also one of the districts severely affected by fuelwood shortage. It is in southern Bhutan and most of the inhabitants are Lhotshampa. Most of the people follow Hinduism but there are also several communities (e.g. Sherpa, Tamang and Lama) who are Buddhists. High agricultural productiveness, a healthy climate and its proximity to the bordering towns have made the district one of the most populous in the country, with a population density of roughly 32 people km2 \u2013 nearly twice the national average.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c3b3ec7-7825-4100-b1ad-7a518e492230": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c3b3ec7-7825-4100-b1ad-7a518e492230", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bcf50a5d7d41419d9ad6889ab5c12aa31fc75f0fae43d5b40aaf0d6423ea2dae"}, "2": {"node_id": "3550b4a4-1203-44a9-aba3-77f3dbf7ba36", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f2a23fa51efc2dd69a5255d0da7884b4a7448c8ce85d484a507ae0bfc5cd098e"}}, "hash": "989b495143f22faeeb98dd6fd57f93315b2fee347912de308872bdb4e75e898a", "text": "All rural households depend on fuelwood for cooking (meals and cattle feed).

The Tsirang Women Group executed the project with logistical support from the Tsirang District Administration and technical assistance from the Improved Stove and Biogas Support Programme, Ministry of Trade and Industry. The project was conceived with the following objectives: \u2022 To reduce household fuelwood consumption by at least 50 percent; \u2022 To build the technical capacity of the local women to construct, repair and maintain the smokeless stoves; and \u2022 To promote the use of smokeless stoves among the local public in general. The project installed improved stoves in 2,000 households. The improved stove is basically a mud kiln (like a traditional oven) with a metal sheet chimney pipe and iron grate. The pot seats are left flat to prevent heat from escaping. The installation of the improved stoves was supported by training of a local woman from each of the 12 geogs (blocks), who are also members of the Tsirang Women Group. These women have become stove technicians who can construct the improved stoves and carry out repairs and maintenance, and have organized public demonstrations to display the construction, functioning, maintenance and the manifold advantages of the improved stove. 4.3 Positive features 4.3.1 Significant reduction in fuelwood consumption The majority of the rural households that have installed improved stoves claim reduction in fuelwood consumption by at least 50 percent, with a few even reporting reduction as high as 75 percent. If Tsirang\u2019s average per capita fuelwood consumption is assumed to be 1.25 tonnes per annum and rural household size (conservatively) six people, then individual household consumption works out to 7.5 tonnes per annum. Half this amount \u2013 3.75 tonnes \u2013 is what is saved per household. Extrapolate this figure to 2,000 households and the result is 7,500 tonnes of fuelwood saved each year, which is a significant amount by any standard. 4.3.2 Spin-off benefits that relate to daily rural life Local people reported cleaner kitchens and utensils, considerably reduced time spent on cooking, washing utensils and collecting fuelwood, the ability to keep food warm longer and reduced risks of smoke-related illness as the foremost social benefits. As in the case of the community cooking stove project in Trashigang, the spin-off benefits connected very well with the daily lives of the beneficiaries. Although women were the primary beneficiaries, the benefits spill over to the whole family. Children, particularly infants, who cling to their mothers most of the time, are at greater risk due to constant exposure to smoke and they are likely to suffer from respiratory problems. Men, who are usually required to fetch fuelwood, especially when long distances are involved, also benefit by having to collect less fuelwood. 4.3.3 Partnership and collaboration The project provides a fine example of partnership and collaboration. The Tsirang Women Group was very well supported by the Tsirang District administration and the Ministry of Trade and Industry, each playing a distinct but comple- mentary role. The Tsirang Women Group managed the project, mobilized local participation and monitored the activities, the Tsirang District administration provided logistical support particularly for organizing training and demon- strations and procurement of materials, and the Ministry of Trade and Industry assigned a full-time stove technical supervisor to provide training and technical guidance for 18 months. The partnership with the Tsirang District administration also involved the sharing of project costs. The Administration covered the salary and travel expenses of the technical supervisor during the period he was assigned to the project. 28 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region 4.3.4 Good focus on local capacity building The technical supervisor trained a woman from each of the 12 geogs in the construction and maintenance of the smokeless stoves. These trained women \u2013 fondly called chullah tshogpas by the villagers \u2013 have in turn conducted demons- trations on the construction, functioning and maintenance of the stoves in their respective geogs. They also serve as local stove technicians to whom people can turn to for technical assistance, if necessary. The demonstrations on improved stoves were packaged with messages from the district health and forestry officials on the benefits of the improved stoves to their health and the local environment. The training and demonstrations also facilitated interaction between the local women representing the different geogs and helped to develop camaraderie among them. Moreover, the project, being the first undertaking of the Tsirang Women Group, provided the members with hands-on experience and skills to manage similar projects in the future and to work as a team. It also gave them new insights into rural development and working with local communities. 4.3.5 Low cost and simple technology The", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5d2949a-35bd-4d92-a066-773ba3b4b4dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5d2949a-35bd-4d92-a066-773ba3b4b4dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9816168af4be34b1c374f19e63f456d3a08601c4dc5a161e2e6da355f9e800a3"}}, "hash": "9816168af4be34b1c374f19e63f456d3a08601c4dc5a161e2e6da355f9e800a3", "text": "low cost and technical simplicity of the improved mud stove have made it easier for the local people to adopt it and enhanced the sustainability and replicability of the intervention. The metal chimney pipes and iron grates can be procured without much difficulty from the neighbouring Indian town of Bongaigaon (three-to-four-hour drive from Damphu, Tsirang\u2019s headquarters). 4.3.6 Cost-sharing as a tool to establish local stakeholders and ownership Each beneficiary was required to contribute about US$3.00 and local materials such as wood and mud. This cost-sharing, without being a burden to the beneficiaries, has helped to establish local ownership of the intervention. 4.4 Limitations 4.4.1 Project planning not community driven The project planning was not community driven but community enthusiasm and response to the intervention grew immensely as local people realized the many benefits of the improved stoves. 4.4.2 Technological limitations The improved stoves had two negative aspects: (1) the stoves do not radiate heat to keep space and people warm during winters; (2) they produce very few coals to roast food over, e.g. corn. A few households reported not being able to use the smokeless stoves to prepare cattle feed. 29 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Working with rural communities to conserve wood energy: A case study from Bhutan * Project management * Mobilization of project inputs and local community participation * Monitoring * Technical services Training and technical guidance Tsirang Women Group Ministry of Trade and Industry Tsirang Dzongkhag Administration * Logistical support * Cost-sharing Rural Households Figure 3-2: Collaborative linkages with rural households as the focus of intervention 5. Key lessons \u2022 Interventions that demonstrate tangible benefits within a short term are likely to be more appealing to the local people than those with long gestation periods. Both projects were quick in showing benefits, contributing to widespread positive public opinion. \u2022 Energy conservation projects have far more meaning for the local people when the intervention is connected well to their daily lives. While reduction of fuelwood consumption was the principal objective, both the projects also generated several spin-off social benefits: cleaner kitchens and utensils, reduced risk of smoke-related illnesses, considerable reduction in time spent on cooking, washing utensils and fuelwood collection; these benefits affect the daily lives of local people profoundly. This further demonstrates how energy projects can add value to the broader rural development objectives. \u2022 Low-cost and simple interventions are easier to promote and possess greater potential for success.This is particularly evident in the case of the Biomass Fuel Efficiency Project, where public response has been extremely positive as the improved stoves are affordable and very easy to construct and maintain. Based on the positive public response, the SGP extended additional funding to the Tsirang Women Group to cover more households. As mentioned earlier, afford- ability and simplicity also enhance the sustain- ability and replicability of the technology. \u2022 Systematic integration of local capacity develop- ment into the project has greater potential for long-term success and sustainability. Both the shielded, cylindrical metal stove and the improved mud stove are not new interven- tions in Bhutan. However, in the past, in most cases the installation of improved stoves was not backed up with proper training of the users in the use and maintenance of the stoves. Consequently, most stoves became defunct and users reverted to traditional ovens. In contrast to this, the Biomass Fuel Efficiency Project was able to systematically integrate local capacity building activities during the implementation of the project which ensured its success beyond project duration. Whereas, in the case of the Improved Community Cooking Stove Project in Trashigang, capacity building activities were not well targeted. \u2022 Effective partnership and collaboration between stakeholders is the key for successful project implementation. The interinstitutional partnership in the case of the Biomass Fuel Efficiency Project shows how three distinct agencies \u2013 one a local women\u2019s group, the other a local government authority and the third a line ministry \u2013 can complement each other by working together. On the other hand, the Community Cooking Stove Project was unable to develop any effective partnership and, consequently, the quality of project implemen- tation suffered with some activities, such as the training workshops, being implemented in an ad hoc manner. \u2022 The importance of site selection based on criteria that are most relevant to project objectives was reinforced by carefully choosing intervention sites for their high demonstration value and visibility; the Community Cooking Stove Project was able to generate a multiplier effect. \u2022 Project design, especially when it has been derived from extensive stakeholder consultation, should not be compromised under pressure.

The other option \u2013 which is the easier one \u2013 would have been to increase the budget to buy additional improved stoves so that all the religious institutions would have received three stoves each as originally planned. The number of the improved stoves would then have been more compatible with actual usage and intended project impact would not have been diluted. \u2022 Project planning and appraisal can benefit immensely from simple cost-benefit or input- output analysis. If the total budget of the project is taken as cost or input and the saving of fuelwood as the key benefit and output, then the Biomass Fuel Efficiency Project was a far more efficient project than the Community Cooking Stove Project. The former saves 7,500 tonnes of fuelwood a year at a total budget of US$77,985, which means each tonne of fuelwood saved per year costs a little more than US$10.00. In comparison, the latter saves 220 to 280 tonnes of fuelwood a year at a total budget of US$33,069, which translates to more than US$130 per tonne of fuelwood saved each year. 30 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region 31 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Working with rural communities to conserve wood energy: A case study from Bhutan Bibliography Asia\u2013Pacific region BYDA. 1999.

Energy in rural areas is used for lighting, cooking, space heating in the domestic sector; water lifting and transportation in agriculture and for use in small and medium enterprises. The lack of modern energy sources severely constrains rural development; this affects employment and income- generation prospects and exacerbates poverty. Centralized planning and implementation in the energy sector have had limited impacts, particularly on the poor, who mostly consume energy inefficiently (such as traditional cooking based on fuelwood). Similarly, it is estimated that 70 to 80 million Indian households are not served by grid quality electricity. Unreliable as well as erratic power supply \u2013 including for electrified homes \u2013 compels villagers to rely on kerosene lamps and other more expensive substitutes.

The Government of India\u2019s Tenth Five Year Plan and Electricity Act (2003) envisage shifts in the approaches to energy programmes and policies; this makes them more demand-driven and participatory. Biomass energy technologies have tremendous potential to meet decentralized energy needs sustainably. However, there are a number of barriers and risks that have to be addressed. This paper discusses an ongoing project, Biomass Energy for Rural India, which attempts to deal with these issues. The emerging lessons from participatory approaches adopted in this case study are assessed in the context of the provision of integrated energy services in rural areas. The paper also highlights a few lessons learned from the implementation to date. Keywords: Rural energy, participatory approaches, poverty, gender. non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and private entrepreneurs. In order to achieve greater impacts on the poor, there is a need for a shift from the largely supply-driven approaches of the past to more demand-driven participatory approaches to energy services\u2019 planning and implementation. This approach is expected to generate a number of technological, market, financial, socio-economic and political challenges. 1.1 Analytical framework This paper presents a case study of the ongoing project Biomass Energy for Rural India (BERI) funded primarily by the GOI, the State Government of Karnataka, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the India Canada Environment Facility (ICEF). The project complements the efforts of the GOI in promoting an integrated approach to rural energy with emphasis on community participation and women\u2019s involvement. It proposes the development of management structures for sustained use of renewable energy technologies involving communities. The lessons learnt during project formulation and implemen- tation stages are discussed in the conceptual frameworks of barriers, risks and mitigation; Water, Energy, Health, Agriculture and Biodiversity (WEHAB) and the development-practice areas of the UNDP. Since the project is ongoing, it should be noted that lessons are still incipient. 2. Case study: Biomass Energy for Rural India 2.1 Conceptualization Preliminary surveys were carried out to determine energy demands and options for supply in a group of villages in Karnataka. Although the pilot demonstration area (Figure 4-1) was electrified already, the quality of the electricity supply was very poor in terms of availability and variations in voltage and frequency. Three biomass energy technologies \u2013 leaf litter-based biogas, dung-based biogas and biomass gasifiers were identified for meeting the villagers\u2019 energy needs. It was evident that although the proposed technologies were technically feasible for large-scale deployment, they could not have been propagated without addressing a number of barriers related, inter alia, to capacity \u2013 both at institutional and individual levels; finance, as they are capital-intensive; markets and policies, due to the subsidized energy prices of alternatives. The technological interventions proposed are based primarily on local resources. Biomass availability on a sustained basis requires dealing with other resources such as land, water and human contributions. Insufficient land, scarcity of water and lack of local people\u2019s participation become potential risks for the project. Participation at the local level as an integral component of the project was thus perceived as being inevitable. Consequently, the project\u2019s primary aim was promoting participatory approaches for meeting rural energy needs sustainably. The four components of the project were: 1.Demonstration of the technical feasibility and financial viability of bio-energy gasification technologies on a significant scale in a cluster of about 24 villages of Tumkur District in Karnataka for meeting irrigation and other electrical energy needs: biogas systems were designed to accommodate cooking gas, drinking water and lighting requirements. 2.Capacity building and development for appropriate mechanisms for implementation, management and monitoring of the project; the project proposed capacity building of Bio-energy Services Enterprises (BSEs) as a Rural Energy Service Company (RESCO) to overcome institutional barriers. Active networking with existing and new enterprises through implemen- tation arrangements identified potential BSEs. Customized training modules were then designed and developed, bearing in mind the needs and background of the project beneficiaries. 3.Development of financial, institutional and marketing strategies to overcome the barriers identified for large-scale replication of the bio-energy packages for decentralized applications outside Tumkur District and in parts of rural India.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c1334016-bd5e-4b12-bdec-dabd03e3c9ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "c1334016-bd5e-4b12-bdec-dabd03e3c9ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0d199b047d0a8b96283d08e180ed4c0c51db2f3a32d3357658691c339249e1d"}, "2": {"node_id": "fce21da7-a96b-4ba3-9d6f-9af5b8a1b55e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eddc25bdd25f44de94ed0c209384ed2e130d5eea8a075009833e9f4cacc013f4"}}, "hash": "4e9cdf74957ddbe4ba7c76c024beac07789be1b972dcb52d0886329d83fe3058", "text": "The project goal was to ensure that the fee-for-energy service approach would be able to recover all the operations and maintenance costs initially, and subsequently introduce schemes for recovery of the capital costs of the bio-energy systems.

The bank will identify the entrepreneurs and provide working capital; the entrepreneurs will, in turn, repay the bank from the revenue collected from the beneficiaries. The profits or surplus income earned could be set aside in a Special Fund, after providing for returns to the entrepreneur to provide seed money to entrepreneurs to establish bio-energy systems in new villages; \u2022 Panchayat \u2013 Entrepreneurs/NGOs: all project assets will be transferred to the panchayats, in consultation with the Zilla Parishad (District Administration). Zilla Parishad will provide the financial guarantee to the panchayats, who will take responsibility for the project. The panchayats will, in turn, identify NGOs or entrepreneurs and contract out the operation, maintenance and management of the bio-energy system for an agreed technical fee, but will own the assets. The surplus income will be set aside in a Special Fund to provide seed money for initiating bio- energy projects in other villages. 35 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Participatory approaches to rural energy supply: A case study of biomass energy for rural India P R O J E C T V I L L A G E S I N D I A T U M K U R K A R N ATA K A TUMKUR GUBBI SIRA KORATAGERE MADHUGIRI 1 2 3 5 4 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 19 18 21 20 22 23 24 25 26 27 Index 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 Village name Veerannana halli Sheebaiana palya K.T Halli Bore gunte Gidadagala Ranganahalli Gidadagala halli Obenahalli Chikkannana halli Kabbigere Ajjena halli Haldodderi Dasara halli Chikkarasana halli Venkatapura Salapurahalli Chikkaseebi Nelahal Gowdana halli Sore kunte Mallena halli Hunjanalu Sirivalli Halli Revanalu Anka sandra Thogari kunte Chikka hedigehalli Dodda hedigehalli Figure 4-1: Pilot projects\u2019 location 2.2 Project inception A series of village level exploratory and open-ended meetings were held to assess the needs of villagers on energy-related issues, and this provided a forum where villagers could propose possible solutions, which could be locally sustainable (i.e. without major dependence on the GOI or external sources).

The project originally planned to deploy biogas systems to be used for electricity generation in the provision of drinking water and lighting and for cooking based on the premise that it would not be economically viable to operate the gasifier at very low loads and capacity factors. During the detailed consultations held with various stakeholders, particularly communities, it was realized that it would not be practical to de-link from the local grid in the context of promoting a technology, but the project could supplement the supply. The electricity distribution company, Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (BESCOM), was losing money due to high transmission and distribution losses. As the emphasis is on improving the quality of energy services, a memorandum of understanding between BESCOM and the project was developed to allow the project to supply electricity to the villages in the target area. For BESCOM, this would minimize losses due to default or non-payment of electricity bills by consumers. BESCOM was further willing to hand over the entire area for distribution of the energy services through the project. Such a decision depends on the success of the pilot villages. 2.3 Implementation framework To implement the project, a number of participatory community organizations have either been set up or strengthened and these have been facilitated by a dedicated project team: \u2022 Village Bio-energy Management Committee (VBEMC): The VBEMC is responsible for the bio-energy services\u2019 package and the biomass gasifier system. The general body of the VBEMC consists of all the adult members of the village, and comprises a 15-member committee, elected by 36 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region Light irrigation crop in Karnataka, India the general body. Eventually, at least 30 percent of the members in the committee are expected to be women. \u2022 Village Forest Committee (VFC): The VFC establishes and manages plantations on institutional vacant land and also private land on lease (where owners have been keeping the land fallow either due to low productivity of agricultural crops or absence of landowners in the village). It is expected that most of the produce will go to the gasifier system. It is envisaged that approximately half of the requirements of the gasifier will be met by the VFCs, with the remainder being derived from private sources. \u2022 Water Users\u2019 Association (WUA): Each community bore well is expected to cater to ten to 20 farmers and is managed by a WUA. The association will evolve an agricultural development strategy for each cropping season and after consulting the members fix a cropping plan that has to be followed strictly by each member. Much sprinkler and drip irrigation will be adopted for efficient use of scarce water. Each WUA will be responsible for buying electricity from the VBEMC, and will charge individual farmers for water supplied on a volumetric basis, thereby encouraging water conservation. The group will also take up ground- water recharging structures in the area. Whereas part of the initial capital cost for pipelines is expected to be contributed by the members, the remainder will be raised from other sources. All operation and maintenance (O&M) costs are proposed to be recovered by the WUA so that the entire operation is sustainable in the long term. \u2022 Biogas Users\u2019 Group (BUG): The project proposes to install small community plants involving three to ten households, each plant being run by a BUG comprising the households. Initially the groups will look after the plants themselves, but in the long run, one or two operators can be appointed to operate all the plants in a village for a fee. \u2022 Self-help Groups (SHG): Several women\u2019s self- help, thrift and credit groups have already been formed in the project area under the World Bank-assisted Swashakti and the state govern- ment-sponsored Stree Shakti programmes. The project is strengthening these groups to take up income-generating activities that will enhance family incomes in order to facilitate cost recovery for energy services. These groups will be trained in various skills and also on how to use energy- driven devices for better productivity. In addition, linkages with other partners such as NGOs, entrepreneurs, research and financial institution and local bodies are being established at appropriate levels. 37 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Participatory approaches to rural energy supply: A case study of biomass energy for rural India Panchayats Village management NGOs/SHG Entrepreneurs Consultant Target population Implementation Finance Project Management Unit Funding agencies Project Steering Commitee District Project Advisory Comittee Rural Development and Panchayat Raj: Project Director Figure 4-2: Current implementation arrangement 2.4 Management and coordination arrangements Initially it was", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "07b43ad8-3623-4cdc-93ba-e9f2ea52aa96": {"__data__": {"id_": "07b43ad8-3623-4cdc-93ba-e9f2ea52aa96", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ed785258cb285b67f8d6c5713324cb1fa6cca1bc0071fe7e2c4c375fa3aac40"}}, "hash": "3ed785258cb285b67f8d6c5713324cb1fa6cca1bc0071fe7e2c4c375fa3aac40", "text": "proposed to house the team with the Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology (KSCST), the implementing agency of the project.

Emerging lessons Although the project is in early stages of implementation, the lessons that can be learned are significant. 3.1 Analyses of barriers and risks The present focus of the project is only on the pilot demonstration in Tumkur and largely reflects the barriers at that level. Further barrier removal strategies could be implemented subsequently for large-scale replication of bio-energy technologies for rural energy services. \u2022 Technical barriers: Barring a few technology suppliers, who supply models to designers to produce gasifier systems, there is very little information openly or commercially available to facilitate decisions on performance specifications, size and costs. Based on consultations with different stakeholders who are experienced with gasifiers, and as recognized in the project development phase, the technology of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) is at the most advanced stage. Thus, it was decided to deploy IISc gasifiers for the first cluster. For subsequent clusters, approaches would be evolved to address issues related to the technology transfer and third party certification on standards and performance of gasifier systems. \u2022 Institutional barriers: There are few institutions at the local level that deal with energy issues. Efforts are being made to develop capacity at the local level by drawing appropriate linkages with village-level institutions. The experience in the first cluster of villages for implementation of bio-energy services\u2019 packages in rural areas shows that the extent of participation of village groups \u2013 self-help groups, village level institutions and NGOs has been satisfactory. From the institutional barriers\u2019 perspective, use of partici- patory groups, linkages with local bodies and synergizing with government programmes could be effective for provision of energy services. Also, community involvement in baseline determination, monitoring and evaluation yields better results and lower costs. \u2022 Information barriers: There is a lack of awareness and information on viable technological configurations, which impedes promotion of these technologies. Villagers were not aware of the full range of bio-energy technologies and were taken to a nearby village to observe the gasifiers in operation; this subsequently led to better appreciation and greater involvement of the people. \u201cSeeing is believing\u201d is valid for promoting the adoption of bio-energy technologies. Cohesiveness and the confidence level of the villagers were realized and raised through visits to existing small gasifier plants, tree-based farming systems, nurseries raised by women\u2019s groups and a community biogas plant run by village women. This also illustrated that village communities are ready to accept a new technology if its benefits are perceived directly by them. Primary sources of information are vital for communities to adopt a new technology. However, this requires awareness-raising and guided demonstration. \u2022 Financial barriers: It was evident from the initial consultations, participatory rural appraisals (PRAs) and baseline surveys that the high level of initial investments would be a barrier. However, if the proposed services are provided, there is considerable scope for developing innovative mechanisms for recovery of the costs of providing services. Low-income levels of the villagers, 38 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region Use of participatory groups, linkages with local bodies and synergizing with government programmes could be effective for provision of energy services. the challenges of successive droughts and the availability of subsidized low cost alternatives have limited financial access. The villagers in the first cluster have shown willingness to contribute towards the full recovery of operation and maintenance (O&M), and there is an understanding about the need to recover the capital costs. \u2022 Market barriers: Bio-energy technologies often have to compete with conventional sources of energy either with subsidized electricity and fossil fuel (kerosene) options or freely accessible fuelwood and biomass residues. In such situations, absence of a \u201clevel playing field\u201d acts as a key barrier to market penetration. Some anticipated risks did not manifest themselves and proposed mitigation measures were adopted successfully. So far, the project has managed successfully the risk of non-participation through effective implementation strategies. The risk of limited government involvement turned out to be higher than the initial perception.

However community involvement in selection of species and providing livelihood opportunities to women through the nursery helped to mobilize private land resources. Increased autonomy for the PMU was seen as a key driver for the success of the project, and hence the necessity to institutionalize it as an independent entity. Another key risk not visualized at the time of project development was the potential of limited interface between the implementing agencies of the project at its development phase and the full project. Additionally, there were some misconceptions on the roles of different stakeholders. Finally, technology risks are much higher than expected at the time of project conception. There are only a limited number of biomass gasifier installations that continuously generate electricity for distribution in a cluster of villages of this scale. 39 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Participatory approaches to rural energy supply: A case study of biomass energy for rural India Biogas for cooking Electricity for irrigation and drinking water services Energy Provision of drinking water supply Groundwater recharge - network of ponds Water Fuelwood substituted by biogas improves cooking environment with reduced pollution in kitchen Reliable lighting in the evening reduces eye strain Health Energy plantations Agroforestry Nursery raising as a livelihood option Mixed species Biodiversity Improved productivity of dry lands Reliable irrigation services Developing cropping strategy to maximize productivity, using optimal resources Agriculture/land Note: There are concrete links between energy and environmental sustainability that are evident in this project and this can be considered in using the WEHAB framework as a tool for analysis. Figure 4-3:WEHAB framework of the project 3.2 WEHAB context for energy and environmental sustainability The project\u2019s influence on WEHAB was analysed; it had a positive effect on each of the five elements. This is illustrated in Figure 4-3. Water: The project required the drilling of additional community bore wells for providing irriga- tion water. Since the area had already exploited groundwater resources, the district has been classified as a grey area, which indicates that there may be low groundwater levels. Thus efforts were made to link with the ongoing initiatives of the World Bank and the state government to facilitate construction of water- harvesting structures to ensure adequate recharge. Biomass-based energy interventions enable a watershed approach that leads to groundwater recharge on a sustained basis to ensure additional water requirements for biomass production and dry land irrigation. Agriculture/land: Biomass-based energy interven- tions offer solutions through effective use of the land. Biomass crops as perennials can reduce soil erosion and restore fertility through avoidance of agrochemical application. Compared with food crops like cereals, application rates of agrochemicals per hectare are one-fifth to one-twentieth for perennial energy crops. Appropriate selection of species ensures biodiversity and improves the landscape when degraded lands and other wastelands are used for biomass production. Improved land cover through vegetation leads to water retention and improved microclimatic conditions with potential positive hydrological situations at the local level. The project ensures effective management of land resources. Ergo, plantations for gasifiers have all these advantages. Biodiversity: Long-term sustainability of biomass supply in the project prevents exclusive dependence on fast growing monoculture plantations, which could have supplied the fuelwood for biomass gasifiers. The need to consider biodiversity issues was essential for agroforestry, and supplying farm forestry with multiple species further helped the villagers to improve their livelihoods. Thus there is greater acceptance by the communities as well as the provision of fuelwood for the gasifiers. Additional income is generated too. Health: Biogas replaces fuelwood cooking stoves and consequently reduces air pollution. Women and children, in particular, benefit as carbon monoxide levels and particulate levels inside homes using fuelwood in traditional stoves are reduced; currently these levels far exceed the permissible levels. They cause respiratory problems, damage to eyes and interfere with the blood\u2019s ability to absorb oxygen; other health-related problems occur as well. E n e r g y / e n v i r o n m e n t : Renewable energy technologies, which include biomass, are considered as potential GHG mitigation options. Deploying biomass energy technologies could minimize the impacts of climate change on sea levels, ecosystems, water, agriculture, food and health. 3.3 Inherent linkages to UNDP development practices The project has direct linkage to poverty reduction through energy-service support such as assured irrigation for particularly poor communities, and mechanisms to provide water rights for the landless to address equity issues; community income generation is subsequently enhanced.

The involvement of local bodies has enhanced the quality of implementation and provided a forum to address sustainability issues. Therefore, all the community groups involved in the project are proposed to be declared as subcommittees of the local bodies. All the elected members of the local bodies have been given ex-officio member status in these local level organizations. This has enhanced synergy between the local bodies and the project. In terms of crisis prevention and recovery, the project could be a classical approach to deal with drought and dry lands. The environmentally friendly technologies arrest GHG emissions and thus contribute to mitigating climate risk-associated disasters in the short term and climate change impacts over the long term. The project is deploying information communication technologies to address a number of barriers that relate to technology, information, institutions and markets. The HIV/AIDS linkage is less direct. However, participatory approaches adopted in the project entail sensitivity to overall developmental issues and interventions and in this context, the project has supported health camps. While the project itself falls mainly under the energy and environment practice, gender perspectives have been integrated fully in project activities. Energy issues are core livelihood issues for women in rural areas. The project has ensured the participation of women and men in managing the supply as well as the use of energy services. Modern energy options reduce the drudgery of household work as they reduce time taken for cooking, collection of fuelwood, collection of drinking water and save time that potentially enhances household income from other activities. 4. Interim conclusions There is a growing realization for linking energy sources and uses. Energy sources are explicitly linked to other natural resources. In rural areas, energy is sourced primarily from biomass. However, the current practices restrict its use in different forms. Modern biomass energy conversion technologies, such as those proposed by the project, provide energy services for enhancing the quality of life of people in rural areas. These technologies also ensure environmental sustain- ability, the seventh Millennium Development Goal, which is part of the UN Millennium Declaration. The analysis of the project within the context of analytical frameworks (e.g. WEHAB and UNDP practice areas) indicates its continued relevance not only at the conceptual level but also at practical or field levels. Access to modern energy services in rural areas faces a number of challenges. Community involve- ment and participation are essential for tackling energy-related issues in the rural areas. Suitability and availability of technologies do not guarantee their diffusion, as this depends on various factors. While technology-related barriers remain, for reasons that have been discussed in this case study, there are other socio-economic and political reasons for limited energy access in rural areas. This necessitates developing innovative institu- tions and extensive capacity building for decentralized generation and distribution of energy services. The project particularly attempts to address this gap by adopting partici- patory approaches to meet rural energy needs sustainably. The impacts of participatory approaches adopted so far also raise important issues. These processes are intensive and sensitive, and could be time- consuming. The institutional mechanisms may become complex due to the different priorities of the stakeholders involved at the local level. As noted earlier, water is a priority, but ensuring water supply without degrading the groundwater table may not be high on the agenda. On the other hand, local needs are clearly spelt out. If these needs are met, then the long-term sustainability of the development interventions is ensured. Participation would thus be a critical factor for sustainability. This further ensures convergence and the cost effectiveness of development interventions. 41 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Participatory approaches to rural energy supply: A case study of biomass energy for rural India Community involvement and participation are essential for tackling energy-related issues. 42 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region Acknowledgements Asia\u2013Pacific region The author expresses sincere thanks to Ms Nadine Smith whose constant follow-up and positive feedback helped in the writing of this paper.

Background and context This paper presents the results of a case study on the performance of two microhydro development projects in Indonesia, the funding of which was partly provided by the GEF/SGP. Where linkage to the Water, Energy, Health, Agriculture, Biodiversity (WEHAB) initiative is concerned, the projects are relevant in the sense that they deal with Energy and to some extent Water. In addition to addressing the overall performance of these projects, the study highlights the interlinkage among environmental benefits, benefits of income-generating activities at the community level and the potential of project duplication under the country\u2019s current economic reform and liberalization of the power sector. 43 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Microhydro case study: The Garung and Seloliman projects in Indonesia Ucok W.R. Siagian30 30 Energy Research and Development Group, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Indonesia. Chapter 5 Abstract Microhydro resources in Indonesia, which constitute approximately 450 MW, have great potential to cater to the electricity demand of rural communities. However, microhydro development has been very slow due to several barriers, including, inter alia, high initial investment in the microhydro system, lack of familiarity with the system (especially in rural areas) and lack of government policy to support the development of microhydro schemes (the oil price has been kept low, lack of incentives for microhydro projects). In addition to these barriers, past experiences suggest that insufficient preparation of the recipient community usually leads to difficulties in maintaining the sustainability of the installed microhydro system. This paper presents a case study concerning microhydro development projects, namely, Garung project in West Java Province and Seloliman project in East Java Province of Indonesia; it deals with the removal of barriers related to initial investment and weak project preparation. The paper highlights the interlinkage among environmental benefits, benefits from income-generating activities at the community level, project impacts, the potential for project duplication under the country\u2019s current economic reform and liberalization of the ower sector. In these microhydro projects, aside from installing microhydro units, the project activities also include efforts to improve the welfare of the recipient community by stimulating income-generating activities at the community level. To date, the two projects can be considered successful in terms of their ability to deliver electricity to rural communities and to improve the local community\u2019s organizational skills.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84977118-323a-4a9c-aeb0-8efcd2c122ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "84977118-323a-4a9c-aeb0-8efcd2c122ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53cc49373a2c7d50df035a2c74af6d8cea6701bebf1b20573b45e1b39cce992e"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe178e8e-8d40-40f3-bd06-35a6b2fd9efa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eda4a14ce12c91401ae4127f24713394783d48a1a353e7b00aa8b39aaceaa965"}}, "hash": "f5188abcd648b4f9492e839afab0ad2206af30a09282011eb2c4b926d54ebc98", "text": "The lessons learned from the two projects include: (i) a successful project is the outcome of thorough preparatory work including bottom-up initiatives, coordination of mutual interests at the earliest stage of the programme and appropriate and sufficient programme supervision; (ii) an income-generating advocacy component embedded as part of the microhydro deployment programme is insufficient to improve the income of the local community; (iii) a soft loan combined with a grant to remove the high initial investment barrier appears to be a good model for promoting the wider use of a small-scale microhydro system.

Table 5-1 provides important statistics related to Indonesia as a whole. 1.1 Latest developments in Indonesia\u2019s energy policy Energy prices are regulated by the government; the prices of some fuels and electricity tariffs for some segments of electricity consumers are subsidized. To reduce the financial burden of energy subsidies, steps have been taken recently to remove energy subsidies gradually. Energy subsidies are planned for complete removal by 2005. Through power sector reform, as represented by the Electricity Law (2002), the state utility (PLN) is expected to become a more efficient and competitive commercial entity. One of the implications of this reform is that the PLN\u2019s social burden such as the rural electrification programme has been lessened significantly. It is expected that local government will take up the PLN\u2019s duty in the rural electrification programme. In order to increase renewable energy resource utilization in 2001 the government issued a ministerial decree stating that the PLN is obliged to purchase renewable-based electricity offered by small/ medium enterprises (SMEs), namely the PSK Tersebar Scheme.31 The Regional Autonomy Law of 1999 regulates the system of regional government; it also has implications in the development of energy in rural areas.

For the sake of simplicity, the former will be referred to as the Garung Project and the latter as the Seloliman Project. To avoid confusion relating to the terms \u201cpikohydro\u201d and \u201cmicrohydro\u201d, the hydropower plants in the two projects will be termed microhydro because their generating capacity falls within the same class. The Garung Project started in July 2001 and the microhydro power plant was commissioned in April 2002 (project proposal: March 2001 to February 2002). The Seloliman Project began in August 2000 and was completed in July 2001. Therefore, as far as the SGP is concerned, the two projects have finished. A short description of the two projects is given in Table 5-2. 3. Project objectives and expected outputs According to the project document, the Garung Project objectives include: (i) to develop the capacity of local technicians to install and operate a microhydro unit; (ii) to stimulate income improvement by using electricity and (iii) to increase the value of local natural resources for improving rural economy through electricity generation. 45 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Microhydro case study: The Garung and Seloliman projects in Indonesia Key features Project location Garung,West Java Seloliman, East Java Plant capacity 15 kW 23 kW Water head 19 metres, 140 litres/second 11 metres, 300 litres/second Grid connected No Yes Operating hours Daily, 1800 to 0600 24 hours Electricity uses Lighting for 78 houses Lighting for 39 houses, an office complex, 2 productive users, sold to state grid Current load 8 kW 21 kW Financing Loan and GEF/SGP grant GEF/SGP grant Project executing agency POKLAN (NGO) Konsorsium Seloliman (NGO) Table 5-2: Project characteristics Note: Both the Garung and Seloliman plants use a cross-flow turbine manufactured by PT Heksa Prakarsa Teknik (an Indonesian company located in Bandung,West Java Province).

The objectives of the Seloliman Project are: (i) to provide environmentally friendly energy alternatives; (ii) to provide education media and to raise the community\u2019s awareness on energy alternatives; (iii) to build community knowledge on sound utilization of natural resources; (iv) to increase the community standard of living via the development of economic activities using electricity; (v) to increase community awareness and community involvement in conserving the water catchment area in Seloliman protected forest; (vi) to establish a strong local cooperative, which will maintain the facility and its related activities (such as a revolving fund for productive activities) and (vii) to establish the community\u2019s shared ownership (managed through a cooperative) of the microhydro facility. The expected outputs of the Seloliman Project are: (i) optimized use of water resources; (ii) microhydro installation as an electricity generator as well as an educational medium (demonstration unit); (iii) emergence of productive electricity usage; (iv) increased community welfare and educational support activities; (v) a professional local cooperative managing the microhydro installation; and (vi) a clear ownership scheme of the microhydro facility. 4. Project inputs For Garung, there are two external funding sources: a grant under the SGP/GEF programme and a soft loan from YBUL. The GEF/SGP grant (US$25,000) was used to finance the preparation of the local community in the adoption of microhydro technology including programmes for stimulating income-generating activities at the community level. The loan from YBUL was used to finance the construction of the microhydro plant. According to its initial plan, five microhydro units were to be installed in three villages in West Java (one unit in Cipangramatan, two units in Dewata tea plantation and three units in Batu Ireng).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c6fcead-b45b-4dda-91aa-211379661da6": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c6fcead-b45b-4dda-91aa-211379661da6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c853f7a84ee7e9f248709bf1b4838432876d5e2eb8b4cea498a1a4d362df926a"}, "2": {"node_id": "3396b372-9be8-47e7-ab11-0df7dc1a4584", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28d898be7e9ce3d446b7437a9c2c63c5e268afdfb360b84b50ca8faa54d4ca62"}}, "hash": "926e1730e5f4e93a604a21a22a1c500ac0bcc07cd4d0f502cda454856b40e9c0", "text": "46 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region Java Jakarta Bandung I N D I A N O C E A N J AVA S E A Krakatau Islands Solo Semarang Surabaya Pulau Madura Yogyakarata Garung Cisompet Garut Seloliman Trawas Mojokerto I N D O N E S I A JAVA PACIFIC OCEAN INDIAN OCEAN J AVA Figure 5-1: Projects\u2019 Location The Cipangramatan plan was cancelled because the PLN (state utility) was extending its grid to the village.

Community development programmes and necessary preparation for microhydro installation had been carried out at these sites by POKLAN. During the project\u2019s implementation, however, POKLAN has not been successful in obtaining the necessary funding for the microhydro units that was expected from other donor agencies. In response to the high community expectancy for a microhydro running in their villages, YBUL then took the initiative to finance the micro- hydro construction. However, due to limited funding capacity, YBUL could finance the Garung Project only. This site was selected because it was consi- dered the cheapest and the most ready compared to the other two sites. The financing scheme is a soft loan (zero interest). The Garung microhydro construction was completed and commissioned in April 2002. In June 2002 Garung community representatives, POKLAN, GEF/ SGP and YBUL agreed that sub- sequent supervision activities for the Garung Project were to be undertaken by YBUL. Since then, one field officer working for YBUL has been stationed at this site. In addition to the funding sources, the local community also provides inputs to the project in the form of workforces and materials for the civil work of the plant (equivalent to approximately US$2,500). The installation cost to connect 75 houses to the microhydro grid (US$2,650) was borne by the connected house. The loan for microhydro construction (US$10,500) is to be repaid by the community from profits generated from operating the microhydro (electricity sales minus operation and maintenance costs). The capacity upgrading of Seloliman microhydro was financed using a GEF/SGP grant (US$27,388). The grant package also included financing for community development activities including initiatives for strengthening income-generating activities at the community level and productive usage of electricity. The grant was proposed by the Seloliman Consortium. The consortium, which was established for the GEF/SGP project, consists of two local NGOs namely: the Center for Environmental Education (abbreviated to PPLH) and LEM21 (an NGOs in Seloliman). The focal agency of the consortium is the PPLH. Similar to the Garung case, the Seloliman community also provided inputs to the project in the form of workforces during the microhydro installation. 5. Community background Garung community is located in a remote and mountainous area and can be reached via a semi-hard road using a motorcycle or a sport utility vehicle (SUV). The community comprises mostly subsistence farmers working with fixed land in and around the village. The educational level of the people is low; around 77 percent of the adults have only elementary school education and therefore their reading and writing are poor. The community has a strong spirit of collaboration and an open culture. They are experienced in organizing themselves to work in occa- sional community activities such as simple road improvement and mosque construction. The community, however, has no experience in managing activities/endeavours that are more regular in nature such as the management and operation of a microhydro power plant. Prior to the microhydro project implementation, the Garung community was already familiar with the concept of generating electricity by harnessing water resources because they had observed one of the community members own and run a small hydropower plant in the village. Due to technical problems, this plant was eventually abandoned by the owner. Concerning house- hold lighting, prior to the microhydro installation the community used kerosene lamps. Besides illumination, there are practically no economic activities that require electric power or that could be improved by the existence of an electricity supply. The farthest houses that are electrified are around two kilometres from the microhydro power plant. 47 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Microhydro case study: The Garung and Seloliman projects in Indonesia In addition to the funding sources,the local community also provides inputs to the project in the form of workforces and materials for the civil work of the plant. In fact, the community could access electricity from the PLN\u2019s 220 V grid. Several houses in the community are connected to the grid but they are relatively distant from it and the quality of the electricity is low (the voltage at the houses is only around 170 V). Also, this distance makes the connection cost to the grid very high and unaffordable for most of the community.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5e02179-1230-477e-8089-afe3296abe94": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5e02179-1230-477e-8089-afe3296abe94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fdfa3f8feb00de2cd2d95e0a29e8df242e79c9f384ba854df12bcb418720994b"}, "2": {"node_id": "dfe121b1-1b85-4583-bb38-ee9d18d198d1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b28e5137125cc13feb0e0552801a0e9607134cc4228a397b2f3dc0ac185ad80e"}}, "hash": "4ded9ccd431ba0322d9d2c597a861715c7f6884ad8fcb56917d005db3e3e6713", "text": "Seloliman is the name of a subdistrict in Mojokerto District, East Java Province.

Janjing is located in a remote area. It can be reached by foot or motorcycle. The community consists mostly of farmers working with fixed land around the village. Prior to the GEF/SGP project implementation, a microhydro installation (12 kW) was already in place. The installation was built in 1994 by the Mandiri Foundation under a GTZ32-funded project and was operated under the management of the PPLH. The original plan of the GTZ project was to use the microhydro to electrify the PPLH office complex and the previously mentioned three subvillages. However, in the same year the PLN grid reached this site. Sempur and Biting were connected to the PLN\u2019s grid while the PPLH complex and Janjing community were connected to the microhydro installation. The PPLH maximum consumption was around 5 kW while the connected 30 houses in Janjing had a power limit of 200 watts/house. The power plant management considered that the capacity of the existing plant needed to be upgraded since the plant experienced overload periodically. In 2000, the PPLH together with LEM21 requested a GEF/SGP grant for capacity upgrade to 32 kW. The GEF/SGP project proposal also included a plan to undertake community development activities. The microhydro upgrading work was completed in 2000 and the plant has been operational since then. The turbine, generator and related control systems were all replaced with higher capacity components. The system uses the previously existing water supply system and powerhouse. 6. Project experience Project preparations for Garung and Seloliman were performed carefully including resource surveys, community participatory approaches and advocacy activities. Community responses were very good. They have been participating actively since the planning stage of the programme including the negotiation of a loan repayment scheme and the amount of monthly installment. This participation is due in part to the fact that the community needs electricity for lighting. They had witnessed the comfort of electric lighting demonstrated by their neighbours who were already connected to the PLN\u2019s grid. As mentioned previously the majority of the community cannot afford the PLN\u2019s electricity, especially the high initial connection cost. So, when the programme offered a microhydro electricity system with much lower connection costs compared to the PLN, the community supported the programme eagerly. The connection cost to the PLN\u2019s grid at this site ranges between US$180 and 240 (depending on the distance of the house to the grid) while the connection cost to the microhydro unit is only US$40. As part of community preparation, both the Garung and Seloliman programmes established local community organizations (LCOs). In Garung the LCO is called the LPKM while in Seloliman it is called the PKM. This was done before the programme began microhydro construction activities. In Garung, the LCO officials comprised a chairperson, a secretary, a treasurer and two microhydro operators. They were elected democratically by the community for a four-year service term. Inspection of the LCO operation is performed by the official community head 48 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region 32 Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit. When the programme offered a microhydro electricity system with much lower connection costs compared to the PLN, the community supported the programme eagerly. and one prominent member of the community. The latter was also determined through election by the community. In Seloliman, the LCO has two groups of officials namely: the daily working group, which is responsible for the daily operation of the microhydro installation, and an advisory group. The PKM daily working group consists of a chairperson, a treasurer and operators. The advisory body consists of individuals representing the microhydro stakeholders, i.e. two persons from the PPLH (one of them chairs the LCO), two persons representing customers from Janjing Village and one person representing Sempur Village. Both in Garung and Seloliman, LCO management is carried out according to written rules drafted and agreed by the community. Under the supervision of the implementing agency, the LCO organized meetings to prepare a microhydro construction plan, negotiation of electricity tariffs among the community, some environmental advocacy activities and adminis- tration of the rural economic development programme.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05dc6542-2a10-4511-8cf0-df9494ad0144": {"__data__": {"id_": "05dc6542-2a10-4511-8cf0-df9494ad0144", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f28ddb4b6a14c65f540d9b5cc675e633f09ebc5b0d0c9bb074ca6646627289e"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb4bc1a4-a31a-4a14-9253-15a35c085209", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "deca140d0489d957b167995690571643c5821b4de3de4c25127cd0aef4407c11"}}, "hash": "798cf10d6f8f8e6afe4de0cf80c6ed2e97d3c474c546fbff4f8a2b70c0179a27", "text": "Bottom-up initiatives, the participatory approach, coordination of mutual interests at the earliest stage of the programme, commitment, clear definition of roles and responsibilities for all parties and appropriate and sufficient programme supervision are probably the reasons why, within the context of renewable-based rural electrification, this project is considered successful. 6.1.

There are two aspects of sustainability that need to be addressed: technical sustainability of the microhydro unit and loan repayment sustainability. As far as technical sustainability is concerned, microhydro is considered a simple and established technology with a simple maintenance requirement; thus no major technical problems from the unit itself are expected. Local microhydro operators, who have received technical training through the programme, appear to be able to handle the system\u2019s operation and maintenance. For handling major technical problems, they continue to need outside help. If this occurs, the closest location for assistance (metal work, spare parts, an electrician) is around 40 km from the site and therefore it is not expected that a long system breakdown will take place. The same situation applies to Seloliman. The availability of sufficient water resources is a problem in Garung micro hydropower project as it uses water from a river collected through a previously existing channel used to irrigate the farm land of the community. Currently, some of the water flowing through the channel (upstream of the microhydro) is also used to irrigate the land. During a relatively long dry season, as experienced in 2002, the water resource could not serve both the microhydro and the farm land. Owing to this problem, and based on the results of a community meeting, the water was prioritized for the farm land and the microhydro was shut down for 13 days. Another problem was the blocking of water channels due to landslides during heavy rainfall, causing a system shutdown. The channel was repaired by the community at practically no cost since they worked on a voluntary basis using material available on site. It is important that the members of community need to be taught and made aware of the importance of water catchment maintenance for irrigation water and the micro hydropower project. 49 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Microhydro case study: The Garung and Seloliman projects in Indonesia Micro hydropower house in Garung So far, no water problem has been experienced by the Seloliman microhydro. However, the Seloliman LCO is concerned about recent deforestation activities (converted to farm land) within the catchment areas of the micro hydropower project, which may decrease the availability of water. Since the catchment area is beyond the management of the LCO, the Seloliman LCO has been requesting the local authority (the water conservation board) to help stop the ongoing deforestation activities. Concerning the loan repayment of the Garung microhydro, which under current repayment rates would take 12 years to complete, its sustainability depends on the technical sustainability of the plant and the livelihood of the community. As described later, the programme appears to have an impact on the community\u2019s income. Therefore, it is expected that as long as the microhydro functions satisfactorily, the loan repayment will be sustained. It is assumed that there will be no sustainability problems with the community\u2019s compliance in paying off the loan because the community was well-informed in advance that the microhydro financing was a loan instead of a grant and had to be repaid via their monthly electricity bills. The electricity tariff, which is around US$1.76 per month for roughly 100 watts power limit, resulted from community consensus. Currently, the community\u2019s discipline in paying their electricity bills has been good. With regard to the power system performance, while most of Garung\u2019s customers are satisfied with the quality of electricity supply there is an important technical issue that needs to be addressed by the LCO. A number of customers complained that the circuit breakers in their houses tripped when they used 60 watts (nominal) load while the circuit breaker is specified for 0.5 amperes (roughly equivalent to around 100 watts). Meanwhile, other houses with the same power limit could install 80-watt bulbs without any problem. As the electricity bill is determined based on the installed power limit, regardless of the wattage used, the customers who get less power for the same bill feel they are being unfairly treated by the LCO. If this equity issue is not addressed and resolved properly, payment delinquency by dissatisfied customers, jealousy among the community members and subsequent local conflicts could arise, which in the long run could jeopardize the sustainability of the power plant. No such problem is experienced in Seloliman since the electricity bill is based on energy consumed and recorded by the kWh meters installed in each house. 6.2. Seloliman Project The Seloliman micro hydropower project has been operating for around two years without major problems.

The average installed capacity of the residential consumers is 450 VA. The two productive users have installed capacity of 3.2 kVA (total) while the PPLH complex has total installed capacity of 5 kVA. Each consumer is equipped with a kWh meter. Residential consumers use the electricity mostly for lighting. Only some of the consumers have TV sets, radios and electrical kitchen- ware. The plant is operated 23 hours a day (one hour off in the morning for maintenance). Realizing that the local consum- ption is still low and the fact that the site is located close to the PLN grid (around 50 metres), the PKM applied for excess power sales to the PLN, utilizing the PSK Tersebar Scheme. After much paperwork among different agencies, a power purchase agreement was signed in November 2003 and the plant has been selling excess electricity to the PLN since 5 December, 2003. The grid interconnection cost was financed by GTZ through a loan (US$12,700) and a grant (US$6,000). According to a recent load test conducted by the PLN the maximum power of the plant is 21 kW. This is probably attributable to an insufficient water rate since the plant uses a previously existing water supply system (piped) that was designed for smaller unit (12 kW). During the day, the plant sells 16 kW to the PLN and the remaining 5 kW to local consumers (the local community and the PPLH complex). Between 1800 and 2100, local consumption uses 12 kW and 9 kW is sold to the PLN. After 2100 the power sale is the same as during the day. 50 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region Power purchase agreement was signed in November 2003 and the plant has been selling excess electricity to the PLN. Since the unit is considered to be still in its early stages, the system\u2019s sustainability still needs to be proven. However, since the PPLH already has good experience in micro hydropower management, as far as technical sustainability is concerned, sustainability seems to be promising. The main consideration is the funding for major repairs/ overhaul in the future. The funds have to be accumulated from the monthly electricity bill paid by local customers and also from power sales to the PLN. The community\u2019s electricity tariff is divided into two components namely: fixed cost (varies between US$0.35 and 1.75/month depending on the power limit) and variable cost (ranges from US$1.00 to 1.4/kWh \u2013 the higher the consump- tion the higher the tariff). This tariff is lower than that of the PLN\u2019s for the same power limit (fixed cost: US60 cents to US$4.7/month, variable cost: US2.00 to 4.8 cents/kWh). Without power sales to the PLN (prior to December 2003), the electricity bill income collected from local consumers was only sufficient for paying operators and simple mainte- nance costs. Any increase in electricity tariffs is difficult because the consumers recall the past when they paid only US23.5 cents/month for a 200-watt power limit; there is also the issue of the low purchasing power of the community. Power sales to the PLN, which are around US5.3 cents/kWh, help to improve the economics of the plant. Now management should be able to save some money as a reserve for future system overhaul/major repairs. Power sales to the PLN help to improve the sustainability of the power plant and therefore could help to encourage others to duplicate the scheme. Seloliman is the first microhydro unit that was interconnected to the PLN utilizing the newly introduced PSK Tersebar Scheme. Officials from the Seloliman microhydro management (PKM) suggest that the mechanisms for implementing PSK Tersebar are discouraging because the paperwork for obtaining the power sales\u2019 agreement is too excessive and complicated. To help promote and encourage wider implementation of the PSK Tersebar Scheme, the relevant electricity regulating agency needs to devise implementation mechanisms that are less bureaucratic. 7. Project impact 7.1 Impact on the local economy While a portion of the SGP/GEF fund in both the Garung and Seloliman projects was intended to stimulate new income-generating activities at the community level, at the current stage it can be concluded that the projects did not have any economic impact on the local community.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66e99fe9-bf17-4a9c-a54a-5726751d6398": {"__data__": {"id_": "66e99fe9-bf17-4a9c-a54a-5726751d6398", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "322890995957e6d2cbc712c85dbde8fa631383607dd8159a3b1e12c17d5ec589"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f988a7b-b63d-4e1c-be90-70788cf441f4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "83167af440ef9b7dfd5d41ed3e404154fa4be2caebadce61626823ff958e7f77"}}, "hash": "27e1578b1b71b0cfdb5bbcfa6d0faf66a08edc178f82c9d2f98c94103ee70d68", "text": "In Garung, the GEF/SGP grant was used to encourage several families to enter small businesses such as production of banana crisps, banana chips, coconut oil and fish farming.

The primary reasons are probably because the members of the community are farmers working on an individual basis. They have no experience of working on a collective basis. The LCO may need to try to encourage a business setting on a collective basis. At the moment, the communities perceive that the activities offered to improve their income are not closely linked to their own immediate concerns; they tend to be satisfied if they can feed their families and there seems to be no sufficient motivation to enter into new endeavours other than farming. Another factor is the daily routine on the farm and other daily activities that already consume much of their physical energy. This shows that it is difficult to transform a farmer into an entrepreneur. The only new economic activities generated by the microhydro installation are small service businesses run by the LCO; i.e. battery charging, milling for coconut, flour and coffee. The customers for battery charging come from other villages that have no access to electricity. The income from this business is considered as LCO income. Compared to the income collected from electricity sales, the milling and battery-charging income is insignificant. 51 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Microhydro case study: The Garung and Seloliman projects in Indonesia Communities perceive that the activities offered to improve their income are not closely linked to their own immediate concerns. Payment of electricity bills by the community does not seem to cause an additional expenditure burden on the community since the tariff is only slightly higher than that previously spent for buying kerosene for their lighting needs. Also, the community perceives that this slight increase is equal to the comfort and service they now enjoy from having their houses connected to the electric power supply. To improve the economics of the project, the LCO may need to consider selling electricity from Garung Project to the PLN grid utilizing the PSK Tersebar Scheme. Although this site is relatively far from the PLN grid (around three kilometres), interconnection with the PLN grid is technically possible. The LCO needs to assess the economic feasibility of power sales to the PLN including possible financing of the interconnection cost. An increase in local power demand in coming years has to be anticipated and considered in the economic assessment. In Seloliman a grant for upgrading the equipment of a cotton-cleaning business has been provided to encourage productive use of electricity. However, the upgrading appar- ently has had no effect on the economics of the business. Four out of seven personnel who formerly worked at this plant have left, indicating that the business is probably unattractive. It is therefore not surprising that no one in the community tried to emulate the cotton-cleaning business. The only beneficiary of the economic programme at this site is the cotton business owner (acquiring an upgraded blower and a cheaper electricity tariff compared to the PLN). Another productive use of electricity in this area is using recycled paper- slurry and small handicraft-making activities. Prior to the micro hydropower installation, existing businesses used power from the PLN. The only effect that could be attributed to the microhydro plant is the availability of cheaper electricity from it. With regard to the current electricity tariff, the Seloliman community considers it to be too expensive. For the community, the new microhydro installation has a negative economic impact. Prior to the microhydro capacity upgrade, the community paid IDR2,000/month for a 200-watt power limit. This tariff, however, was in fact too low because it was determined in 1994 and based on kerosene consumption that has been replaced by electricity. Since the kerosene price in 2002 was already two times higher than that of the 1994 price, expecting the electricity tariff to remain at the 1994 level was unrealistic. The PPLH, the former operator of the old microhydro system did not increase the electricity tariff during the six-year microhydro operation because the community had low purchasing power and therefore the power supply to the community was more out of charity than a commercial venture. With the new microhydro unit, the Seloliman LCO may need to start educating the community concerning the value of energy by slowly increasing the electricity tariff to a realistic but affordable level. By doing so, the microhydro operation would become more profitable, and therefore enhance its sustainability; at the same time the community would be encouraged to work harder and generate more income. Part of the accumulated fund can also be used to help finance initiatives for improving the income of the community. 7.2 Impact on", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02c0331b-b933-49aa-9ef2-1c16a2717d52": {"__data__": {"id_": "02c0331b-b933-49aa-9ef2-1c16a2717d52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7bfe7f01ed6fed30936f3e57eb4c401f52f84449950b08b7ca58f806d67bd07e"}}, "hash": "7bfe7f01ed6fed30936f3e57eb4c401f52f84449950b08b7ca58f806d67bd07e", "text": "the environment The Garung and Seloliman microhydro projects fall within the climate change focal area of the SGP/GEF programme. Direct links between the project and climate change mitigation are limited to the removal of emissions from kerosene for lighting, which has been replaced by electric lighting. The microhydro uses the existing water channel that is used for irrigating the community\u2019s farm land. The community had awareness on maintaining water resources prior to the project\u2019s implementation. Now, because the water resources serve two purposes, it is expected that the commu- nity will be more aware of the importance of water channel maintenance. Awareness-raising in Garung and Seloliman on the importance of preserving the environment was conducted during the project\u2019s implementation. However, the impact of this effort cannot be judged at the current stage of the project because such impact is long term in nature. The community consists of farmers working with fixed land around the village. One of the possible 52 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region Power supply to the community was more out of charity than a commercial venture. environmental problems associated with this community is illegal logging of the surrounding natural forest as a source of income. As long as their livelihoods from farming are deemed sufficient, illegal logging is not likely to occur in the community. The impact of the environmental awareness effort may only be evaluated by observing the community\u2019s response when it is confronted with difficult times, such as crop failure. 7.3 Social impacts The formation of the LCOs in Garung and Seloliman is one positive impact of the project in terms of improving the organizational skills of the local community. The improved organizational skills of the community are probably due to the presence of on-site staff of the implementing agencies (YBUL in Garung and PPLH in Seloliman) that monitor and supervise the day-to-day operation of the organization. Another indirect impact of the project may also be linked to the community\u2019s better access to outside information via TV, which is now accessible through the provision of electricity. However, this has to be considered with care since TV may also have a negative impact on the community by boosting consumptive lifestyles (due to advertising). For both Garung and Seloliman, the long-term impacts of the programme cannot be observed yet as the project duration is still less than three years. 8. Lessons learned 8.1. Thorough preparation for rural electrification projects As demonstrated in Garung and Seloliman, a successful project is the outcome of thorough preparation. Bottom-up initiatives, participatory approaches, coordination of mutual interests at the earliest stage of the programme, commitment, clear definition of the roles and responsibility of all parties and appropriate and sufficient programme supervision have proved to be key elements for successful projects. 8.2 Creating income-generating impacts is difficult The experience of the Garung and Seloliman projects suggests that income-generating activities as part of microhydro project development may not be sufficient to stimulate or catalyse local communities to supplement their incomes; other factors such as access to market, quality of products, etc. need to be considered. This is particularly true where efforts to increase productivity have been limited and hampered by the absence of electrical energy; for example: grain milling and pottery-making home industries, which still use human or animal power. In such a community, the availability of electricity may help to increase the community\u2019s productivity (income) either by the use of more powerful electric motors or by expanding working hours. Increased income may also result from improved product quality from the use of electrical appliances that generate better precision than manual work. 8.3 Grants and soft loans appear to work As demonstrated in Garung, financing via a soft loan combined with a grant to remove the barriers of high initial investment in a micro hydro- power scheme seems to be a good model. However, the YBUL soft loan (zero interest) scheme is a special case. Other NGOs or foundations that are no involved or related to the development probably will not provide soft loan financing as YBUL did. Besides, an NGO or foundation in Indonesia generally, by design, is not a financial (lending) institution. Therefore, for the dissemi- nation of micro hydropower in the country, the involvement of formal financial institutions, such as regional banks, is necessary. Soft loan financing schemes (not necessarily zero interest) that are suitable and dedicated to small-scale renewable energy development should be made available by banks at the district level. When the grant component is concerned, it is logical to expect that regional government should be the provider. 53 Challenges and Lessons", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ebc4df0e-bb33-47de-926c-bba4a653b778": {"__data__": {"id_": "ebc4df0e-bb33-47de-926c-bba4a653b778", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa17c8e0a92105cdadd453a703f6ec5045881fcf269bdbcb4630d5ac81f723a0"}, "3": {"node_id": "ff176374-9ddb-4452-8e41-ca8756794cb2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "657d48256b617fc257cbbdcd94d8fa557ede219d6c29831bdbe193a56b232663"}}, "hash": "1e24c6935a98e6230e2bbd17b251efbc3b4b954ee9317e922d56b00c8b8fd284", "text": "from UNDP Projects Microhydro case study: The Garung and Seloliman projects in Indonesia Financing via a soft loan combined with a grant to remove the barriers of high initial investment in a micro hydropower scheme seems to be a good model. 8.4 The PSK Tersebar Scheme The success story of the Seloliman microhydro in converting off-grid units to on-grid units (interconnected with the PLN) shows that the policy for promoting a small-scale renewable energy system (PSK Tersebar Scheme) becomes viable operationally. However, attention should be given to the suggestion from the microhydro officials in Seloliman (PKM) who consider the paperwork for obtaining the power sales\u2019 agreement to be excessive and complicated. To help promote and encourage wider implementation of the PSK Tersebar Scheme, the relevant electricity regulating agency needs to devise implemen- tation mechanisms that are less bureaucratic. 9. Potential for replications The Garung and Seloliman projects both have demonstrated that with proper and appropriate project preparation, a microhydro system can be implemented for rural electrification. This success story could be potentially duplicated in other areas of the country as long as the characteristics of the targeted areas are similar to Garung and/or Seloliman. Some of the characteristics that need to be considered for a successful project include water resources, community needs and community background. It is well understood that each site has its own characteristics. But with the country\u2019s microhydro potential of around 450 MW (more than 1,000 locations), it is generally acknowledged that it is highly likely that at least 100 sites that have similar characteristics to Garung and/or Seloliman could be found. As previously reported, the country\u2019s policy climate is good and conducive towards wider development of small-scale renewable energy systems. As an outcome of the Regional Autonomy Law and reform in the power sector where the PLN is no longer fully responsible in the rural electrification programme, regional governments are expected to be more active and creative in searching for funding partners needed for their rural electrification projects. When Seloliman power sales to the PLN are successful \u2013 technically as well as financially \u2013 many parties are expected to be interested in duplicating the Seloliman success story; this will allow a change in the \u201cmind-set\u201d of policy- makers to encourage the purchase of electricity produced from small-scale generators employing renewable energy resources. 54 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region 55 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Microhydro case study: The Garung and Seloliman projects in Indonesia Bibliography Asia\u2013Pacific region Bandung Technology Institute (Institut Teknologi Bandung-ITB). 1991.

Context Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world and is mostly mountainous, which can constrain development work. Most people live in rural areas where poverty is greater compared to urban centres, valleys and the southern plains. Social and economic inequalities, low growth rates, unbalanced development approaches, discrimi-nation, exclusion, environmental deterioration and inappropriate policies lead to a vicious circle of poverty, which can be perceived as one of the key contributing factors of the current conflict in the country. 57 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects The Rural Energy Development Programme as a model of holistic rural development in Nepal Tek B. Gurung33 33 Natural Resource Management Officer and Energy Focal Point at the UNDP Country Office Nepal. 34 The analysis of this experience is extremely challenging for the author, as he is fully aware of the sentiments and sensitivities that prevail among the progamme, government and other actors in the sector. At the same time, one has to justify issues in a professional and independent manner and to learn from past experiences. Chapter 6 Abstract Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world. The vast majority of its population is rural who primarily depend on biomass-based energy resources. The level of energy consumption as well as access to modern energy services is extremely low despite the huge hydropower potential. Due to the difficult geographical setting and scattered settlements in the hills and mountains, the costs of large-scale power generation and transmission are exorbitant. The Rural Energy Development Programme (REDP) supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has shown a workable example for extending sustainable energy services into the remote and isolated areas of Nepal through the promotion of microhydro, biogas, solar energy and improved cooking stoves. This paper provides an account of the country situation under which the REDP began its operation, the modalities and mechanisms that were adopted and the results and impacts that may be attributed for the REDP to be a model for rural development. It also includes some important lessons, including key challenges, leading to a conclusion on how the REDP should be seen in the context of sustainable rural development. The holistic development approach comprises community participation and empowerment, socio-economic inclusion, ownership building, promotion of energy technology packages and capacity building at different levels; these are the key elements for validating it as a good rural development model. Keywords: Rural energy, biomass energy, modern energy, energy mix, holistic approach, community mobilization, capacity building and rural development model. Energy consumption in Nepal is extremely low. There is a significant gap between per capita energy requirements and actual consumption. Biomass-based and conventional energy resources are predominant in the energy mix, and are primarily used for cooking and lighting purposes. Rural communities mostly lack access to modern energy resources such as electricity, a major deter- mining factor of living standards in the modern world. The negative implications on people\u2019s health, environmental sustainability and labour force productivity cannot be overexaggerated. This situation is ongoing in Nepal despite the country\u2019s rich endowment of renewable energy resources. Nepal\u2019s aspiration in realizing its huge potential of renewable energy is reflected in the government\u2019s high priority for energy sector development. However, past efforts were predominantly focused on the development of large and centralized hydropower grid systems. Due to topographical difficulties and the highly capital-intensive nature of large projects, Nepal has been unable to realize substantially or to improve significantly access to affordable electricity for the vast majority of rural and poor people.35 Even after substantial realization of hydropower potential, the likelihood of providing sustainable energy services to the poor appears to remain extremely low with the existing centralized mode of handling energy resources. Commercial energy production, trade and consumption trends in the last 20 years have been distorting the foreign exchange balance36 of the country and can be impediments to a country\u2019s achievement of its sustainable development goals. Additionally, Nepal faces the challenge of promoting renewable and cleaner energy technologies due to heavy subsidization of imported petroleum products. 3. Rural development in Nepal and the inception of the REDP Nepal\u2019s planned development has its origins in the late 1950s and underwent various trials. In the middle of 1980, the failure of Integrated Rural Development Programmes (IRDPs) to achieve expected results forced a paradigm", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b3a53ab-d911-4333-9691-397825f2d602": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b3a53ab-d911-4333-9691-397825f2d602", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da6ae9ce58e4ec981923441b09e46e09b2520add8754fe857cc939682363e837"}}, "hash": "da6ae9ce58e4ec981923441b09e46e09b2520add8754fe857cc939682363e837", "text": "shift in rural development thinking in Nepal. IRDPs were criticized for being unfocused and having a top-down approach, suffering from coordination problems and lacking an effective presence of line agencies at the local level. Shortly after, the potential of the community participatory planning process began to gain recognition as it could take advantage of the government-supported pluralism in the existing market place. In a predominantly agrarian-based economy, it was also realized that the community approach could hold promise in engaging the vast majority of poor people in the development process to modernize their subsistence agriculture. This, coupled with the promotion of cottage and small-scale industries, could form the essential elements of the strategy for the transformation of the hill and mountain economy towards a more sustainable state, one in which energy inputs would be crucial. While there is an energy crisis in Nepalese rural areas, particularly in the hills, it appears to have been neglected for the past several years in the government\u2019s development prioritization. As a result, there are serious negative impacts on natural resources and rural development such as deforestation, low productivity agriculture, the inability to pump water for irrigation and drinking purposes, the inability to introduce technologies that reduce drudgery (especially for women) and poor livelihood opportunities. 58 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region Box 6-1: Basic facts about Nepal and its energy consumption \u2022 82% of the land area is mountainous \u2022 Per capita annual income of US$220 \u2022 Human Development Index (as per HDR 2002) is 0.49 \u2022 80% of the total population of 23.2 million is rural. \u2022 Per capita energy consumption is 44 kgoe (kilograms oil equivalent) or 2 Gigajoules (1998) \u2022 Per capita energy requirement: 12 Gigajoules \u2022 90% of the population relies on traditional fuels for energy use 35 Nepal has realized only approximately one percent of its huge techno-economic potential of 42,000 MW of hydro-electricity and its people pay some of the highest electricity prices in the world (approximately 12 cents per kilowatt hour). 36 The production of commercial energy (mostly electricity and solid fuels) in 1982 was 26 ktoe (kilotonnes oil equivalent) that increased to 101 ktoe in 1998 - nearly a fourfold increase. However, the consumption increased from 166 ktoe in 1982 to 1,011 ktoe in 1998, more than a sixfold increase. This major gap in the change in the production and consumption of commercial energy over the years gave rise to a substantial increase in the import of energy/fuel from 141 ktoe in 1982 to 916 ktoe in 1998, almost six and half times more. Data were taken from the Energy Statistics Year Books of the United Nations from 1982 to 1998. The high potential for promoting sustainable rural livelihoods through better utilization of local water resources cannot be over exaggerated. The role of rural electrification could be dramatic if institutional and technological hurdles are overcome. This was also seen in the light of the liberal sociopolitical environment that emerged after the restoration of democracy in the country in 1990. The Eighth Five Year Plan (1992\u20131997) of the government made it possible for the involvement of non-government organizations (NGOs) in the delivery of services to the local people. Further, the Electricity Act (1992) created an environment conducive to community and private-sector participation in hydropower develop- ment through de-licensing of up to 1,000 kW capacity. This policy, along with tax exemption for 15 years, provided a strong incentive mechanism for the development of the small- and microhydro sector by encouraging investment from the private sector and communities. The REDP intervention emerged; it took advantage of this enabling environment for rural develop- ment through provision of rural energy in which microhydro was the central element. The new and distinct feature in the REDP concept, compared to past initiatives, is that it combines hydropower and other forms of energy such as biogas, solar energy and improved cooking stoves. The integration of different forms of energy could be instrumental in inducing agricultural diversi- fication, leading to rural industrialization, and promoting rural employment, as well as reducing pressure on the natural resources. In addition to other renewable energy initiatives (e.g. biogas and solar energy), over 1,000 micro- hydro plants were established in rural Nepal, utilizing the incentive mechanism and benefiting from an enabling environment prior to REDP intervention. While many institutions supported those initiatives, there was a lack of appropriate institutions at the central as well as local levels to take up energy initiatives in their multifaceted form as a cross-sectoral issue. Rather, the major thrust was on the promotion of privately-operated microhydro plants without due", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "227d980b-af2c-4772-8d40-ff1442fda429": {"__data__": {"id_": "227d980b-af2c-4772-8d40-ff1442fda429", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b9ac39f3c11dfbe94045d740dffc7a0c4ac678a9daf9beb975c4efa372928c3"}, "3": {"node_id": "6a96eaa1-e0af-4875-b5d8-039ce96b96fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dccf326ac7677bd763b153cc8376cdeddbe0068139f6d6f552e7be307aa96e16"}}, "hash": "4de7c8a7e44bb0c3c42e15d0c03a7288c811bbf60dfa97cf529a5b35304b0807", "text": "consideration of other factors. Although some successes were achieved, studies (ICIMOD, 1993a; Junejo, 1994 and 1995) pointed out that they tended to suffer from technical and operational problems, such as frequent breakdown of machinery and a lack of repair and maintenance services within convenient reach. In addition, due to poor people\u2019s difficulty in paying tariffs, a number of schemes were unable to generate enough revenue, operate at a financially viable level or to repay the loan. The REDP, with its twin goals of improving rural livelihoods and preserving the environment, was designed to address these issues. Key elements crystallized in the objectives of the programme are summarized below: \u2022 institutional arrangements and development to promote rural energy development in its cross- sectoral dimensions, at the central and local levels; \u2022 environmental preservation through social mobilization and the promotion of alternative energy primarily in the form of microhydro; \u2022 promotion of local economies and livelihoods; \u2022 utilization and development of research and dissemination of technologies; and \u2022 human resource development for the development as well as operation and maintenance (O&M) of rural energy systems. The immediate objectives of the REDP stated in the project document are: i) to support the establishment and institutionalization of a rural energy development agency to promote rural energy system development in Nepal; and ii) to enhance rural livelihoods through community- (or entrepreneur-) managed rural energy systems development and demonstration programmes through enhanced capacity at the district level to manage rural energy development. 59 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects The rural energy development programme as a model of holistic rural development in Nepal Traditional way of delivering and grinding grains including wood collection and use of kerosene lamp 4. An introduction to the REDP: elements, struc- tures and processes The critical programmatic components of the REDP are: \u2022 Community mobilization: i) organizational development through group formations and capacity building; ii) capital formation through savings and credit schemes; iii) skills\u2019 enhance- ment through training and exposure visits; iv) women\u2019s empowerment through equal participation; v) technology promotion through demonstration and R&D; and vi) environmental management through nursery management, plantations and sanitation activities. In this regard, the REDP aimed to ensure that 99.9 percent of households in a programme village participated and became beneficiaries. \u2022 Promotion of microhydro demonstration schemes: i) microhydro system installation; ii) fund mobilization through savings in the community, District Development Committee (DDC) and Village Development Committee (VDC) equities, donations and project contributions; iii) end-use promotion through appropriate technologies and enterprise promotions; and iv) and O&M of microhydro by the villagers. \u2022 Promotion of other rural energy technologies: biogas, solar home systems and improved cooking stoves, as appropriate, to fulfil the needs as well as demands of the communities. \u2022 Human resources development: orientation and sensitization, training/fellowships, capacity development of manufacturers, conservation education/awareness and local enterprise training. \u2022 Environmental and natural resources manage- ment: sustainable natural resource utilization, conservation, planting and management of community-based forestry initiatives. 60 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region Figure 6-1:The management and coordination structure at the centre \u2022 Minister, Minister of Local Development \u2022 NPC Member \u2022 Secretary to MLD \u2022 High level representative of MoWR \u2022 High level representative of MoST \u2022 High level representative of WECS \u2022 Representative of civil society \u2022 Secretary to MLD \u2022 Representative of NPC \u2022 Representative of MoWR \u2022 Representative of MoST \u2022 Representative of WECs \u2022 Representative of Private Sector \u2022 National Programme Coordinator \u2022 National Programme Manager \u2022 National Programme Coordinator \u2022 National Programme Manager \u2022 Professional Staff \u2022 Administrative Support Staff Rural Energy Development Board for Policy Oversight Programme Management Committee Programme Management Unit Technical Review Committee Rural Energy Consultative Forum 61 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects The rural energy development programme as a model of holistic rural development in Nepal Figure 6-2:The management and coordination structure at the district level \u2022 Chairperson, District Development Commitee \u2022 Local Development Officer \u2022 Representatives of Line Agencies such as District Forest Office, District Agriculture Office etc. \u2022 Representatives of Private Sector Agencies \u2022 District Energy Advisor \u2022 Logistics Support Staff District Energy Committee Office District Energy Advisor under DDC District Energy Fund PMU Rural Energy Service Centre Figure 6-3:The management and coordination structure at the community level Functional groups (e.g. Microhydro, Forest, Income Generation, etc) Community Organization (CO) Community Energy Fund DEC/DEA CO CO CO CO CO CO Support Organization (SO) Notes: 1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a96eaa1-e0af-4875-b5d8-039ce96b96fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a96eaa1-e0af-4875-b5d8-039ce96b96fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b9ac39f3c11dfbe94045d740dffc7a0c4ac678a9daf9beb975c4efa372928c3"}, "2": {"node_id": "227d980b-af2c-4772-8d40-ff1442fda429", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4de7c8a7e44bb0c3c42e15d0c03a7288c811bbf60dfa97cf529a5b35304b0807"}}, "hash": "dccf326ac7677bd763b153cc8376cdeddbe0068139f6d6f552e7be307aa96e16", "text": "PMU= Programme Management Unit, CO= Community Organizations, DEC=District Energy Committee. 2.

The management and coordination structures at various levels are depicted in Figures 6-1 to 6-3 (extracted from other project documents). Fund flow mechanisms and resource mobilization: The programme funds go directly to the District Energy Fund (DEF) and then to the Community Energy Fund (CEF) based on plans that evolve through a bottom-up planning process. The UNDP funds (mainly for microhydro installation) serve as a catalyst to mobilize resources from local communities, local government bodies, government subsidies and other energy-related programmes. Support includes: attaching toilets with biogas reactors; skills\u2019 training for improved cooking stove construction and installation; upgrading local electromechanical enterprises into Rural Energy Services Centres (RESCs) and training on community management and systematic operation of rural energy. Development of operational guidelines: Considering the issues mentioned earlier and challenges illustrated below, it was important to develop a number of operational process guidelines and strategies within the purview of the legal frame- works of the country and policy and strategy of the UNDP (see Box 6-2). These guidelines help to keep track of the implementation, as well as to generate lessons in a systematic manner. A number of guidelines pertaining to community mobilization, district level operations, environmental management, including an operational manual for microhydro, were developed to help imple- mentation of the programme. 5. Results and impacts A summary of the key quantitative achievements is presented in Box 6-3. Holistic rural development is underway. Hundreds of rural energy systems have been developed comprising microhydros, biogas, solar energy and improved cooking stoves. Villagers are becoming increasingly engaged in various income generation activities, such as village tea stalls, poultry raising, piggeries, fresh vegetable production, carpentry, weaving, knitting, Thanka (traditional Nepalese painting depicting Buddhist culture), photography the public telephone service and computer institutes. Environmental management initiatives such as watershed management, plantations and community forestry are fostering sustainable development. The local (district) level NGOs have been developing as support organizations, which has helped in forming social capital and mobilizing latent local resources. Local electromechanical/grill workshops have been promoted as rural energy service centres (RESCs) for technical support. The local government bodies (DDCs and VDCs) have been strengthened for internalizing the decentralized rural energy planning, programming and monitoring and evaluation systems. The outputs are gradually translating into positive changes in the capacity of all concerned stakeholders and ultimately, in the enhancement of rural livelihoods. The changes encompass: (i) increased income from off-farm and non-farm activities; (ii) improved health due to a reduction in drudgery, labour and smoke inhalation, and improved sanitation; (iii) better education of children due to the availability of brighter ligh at night to do their homework (extension of 62 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region Box 6-2: Guidelines and coordination arrangements created by the REDP Guidelines: 1.

Key challenges and lessons Implementation of the REDP has yielded a range of challenges and lessons since its inception and throughout implementation. Key challenges are: i. At the time of the REDP\u2019s inception,the prominent actors in the energy sectors, for the most part, believed that small and microhydro systems were less cost effective and efficient, and of poor quality. ii The failure of many microhydros prior to REDP intervention, as well as IRDPs, created a challenging scenario for wider appreciation of the programme concept. iii During implementation, the multiplicity of actors in the rural energy sector, largely a result of the liberal policy of the government in the 1990s, had created unnecessary competition, coordination problems as well as an environment of mistrust and latent tension among actors. This represented a serious challenge for the programme on how to effectively bring the various stakeholders on board to succeed. Therefore, it was important for the programme to conceptualize and materialize various forums to engage them (see Box 6-2). iv. Since the programme was designed to be holistic and evolving in nature, and so many issues were to be handled simultaneously, it became imperative to deal with them. It was therefore a challenge to develop appropriate guidelines (see Box 6-2). v. After the initial successes of the REDP, many staff members were given the opportunity to pursue higher studies, which created a critical challenge in terms of maintaining the spirit and speed of work. This was further compounded by the uncertainty of funding for the continuity of the programme beyond the originally stipulated duration. Further, a paradox occurs when success stories begin to crystallize, and the importance of the programme becomes heightened as does the excitement of the staff; yet, at the same time the life of the programme draws closer to conclusion. Under such a situation, it can be challenging to maintain high morale among staff, as it appears that they may exhibit symptoms of job insecurity or begin sourcing new employment opportunities. 63 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects The rural energy development programme as a model of holistic rural development in Nepal Box 6-3: Key achievements of the REDP at a glance (as of Jun 2003 from 1996) Rural energy systems Microhydro schemes including Peltric sets 120 (1,575 kW) Biogas plant with toilet attached 2,953 Solar home systems 1,524 Improved cooking stove 7,200 Environment initiatives Nursery establishment 96 Community-managed forests 181 Plantation 2,702,622 (plants) Toilet construction 9,803 Environment classes/campaigns 321 Human resource development Training on technical subjects 1,170 Environment management training 2,219 Training: income generation and micro enterprise 4,598 Institutional development training 6,446 In-country study tour 2,047 Others 3,914 Community mobilization Male Female Community organization 1,366 1,371 Community members 27,307 28,126 Cumulative weekly saving (Rs) 10,576,176 9,442,977 Cumulative investments (Rs) 21,345.647 19,255,557 Institutional development District Energy Fund 15 Rural Energy Development Section 15 Community Energy Fund 120 Rural Energy Services Centres 13 Support organizations (NGOs) 15 Microhydro cooperatives 13 Note: 1.

Given the fluidity of the security situation, the question of how to replicate the REDP\u2019s success (adapted where appropriate) in 25 districts has arisen as a critical challenge for the future. A systematic study should reveal the programme\u2019s lessons and stories. Nevertheless, through the author\u2019s observations and analyses, several critical lessons vis-\u00e0-vis cross-cutting issues emerge: i Rural energy serves as an entry point in reaching the poorest of the poor. The most important lesson is that, through community mobilization, rural energy has to be approached to ensure 100 percent participation of the people in a certain political or geographic unit. The \u201chand-to-mouth\u201d problem of the poorest needs to be addressed by providing them direct economic benefits (see Box 6-4). ii Community mobilization for rural energy development is instrumental in overcoming social discrimination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93ca1661-0646-4bae-9fac-4e79f64ea7e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "93ca1661-0646-4bae-9fac-4e79f64ea7e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "246fad895e38b07b27613e5f097f8d28f85ffd379992fefbb37aa85ea80b3bcb"}, "2": {"node_id": "d92c33b2-84b8-4660-8ad1-7272b1212792", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "248861f947ab0cc0698d8105f45a8376767fede382ab69bbf220875101df7daf"}}, "hash": "0b430103048278d580153fbd1d312910fe219f82c9a788323945843890852ae8", "text": "ii Community mobilization for rural energy development is instrumental in overcoming social discrimination.

At the district level, it is in between; however, this level is particularly complex given the need for coordinating relationships strategically, particularly with higher bodies at the centre. iv Enhancing capacities of local people empowers, thereby contributing to the fostering of good local governance. The aim of establishing rural energy in their locality binds local people together. It is important that the strengths of rural people should be acknowledged and encouraged. Their leadership capacity should be nurtured and built through various means including exposure to the outside world and alternative experiences (see Box 6-5). v Provision of \u201cenergy only\u201d is not the solution for sustainable development, and use of only one energy technology does not serve the purpose \u2013 an appropriate and dynamic \u201cenergy-mix\u201d needs to be developed. In the case of rural Nepal, it is important to build the capacity of people to be able to pay for the energy services they require through 64 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region Box 6-4: Poorest and socially discriminated people in Nepal and associated challenges The poorest of the poor are generally the disadvantaged groups due to discriminatory social structures like caste, ethnicity and gender. In the hierarchical social structure, so-called Dalits (kami/blacksmiths, Sarki/leather workers, Damai/tailors, etc.) and women in all categories are the poorest and very likely to be excluded in the project implementation process. They may even remain unseen. They are always addressing basic survival issues and avoid or are systemically excluded in the development process. They can only be brought into the development process if a rule is established for 100 percent participation and their immediate hand-to-mouth problems are addressed. Once participation is ensured through careful intervention, their capacity to afford energy services is another challenge. It is possible to gain consensus among the villagers for supporting the poorest as well as addressing the equity issue which serves as a shield against insurgency (destroying microhydros). So far no single microhydro scheme has been damaged. Although the constitution of Nepal does not allow discriminatory practices based on caste, ethnicity, colour, religion and sex, many discriminatory structures and practices are embedded in the social system and are perpetuated by the patriarchal norms. Therefore, it is pertinent to consider organizing homogeneous people in terms of their caste and gender in community mobilization. There should be gradual social guidance to empower them to become equal participants. Adult literacy classes, envisioning exercises about their lives and the role of energy services in their lives were some of the key tools applied in the community mobilization process. These helped to mainstream the disadvantaged into the overall development paradigm which was a key to successfully overcoming these social barriers. The selection of community mobilizer(s) is also a critical dimension. The REDP set a policy that the mobilizers must be from within the district but not from the same village where they have to act. This gave a fair chance of employment within the district and at the same time the biases that could arise due to being resident of a particular village were avoided.This is, however, still a point for future debate. economic activities such as micro-enterprises. Similarly, it is important to promote location- specific combinations of electricity (microhydro) which could be utilized for multiple purposes; biogas and improved cooking stoves for cooking family food, as well as cooking feeding materials for livestock. If microhydro is not feasible in an area, solar energy, batteries or other forms should be considered. Attaching toilets with a biogas reactor has been promoted and is an increasing trend which has a direct bearing on public health due to improved sanitation in the village and reduction of contamination of water sources. vi Technological concerns and issues in rural energy could be addressed through R&D for which synergistic coordination and linkages are essential. The key concerns in the REDP pertain to the quality of rural energy technologies and the provision of technical support after the establishment of rural energy systems. For R&D, the academia and research institutions were brought on board and for technical support the local level electro- mechanical/grill workshops were promoted, which alleviated most of the concerns. This also ensured a self-running mechanism. 7. Conclusion In conclusion, the REDP must be viewed in the context of sustainability. In Nepal, poor people, for the most part, do not have the capacity to invest in the establishment of rural energy systems without state or outside support.

However, if sustainability is viewed in the context of the community\u2019s capacity to handle the \u201cestablished business\u201d after support ceases (in this case rural energy systems), it is most important to ensure the people\u2019s capability of assuming this task, with elements contributing to this as integral parts of the project. The salient elements of sustainability that have emerged through REDP intervention are: a) rural energy should be viewed from the holistic perspective; b) sustainability should focus on the local level; c) capacity building should address issues of good governance; d) legitimacy aspects of local systems should be fostered; e) financial and service delivery mechanisms, such as RESCs, should be developed and f) public\u2013private partnership issues should be considered from the outset. As a result, the 65 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects The rural energy development programme as a model of holistic rural development in Nepal Box 6-5: Good community governance through self-reliance Nepal is a heavily donor-dependent country; but most of the support and services for rural people have been delivered without consideration of demand. As a consequence, this has undermined or not tapped into people\u2019s strengths and capabilities. This orientation also blocks communities from new opportunities. The conventional practice was that the outside contractor would establish microhydro without local participation and would hand it over to the community or private entrepreneur(s) after its commissioning.This seriously hindered ownership building and sustainability. In contrast, the REDP approach involved all beneficiaries from the beginning, building and strengthening their institutions and institutional capacities, promoting their leadership abilities, enhancing transparent decision-making processes and letting them lead the process on their own. To establish their rural energy system by constructing microhydro (which forms the nucleus of the system), people demonstrated their solidarity and leadership capabilities to mobilize funds from the community, district bodies and bank loans. Often the provision of support to hardware components such as construction or infrastructure development may be susceptible to all sorts of financial irregularities. In the case of the REDP, microhydro equipment procurement is a vulnerable component because considerable amounts of money are involved. In order to avoid all possible irregularities, a mechanism has been devised to procure microhydro equipment; the community selects their group leaders to send them to markets and when they come back to the village they organize stringent community audits in addition to the regular REDP audit process. The REDP plays a facilitator role by providing a list of qualified manufacturers and brokering appointments for these community people. This approach empowers people, building a sense of ownership and accountability and developing their leadership capabilities in the process. These village leaders do their best for the village in negotiating prices. This provides an opportunity for them to be exposed to the outside world away from their villages. A number of community organizations have succeeded in securing a reasonably good bargain price for their equipment and, at the same time, they have become familiar with people and places to contact in the event of future problems.This has also fostered \u201crural-urban\u201dlinkages. REDP as an approach to rural development is also an important issue for consideration and further discussions. Related to sustainability is the impact the REDP has had and continues to have in the policy arena. The most important policy issues emerging from the lessons learned from the REDP relate to scaling-up the lessons, by embedding them, and adoption of the approach in policy dialogues and the policies themselves. There is a growing realization among government authorities and donors that the REDP modus operandi has significant potential when applied to the development of other rural areas in Nepal. There are positive signs that the level of coordination is increasing among interministerial departments and donors. All development partners including government, donors and civil society are working towards the goal of poverty reduction and have realized that this has not been sufficiently addressed as of yet. This kind of favourable environment needs to be utilized in the formulation of holistic rural energy policy. The Hydro-power Development Policy (2000) envisions rural electrification, but does not fully embrace a holistic rural energy perspective which could be addressed in the ongoing policy study in the rural energy sector under the auspices of the Thematic Trust Fund for Sustainable Energy Development of the UNDP. It is expected that the lessons from the REDP will serve as a sound foundation. In addition, a study on how to proceed with rural energy sector development is under discussion among donors and the government.

There are about 3,900 VDCs in Nepal and out of these, around 1,500 are situated in the plains area; the likelihood of their being connected by the national grid is very high. Some 1,000 are found in valleys of the mid-hills, which are mostly connected, and around 300 are in extremely remote areas requiring a special intervention strategy. The remainder of the 1,100 VDCs could be considered as a potential target area for programmes or other interventions similar to the REDP to make significant changes in the country\u2019s rural development paradigm. To this end, a partnership with the World Bank is being arranged, and this will permit replication of the programme in an additional 150 VDCs over the course of the next three years. This can be considered as a measure of success and as a good practice by the government and the World Bank to further the REDP initiative. Capitalizing on the strengths of the programme and to build more partnerships is a future focus for the REDP. 66 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region Installed in project areas: Microhydro powerplant (left) Biogas Plan (right); Solar Home System (top) Productive uses of energy in project areas 67 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects The rural energy development programme as a model of holistic rural development in Nepal AcknowledgementsAsia\u2013Pacific region Asia\u2013Pacific region The author expresses sincere thanks to Ms Zheng Luo and Ms Nadine Smith for facilitating his visit to the Bangkok Sub-regional Resource Facility of UNDP\u2019s Bureau for Development Policy to set up activities of the Asia\u2013Pacific Energy Working Group (EWG) and to draft this paper under the auspices of the Mutual Support Initiative (MSI).

Development requirements impose heavy demands on the country\u2019s ability to increase agricultural and industrial production, and supply appropriate technologies, facilities and infrastructure for expanding economic activities. Access to reliable and affordable energy services is not only essential to sustain economic growth, but also a prerequisite for meeting social and environmental goals. In the Philippines, the rural poor have limited access to energy services; therefore, development prospects are seriously compromised, and as a result, much potential for development remains untapped. 69 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Financing for renewable energy: Lessons from the FINESSE project in the Philippines Minoru Takada, Sooksiri Chamsuk, Imee Manal and Jane Steel37 37 Mr Minoru Takada is Sustainable Energy Progrmme Specialist, Bureau for Development Policy, UNDP.

Chapter 7 Abstract Renewable energy in the Philippines can potentially play a significant role in expanding off-grid energy options in rural areas where many people still do not have access to adequate and affordable modern energy services. The Financing Energy Services for Small-Scale Energy-Users (FINESSE) project, which commenced in 1997, therefore attempted to address some of the key barriers to widespread diffusion of renewable energy, focusing on the provision of appropriate and accessible financing for small-scale renewable energy projects. FINESSE\u2019s main objective was to develop the capacity of the local financier, the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) to handle renewable energy projects within its lending programme and to tackle some of the obstacles, which had inhibited the expansion of a renewable energy investment portfolio. This objective was successfully achieved through training sessions and the streamlining of internal lending guidelines and operating procedures for renewable energy financing; this significantly raised internal capacity for the technical evaluation and management of a renewable energy lending portfolio. However, limited policy and regulatory incentives for renewable energy development, the weak capacity of the project proponents and inflexible lending conditions inhibited the development of a significant number of renewable energy investment projects, limiting the widespread diffusion of renewable energy. The FINESSE-Philippines project provided a best example of how to develop capacity for managing renewable energy projects. By establishing a bridgehead in the financial institutions of the Philippines, FINESSE has rendered renewable energy development in the country a valuable service, and possibly also elsewhere in the region. Yet, the DBP\u2019s experiences clearly point out that focusing on financing issues alone cannot result in desired outcomes. Concerted efforts to create an enabling atmosphere across a wider set of issues \u2013 political, institutional and financial \u2013 are essential in expanding the use of renewable energy. Keywords: Renewable energy projects, capacity building, financiers, Development Bank of the Philippines, lending guidelines. Recognizing the importance of energy issues, the current Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) considers modern energy services to be essential for national development. Under the MTPDP\u2019s framework, the Philippine Energy Plan (PEP) similarly promotes energy as a major element in poverty reduction and economic growth, and specifically aims to make electricity available fo all the population using both on- and off-grid options. Renewable energy can play a significant role, particularly in expanding off-grid options in rural areas, to achieve general access to adequate, affordable, reliable, high-quality, safe and environmentally benign modern energy services. At the end of 2000, about 20 percent of the total number of barangays38 (41,955) had no access to electricity. Many are rural (mainly poor) communities, which will not be connected to the grid in the foreseeable future, because of financial and technical grid extension issues. Fifty percent of the remaining unelectrified barangays have been identified as suitable for off-grid electrification using renewable energy technologies due to their distance from the grid and low population density. As numerous studies show, there is a huge renewable energy resource potential in the Philippines. Yet, the actual use of renewable energy resources is minimal, with the exception of geothermal and large hydro energy systems. Currently, renewable energy contributes approxi- mately 28 percent of the primary energy mix, most of which comes from traditional biomass.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af2ea349-fe0f-4c2c-988b-824cf8ae0493": {"__data__": {"id_": "af2ea349-fe0f-4c2c-988b-824cf8ae0493", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "decc00e50b27b416eda036d6d48ec8ba58e3e603340ef226a87e4b78fb114da3"}, "2": {"node_id": "0baeaea0-98eb-4708-b82a-5ad6a95cfb25", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bb190b020b1e5972fb63e245eb583ac52213a201e5cde3325022a0536d263e6e"}}, "hash": "9b2ec526c065710ea39f0668b088f76f011ffd929e596b9dd8017a461beb5bd8", "text": "Contributions of renewable resources from solar, wind, modernized biomass and microhydro systems in terms of energy supply are virtually non-existent (less than 0.1 percent).

However amortized costs in the long run are much lower than conventional means. The initial cost barrier often effectively makes renewable energy technologies inaccessible for most users in the low/middle income bracket. Accessible financing, suitable for the needs of this bracket, is the key to surmounting this problem. Affordability can be dramatically increased if credit facilities are made available to entrepreneurs and consumers. In this context, Financing Energy Services for Small- Scale Energy-Users (FINESSE) in the Philippines was launched in 1997. The main objective was to develop the capacity of local financiers to appraise, manage and monitor renewable energy projects within their lending programmes. By working with a credible national bank in the Philippines, i.e. the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), the FINESSE project has attempted to increase accessibility and credit availability for renewable energy project developers and end users. This paper discusses the FINESSE project\u2019s approach to overcom- ing the renewable energy financing challenge as well as lessons learned, which provide insights for future endeavours. 2. The FINESSE project: Developing the capacity of financiers 2.1 Background and rationale The FINESSE project commenced in 1997 as a three-year project39 with funding from the Netherlands and the OPEC Fund for International Development totalling US$1.1 million through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The DBP\u2019s Window III was responsible for overall project coordination and implemen- tation, with technical support provided by UNDP. Under the overall guidance of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), the DBP closely coordinated activities with other government agencies such as the Department of Energy (DOE), private groups and NGOs during implementation. 70 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region 38 The smallest political unit into which cities and municipalities in the Philippines are divided. It is the basic unit of the Philippine political system. It consists of less than 1,000 inhabitants residing within the territorial limit of a city or municipality and administered by a set of elective officials, headed by a barangay chairperson or punong barangay (source: Philippine National Statistical Coordination Board website). 39 The project duration was later extended to last for six years, in order to allow sufficient time for capacity development as well as project pipeline development. There is a huge renewable energy resource potential in the Philippines.Yet,the actual use of renewable energy resources is minimal,with the exception of geothermal and large hydro energy systems. The project is an initiative aimed at promoting ways to provide technically feasible and economically viable renewable energy and energy efficiency services to residential, commercial, industrial and other productive sectors. The FINESSE concept was first applied by the World Bank40 in South and Southeast Asia in the early 1990s, the Bank consequently produced, inter alia, renewable energy and energy efficiency project propositions for potential commercial lending. One important lesson drawn from the FINESSE-Asia project was that it took a very long time (over five years) to secure investments for the resultant business propositions, partly because the project had started without prior identification of potential financiers to provide such investment capital. 2.2 Concept and strategy The FINESSE-Philippines project was proposed as a direct follow through to the FINESSE-Asia project. Due to the reorganization of ministries in the early 1990s, FINESSE-Philippines did not start until 1997. Reflecting on the lessons learned in the FINESSE-Asia project, at the outset the FINESSE-Philippines project identified the DBP as the main financier to work with nationally. The DBP was selected, because it was the only bank in the country that had previous experience in renewable energy issues. Of particular relevance was its special development lending programme, Window III. Window III provides concessional loans to projects with distinct development impacts. By 1995, Window III had approved the financing of five renewable energy projects. Despite the Window III facility, the DBP faced a number of obstacles in expanding financing for renewable energy. Previous experiences uncovered weaknesses in technical evaluation and manage- ment of a renewable energy lending portfolio. For example, the DBP\u2019s lending guidelines did not consider the unique characteristics of renewable energy projects (i.e., high initial capital cost and long gestation period). Moreover, the DBP had to rely on technical input on the appraisal and implementation of projects from the DOE due to inadequate in-house technical capacity, which at times was too cumbersome.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75967d6c-e090-4bcf-b83f-6397b07cf182": {"__data__": {"id_": "75967d6c-e090-4bcf-b83f-6397b07cf182", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32119f8b4a362cf0782b359bea9776804f16f3a9170eaeae160e6cdc508a32dd"}, "2": {"node_id": "c1011c1e-11c3-487d-bdbc-cd07843a8f46", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d626918a0fddcae110802e63896c1a5a63c9424191b3c27eedb4ee55ed26485d"}}, "hash": "e4157e71699a9df755ca807889ded1d36c979f2da4a22e0edcb7a49bc5de7f50", "text": "Thus the project was designed to tackle some of these obstacles, which had inhibited the DBP from rapidly expanding its renewable energy investment portfolio.

It was envisaged that the DBP would be able to marshal its own bank resources, in order to make credit more readily accessible and that this would allow it to establish itself as a credible focal point for financing renewable energy projects in the Philippines. An important indicator of the success of the FINESSE project would be the number of renewable energy investment projects the DBP would eventually develop. Focusing solely on bankers\u2019 capacity building is rather narrow in scope, given that the barriers against diffusion of renewable energy technologies involve a far wider set of issues. Nonetheless, when project started, this was considered durable since the New and Renewable Energy Bill was expected to be approved, creating incentives for market expansion. That is, the FINESSE project in the Philippines was operationalized under an assumption that at the end of project implemen- tation, demand for renewable energy financing would have grown substantially due to the enactment of the Bill and contingent public support. Moreover the DBP would be prepared accordingly for responding to such increased demand. Tailored to the needs of the DBP, the project intervention strategy involved the following activities: i) Mainstreaming renewable energy into the DBP\u2019s oper- ational structure: Renewable energy is in fact a new commodity for most financiers and it often lacks the needed internal commitment and 71 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Financing for renewable energy: Lessons from the FINESSE project in the Philippines 40 The FINESSE concept was created in 1989 by the World Bank in collaboration with UNDP, The Netherlands Ministry for Development Cooperation (DGIS) and the US Department of Energy (USDOE). The project sought to strengthen the DBP staff\u2019s technical knowledge and skills in evaluating and managing funds for renewable energy projects and to streamline internal lending guidelines and operating procedures for renewable energy financing. confidence to undertake investment activities. The project aimed to provide a means for the DBP to establish and institutionalize a unit dedicated to renewable and energy efficiency issues. ii) Building capacity \u2013 at both individual and institutional levels: Having adequate in-house technical as well as systemic capacity is a prerequisite for the sound management of the lending portfolios. The project was therefore designed to provide a series of training events specific to each renewable energy technology for DBP staff. Support was also provided for the development of lending guidelines for individual renewable energy technologies, so that the DBP could systematically evaluate and manage the proposals for renewable energy financing. iii) Generating the renewable energy lending portfolio through \u201clearning-by-doing\u201d: The project aggressively conducted investment promotion seminars, as well as information/ knowledge dissemination to help prospective proponents develop renewable energy proposals. In order to ensure quality business proposals and to increase access to financing, a revolving fund was established to finance feasibility studies necessary to complete the business proposals. The Project Preparation Revolving Fund (PPRF) was expected to increase the rate of project development, which, in turn, would also help to accelerate learning opportunities for the DBP and proponents. It should be noted that while the FINESSE project financed activities to develop individual and institutional capacity as well as initial capital costs for the PPRF, it did not subsidize any lending operations, which were solely done using the DBP\u2019s internal resources. 3. Project experience: What worked, what didn\u2019t and why To date, the FINESSE project has had a positive impact on the evolution of the DBP\u2019s renewable energy portfolio. By late 2001, the DBP had successfully developed one project beyond the pipeline; a solar-water heater project to provide water-heating facilities to commercial entities, with a total lending value of PhP 5 million41. There are four projects that are considered as being\u201c in the firm pipeline\u201d42 and there are 19 others that are in the pre-pipeline stage ranging from \u201cconcept\u201d to pre-feasibility levels, which are either receiving pre-loan counselling assistance from the DBP or waiting for its assistance. While projects in the firm pipeline have increased substantially, actual lending has occurred in only one case, indicating that there are some internal and external factors that pose challenges in facilitating renewable energy financing. The analysis hereunder provides more detail \u2013 what worked, what did not and why \u2013 in relation to three issues synonymous with the project\u2019s implementation and objectives.

Initially, it was viewed as a pilot unit, and did not have regular unit status. Given the uniqueness of renewable energy financing activities, the establish- ment of such a unit was essential. Yet, forming and running the NRECG heralded significant challenges. First, due to the new and experimental nature of the NRECG, none of the members worked (or did not opt to work) full time in the unit \u2013 on average, utilizing only 20 percent of their working time. The non-full-time assignment of members to the renewable energy project often prevented them from participating in training and other renewable energy activities in order to attend to their regular jobs at the bank. Lack of any formal terms of reference for NRECG staff and a clear work programme was a factor that contributed to uncertain benchmarks and varied commitments of its members. Second, the composition of the group changed every year due to the movement of 72 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region 41 US$1.00 = 50.80 pesos (PhP). 42 Firm pipeline means those projects that are at least, past the prospecting and preliminary screening stages of the DBP\u2019s loan process flow.

Four years after the establishment of the NRECG, only four out of the original nine members remained as part of the bank\u2019s renewable energy financing programme. Changes in the composition of the group also meant that training efforts and resources spent on those who later left the group had not been fully utilized. Moreover, some training activities had to be repeated for the benefit of those who were not amongst the earlier batch of trainees. Despite all of these challenges, the DBP\u2019s commitment did not fade. In July 2001, the DBP initiated steps to institutionalize its commitment to renewable energy by making the NRECG a regular unit of Window III. As of 2001, the unit was led (part time) by the vice-president in charge of Window III and was staffed with three full-time and four part-time DBP regular professionals, paving the way for continued and sustainable renewable energy financing after the external assistance (the FINESSE project) ended. This successful mainstreaming of renewable energy financing into the DBP\u2019s regular structures can be attributed to two factors. One is the support and commitment of the management, which was enhanced under the project. Before the project\u2019s intervention, DBP management showed little interest and support, resulting in the limited effort by NRECG members and also in the relatively minor importance given to renewable energy activities at the time. To increase management confidence in renewable energy, training events specifically tailored for senior bank management and branch managers were conducted at the beginning of the project. Renewable energy study tours and conferences were also organized inclusive of DBP senior officers. Through these activities, they were able to understand the merits of renewable energy in relation to the bank\u2019s development goals, including economic, environmental and human resource development. This totally reversed management perceptions against renewable energy, and was pivotal in the eventual success of renewable energy mainstreaming. Another important factor was the personal dedication and commitment of several DBP staff in Window III. Despite institutional changes and limitations within the DBP, the FINESSE project was fortunate to have the continued engagement of people who drove the NRECG from the beginning. Clearly, external assistance, like the FINESSE project, would not have been possible, or made a difference, without their commitment. (2) How was the DBP able to develop individual and institutional capacity to manage renewable energy financing projects? As mentioned previously, lack of specific knowledge and capacity is one of the key barriers in lending for renewable energy projects. The DBP has developed both individual and institutional capacity via two components of the project, i.e. providing training for DBP staff and establishing lending guidelines to develop systemic and institutional capacity. Training activities under FINESSE focused on providing basic understanding of the nature of renewable energy projects and the renewable energy market and adeptness with the project\u2019s development cycle (especially financial aspects); acquiring greater skill in evaluating loan applications; and managing loans for these projects. The training modules included domestic and foreign case studies in order to add", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9afc5f94-6fdf-4f78-879c-a4ea332c8601": {"__data__": {"id_": "9afc5f94-6fdf-4f78-879c-a4ea332c8601", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e28bb6895be7cc07c1a406c3d8027e63183eaa31666650735ebb4ab5c839d00"}}, "hash": "2e28bb6895be7cc07c1a406c3d8027e63183eaa31666650735ebb4ab5c839d00", "text": "a real-life dimension to the classroom instruction. Overseas training activities, in particular, provided the group with success stories of renewable energy systems for development in other countries as well as the latest information on new and renewable energy research. These training events were organized for the NRECG members and also for senior management/ branch representatives. Between 1998 and 2000, 13 domestic courses were conducted for the NRECG. The NRECG members were also sent on a total of ten overseas training events. All training 73 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Financing for renewable energy: Lessons from the FINESSE project in the Philippines NRECG site visit to the solar PV power plant courses for the NRECG were based on a training needs assessment conducted by a local consulting firm in conjunction with the DBP\u2019s human resources group. The courses included a series of technology-specific sessions related to areas such as biomass, wind etc, so that participants could learn about respective technologies. The training modules were prepared by a local consulting firm with support from foreign experts and were coordinated with the DOE, which provided technical experts as resource persons/ speakers, as required or available. The effects of the training were immediate and positive. Firstly, the NRECG acquired the necessary technical and financial knowledge to better evaluate new and renewable energy project proposals through domestic and international training interventions and hands-on experience with the evaluation of actual proposals. The training has raised a great deal of confidence among NRECG members who started out with no knowledge on renewable energy. As training included represen- tatives from branches and management, the knowledge has been passed on to other levels of bank personnel. Even senior management has become more knowledgeable and appreciative of the merits of renewable energy technologies, particularly in support of the bank\u2019s environment management thrust and programme. Secondly, training and exposure enabled the NRECG to appreciate the significance of renewable energy in the overall economic development picture. This also helped them to perceive renewable energy projects as being different from standard business ventures that yield immediate returns on investment; therefore renewable energy projects need more allowance in terms of interest and repayment schedules. The NRECG was better able to balance the risks involved with renewable energy investments and realized the flexibility required in handling renewable energy loans. Subsequently, the DBP formalized renewable energy lending by establishing guidelines and operating procedures tailored to the nature of renewable energy projects. They served as the overall appraisal system for evaluating proposed renewable energy projects for financing, and took into due consideration their financial requirements and risks. A special feature of the guidelines, not normally found in financing schemes for other types of projects, was to encourage women\u2019s participation and pay strict attention to the environmental impact of the proposed project. The guidelines are formulated inline with the DBP\u2019s lending policies and standard proce-dures, and are unique to the renewable energy projects; but they would be useful as an industry standard for renewable financing programmes in general. The guideline took into account the unique project attributes of the various renewable energy technologies, with only one major difference in the loan features \u2013 the grace period on principal repayments. Annex 7-1 provides details of the lending criteria for each technology. Policies and lending guidelines specific to five key renewable energy technologies: solar, solar photovoltaic (PV) for telecommunications, wind, hydropower and biomass, have been adopted. Along with these guidelines, the bank\u2019s loan appraisal process flow for Window III was also formalized to include new and renewable energy. The entire process is comprehensive, comprising several activities with the corresponding number of processing days and steps involved. Annex 2 contains the loan appraisal process flow within Window III. These lending guidelines have significantly helped the DBP to regularize renewable energy financing within its lending activities. (3) How effective were the project interventions, such as the PPRF, in generating renewable energy lending portfolios? Prior to the FINESSE project, the DBP had very few business proponents who were considered serious enough for lending purposes. This was chiefly attributable to the lack of serious business ventures with a definite idea of the renewable energy projects they wanted to develop and 74 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region NRECG site visit to the Solar PV power plant were determined to pursue by securing a bank loan. Insufficient knowledge amongst the private and public players of what a business plan for renewable energy technology projects entailed was a common problem. To overcome these barriers, several project inter- ventions (listed hereunder) have been identified and implemented. These include information dissemination", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "788aff37-ee81-458a-98ba-dd8d9c3f605c": {"__data__": {"id_": "788aff37-ee81-458a-98ba-dd8d9c3f605c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5cd071b3bc3fe474b57d6db31076873522a561b5687ed127779f0ba7c475b4c4"}}, "hash": "5cd071b3bc3fe474b57d6db31076873522a561b5687ed127779f0ba7c475b4c4", "text": "campaigns, investment promotion seminars, establishment of a financial mechanism for feasibility studies \u2013 the PPRF \u2013 and the application of flexible lending criteria for renewable energy projects: Raising awareness and infor-mation dissemination This activity was pursued by various means: the FINESSE on-line website was developed; the newsletter (FINESSE Update), detailing project activities, was released on a monthly basis; and a project brochure was distributed to proponents, including other agencies, during business meetings, conferences, etc. as part of project promotion efforts. This strategy had some success in promoting awareness and interest among stakeholders in terms of potential investments and creation of the renewable energy-aware financial sector. Information activities heightened awareness and interest in renewable energy systems and services, not only as techno- logies but also as vehicles for boosting development and viable business ventures. Information linkages with other players, both international and local, have been significantly strengthened, proof of which is the growing recognition of the DBP as the strongest supporter of renewables within the country\u2019s formal lending sector. Consultation and technical support provided to project proponents Sixteen external and two internal promotion activities were undertaken to raise awareness and build capacity among potential proponents to develop renewable energy business plans and propositions. Investment seminars were organized, followed by a number of one-on-one investment meetings between the DBP and prospective project proponents. Various linkages among potential project proponents and other key players in renewable energy were established (e.g. private developers and energy service providers, and local government units). Close consultation, counselling and provision of technical assistance to project proponents by NRECG members during loan application and project preparation helped to forge good working relationships with the proponents. In fact, most of the projects that reached the FINESSE pipeline did so after one-on-one meetings where proponents received personalized guidance on NRE project preparation and loan procedures. A list of over 20 projects in the pipeline is a clear indication of the success of such efforts. Moreover, subsequent joint activities (mainly co-financing arrangements), undertaken with other government agencies like the DOE and donor organizations like the UNDP Small Grants Programme also evidence these achievements. Establishment of the PPRF This mechanism provided selected project proponents with financial assistance to conduct high quality feasibility studies and business plans. The PPRF provided loans of up to PhP 1 million for feasibility studies, project design and preparatory activities for renew- able energy projects, payable within three years and including a six-month grace period on the interest repayment. The proponent was expected to put up at least 50 percent of the total cost of project preparation with the fund being managed by the DBP\u2019s Trust Services Department. Collateral require- ments included hard collateral and substitutes. The unpaid principal balance of the loan could also be converted into the regular loan, once the DBP approved financing of the project covered by the PPRF. A flexible lending mechanism, developed through Window III: Due to the unique nature of Window III, house lending rules have been applied in a noticeably more relaxed way although prudence is always maintained. For instance, as long as a project can show that an adequate return on investment is guaranteed, collateral becomes a less pressing issue. Through the renewable energy technology, specific procedures and guidelines that were developed, and training, NRECG members and management staff were able to develop the aforesaid grace period on principal repayments and were able to understand the context of the proposal they were handling. This therefore 75 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Financing for renewable energy: Lessons from the FINESSE project in the Philippines Information activities heightened awareness and interest in renewable energy systems and services, not only as technologies but also as vehicles for boosting development and viable business ventures. allowed a fair amount of flexibility in dealing with each renewable energy loan that they handled. However, despite these interventions, the actual lending portfolio grew very slowly. In fact only one project has availed a loan and is ongoing. While the number of projects in the pipeline has grown significantly, it is questionable why such proposals have been so slow to mature into loan projects. The answers are multiple, and illustrate significant structural challenges. Firstly, one explanation for the delay in the maturity of pipeline projects is that project proponents did not have the anticipated sufficient capacity to produce \u201cbankable\u201d business plans. Therefore, more time than expected was invested by NRECG members in supporting proponents with the development of their business propositions. The efforts of the NRECG members are best illustrated by the way members fine-tuned, developed and nurtured basic project ideas to the stage that allowed", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0ff5d79-abac-4a24-a8cf-047598647f7d": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0ff5d79-abac-4a24-a8cf-047598647f7d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f3bce236647b6104c8b6c0aceaac61cc900db59fdc7038cc44bd485125a39f8"}}, "hash": "8f3bce236647b6104c8b6c0aceaac61cc900db59fdc7038cc44bd485125a39f8", "text": "consultants to assemble presentable business plans. This phase easily lasted a year or more and was required to ensure high quality technical inputs. The unforeseen \u201cincubation\u201d period of the pipeline projects assumed a dominant role because it turned out to be the only way to generate acceptable invest- ment proposals. It is important to realize that there would have been no projects in the pipeline at all, if sufficient time with adequate resources had not been spent during this incubation period. Further, the incubation period that Window III allowed to be adopted was instrumental in the approval of the two PPRF loans. Without this neither of the projects was likely to reach the pipeline stage. According to the NRECG, only the two approved projects actually applied for the PPRF. Two other projects initially expressed interest, but did not complete the requirement for loan application. It appears that the PPRF may not have been as instrumental in promoting renewable energy investment as was originally expected. A second reason is that rigid financial regulations hampered the faster development of renewable energy. Through Window III, the DBP applies the house lending rules that are more relaxed. For instance, for as long as a project can show that an adequate return on investment is guaranteed, collateral becomes a less pressing issue. However, whilst the DBP can make unsecured loans (project financing), it finds the requirement of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, i.e. the Central Bank) to set aside funds equivalent to 25 percent of such a loan unacceptably constraining in its overall funding ability. This effectively blocks very promising projects from being implemented. Thirdly serious investment in the Philippines has been inhibited. Few, if any, domestic investors are tempted by payback periods that stretch beyond five years, no matter how sound all other aspects of the investment opportunity involved may be. Since most renewable energy investments are in this category, few renewable energy develop- ments will be entered into immediately by the private sector. Unless, that is, financial incentives can be put in place that adequately bridge the gap with commercial expec- tations of rates of return on investment. Moreover, invest- ment in renewable energy projects deals with often \u201cnon- viable\u201d project partners such as the electricity distribution franchise holder, the electric cooperative (EC) and often, the local government unit (LGU). Technical and financial capacity is often lacking in the EC and in the LGU, (which is constrained by a low internal revenue allocation, [IRA]). Given this situation, debt servicing is severely limited. Further, legislation and regulatory functions limit the extent of cross-ownership between the generation and distribution of energy. This creates a situation whereby the possibility of accruing substantial benefits due to operational integration remains out of reach. Fourthly, a level playing field for renewable energy has not been created yet, making it almost impossible to penetrate the market in a significant manner. Both national and local politics thus distort the energy sector both in a systemic and an ad hoc basis (ranging from subsidies on fuel prices, delivery costs, etc.; repeated bailouts of ECs; to \u201cfree\u201d gifts of generating equipment/ distribution lines/fuel, etc.). This long-standing problem has yet to be addressed adequately. 76 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region Delay in the maturity of pipeline projects is that project proponents did not have the anticipated sufficient capacity to produce \u201cbankable\u201dbusiness plans.Therefore,more time than expected was invested by NRECG members in supporting proponents with the development of their business propositions. Legislation per se cannot provide the solution. The new Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) may mean a small step forward. As a disincentive for the use of non-renewable energy sources, fossil fuel-based generators will pay a small extra charge for grid access, which would otherwise have benefited renewable energy-based generators. To summarize: The underdeveloped state of renewable energy with few potential and established players who understand investment proposals poses a serious limitation for the expansion of an investment market. The demand is small and the ready market of investors or borrowers for renewable energy funds does not approach the commitment level. The FINESSE approach would have been substantially useful in situations where the government had an effective renewable energy development strategy that would have generated a reasonable amount of demand for investment in the renewable energy projects. 4. Lessons learned The FINESSE project experiences provide valuable lessons for embarking on renewable energy development endeavours in the Philippines and elsewhere. These are summarized below: i) Policy interventions to create a \u201cfair ground\u201d for renewables are a necessary precursor for expanded financing for the renewable energy sector.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6cd4cf5-6582-4da2-ade6-e7d4d4ea15ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6cd4cf5-6582-4da2-ade6-e7d4d4ea15ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04179a1c5498e83dc04372fcf1dec5249397747ea641fc4adf1cbc3558f74d70"}}, "hash": "04179a1c5498e83dc04372fcf1dec5249397747ea641fc4adf1cbc3558f74d70", "text": "The FINESSE project highlights that without appropriate national policy and regulatory frameworks, it is unlikely that demand for financing for renewable energy will increase significantly. Appropriate policy interventions, therefore, are essential to create an atmosphere conducive for the renewable energy sector to grow and sustain itself in any country. ii) Capacity building is needed at all levels of the financing delivery chain. While increasing the capacity and understanding of financiers can lead to the generation of a pipeline of projects that can be evaluated for lending, the FINESSE project experience clearly points out the obvious need for a wide range of capacity-building efforts. The lack of proponents\u2019 capacity means that without incubation by financiers, there will be no pipeline projects. There is a need for strong capacity building of proponents, and indeed at all levels of the financing delivery chain. iii) Financiers need to be equipped with the means to manage risks. Two important issues relating to risk emerged from the FINESSE project experience. First, local politics in several cases directly hampered the lending operations from progressing. Second, stringent mandatory equity requirements imposed by national regulations (to minimize risks) prevented promising renewable energy projects from being financed. In both cases, the DBP had basically no effective means to deal with them, as the conditions set were outside the DBP\u2019s mandate and reach. There is a strong need for a regulatory mechanism that (i) protects financiers from being exposed to political risks and (ii) provides them with the means and flexibility to take calculated risks, for example, reducing equity requirements under certain conditions. iv) Leadership roles to drive mainstreaming to facilitate lending of renewable energy projects are crucial. Institu- tionalizing renewable energy lending in the financing sector is not an easy task, given prevailing internal and external conditions that are mostly not conducive to renewable energy development in developing countries. Under such conditions, what often makes a difference is strong leadership that drives the process. The DBP is a case in point, where the strong personal leadership and commitment of a few staff have led to securing commitment and confidence from senior management and the establishment of a unit dedicated to renewable energy development. 5. Conclusion The experiences in the FINESSE-Philippines project present one good example of how in a sequential manner a financier can develop its capacity in managing renewable energy projects. The process that led to the development of a \u201creal window\u201d for renewable energy investments, where there was none before, offers a best practice. By establishing a bridgehead in the financial institutions of the Philippines, FINESSE has rendered renewable energy development in the country a valuable service, and possibly also elsewhere in the region. 77 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Financing for renewable energy: Lessons from the FINESSE project in the Philippines The DBP is a case in point, where the strong personal leadership and commiment of a few staff have led to securing commitment and confidence from senior management and the establishment of a unit dedicated to renewable energy development. Yet, the DBP\u2019s experiences clearly point out that focusing on financing issues alone cannot result in the desired outcomes. Concerted efforts to create an enabling atmosphere across a wider set of issues \u2013 political, institutional, and financial \u2013 are essential. For this reason, should the FINESSE- type approach be replicated, all of the critical issues raised above at all stages of the project design and implementation phase, including the project management cycle would have to be taken fully into account. The lessons of the FINESSE project have been incorporated into an ongoing renewable energy project in the Philippines funded by the UNDP-GEF, which tackles these barriers in a comprehensive manner. With reputable bankers in its corner, renewable energy stands a much better chance of being treated fairly by politicians and achieving wider recognition of its many advantages. If the pending renewable energy bill is passed and ongoing interventions by the government and bilateral and multilateral partners can deliver on their expected outputs, the demand for financing of renewable energy projects should increase significantly, and eventually, available renewable energy resources can be harnessed. This will contribute to sustainable development in the Philippines. 78 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region Bibliography Asia\u2013Pacific region FINESSE. 1997.

UNDP Samoa has prepared this case study solely. 44 The case study has been prepared by Mr Thomas Lynge Jensen, Sustainable Energy Advisor, UNDP Samoa & UNESCO Apia with input from Ms Easter Galuvao, Assistant Resident Representative (ARR), Environment, UNDP Samoa. Most of the information is from the Feasibility Study \u2013 Possible Future Power Supply Options for Apolima Tai, Samoa, prepared by Mr Gerhard Zieroth, Renewable Energy Consultant for UNDP Samoa and UNESCO Apia, March 2003. 45 E.g. issues related to self-reliance and energy security also are factors that are part of the equation. Chapter 8 Abstract The Sustainable Power Supply on Apolima Island Project, which is in the design phase, is geared towards sustainable, cost-effective, reliable and environmentally sound 24-hour power supply. Samoa depends on imported petroleum for electricity generation and commercial energy supply. More than 95 percent of all households have access to electricity. Apolima Island has a total population of 93, living in nine households. The average monthly energy demand is around 350 kWh while the combined installed load of the current power system is less than 12 kW. The geographical situation, with more around 99 percent of the population living on two main islands, facilitates grid-based electrification. The possible technical options including some of their main benefits, issues and cross- practice linkages have been investigated and compared. Current fuel and lube oil handling poses an environmental concern as there is no storage compound to retain spillage or its recovery. Current operating conditions of the diesel power plant also cause both air and primarily noise pollution. As a centralized solar system needs a surface area to accommodate generation equipment, its location on a narrow volcanic crater creates a space constraint for Apolima. Meanwhile, proper disposal of batteries used in solar electrification systems should also be taken into account. Natural disasters such as cyclones are also a threat for the power supply infrastructure. For small island electrification, environmental and economic issues, and user preferences are all factors to be considered when making a technology decision. Possibly future income generation is also a potential positive impact of this project. Social-energy linkages have been investigated through a stakeholder analysis. At present, development activities in Samoa are guided by the Strategic Development Plan (SDP) Seven, covering 2002 to 2004. Two of the nine key strategic outcomes are relevant to development of the power sector and the planned project on Apolima. Currently, a National Energy Policy is being prepared. The proposed solar-energy project would have a high profile as a pilot project to help understand the technology. The case study also mentions tentative lessons learned and postcase study follow-up. Keywords: Power supply, environmental/economic/social governance energy linkages, solar electrification systems, income generation. 1.2 Country profile Like most Pacific Island Countries (PICs), Samoa depends on imported petroleum for part of its electricity generation and commercial energy supply. While costs for imported petroleum once again have sharply risen, the use of energy remains vital to the economic and social development of local island communities and contributes to improving living conditions by increasing productivity, comfort, and by enhancing commu- nication and transportation facilities. More than three-quarters of the Samoan population lives outside the capital, Apia, in rural areas and while the prospect for economic development tends to be limited in these areas, nevertheless access to energy is important for social and equity reasons. Moreover, the provision of improved infrastructure services, including basic electri- fication, contributes to create a more attractive environment in the rural areas thus helping to mitigate urban drift. While there is usually a broad consensus on the need to provide at least basic electrification in rural areas, the question of how to do it regularly excites the proponents of certain solutions and creates substantial controversy. Unlike other PICs Samoa has pursued a rural electrification policy that aims at complete networking of all residential areas in the country. The geographical situation with more than 95 percent of the population living on the two main islands, facilitates grid- based electrification. 1.3 Island profile Apolima Island, Samoa lies in the Apolima Strait, outside the reef that encircles the main island of Upolu. Being the remnant of a volcano, it features high, steep cliffs that allow access at only one point. The village is located inside a crater that opens to a constricted, difficult passage from the sea. The soil of the island is poor and therefore coconuts and fish are the main sustenance for the residents. There are no roads or vehicles; all transport is by small boat. There is no piped water supply.

There is only one large water tank. Until 1991 there was a small hospital but it was destroyed by Hurricane Val together with several residential buildings. At present, medical care is limited to visits by a doctor from the main island. There are no schooling or kindergarten facilities. A solar-powered public telephone is available. The total population is approximately 93, living in nine households; all families except two live in traditional Samoan fales (i.e. oval open houses) and all families occupy more than one building. It appears that there was significant out-migration in 1991; villagers quote cyclones as the main reason for this. The remnants of several buildings can still be seen in the village. Three families left the island between 1999 and 2003. The village leader considers the current demographic situation to be stable, unless a catastrophic event such as a major cyclone destroys major parts of the village again. The stated monthly household income fluctuates between WST$500 and 1,20046. All families receive income from more than one source. The most common sources are fishing (either selling fish caught or working on a fishing boat for a salary) and remittances. The monthly incomes do not show large variations. Current energy expenditure as a percentage of income is comparatively low for most households. There are two fishing boats in the village that are also used for transpor purposes. All families have small fields where they grow taro and vegetables. Other sources of income include revenue from the sale of agricultural produce (taro) and domestic animals, pandanus mats, transport fees (for the boat owners) and the Electric Power Corporation (EPC) salary for the operator of the generator. The village leader occasionally builds canopies for fishing boats. 84 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region 46 (US1.00 = WST$2.94) Apolima Island 2. Project status Inception: A feasibility study of possible 24-hour supply options was prepared by the Government of Samoa, EPC, UNESCO Apia and UNDP Samoa. UNESCO Apia and UNDP Samoa co-funded the study, which was finalized in March 2003. Current status: The project is in the design phase. A final decision regarding the future power supply option has yet to be made by the EPC Board and the Cabinet Development Committee (CDC), Government of Samoa, but the recommended option is the utilization of solar energy. 3. Project input and profile As mentioned, the project design is currently under- way, but the expected outcome is a sustainable, cost effective, reliable and environmentally sound 24-hour power supply. 4. Project impacts A description and discussion of some of the major linkages between energy and cross-cutting issues that UNDP Samoa will consider when determining possible (non-hardware) support to the project is given hereunder. The issues mentioned in the following sections (e.g. energy-social linkages) may also have aspects relating to another category (e.g. energy-technical linkages). Thus the categorizing is tentative and non-exclusive. 4.1 Technical\u2013energy linkages 4.1.1 Current situation in the Apolima power system Generation: A 20 kW diesel generator currently generates electricity. Only the evening peak demand from 1800 until 2300 is supplied. There is however, some flexibility to operate the generator on special occasions such as for funerals and major rugby matches on television. EPC technicians come to the island once a month to service the unit and bring with them the required fuel and lube oil. The village leader currently operates the generator. The operator does not carry out any maintenance. Services such as changing filters are performed by the EPC. The technical lifetime of the engine has exceeded its capacity and therefore it is in suboptimal condition. For example, the engine leaks during operation and generation records show sub- optimal conversion efficiencies for the Apolima generator. Evidence of some lube oil and fuel spills can be seen around the powerhouse. Distribution, meter reading and billing: As all current consumers are located within one kilometre of the powerhouse, a low voltage distribution system is sufficient to supply electricity to the houses. In line with EPC standards in Upolu and Savaii, all houses have meters and are fused at 35 A. (i.e. the connections allow a total load of 8 kW).

Appliances such as water kettles, sandwich makers and irons exist, but residents use them infrequently because they encounter significant voltage fluctuations (flickering lights) when they are used. There has been a slightly increasing electricity demand over the last three years. 4.1.2 Possible technical options Table 8-1 summarizes some of the possible technical options, including some of their main benefits and issues. 85 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Sustainable power supply on Apolima Island, Samoa Apolima Island: an aerial view 86 Table 8-1: Possible technical options Technical option Benefits Issues Do nothing \u2022 Generator will continue to operate in a suboptimal mode and have negative impacts on the environment \u2022 In the short term there is a risk that the diesel engine will have a breakdown Increase supply hours and monitor load \u2022 Energy services increased \u2022 Information on load outside the evening peak would become available \u2022 Efficiency level of the generator would decrease \u2022 Negative impacts on the environment would increase \u2022 Financial losses would increase Upgrade existing diesel system (i.e. new genset, new powerhouse relocated, prepaid meters, training and Demand Side Management) \u2022 Less fuel consumption compared to existing situation \u2022 Reduced environmental impacts compared to existing situation \u2022 Lower supply cost compared to existing situation \u2022 Possibility to extend supply hours according to demand \u2022 Vulnerable to a decline in demand triggered by loss of population \u2022 Expensive overcapacity Undersea cable (from mainland) \u2022 24-hour supply \u2022 No environmental hazards \u2022 Loads on Apolima are only 15 kW peak and the minimum capacity sea cable available is 6,000 kW, i.e. extremely expensive overcapacity \u2022 Specialized cable laying equipment required Centralized solar system \u2022 24-hour supply \u2022 The existing distribution system and all consumer appliances could be retained \u2022 No pollution (including no noise) \u2022 Total independence for fuel supply \u2022 Comparatively low level of maintenance and service \u2022 Vulnerable to a decline in demand triggered by loss of population \u2022 Expensive overcapacity \u2022 Supply limited by battery capacity \u2022 Some restrictions would have to be imposed on the use of high-powered devices (such as kettles and irons) \u2022 Power would be unavailable during occasional occurrences of extended periods of cloud \u2022 Photovoltaic (PV) technology is relatively new to the island \u2022 Expectation that external assistance will be provided to fund/co-fund this project Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region 87 Table 8-1: Possible technical options (continued) Technical option Benefits Issues Solar-diesel hybrid \u2022 Distribution system can be used \u2022 Less pollution \u2022 Supply not limited \u2022 Technically more complex than centralized diesel or solar only systems \u2022 Expensive overcapacity \u2022 High performance batteries used in hybrid configurations are sensitive to the level of maintenance \u2022 Appears that hybrid technology would be best introduced in an environment that is more conducive to monitoring and technical back up \u2022 PV technology is relatively new to the island \u2022 Expectation that external assistance will be provided to fund/co-fund this project Solar Home Systems (SHS) \u2022 Would be a classic site for a basic electrification by individual solar home systems.

The supplies are stored close to the powerhouse. At present there is no storage compound to retain spillage or to enable recovery of spillage. Fuel is transferred from drums into the overhead tank supplying the diesel engine. There is no explicit procedure guiding response to any leakage or spillage. Some oil spilling has been observed around the powerhouse. It is mainly lube oil that leaks from the engine into the environment. Minor spills during fuel handling possibly add to the problem. The environmental impact of oil depends on the way in which exposure takes place. In the immediate vicinity of the oil spills, flora and fauna could be harmed or in the worst case destroyed. The adverse effects of long-term exposure of small amounts of oil are not so obvious. Oil causes severe damage to plants, the seeds and the normal micro flora in the soil. Oil-degrading bacteria also deplete oxygen and nutrients in the soil. Oil can contaminate surface water when it rains or it may penetrate through the soil into ground- water. As the residents of Apolima mainly use rainwater and water from an up-hill stream, there is probably no immediate danger for the population. It is likely that a portion of the oil spilled at the powerhouse eventually ends up in the coastal waters. Oil is toxic for animal and plant life in the water. The practice of burning waste oil-soaked rugs to dispose of the oil can contaminate both the air and the soil, since air impurities settle on vegetation and the soil. Combustion gases from burning waste oil may contain heavy metals, soot, carbon monoxide and various organic compounds. The safest disposal of waste oil produced in the electricity operations on Apolima is to collect the oil in drums and ship it to Apia for proper disposal or recycling. Other impacts of the diesel plant: Under the current operating conditions exhaust gases contain a proportion of smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) resulting from the suboptimal combustion of fuel. Other air pollutants include sulphur oxide (SOx), nitrous oxide (NOx) and carbon dioxide. Although higher than they could be, the quantities of emissions are equivalent to those of a small vehicle. Therefore they do not pose a local environmental problem (nor do they contribute in any significant way to global greenhouse gas accumulation). Due to the current location of the small powerhouse, noise pollution poses a problem for some of the residents whose houses are only 20 metres from the diesel generator. Relocation of the powerhouse and/or sound- proofing would mitigate this problem. 4.2.2 Solar electrification systems Batteries: While recycling of lead-acid batteries is in principle a straightforward procedure, experience in solar electrification projects has shown that used batteries might be dumped on a beach, creating an eyesore and an environmental hazard. This becomes a concern particularly when low quality starter batteries (that need to be replaced frequently) are used. The undiluted waste acids (pH <2.0) pose a health hazard for people who come in direct contact with the electrolytes. Lead is a heavy metal that should not enter groundwater resources or the food chain. Assuming that high quality batteries are used that last up to eight years, this problem could be reduced substantially. The technician responsible for the project and/ or the village leader should also make sure that batteries, when replaced, are sent to Apia for possible future recycling. Space: Given that Apolima village is located in a narrow volcanic crater, the space required by a centralized solar system might be a problem. All centralized systems need a certain surface area that accommodates generation equipment, fuel and other supplies. Apart from requiring a powerhouse for the diesel generators, solar systems will use substantial space for the arrays. Per kWp power installed, a PV collector surface of approximately 7.5 m2 will be required for crystalline solar cells. The land area actually required would be approximately", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6bec06d5-8c05-4d41-bf34-19ebe5022a86": {"__data__": {"id_": "6bec06d5-8c05-4d41-bf34-19ebe5022a86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "659ca6d75afc324b0547af39e5edfc56bfcb599d0e344fc8c7a0cb0b263d20e3"}}, "hash": "659ca6d75afc324b0547af39e5edfc56bfcb599d0e344fc8c7a0cb0b263d20e3", "text": "twice this surface given that the arrays must be well clear of vegetation. The clearance must be sufficient to avoid shading of the panels. 88 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region Oil causes severe damage to plants,the seeds and the normal micro flora in the soil.Oil-degrading bacteria also deplete oxygen and nutrients in the soil. 4.2.3 Climate change issues Even though the current quantities of emissions are negligible, and thus contribute in no significant way to global greenhouse gas accumulation, the issue is at some level relevant for a Small Island Developing State (SIDS) like Samoa. In Samoa\u2019s First National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) it is mentioned: \u201cThe emissions of GHG in Samoa are relatively insignificant by world standards. Notwithstanding, Samoa is among the most vulnerable countries to the impacts of the greenhouse effect. It is ethical, therefore, that Samoa should recognize its obligation toward reducing GHG emissions\u201d. It could be argued that since PICs such as Samoa have not caused the problem, they bear little responsibility for a solution under any reasonable scenario for future energy-use patterns. Global climate change will never be measurably affected by the insignificant impact of the PICs \u2013 the PIC emissions represented about 0.02 percent of total world carbon emissions in 1990. But SIDS may find it difficult to lobby effectively for global action unless they are themselves seen to take reason- able measures to progressively switch from fossil fuels to renewables (and reduce energy consumption). Therefore on the other hand, it could be argued that the PICs need to be jointly able to demonstrate that they are prepared to undertake the measures and activities that they are recommen- ding to others (i.e. the developed countries as main emitters). This argument could be one of the reasons that the PICs in September/October 2002 agreed that they should work together to achieve a regional target of increasing the share of renewable energy to at least 15 percent of the primary energy supply by 2010.47 4.2.4 Natural disasters It is possible that a cyclone might again destroy major parts of the village. Such an event would substantially damage any power supply infrastruc- ture. For example, during cyclones the PV arrays are not only vulnerable to damage from dislodged palms and other debris, but they also provide a large surface area to be leveled by high winds. A solar array that becomes dislodged during a cyclone becomes a major hazard. Thus cyclone-proof racks and mountings have to be used. 4.3 Economic\u2013energy linkages 4.3.1 Economic and financial issues The financial performances of the realistic technology options (i.e. new centralized diesel, centralized solar, solar-diesel hybrid and SHS) are marginal even under the best of assumptions. None of the project configurations are \u201cbankable\u201d and can only be realized with considerable subsidies and/or donor contributions. A financial analysis would therefore not yield meaningful results, even if facilities such as carbon credits were taken into consideration. It is therefore more meaningful to analyse the potential for economic cost savings in the operation of Apolima electricity supply, which inter alia would avoid negative environ- mental impacts and maximize the contribution of the local community to the supply of electricity. It is not unusual that initial capital costs in rural electrification are subsidized in order to facilitate access to electricity for communities that would not otherwise be supplied under commercial terms. In such instances, economic rationale still prevails. There is always a least cost solution, i.e. a solution where a subsidy is provided in the most efficient way. Thus an approach that does not investigate the economic viability of a project but helps to find the solution that involves the lowest economic cost or the lowest subsidy required has been applied. From such a perspective distributed solar systems turn out to be the least cost option. Even if the fuel price is held constant in real terms, distributed solar power still remains the least cost solution. The second best solution is diesel including moderate DSM (30 percent savings) followed by diesel supplying the actual load. Central solar and solar hybrid are significantly more costly than diesel and distributed solar power. Thus power 89 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Sustainable power supply on Apolima Island, Samoa 47 Apparently the main reason was that the PICs need to work together to address some of the issues advocated by them, but not addressed adequately by the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD).

This proposal was not agreed on. But a group of likeminded countries \u2013 led by the European Union \u2013 in their Joint Declaration agreed that they intend to go beyond the WSSD agreement reached in the area of renewable energy.Around 67 countries were behind this initiative.Of these countries 37 or more than 50 percent were SIDS. It is therefore more meaningful to analyse the potential for economic cost savings in the operation of Apolima electricity supply,which inter alia would avoid negative environmental impacts and maximize the contribution of the local community to the supply of electricity. supply in Apolima is a subsidized operation where the primary objective is not, it seems, to have been cost recovery per se, but to supply a remote community on social justice grounds (among others). This indicates that for small island electrification, factors other than capital O&M cost should form the basis for making the decision as to which technology to use. Environmental issues, economic activity issues, issues relating to reduction of economic and political dependence on fossil fuel imports and user48 preference are all factors which need to be considered when making the technology decision.49 4.3.2 Income generation With respect to the positive impacts from income generation, 24-hour supply is expected in the short term to have a small impact. Women have mentioned that the weaving of mats could be extended and potentially generate more short-term cash income. Weaving already occurs at night, often in poor kerosene light. Extended lighting will improve the conditions in which the women work, enable them to work longer hours when required with less eye strain and provide better conditions to ensure the quality of their work is maintained. In the medium and long term, the impact could be substantial via activities related to small-scale business (potentially tourism,fishing and small shops). 4.4 Social\u2013energy linkages (including gender) 4.4.1 Stakeholder analysis Multiple stakeholders and different points of view: Different stakeholders have different views with respect to problems encountered. Table 8-2 displays the major stakeholders together with some of their possible expectations and issues. The EPC: In order to understand the EPC with regard to the Apolima operation, it is helpful to consider its scale relative to the entire EPC operation: while the Upolu island system supplies approx 7.5 million kWh per month, Apolima accounts for an average of 400 kWh. The Government of Samoa: From the government\u2019s perspective the theme and focus of the current Strategic Development Plan (SDP) are opportunities for everyone, with the government intending to reduce tensions in society arising from actual and perceived inequities. To address this, the government remains convinced that strengthening family values and Samoa\u2019s social structure are key elements to achieving and maintaining social harmony, i.e. the benefits of development should be shared equitably across society. 90 Table 8-2: Major stakeholders and their expectations/issues Stakeholder Possible expectations Possible issues Power utility \u2022 Reduction of technical and non-technical losses \u2022 Financially viable operation \u2022 Customer satisfaction \u2022 Moral hazards created by defaulting customers \u2022 Subsidization of individual operations undermine viability Government \u2022 Environmentally sound operation \u2022 Operation in line with current legislation and policies \u2022 Social justice \u2022 Political repercussions \u2022 Continuous subsidy for rural electrification Villages \u2022 Reliable 24-hour supply of electricity Low tariffs \u2022 No pollution of their environment \u2022 Support by EPC for their power supply \u2022 Being involved in the planning process for new supply \u2022 Tariff increase \u2022 Strict implementation of disconnection policy \u2022 Loss of supply Donors \u2022 Economically viable projects \u2022 Environmentally sound, sustainable projects \u2022 Least cost solution \u2022 Unexpected negative impacts (social, environmental) \u2022 Bad publicity Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and The Pacific Region 48 Review of the PREFACE Project \u2013 A Joint France/Australia Renewable Energy Programme, p. 7, 2002, by Mr Herbert Wade and co-workers. 49 Ibid. Development priorities of the residents of Apolima: In order to assess the importance villagers attached to an extended electricity supply, the development priorities of Apolima were explored in consultation with the residents. Development priorities or problems mentioned by the villagers were also discussed with the village leaders in order to cross-check consistency of responses. Both male and female members of families were interviewed and women were given the opportunity to develop and discuss development priorities. Problems were identified and then ranked using a matrix ranking. The results of the ranking exercise are provided in Table 8-3, which shows the ranking of priorities separated by gender. Although the ranking of development priorities seems rational, the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2986d9df-cbd2-49e1-b079-be5404fdde44": {"__data__": {"id_": "2986d9df-cbd2-49e1-b079-be5404fdde44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "837ac62d7f3dff9f2428509eb5e7493a6e0db2f6be2d5b477987ede72585e16a"}}, "hash": "837ac62d7f3dff9f2428509eb5e7493a6e0db2f6be2d5b477987ede72585e16a", "text": "results of qualitative surveys using participatory rural appraisal (PRA) toolss hould always be taken with some caution. What can be concluded with some degree of confidence is that a 24-hour electricity supply is probably not the first development priority. Reliable access/ transport and schooling for young children outrank it. Electricity supply also takes a different ranking across the two genders. It seems to be more important for men (who probably value entertainment by radio and TV/VCR) than women. UNDP (Samoa): UNDP recognizes that Energy and Environment are essential for sustainable development and thus it is one of UNDP\u2019s corporate thematic focus/practice areas. With regard to energy, UNDP has four cooperate energy priority areas. These are as follows: (1) strengthening national policy frameworks to support energy for poverty reduction and sustainable development; (2) promoting rural energy services to support growth and equity; (3) promoting clean energy technologies for sustainable development; and (4) increasing access to investment financing for sustainable development. With this overall level in mind, the Apolima Project in particular should be seen in the context of priority areas (2) and (3). In the Country Programme Outline (CPO) for Samoa (2003\u20132007) it is stated that UNDP\u2019s interventions will concentrate on three main streams of input that support the Strategy for the Development of Samoa (2002\u20132004) and the United Nations Development Assistance Frame- work (2003\u20132007) with strategic areas of focus and associated goals. One of these three main streams of input is Sustainable Management of Natural Resources. Here the goal is to assist in obtaining sustainable environmental manage- ment and energy development to improve the livelihoods and security of the poor. Inter alia, this is to be achieved through institutional frameworks for sustainable environmental manage- ment and energy development. Regarding the results and resources framework the objective is to improve natural resource management and promote environmental sustainability. One of the outputs is that renewable energy is integrated into the national development agenda. 4.4.2 Social impacts of 24-hour power supply It is difficult to assess social impacts from extending the service hours of electricity supply. Firstly, it is unlikely that this change would have any dramatic effects on the social structure or on the life of particular groups. It should be noted that most of Samoa\u2019s rural population does have 24-hour supply and there is no indication of this electrification having significant negative effects. An extended electricity supply using the existing diesel would of course extend socially disruptive noise into the night hours. In terms of affordability, there seems to be no problem. The incomes stated by the families are comparatively high and expenditures for energy services would require less than 10 percent of the households\u2019 incomes under the demand scenario for extended supply hours. 91 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Table 8-3: Ranked village development problems Problem Rank: Male Rank: Female Unreliable and inadequate sea transport to the island 1 2 No schooling for young children (classes 1+2) 3 1 Lack of medical care, infrequent visits by health workers 4 3 Lack of 24-hour electricity supply 2 5 Lack of income opportunities 5 4 Lack of hurricane shelter 6 6 Sustainable power supply on Apolima Island, Samoa 4.4.3 Migration With respect to the risk of regular out-migration, any centralized power supply system would be most vulnerable to a decline in demand triggered by loss of population. Distributed solar electrification on the other hand is easy to move and the systems are a tradable commodity. 4.4.4 Payment of electricity Some of the metered consumers are in arrears. Any intervention in the Apolima electricity supply should therefore include an effort to secure payment for electricity used. Prepaid metering could possibly be an appropriate solution. The EPC already runs a successful trial with 30 pre-paid meters on Upolu using the \u201ccash power\u201d system. This system is based on a numerical code that is generated by a central computer. The code is bought by the individual consumer and entered into a keypad on the meter that registers the credits bought and dispenses electricity accordingly. Introducing \u201ccash power\u201d meters would only require the purchase of additional meters. All other systems are already in place at the EPC and EPC staff are familiar with the system. 4.5 Governance-energy linkages 4.5.1 National development planning Such a project should obviously be seen within the context of Samoan government develop- ment plans and programmes for the power sector. Future electrification projects should aim at consistency with the central government develop- ment plans. Highlights of plans for both the SDP and the EPC Corporate Plan are provided below.

In recent years the government has taken substantial steps to tackle weaknesses in the energy sector in general and the electricity sector in particular. Currently a National Energy Policy is not available, but one is currently being prepared. The Strategic Development Plan Seven: Development activities in Samoa are currently guided by the Strategic Development Plan (SDP) Seven that covers the period 2002 to 2004.50 This plan lists nine key strategic outcomes. Two of these outcomes are relevant to development of the power sector and are considered relevant to the planned project on Apolima.These are: \u2022 Access to safe, efficient and reliable infrastructure and services (water, electricity, telecommuni- cations, transport) is important for an improved quality of life. The government will aim to provide efficient and effective infrastructure and services not only to the town areas but also to the rural and remote areas of Samoa. \u2022 Continuation of the public sector reform programme has a high priority as a key strategic outcome. The government believes much still remains to be done in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector, including Public Bodies. This is an essential component for further strengthening the enabling environment and building confidence for private sector investment and development, translating into further employment creation. The electricity sector is specifically mentioned under the infrastructure development programme. The SDP states: \u201cConsiderable investment has been directed to building the infrastructure services necessary to support the achievement of the key strategic outcomes. In the next three years, government will concentrate on improving asset management through upgrading the management efficiency of the relevant agencies. To this end, institutional strengthening efforts have commenced for the EPC, Public Works Department (PWD) and SWA.\u201d For the electricity sector the SDP specifically demands: \u201cThe Corporate Plan and Business Plan now in place will guide the work of the Corporation towards achieving its goals. It will also instill commercial discipline in its operation. Part of the plan includes the creation of a Customer Relations Section focusing on enhancing customer services. The EPC will also review its tariff structure to improve its financial viability. The plan is expected to improve the Corporation\u2019s management and operational efficiency.\u201d In addition the SDP states that the 92 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region 50 The SDP was developed in close consultation with all stakeholders including village communities. This, of course, is at the core of good governance. Access to safe,efficient and reliable infrastructure and services (water,electricity, telecommunications, transport) is important for an improved quality of life. rural electrification programme will continue and it can be expected that full national coverage will be achieved soon. These strategy guidelines clearly set the scene for projects in the electricity sector. While improvements and expansion of infrastructure services are considered essential, the policy focus is on public sector reform, improvements in management efficiency, opera- tional effectiveness and financial viability of the utilities. 4.5.2 The EPC Corporate Plan The EPC\u2019s role and functions are clearly defined in the Electric Power Corporation Act of 1980 and its various Amendments. Accordingly, the EPC is the sole provider of electricity in Samoa and as such an essential part of the economy. Following the strategic guidelines of the government, the EPC developed its first corporate plan in March 2000. Although the plan nominally covers the period 2000 to 2002 it has not yet been updated and is still considered the relevant guide- line for managing the EPC\u2019s operation. The plan \u201csets the framework for rigorous, output- oriented, customer focused performance, management and evaluation\u201d. It is based on 12 assumptions some of which can also be considered as outputs as they are under the control of the EPC. (i.e. the EPC will become financially viable, services of the EPC will improve, manage- ment will be responsible for decisions). As far as this project is concerned, the plan commits the EPC to implement cost- effective engineering solutions, to make prudent investments and to conduct safe installations. The plan also emphasizes the reduction of losses and the importance of ensuring that revenues are collected. 4.5.3 Institutional linkages At present, Apolima electricity supply forms part of the EPC\u2019s rural electrification programme. As such the island is treated like any other village. Meter reading and billing follow standard EPC procedures. This also implies that customers have to pay their electricity bills in Apia.51 The EPC as an implementing agency: Implementing a project through the EPC would be in line with the utility\u2019s mandate. In principle there would be a continuation of the past institutional arrangement, perhaps with", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "130167ca-7675-491c-878b-f77ce8f5a153": {"__data__": {"id_": "130167ca-7675-491c-878b-f77ce8f5a153", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bfefbfd0e74e575d777db7b3cd02ef1a284e7dac363f839e594175c00baa2bbe"}}, "hash": "bfefbfd0e74e575d777db7b3cd02ef1a284e7dac363f839e594175c00baa2bbe", "text": "some minor changes. However EPC senior staff have indicated that suggestions on alternative institutional arrangements could be openly appraised. The EPC seems willing to consider outsourcing the operation as long as operational safety and EPC electrification standards are maintained. This opens up an opportunity for a community-based project as discussed below. Implementation by the community: In recent years, community-based, decentralized rural electrification projects have become a common feature in many countries. These concepts aim at community empowerment, i.e. project management by the community is intended to contribute to greater community self-reliance, problem-solving and project management skills. It is also supposed to improve the payment of monthly fees by ensuring the accountability of beneficiaries to the community and, if designed in a sensitive manner, community manage- ment could improve the overall management of the technical systems, and relationships between participants. Such an approach requires community mobilization, i.e. a process by which communities are facili- tated to unite to achieve collective goals, support the project and participate in its implementation. Participatory methodologies are generally used to facilitate the community mobilization process. While community-based projects exist in other sectors in Samoa, the concept has not yet been used in the electrification field where the EPC\u2019s grid extension policy has provided power to more than 95 percent of the population. The possibility of handing the electri- fication scheme over to the community has been discussed with the leaders and family heads in Apolima. While the concept was not completely discarded by the villagers, a clear preference was expressed for the EPC to remain in charge of the operation. Handing over an electricity supply to the community of Apolima is nevertheless considered as an option that would be in line with the current policy of the government to enhance self-reliance. A more realistic solution could be to hand day-to-day operation and revenue collection to the community with the EPC 93 Challenges and Lessons from UNDP Projects Sustainable power supply on Apolima Island, Samoa 51 The residents of Apolima consider this procedure cumbersome and offering the customers an easier way to pay their bills might help to reduce arrears. The policy focus is on public sector reform, improvements in management efficiency, operational effectiveness and financial viability of the utilities. providing technical back up. Again, there is a need to enhance and strengthen the capacities of the community to manage their own power supply. As such this should be an integral component of the project. Further, well-defined roles and responsibilities between the stakeholders concerned should be clearly identified. 4.6 Replication\u2013energy linkages The proposed solar energy project could have a high profile in Samoa, as it would depart from the conventional approach taken by the EPC in the past. It would be designed for ease of replication in other communities, mainly in Savaii. The distributed solar option has thus far, not been a mainstream solution in Samoa. As a consequence there is little institutional knowledge nor a commercial structure to support a project of this nature. On the other hand, this could be taken as an argument in favour of a renewable energy solution. As pressure increases on the EPC to become more efficient and a commercially viable provider of electricity, the utility may want to learn about feasible options to separate subsidized parts of its operation, use technologies that are better adopted to low load densities and maybe hand over remote, rural electricity supply operations to the benefiting communities. Thus a pilot project to test a different approach might be welcome. While the main island of Upolu is nearly fully electrified based on grid extension, the distributed solar systems could potentially offer an economically and financially attractive solution for significant parts of the other main island of Savaii. A pilot project might help to understand the technology. 5. Lessons learned Listed hereunder are some of the tentative lessons the UNDP Country Office in Samoa learned during the preparation of this project and case study: a)Even in a very small and well-defined context (e.g. like a small island community) many energy cross-sector linkages and issues are present and therefore sustainable energy interventions are complex, no matter the scale of intervention. b)This implies further that a holistic approach to the design and formulation of the actual project of course is optimal, but at the same time it is unrealistic in most projects and programme contexts to set out to cover and address \u201ceverything\u201d. Thus at some point there must be a choice by the stakeholders involved on which cross-sector linkages and issues have priority and therefore can and/or should be addressed in a particular project. c) On", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6865cc2-57c2-4175-aed4-28f4e37f1e47": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6865cc2-57c2-4175-aed4-28f4e37f1e47", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-sustainable-development-asia-and-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3fc0b1b4bd7fd33a9e8a76a6de52f497506af8fdfc3ff920d6a32593c3987d7c"}}, "hash": "3fc0b1b4bd7fd33a9e8a76a6de52f497506af8fdfc3ff920d6a32593c3987d7c", "text": "the other hand the cross-sector linkage(s) and issue(s) that are given priority and thus become part of the project focus will depend on the specific project context (e.g. scale, culture), points of view (e.g. the recipients, donors, governments, utility in question, etc) and specific time period (e.g. prevailing schools of thought/paradigms). d)For many cases of small island electrification in the Pacific, linkages other than energy-economy will form the basis for deciding on which technology to use: social-energy, technical-energy and environmental-energy are all factors, which need to be considered when making the decision regarding energy form, technology, institutional set-up, etc. 6. Post-case study follow up Hereunder is specified tentatively how this case study is applicable to the programming and policy work in the UNDP Country Office in Samoa: a)There is a need to apply holistic approaches to the design and formulation of actual projects to ensure cross-linkages and synergies are reflected and that relevant practices of the UNDP are formed. b)There is a need for increased knowledge and capacity building in the area of energy cross-sector linkages. 94 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region Apolima Island: in the village 96 Energy for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific Region", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d4420bc-b396-4b4b-ae12-368e222d821b": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d4420bc-b396-4b4b-ae12-368e222d821b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "787a6ebb62993723f68aa8afe4367ebac2714b1aa6b3c5f7de35f7a060be35b9"}, "3": {"node_id": "dad23763-efeb-4d7f-86ee-3df429015bfb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "091d10e617fe2225221e226f037bcdeffd0231b5968d74f5e93236bd8cabb463"}}, "hash": "ebc1839d8f1069755e5dd5d12cbc5a75cea44b48a1efc21cd36f7b0e7069eda0", "text": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection Asia-Pacific Inclusive Growth and Development Summary of e-Discussion Empowered lives.

Concurrently, social protection instruments may help sustain and consolidate gains and form a basis for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) with greater equity .1 1 UN General Assembly, Outcome Document of the High-Level Plenary Meeting of the 65th session of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), A/65/L .1, 17 September 2010 (The MDG Summit 2010) . ASIA-PACIFIC INCLUSIVE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre SOCIAL PROTECTION E-DISCUSSION 2 Launch Message Nicholas Rosellini Deputy Assistant Administrator and Deputy Regional Director Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific United Nations Development Programme Dear Colleagues: I am pleased to announce the launch of an e-discussion on social protection . The set of recent crises, rapid urbanization, and widening economic and social disparities has led to greater vulnerability in Asia and the Pacific . Given the importance of social protection instruments in addressing social and economic vulnerability, we would like to gain from your knowledge and experience as practitioners, as experts and as UN colleagues in country offices . The primary aim of this e-discussion is to deepen our knowledge on waysand means of making social protection instruments work for countries in Asia and the Pacific . Asia and the Pacific has a lot to be proud of; it has recorded high levels of sustained growth, made large reductions in poverty, achieved greater gender parity in primary, secondary and tertiary education enrolment, reversed the spread of HIV, and managed to curb ozone depleting substances and expanded access to safe drinking water . What is perhaps missing is consistency in achievement across countries and within countries . Aggregate figures mask the reality; where high growth has not significantly improved the plight of vulnerable and marginalized groups; where chronic hunger continues to persist at a large scale, especially in South Asia despite marked increases in GDP per capita; where easy and equitable access to key services and goods, especially at the more local level, remains unrealized in many countries . It is this Asia, where a great deal is still left to be desired . Social protection measures, while not a panacea for development challenges, aim to target many of these deprivations . The objective is to better manage risks and reduce vulnerabilities so that societies are more resilient . We know that the recent set of crises and disasters has set back development gains, pushed 3 Introduction vulnerable populations to the brink, and made employment less secure . While a number of countries have embarked on social protection initiatives, these measures remain fragmented . Expenditure on social protection programmes and their overall coverage remain low . With this in mind, this e-discussion on social protection seeks to draw from your expertise, knowledge and experience so that we can better serve the countries we work in, both at the policy and programmatic level . I invite all of you to actively participate and contribute . The discussion kicks off today and will be conducted on both this email group and UN Teamworks\u2014a collaborative platform which allows you to share and access knowledge on development issues, engage in interactive discussions with colleagues, share your updates, blogs, success stories, etc ., and access available and continuously updated good practices . UNDP staff may directly access the Teamwork\u2019s space, Ensuring Inclusion: An e-Discussion on Social Protection .2 For others, instructions to sign-up to Teamworks will follow . Please feel free to share this widely to broaden participation . We hope to build on this small but significant step . Background Asia-Pacific has emerged as engine of global growth, with several economies achieving consistently high growth rates for over a decade . It is seen as a region whose demand for goods and services could provide a way out of the global economic downturn . But despite impressive economic performance, the region continues to have the largest population living in poverty compared to other regions .

Moreover, increasing economic disparities and social cleavages are putting strains on the fabric of societies by increasing the risk of social and political upheaval . Marginalized populations and groups including women find it difficult to access basic services and resources, have little control (and ownership) over their assets, and often lack the means of production to escape poverty . While many countries in the Asia-Pacific region have already implemented a variety of social protection interventions, they remain fragmented, inadequate and often problematic . Social protection schemes generally analyse the risks 2 UN Teamwork Space, Ensuring Inclusion: An e-Discussion on Social Protection, available at https:// undp .unteamworks .org/node/124146 4 and vulnerabilities of categories of poor and excluded social groups, differentiated according to age, health status and relationship to formal labour markets . This has led to the exclusion of women from social protection schemes since they are not represented in large numbers in formal labour markets . In addition, women and men face different vulnerabilities and risks, some caused or worsened by discrimination and inequality and others specific to their gender . For the same reasons, the impacts of social protection programmes are gendered, and poorly designed programmes can exacerbate or contribute to inequalities . However, experience across other countries and regions suggests that well designed, context-specific social protection policies can be effective in providing minimum safety nets . Simultaneously, the region can benefit from other countries and regions experiences in strengthening design and financing of social protection policies and programmes . Although social protection is not a panacea, it can help in reducing economic risk and managing vulnerability as countries continue towards empowering their populations . Objectives As social policies and programmes expand and take hold in countries in Asia- Pacific, there is a need to bring the variety of fragmented social protection instruments under a comprehensive approach . Also, conceptually there is a need to draw boundaries between social protection measures and general areas of development policy and programmes . The objective of the e-discussion is to explore the potential of social protection across the wide range of policies and sectors, bringing in comparative strengths of different agencies to enhance collaboration, synergies and better utilization of UNDP\u2019s expertise to improve social protection systems at the country level . By using a regional platform for the e-discussion, we hope to make the discussion on social protection relevant for UN country office programming as well as other development partners . The value addition is consolidation of directly applicable expertise, knowledge, and experiences from other countries within and outside the region . Also, given that social protection programs are often capacity intensive, in the sense of demanding complex institutional and financing arrangements, it is also critical that UNDP be able to identify appropriate entry points and offer targeted strategies to address institutional capacity constraints and implementation bottlenecks of social protection schemes . 5 Introduction The substantive contributions of the e-roundtable discussion provided a basis for Session 2: Social Protection for Accelerating and Sustaining the MDGs at the UNDP Regional Meeting on the MDG Acceleration Policies, Strategies and Good Practices: Towards Inclusive and Sustainable Development, Bangkok, Thailand 5 October 2011 .

A series of recent crises\u2014 financial, oil, food crises, and climate-related disasters\u2014 have renewed the interest of policymakers, development practitioners, and academics in social protection initiatives as a means to counteract the socio-economic impact of shocks . Moreover, persistent development deficits, new challenges of rapid urbanization, as well as widening economic and social disparities, have led to greater vulnerability in the Asia-Pacific region, exacerbating the risk of social and political stability . As traditional social support systems are severely stretched, policy-backed systems of social protection are increasingly viewed as providing a basic minimum response to crises by managing risks and reducing vulnerabilities of those likely to be most affected . Moreover, social protection instruments may help sustain and consolidate gains, and form a basis for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) with equity . 1 2 9 Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes In Part 1 of the discussion, members were invited to share experiences and insights on the following: What are the key features of successful social protection schemes? Members were requested to focus on the following aspects: \u2022\ufffd What was the key issue/s the scheme was attempting to address? How was it successful? What were the key strengths and limitations? \u2022\ufffd How did the scheme manage risks and/or reduce vulnerabilities? \u2022\ufffd What were the socially-differentiated impacts of the scheme/s? How was gender accounted for? \u2022\ufffd What were the institutional arrangements? (e .g . between sectors; national and local levels; public sector institutions and other institutions) . \u2022\ufffd What was the time horizon and operational implications? (i .e . design, cost, implementation, sustainability, accountability etc .) . \u2022\ufffd Is it feasible to universalize and sustain the scheme/s? Summary Over the course of Part 1 of the e-discussion on social protection (SP), 7\u201323 September 2011, we received 20 responses to the topic question: What are the Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes?

In addition, we learned how some countries such as India are integrating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sensitive policies into their social protection programmes; in essence expanding the definition of vulnerable to include people living with HIV (PLWH) and their families . Moreover, we were also led to consider the crucial role of social protection in mitigating the socio-economic impact of disaster on peoples\u2019 lives .

On the other hand, MGNREGA does make its records available for public scrutiny (in accordance with the Right to 10 Information Act, 2005), allowing a degree of accountability, and thus paving the way for subsequent improvements to the programme . Moreover, in the case of Indonesia\u2019s conditional cash transfer programme, which aims to improve education and health outcomes (Family Hope Program or Program Keluarga Harapan or PKH), Vita Febriany notes that PKH is largely a demand driven programme, and has not paid sufficient attention to supply-side issues and constraints, particularly with respect to services providers (i .e . health and education) . Sometimes, overcoming supply-side issues is the main objective of a social protection scheme . For instance, as Bishwa Nath Tiwari points out the Rural Community Infrastructure Works (RCIW) Programme has made food available to remote locations in Nepal through a public works programme; in effect, fulfilling the dual purpose: food security and employment, but more crucially overcoming the transportation/accessibility issue\u2014a supply-side issue\u2014 through the public works programme . Having said that addressing the demand side (i .e . food security, employment, health, education, low income, including PLWH as part of the vulnerable population) appears to be the explicit aim of most social protection programmes . The UNDP Regional Crisis Prevention and Recovery Team (Sanny Jegillos, Rajesh Sharma and Radhika Behuria), Dayachund Bundhoo (UNDP Mauritius), the UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) team (Alessandra Heineman, Feisal Hussain and Jill Engen) and the UNDP Nepal Country Office (Neil Webster) all emphasized the role of monitoring and accurate data gathering for improved targeting, scaling up, and general design improvements of SP initiatives . In the case of Pakistan\u2019s Benazir Income Support Programme (Faiza Effendi and Haris Gazdar), the National Database Registration Authority\u2019s (NADRA) database has proven to be quite useful in improving targeting (of the vulnerable population), and reducing transactions costs and potential leakages . Having electronic ID cards that hold accurate and relevant information linked to a central database helps initiatives/policies to be grounded in evidence . These examples, where monitoring, assessing and targeting were part of the design of a social protection initiative, can potentially serve to help other countries, such as Timor-Leste (Alexandre Sarmento), where the conditional cash transfers were disbursed across the country without any prior feasibility study or mapping to identify vulnerable households . In fact, as Alexandre Sarmento points out in his contribution, UNDP is working with the Timor-Leste government on monitoring and evaluation (M&E), identification and the development of e-tools to achieve better human development outcomes through its current conditional cash transfer programme . If executed properly, improvements in M&E (with the use of technology) can pave the way for evidence-based policymaking, more efficient processes, and measureable results . Moreover, M&E can be geared to assess and identify both supply and demand-side challenges . 11 Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes The longevity and historical evolution of social protection programmes can often be a testament to their success: the longer the duration of a programme, the more likely it fulfilled its objectives . In a continent that is now largely democratic, governments are under no obligation to continue social schemes associated with previous governments, especially initiatives that are not so successful or for which there is little or no public appetite . The fact that Thailand\u2019s \u2018Thirty Baht\u2019 Scheme (now known as Universal Health Coverage Scheme) has become a permanent feature, having overlapped with three successive governments, reflects that it has been effective . India\u2019s MGNREGA is an act that built upon several fragmented employment schemes in various states . The knowledge, expertise and know-how were already present, it was a matter of gaining consensus by bringing together the public and political will to implement it across all states in India .

This then led to the first delivery centre for migrant women.\u201d This reflects a very careful and thoughtful approach; pilots are expanded once public sentiment is positive and the general aims of a social programme are being adequately achieved . Similarly, in the case of Bangladesh\u2019s Female Secondary/High School Stipend Project (FSSP)\u2014a project that pays tuition fees to schools and a monthly cash stipend directly to all rural girls up to class 10 if they remain unmarried, fulfils 75 percent attendance and demonstrate proficiency in achieving grades (45 percent in annual exams)\u2014Aniruddha Bonnerjee notes that the FSSP, based on the success of a pilot predecessor, was launched nationally in 1994 . Also worth noting is that some projects have led to transformative change in the lives of people . That is, a social protection initiative or project has helped people move up the income and social ladder, or to graduate, thus escaping a situation of persistent vulnerability and poverty . The Rural Employment Opportunities for Public Assets (REOPA) programme, as discussed by Richard Marshall, Majeda Haq, and Goran Jonsson (UNDP Bangladesh), is one such programme, where \u201cthe graduation concept was identified at the design phase\u2026adjusting to ground realities .\u201d REOPA also had targeted women as its primary beneficiaries, 12 \u201c[the programme] has given widowed, divorced or abandoned women, who are the sole breadwinners for their families, a chance to escape permanently from the vicious circle of poverty . The results of the project have been impressive with 96 percent of women starting their own business after graduating, and two thirds making net profits .\u201d In addition to offering employment, such programmes have additional enablers built into their design, for example REOPA offers women training related to business planning and easy access to financial services such as savings and credit . When packaged together, this bundle of services can transform lives . Furthermore, as Rathin Roy points out, a number of programmes, especially conditional/unconditional cash transfer schemes are designating women as the recipients of cash disbursements . This seems to be a step in the right direction, but in addition to \u2018empowering\u2019 women, it may reinforce the dominant cultural stereotype of women being the sole caretakers of children, for instance . More generally, cash transfer programmes including pension schemes have been useful, mainly because they can be an easy way to provide income directly to those most in need and at the same time lead to improved development outcomes (in education and health, for instance) . Historically and even now, a criticism of Official Development Assistance (ODA) is that a small fraction of disbursed ODA reaches the poor\u2014most of it is spent on overheads and other administrative costs . Direct cash payments to a targeted population limit the bureaucratic processes that tend to delay disbursement of funds and increase the risk of leakages . However, cash transfers are not immune from corruption; and reducing leakages is high on the agenda . What is noteworthy in Katharine Vincent\u2019s contribution on pension and cash transfer schemes in Southern Africa is the element of knowledge transfer and exchange between neighbouring countries\u2014pension schemes and cash transfer programmes that work in one country are being adopted in neighbouring countries after being adapted to suit the specific context . Similar to the benefits of agglomeration (of industry), it seems that once the \u2018knowledge\u2019 and \u2018know- how\u2019 of successfully carrying out pension and cash transfer schemes is available, the implementation of pilot schemes to try out similar initiatives, especially in comparable cultural contexts, becomes inevitable . However, the challenge is to fund these initiatives domestically, rather than rely mainly on external donor resources . Institutionally, a devolved system of governance favours social protection initiatives, in particular those that target specific populations and are locally focused . Government that is in closer proximity to the people is generally expected to have a better understanding of the needs, challenges and aspirations of the people and therefore, in principle, be more responsive . Even initiatives that are conceived at the central level and/or aim for universalization 13 Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes (i .e . MGNREGA in India) rely on the local/district level government and partners for implementation and feedback . As discussed by both Neera Burra and Mahendra Dev, often the relative success of the employment scheme across states in India depends on the commitment, capacity and experience of the local government .

Moreover, a greater appreciation of local context and heterogeneity is leading to a shift\u2014 more partnerships are being forged at the local level, with provincial/district level governments, local non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other partners . Moreover, Darshini Mahadevia discusses the catalytic role that local NGOs can play in changing the status quo at the local level . Her research in India found that interventions by NGOs at the local level led to greater level of tenure security for the vulnerable and otherwise marginalized population . In fragile states this can be a challenge given issues of instability and weak institutional capacity at the local level to deliver services as discussed by S.M. Sirajuddin in his contribution on the Social Safety Net Programme in Afghanistan . It is perhaps advisable to start small in such contexts with focused aims and objectives . Even small, but noticeable, changes in such contexts can go a long way . For instance, the Project for the Improvement of Household Food Security, Nutrition and Livelihoods in Afghanistan (as discussed by Sharmistha) had a budget of only $3 million and was focused on integrating nutrition and food security components into existing agricultural and livelihood programmes at the national and provincial levels . The project seems to have achieved its modest aims . Finally, the political context and existing power relations matter . As touched upon by Hussain Bux Mallah, some social protection programmes can help to positively alter existing power relations, especially in countries where land and assets are unevenly distributed . Legal provisions and changes can have a similar effect; the examples cited by Pramod Kumar and Kazuyuki Uji from Nepal and Pakistan, where the respective Supreme Court bodies have recognized the third gender . Such provisions, in principle, allow the third gender to access public services (e .g . health and education) and put such social groups on an equal footing with the rest of society . Potential abuse, marginalization and discrimination against the third gender would now be less tolerated under the law . Such protections can help towards narrowing pre-existing inequities in society . To conclude, it is important that we press on to encourage the development of social protection initiatives that have measureable development impact . 14 Thanks to all of you, we have had an engaging discussion that to a large extent helped bring out some key features associated with successful social protection programmes . implementation and programmatic challenges were detailed in the discussion . Such knowledge exchange, sharing, and consolidation should help us all gain a comprehensive understanding of social protection .

REOPA is a cash-for-work based social safety net programme that targets women, offering earth road maintenance jobs in rural areas . Participants receive training and support, and accumulate capital through a mandated savings component . Thus, REOPA provides both personal human capital and a cash fall back asset . The benefits of REOPA extend beyond the duration of the project, with a significant impact on long-term food security . Results show that upon completion of the project, 84 percent of the women have robust food security; only 1 percent is food insecure . Further, findings suggest that up to 15 months after graduation from the programme, women are living on earnings from their micro-enterprises established with savings capital, and obtaining the same high 16 food security as women currently employed by REOP . This high level of food security was achieved in spite of soaring food inflation in rural Bangladesh (~15 percent as of April 2011 .)4 What issue was the scheme attempting to address? The project targets the needs of the extreme poor, and seeks to ensure sustained graduation from poverty; it also has a strong gender dimension . Around 50 percent of ultra-poor households in Bangladesh suffer from year-round food insecurity, and another 20 percent only have adequate access to food for one to six months .5 Finding productive employment for the rural poor (and women in particular) is difficult due to their lack of skills . Only 30 percent of rural women participate in the labour force . The situation faced by women-headed households is considerably worse due to social exclusion .6 How was it successful? REOPA offered widowed, divorced or abandoned women, who are the sole breadwinners for their families, a chance to permanently escape from the vicious cycle of poverty . Regular wages from REOPA road maintenance employment over a two-year employment period enabled participants to buy enough food and secure other basic needs, including housing, medical treatment and children\u2019s education . The majority of participants invested their mandatory savings in a range of micro-enterprises after completing their employment tenure . This will ultimately contribute to the sustainable livelihoods of project participants . Through the programme, women are linked to service providers and markets, and receive training related to the businesses they plan to set up . They continue to receive assistance from REOPA\u2019s partner NGOs on how to best invest their savings .

What were the gender-differentiated impacts of the social protection scheme? Although REOPA only targets women, their families and wider communities also benefitted from the scheme . What was the time horizon? The REOPA scheme is designed to run for just over two years, with a two-year employment tenure, and initial post-graduation follow-up of self-employment livelihood activities . This scheme was implemented over four years, and graduated two classes of participants\u201424,444 women\u2013between 2008 and 2011 . Was the scheme universalized? The Government of Bangladesh is now planning to scale up REOPA to cover other districts that have a high incidence of poverty and vulnerability, drawing on lessons learned from the current project . The Government has committed $25 million for this purpose . How can gender be better taken into account in the design of social protection programmes? The first priority is to design programmes that consider and are sensitive to the specific needs and vulnerabilities of participants, their current workloads (also unpaid family care work), and the cultural systems that inhibit women\u2019s inclusion .

The local government division was the overall governmental partner . At local level, the project was implemented by Union Parishads (councils), the lowest tier of local government, with line ministry service departments involved at the sub- district level . Local partner NGOs assisted project participants and monitored at the field level . UNDP provided government capacity strengthening and exerted financial control, while also supporting effective coordination and project linkages . What were the operational implications (e.g. the design, cost, implementation, sustainability, accountability) being addressed, and what are the key strengths and limitations of the selected schemes? The graduation concept was identified at the design phase, but the detailed strategy had to be worked out as the project developed, adjusting to ground realities . It is important to set the graduation criteria at the outset of the project to give a sense of direction . It is also important to be realistic, particularly in relation to sustainability . A project with a well conceived graduation strategy will be relatively costly since the ambition is a one-off treatment to enable beneficiaries to permanently exit poverty . The REOPA cost per graduated woman is around $1,400 . However, the alternative of perpetual dependence on social protection for non-graduated recipients is even costlier . Graduated participants will also be productive and thus contribute to the national economy . The skills of the implementing local government institutions need to be strengthened, especially with regard to pro-poor and gender sensitive attitudes and organizational cultures . Critical limitations such as a lack of government human resources and accountability have to be addressed by governments beyond individual projects\u2019 immediate purview .

In India, the wage employment public works programmes have been extensively used as a tool of social protection . One of the most important programmes now in India is the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGA) introduced in 2005 . It was renamed Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act on 2 October 2009 . The objective of the act is to provide livelihood security in rural areas by granting at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every household . It applies to all the adult members of households, and it is not restricted to unemployed population . NREGA 2005 is a law whereby anyone who is willing to do unskilled manual labour at the statutory minimum wage is entitled to employment on public works within 15 days of filing their application . If employment is not provided, an unemployment allowance must be paid (part of the Right to Food Campaign 2007) . This is the first time in India that a rights-based approach for employment was introduced . This is the largest (in terms of population covered) public employment programme implemented in human history . What is the coverage and funding mechanism? The scheme is now universal in rural areas and is demand-driven . The Government of India (GoI) had implemented the act in the first phase in 200 districts of the country (February 2006) . In Phase II, an additional 130 districts were included totalling 330 districts (April 2007) . From April 2008, in Phase III, NREGA was universalized and extended to all 596 rural districts in the country . In 2009\u20132010, around 52 .6 million households were provided employment as compared to 45 .1 million households in 2008\u20132009 (www .nrega .nic .in) .

The act provides a legal guarantee of employment to anyone who is willing to do casual manual labour at the statutory minimum wage . The primary objective is employment creation . The auxiliary objective is productive assets creation . The eight categories of public works permitted under the scheme are: (1) water 20 conservation and water harvesting, (2) drought proofing, (3) irrigation of canals including micro and minor irrigation works, (4) provision of irrigation facility on lands of Scheduled Castes and Schedule Tribes8 and others, (5) renovation of traditional water bodies (e .g . tanks), (6) land development, (7) flood control and protection works, and (8) rural connectivity .9 How is MGNREGA different from earlier public works programmes? There are many distinct reasons why MGNREGA is different from earlier public works programmes: \u2022\ufffd MGNREGA provides statutory guarantee of employment; \u2022\ufffd It provides a rights-based framework for wage employment; \u2022\ufffd There is a 15-day time limit for fulfilling the legal guarantee, and unemployment allowance is given if employment is not provided; \u2022\ufffd MGNREGA has extensive in-built transparency safeguards; \u2022\ufffd The programme has a high level of coverage; and \u2022\ufffd MGNREGA aims for universality . What is the time horizon? The scheme was started in 2006, and is ongoing with no set end date . How does the scheme manage risks and/or reduce vulnerabilities? The MGNREGA deals with both absolute deprivation and vulnerability . It addresses both idiosyncratic and covariate risks . It acts as employment insurance during non-peak periods (unseasonal) and has income stabilization benefits . It provides a buffer against drought by offering an alternative source of income (e .g . 2009\u20132010 droughts) . The scheme also benefits vulnerable groups like women and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes . What is the impact on women? At least thirty-three percent of all persons employed by the scheme must be women, however, the actual share of women in the programme is higher . The rate of participation by women actually increased from 41 percent in 2006\u20132007 to 49 percent in 2009\u20132010 (www .nrega .nic .in) . 8 The Scheduled Castes (SCs), also known as the Dalit, and the Scheduled Tribes (STs) are two groups of historically disadvantaged people that are given recognition under Schedules of the Constitution of India . According to the 2001 Census, Scheduled Castes constitute 15% while Scheduled Tribes constitute 7 .5% of the population in the country . 9 Ministry of Rural Development, Department of Rural Development, The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (NREGA), Operational Guidelines, 2008, 3rd edition, Government of India . Available at http://nrega .nic .in/Nrega_guidelinesEng .pdf 21 Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes The majority of women employees collect their own wages, and through their income, are able to positively impact education, health and nutrition of women . Worksite facilities are also sensitive to the needs of women .10 What are the institutional arrangements and implementation mechanisms? The key stakeholders in the scheme are wage-seekers, Gram Sabha (village community), Panchayati Raj institutions (local councils) particularly the village Panchayat, the programme officer at the block level, district programme coordinator, state government, and Ministry of Rural Development (central government) . The main implementing bodies are the Gram Panchayats (at least 50 percent of works) . Other implementing agencies include the intermediate Panchayats, district Panchayats, and line departments (e .g . Public Works Department, Forest Department)11 What are the operational implications? Better implementation and the design of the act make it more sustainable in comparison to earlier programmes . However, the financial sustainability of the programme depends on the GoI\u2019s commitment . At present, the government is committed and guarantees work through the programme, but if general fiscal space shrinks, it could lead to issues of sustainability . In the medium term, assets created by the scheme could add to overall fiscal stability and aid in making the scheme self-sustaining . In terms of transparency and accountability, all MGNREGA related documents are made available for public scrutiny . Documents are also obtainable under the Right to Information Act .

For example, the scheme is successful in Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh due to greater accountability; there are social audits conducted and the level of political commitment is high for these types of schemes . Additionally, Rajasthan has significant experience in running drought related programmes . Additional facts Survey results from six northern Indian states (Bihar, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, M .P ., Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh) show that around 69 percent of the sample workers reported that the programme helped them to avoid hunger,13 while it helped 47 percent to cope better with illness . Around 38 percent of the workers reported that it helped in sending children to school . Most evaluations\u2014official and non-official\u2014show that implementation has been more effective than any of its predecessor schemes . Moreover, leakages have been reduced significantly over time . Best regards, S. Mahendra Dev, Director and Vice Chancellor Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research Mumbai, India Faiza Effendi, UNDP Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific, New York Dear AP-IGD Members: With average food inflation at 18 percent during the last three years, the number of poor and undernourished in Pakistan has significantly increased . While no official estimates on poverty headcount are available, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) correlation of food inflation with poverty incidence establishes a conservative estimate of 30 percent . In October 2008, the Federal Government initiated the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) with an initial budget outlay of $500 million . The programme is the largest direct cash grant scheme in Pakistan\u2019s history, targeting 3 .5 million economically distressed persons affected by poverty and inflation due to the sharp rise in international oil and food prices in 2007 . It was started as a programme in 2009 to extend cash transfers of $13 per month paid every two months to the underprivileged in pursuit of promoting a more equitable 13 Jean Dr\u00e8ze and Reetika Khera, Frontline 26, no . 1, 3-16 January, 2009, Chennai; and Right to Food Campaign, \u201cEmployment Guarantee Act: A Primer,\u201d 2007 .

It was established through ordinance as an autonomous body with organizational presence in all parts of the country, Success parameters While initial outlays under BISP were based on parliamentarians generating a list of the poor based on a minimum income threshold, in August 2010, BISP introduced the poverty scorecard methodology to efficiently identify cash grant recipients . Essentially an assessment tool, the poverty scorecard used a district wide door-to-door survey to assess poverty in households using a proxy means test to collect and compute poverty scores in real time . The main benefits of this innovation were (a) reduction in potential leakages, and (b) institutional redistribution of roles between BISP and the National Database Registration Authority (NADRA) vis-a-vis the verification of the household poverty status . The National Database Registration Authority\u2019s electronic database turned out to be an extremely efficient tool, with an automated filter system of screening applications . It more accurately identified the poor and vulnerable populations in effect reducing potential leakages .14With the use of the BISP card to extend cash grants, post offices no longer function as the point of cheque distribution for beneficiaries, thus eliminating potential corruption at these distribution centres . In addition, the scorecard offered information on the differentiated needs of the poor, which in turn led to more informed product development and greater overall effectiveness in terms of response .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be9de3ff-af4a-4bf0-a2e0-7e59e87651e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "be9de3ff-af4a-4bf0-a2e0-7e59e87651e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "acf6eaad18dcd21962facc46761b4141eeb97221b0cbb0d548e8b6d85df17784"}, "2": {"node_id": "a08f350e-33fd-4a09-8756-eb707e439ec5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8cc8eb3db1684ca6061865adf0124157b5ecd4514b7e8cc8e824b5668e6451f3"}}, "hash": "d01d03adea80529167a9d3e1b4af297815e9505ee769a0176215ffda9c550d88", "text": "The BISP card materialized through forging new partnerships with private sector commercial banks, which allowed for branchless banking (magnetic strip-card based) .

The National Database Registration Authority\u2019s database, which serves as the foundation for BISP, should link with other public and private bodies that offer social protection . Currently, several of these institutions operate as silos, and as a result social protection schemes remain fragmented . Centralizing computerized data on the poor can go a long way towards boosting efficiency and minimizing potential for corruption . 14 It actually reduced the number of eligible candidates . During 2010 only 53 .3 percent of the applicants met the poverty criterion, even though all applications had been verified by parliamentarians and union councilors . 24 Areas for Improvement Institutionally, BISP is a fairly top-heavy organization . In addition to the Board, there is a supreme governing council with the President of the country as the Chief Patron and the Prime Minister as the Executive Patron . The law is silent on the total strength of the council, their tenure and remuneration . The power of the President to appoint members introduces politicization, compounded with the board members having extensive discretionary powers and immunity from criminal liability . Furthermore, the overlapping functions between the board, council, and BISP management (federal government), notably in areas including resource mobilization, monitoring performance, and office establishment, creates parallel systems of reporting, potentially undermines board authority, and reduces accountability . While BISP has recently introduced a variety of products (credit, health insurance, flood affected assistance package, and skills development), the rationale for choosing the mix of products is not immediately clear . Furthermore, fiscal sustainability of the programme remains an issue . The BISP\u2019s challenges lie in variety of areas\u2014governance structure; coordination among its network of partners including NADRA, PPO and Private Sector Banks; accountability; security (web) in terms of its ICT-based products including the database of beneficiaries and SMART cards; and long-term operational sustainability . Conclusion Social protection schemes need to be situated within the larger landscape of development with clarity of vision in terms of graduating clients towards more productive activities . The dolling of grants without conditions, and in the absence of an exit strategy, is likely to generate undesirable dependencies . Moreover, there is the possibility of misuse by the state for patronage purposes . Furthermore, the existence of parallel and competing social protection programmes generates market distortions and renders many ongoing schemes less effective . A necessary precondition for a sound social protection programme is its ability to accurately target, and then exit once its purpose is fulfilled . This would help \u2018ring fence\u2019 the social protection scheme from other ongoing programmes . Finally, UNDP\u2019s role in strengthening the governance and administrative systems for social protection organizations can go a long way in developing coherent, responsive, accountable and transparent social protection mechanisms at the national and local levels .

Program Keluarga Harapan was designed to boost demand for education and health services among the chronically poor households by eliminating the main barrier (disposable income) . Ability of the extremely poor to access health and education is limited by the fact they do not have the minimal income to pay for such basic services . Program Keluarga Harapan beneficiaries are poor households that fulfil one of the following criteria: (a) have a pregnant or lactating mother; (b) have a child under 6 years of age; or (c) have a child of primary or junior secondary school age . In 2007, PKH was piloted in 7 out of 33 provinces in Indonesia and covered approximately 388,000 households . While other social protection programmes in Indonesia have yet to pay attention to the gender issue, PKH specifically targets women and children as beneficiaries by transferring funds directly to the intended female recipient (mothers) or related adult women (sisters or grandmothers in the absence of a mother) . Given that women are primary caregivers, it was expected that transferring money to them (as opposed to men) will more likely result in it being spent on goods and services that are beneficial to the children\u2019s wellbeing .

To ensure that the objectives of the programme are met, a facilitator is assigned to large groups of 200-300 beneficiaries; smaller groups of 25 beneficiaries are also formed . Facilitators mobilize beneficiaries and inform them of their rights and obligations, encouraging them to adopt and maintain PKH practices . While monitoring can be improved further, this allows for some degree of monitoring . In 2010, PKH extended to 20 provinces and 90 districts, and covered approximately 800,000 households with the total budget of IDR 1 .3 trillion (US$152 million) . The number of beneficiaries is expected to reach 2,034,000in 2013 . Preliminary impact evaluations on PKH show that the number of visits to health centres is increasing among the PKH treatment group, while the number of absentee students in the treatment areas is decreasing compared to the control areas (areas receiving no cash transfers)15 . Furthermore, even though there is no strict control on the use of PKH funds, most beneficiaries claimed to use transfers for daily needs such as food as well as for education and health expenses .16 While successful in several ways, the programme still faces several problems that reduce its overall effectiveness . First, while the success of the programme depends on the availability of health and education services, there are wide disparities in terms of provision and accessibility to such basic services between urban and rural areas and across provinces in Indonesia . Second, PKH is largely a demand-driven programme, and has not paid sufficient attention to supply-side issues and constraints, particularly with respect to services providers (i .e . health and education) . Third, targeting women in the family without addressing underlying gender inequality in household decision-making lessens the effectiveness of the programme .

However, due to the intersection of economic, social and cultural factors, educating girls remains a major development challenge in parts of Asia and the Pacific . Within this context, the Bangladesh Female Secondary/High School Stipend Program (FSSP) is an example of transformative social protection with direct relevance for other countries . In 1990, the education indicators in Bangladesh were amongst the worst in the region . Female literacy was 20 percent (14 percent in rural areas), and the looming gender disparity in primary enrolment rates (64 percent for girls, 74 percent for boys) spiked substantially in secondary education, with girls comprising less than 1 in 3 enrolled students and just 3 out of 10 school graduates (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, Census 1991) . These indicators17changed dramatically within a relatively short period allowing Bangladesh to achieve gender parity in school enrolment (target 4, MDG 3) well ahead of the Millennium Development Goal 2015 deadline\u2014one of the few countries in South Asia to achieve this goal .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d502157e-b8fa-4c69-a7f5-5403f69d3187": {"__data__": {"id_": "d502157e-b8fa-4c69-a7f5-5403f69d3187", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a6bbea19758983d66e88d6b8aa02ccc7bda33dbcb8263e6469b03103b634170"}, "2": {"node_id": "8586aace-e636-48fc-abd9-3e03dcaa247f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a28e33c09d8a5dd2d5459bbd0c89593ca748af2b35813c117f0216955c16b249"}}, "hash": "64a6687318c87a16dac3dd829c3512caa9e40cdf10adc0a2584e49f1599b886e", "text": "Data from the Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics (BANBEIS) indicates that female enrolment in secondary schools jumped to nearly four million by 2005 from just over one million in 1991 .

Alongside the many factors credited for these sweeping changes, such as better employment opportunities for women with secondary education (textiles, processing) and sustained public fiscal allocations for education, the FSSP is also acclaimed for its highly visible and prominent role . The FSSP is based on a successful pilot predecessor and was launched nationally in 1994 . The Government of Bangladesh (GoB), the International Development Association/World Bank, ADB, and the Norwegian Agency for International Development conjointly fund the programme . The FSSP\u2019s short-term objectives are (a) to increase female enrolment in grades 6-10, (b) to assist them in passing the senior secondary certificate examinations to qualify for employment, and (c) to retain girls in secondary school in order to delay marriage . In the long term, the programme\u2019s objectives are to expand the number of educated women participating in economic and social development, increase the social status of 17 The data for this brief are from various sources including Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Statistics, BANBEIS; Census (1991, 2001); DHS 2004 & WDI 2011 . 28 females while reducing gender gap, and create a positive impact on population growth (Khandker, Brown and Fuwa, 2003)18 . The project pays tuition-fees to schools and a monthly cash stipend directly to all rural girls up to grade 10 if they remain unmarried, fulfill 75 percent attendance and demonstrate proficiency in achieving grades (45 percent in annual exams) . More than 95 percent of the secondary schools in Bangladesh are private sector schools but receive more than four fifths of operational expenses through subsidies and payments of girls\u2019 tuitions from the Ministry of Education . These private secondary schools are overseen through community-based school management committees in charge of a wide range of affairs, including hiring and dismissal of teachers . The payment of the stipend directly to a girl\u2019s bank account is an empowering experience in a male dominated domain such as banking where a majority of account holders and officials are male . The coverage of these programmes is universal in rural areas\u2014by 2005 nearly 2 .5 million girls from rural areas were receiving secondary school stipends (BANBEIS, 2006) . Some school costs still have to be borne by households, and inevitably the poorest families are marginalized/excluded . Furthermore, the dispersion of schools and facilities is likely to be biased against poorer areas . Plans to expand coverage to these vulnerable groups and areas are being formulated . The FSSP costs about six to eight percent of the total education budget, prompting concern (mainly from donors) regarding sustainability . 19 Although there have been no studies de rigueur that isolate the impact of FSSP on outcomes from other factors, evidence suggests that some positive outcomes were transformative in many ways (Demographic and Health Survey 2004, World Bank, op cit) . A low-income country laying down a universal programme (for rural areas) was quite an accomplishment, and reflected a firm commitment towards identity and nation building through increased economic participation and empowerment of women and men, and the realization that population growth had to be curbed in order to address the unsustainable population density in Bangladesh . The involvement of multiple donor partners was essential given the scope and scale of the interventions planned . Enrolment of girls in secondary school surged and gender parity in secondary education enrolment was achieved . The 2004 DHS results show an improvement in the rural-urban gender gap in education . In tandem there was an upward drift in marriage age and increased gaps between babies (i .e . a fertility shift) (DHS, 2004), increased empowerment of girls through banking and finance and enhanced employment 18 Shahidur Khandker, Mark Pitt and Nobuhiko Fuwa, Subsidy to Promote Girls' Secondary Education: The Female Stipend Program in Bangladesh (World Bank, Brown University and International Rice Research Institute and Chiba University p .2 2003) .

To the extent that increased secondary education of girls is not matched by a focus on quality and continued access, or an increase in school- facilities and infrastructure to accommodate the surge in enrolment, stronger institutional support for girls to continue tertiary education, or assistance and encouragement to find stable employment, these are lost opportunities to empower women with a stronger sense of identity in a male dominated society . The FSSP must therefore be seen as adjunct and complementary to a wider set of equally critical supportive measures and include impact based assessments along with monitoring and evaluation of outcomes . There are also concerns about sustainability and affordability amidst a donor driven effort to move the programme to a targeted basis so that the most deserving can get the requisite attention . Targeting not only stigmatizes recipients, it is extremely costly to implement . More importantly, the definition of affordability must be driven by social consensus and not a prescriptive financial formula . The GoB is planning to extend this programme to include boys, and find innovative ways to draw in girls and boys from the most disadvantaged families . All the best, Aniruddha Bonnerjee, Independent Consultant Social protection, Child Poverty, Pensions and Social Policy Former World Bank Economist Fatma Gul Unal, UNDP Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific Dear AP-IGD Members: In China, socio-economic problems of the rural poor are a challenge . This is largely due to neglect of this population and sector during periods of urban- biased growth, which began with de-collectivization and strengthened in the late 1990s . Socio-economic problems are also seen in the urban areas resulting 20 Impact of 3F Crises on Women and Children of South Asia, Koehler and Bonnerjee, 2009 . 30 from the rapid rural-urban migration . Consequently, both rural and urban populations are exposed to new vulnerabilities as a by-product of the Chinese economic growth model . Social protection initiatives can address these separate but related challenges . The subject of this discussion is on two different initiatives that target select populations (a) residents in rural areas and second and (b) for rural migrants who reside in urban areas . Caring for One Billion: Assessing the New Social Protection Programmes in Rural China (Zhang et al . 2011)21: This recent report on China focuses on a particular social insurance initiative, namely, the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) in rural China, which started in 2003 and covers 100 percent of all villages in the country . The New Cooperative Medical Scheme aims to protect rural low-income households from falling into poverty . Catastrophic illnesses, as the report mentions, are a leading cause of pushing rural households into poverty . This research paper, which utilizes data from 2004 and 2007, seeks to evaluate the NCMS in terms of the difference it has made in the lives of the rural poor, a group representing more than 35 million in 200922 (State Council Information Office, 2010) . The study claims that despite a very high participation rate by the poor, NCMS has made a limited difference for the poor due to the limited availability of funds for the programme . Based on survey results, the reimbursement rate was less than half, sometimes less than one third of the promised amount . What is more striking, the higher the health spending (or the seriousness of the illness as measured by the price) by the household, the lesser the reimbursement ratio . Overall, the programme managed to cover only 15 percent of the reimbursement demand . The programme is fostering and creating a positive sentiment among the rural population towards the government . Majority of the rural poor felt like the government has been paying more attention to them than previously . Other programme outcomes include an increase in participation among the poor for seeking medical help during illness and an increase in gross income of the health clinics that offer the NCMS programme . Despite fiscal challenges, the programme is a promising safety net for the poor, especially those that are pushed into poverty due to the inability to afford medical treatment . 21 Zhang et al ., Caring for One Billion: Assessing the New Social Protection Programmes in China (Centre for Social Protection Research Report, January 2011) .

China is a case in point, which not only points to the importance of equal access to maternal care, but also provides a good example for inclusive health policies . China\u2019s experienced economic transition and fast economic growth that was unequally distributed, with a concentration in urban areas . This growth bias towards urban areas resulted in more than 150 million migrants moving from rural to urban areas . Most of the migrants work without legal documentation as informal workers, construction workers, garbage collectors, and small workshops employees .24 Health care services were influenced by the emphasis on privatization during the economic transition in China, shifting income generation in this sector from public resources to private fees . This has led to underutilization of health services by the poor, including migrant workers .25 Several studies found that maternal health outcomes for the migrant population are significantly worse when compared to residents . This is because migrant women do not seek medical help, or if they do, it is usually from illegal providers .26 In response, the government is registering migrant deliveries . This was first initiated in Shanghai in 1994, and then in expanded to other districts . Based on data collected and research, reasons for low health access rates for migrant women were (a) economic, due to high user fees and lack of medical insurance; and (b) cultural, as migrant women felt discriminated by staff in the public health centres . Based on these findings, policy guidance and recommendations were given to the government . . The first policy on fee control and service quality assurance for migrant women was passed in 1999 in Shanghai . This then led to the first delivery centre for migrant women in the form of a pilot project in Minhang district in 2004, and to nine more districts around the same time, and 13 more in 2007 (WHO, 2011) . These centres are considered to have produced positive 23 WHO, Social Determinants Approaches to Public Health: From Concept to Practice, 2011 available at http://www .who .int/sdhconference/background/news/ socialdeterminantsapproachestopublichealth/en/index .html 24 Ibid . 25 Ibid . 26 Gao X ., \u201cAnalysis of 24 Maternal Deaths in Migrants in Shanghai,\u201d Journal of Preventive Medicine 6 (1994): 22\u201323; and Jiang H . and Liu Z ., \u201cStudy on Maternal and Child Death of Migrants in Shenzhen in 5 years,\u201d Public Health in China 13 (1997): 550\u2013551; and Zhang et al ., Caring for One Billion: Assessing the New Social Protection Programmes in China (Centre for Social Protection Research Report, January 2011) . 32 results for migrant women in terms of providing improved access to maternal care .

Over the five-year lifetime of the United Kingdom Department for International Development and AusAID-funded Regional Hunger and Vulnerability Programme (RHVP) (http://www .wahenga .net), the number and extent of cash transfer schemes in southern Africa has increased dramatically . While old age pension schemes in the middle-income countries (South Africa, Namibia and Mauritius) have a longer history, the growing evidence of the role of cash transfers in reducing vulnerability to food insecurity and poverty has prompted the introduction of pilots and programmes in other neighbouring countries . It is also worth noting that in contrast to other regions, countries in southern Africa are very active in introducing unconditional cash transfers . Lesotho\u2019s Old Age Pension scheme is domestically financed and began in 2004, against the advice of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) . The IMF was primarily concerned with Lesotho\u2019s fiscal position and whether it could afford the U$21 million (first year) cost of running the pension scheme . To maintain affordability, the government set the age of eligibility relatively high at 70 years old . However, given this the government managed to increase the amount of monthly transfer . The success of the scheme was instrumental in the country choosing to introduce a cash transfer programme targeted towards vulnerable children, which began in 2010 (funded by the European Union with technical support from UNICEF) . Although the schemes are not technically linked, evidence of positive economic impact, and the success of categorical targeting 34 from the pension scheme, provided the political motivation to expand social transfers to a new vulnerable category\u2014in this case, children . Swaziland, another small developing country in southern Africa, followed suit, introducing its pension scheme in 2005 . An impact evaluation carried out by RHVP in late 2009 found that in addition to reducing vulnerability to hunger and food security, receipt of the Old Age Grant allowed beneficiaries to access better healthcare and purchase basic personal goods including clothes and shoes . It also helped elevate their social status in society (Orr et al ., 2010) . Grant benefits extend beyond the recipient to other household members, thereby furthering the programme\u2019s reach . For example, in Swaziland, despite pension being an unconditional transfer, many elderly grandparents used it to pay school fees of their grandchildren, particularly HIV/AIDS orphans .28 While Lesotho and Swaziland\u2019s old age pensions were universal among the elderly, another southern African country introduced a truly universal pilot programme . Namibia\u2019s Basic Income Grant (BIG) was officially a two-year pilot, from January 2008 to December 2009, in the settlement of Otjivero-Omitara, 100km to the east of Windhoek . Under the project, a universal cash transfer of N$100 ($14 USD) per month was provided to 930 individuals under the age of 60 (at which age they become eligible for the state pension) . Delivery of cash was done electronically through deposit into smartcard-based bank accounts opened for beneficiaries with the state post office, NamPost Other pilot schemes in southern Africa have employed alternative targeting schemes, and many are now in the process of being scaled up . In Malawi, the Social Cash Transfer Scheme (SCTS), financed by UNICEF, was based on a system of poverty-targeting, transferring cash to the poorest 10 percent of households that were also labour-constrained . After a successful pilot in Mchinji district, it is now in the process of being scaled up . Across the border in Zambia, five cash transfer pilots ran in Kalomo, Monze and Kazungula districts in the Southern Province, and Chipata and Katete in the Eastern Province . As in Malawi, the Zambia Social Cash Transfer Scheme is poverty-targeted, aimed at the ultra- poor, and the Chipata scheme also pays a bonus for every child enrolled in school .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea74c265-a50b-4e5f-864e-2feda5da14eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea74c265-a50b-4e5f-864e-2feda5da14eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "174297e321199803c8c3374dfc3e84a2c8c88c5aa347f685db057cae8d978d95"}, "2": {"node_id": "496a3d91-9945-4a78-946d-f33bb47e1cbe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39ac52379e26c2346eb2550c9a467cbde51e04e847f6f5543fdccc87a302ba7c"}}, "hash": "ee212d9f3445c9f90d244dab31cd59736a0852c6dc3f4d7d8a7b8b1e01e06245", "text": "Following the successful pilot, the scheme is being scaled up, with plans to use an electronic delivery system for transfers .

Best regards, Katharine Vincent Regional Hunger and Vulnerability Programme (RHVP) Bishwa Nath Tiwari, Human Development Report Unit, UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Dear AP-IGD Member: Public work programmes are frequently employed as social protection measures to meet the dual challenge of addressing the short-term need for smoothing consumption29, and the long-term aim of asset creation . I would like to discuss the Rural Community Infrastructure Works (RCIW) programme, one of the most popular targeted programmes in Nepal, implemented by the Government of Nepal since 1996 . Background In 2009, more than 3 .5 million people suffered from hunger in Nepal .30 In general, physical connectivity is a major barrier to food security, especially given the mountainous terrain of the area . A quarter of the population in Nepal still live in remote and hilly areas, and it can take anywhere between four hours and 13 days to access the nearest road .31 The Rural Community Infrastructure Works programme makes food available to remote locations through implementation of various projects including road construction, pond rehabilitation and land reclamation . Furthermore, the social mobilization approach adopted in the implementation of the programme has helped to build the capacity of poor and vulnerable . Over the years, the purpose of the programme has changed from a short-term focus on food availability to a long-term emphasis on ensuring food security through asset building . The RCIW programme played an important role in reducing vulnerabilities . It provided food to 50,000 households by distributing 13,000 metric tonnes of rice 29 Consumption smoothing is the economic concept used to express the desire of people for having a stable path of consumption . 30 WFP, Nepal Operations Summary (Rome: 2010) . 31 Road construction in Nepal: A Way out of Poverty: International Award for SDC Road Project in Nepal. Available at http://www .sdc .admin .ch/en/Home/Projects/Road_ construction_in_Nepal_a_way_out_of_poverty 36 annually, and it expanded the rural road network within the targeted areas . More than 700 km of paved roads were constructed under the programme, which benefited an estimated population of 360,000\u2014these additional persons now have relatively easier access to transportation (a 2 .5-hour walk from their homes) .32 This also facilitated access to markets, health centres, schools, and other basic services, thus reducing overall vulnerability of the rural and remote populations . The RCIW programme undertook measures to build capacity at all levels . It included individuals and local institutions and the private and public sector to ensure that development activities would continue on their own . Institutional arrangements Various stakeholders, including national and local governments and various development agencies, jointly implemented RCIW . The Government of Nepal led the programme at national level through the Ministry of Local Development, in collaboration with the World Food Programme (WFP), which helped to provide food for workers and fund food transportation and tools . Furthermore, KfW (German Financial Cooperation) offered financial support for building infrastructure, while GIZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit) and DFID funded technical assistance . At the local level, the district development committees and district project support unit supported implementation, while user and self-help groups were responsible for implementing the various projects/activities . The RCIW programme employed social mobilisation and empowerment activities as part of its implementation . The project emphasized interaction with the targeted communities . Based on the social mobilisation approach, the field staff assisted villagers to form self-help groups to implement Food for Work projects, followed by complementary activities (saving/credit provision, income generation initiatives, and awareness raising through Participatory Learning Centres) . Key strengths The programme is self-targeting as it is generally the poor who can work as unskilled labour; it has a decentralized, transparent, and flexible approach to programme planning and implementation .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30639033-1caa-4c24-a545-37581b9e41d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "30639033-1caa-4c24-a545-37581b9e41d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "326c8d5ef10c4ce0ff1281ef33a8db7ac91893e29c9ca28b70d5301440aae37b"}, "2": {"node_id": "ee803870-d97b-4533-b694-3e4e85f1732c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c9b1b8b67471e43289524891603fff1b7c8309f0773c0dcf64f843ff6eb53b36"}}, "hash": "3fc72ad6c58f7c291cc75627a35a6ecee55cdb21ae0c4d4f7b566e4faf305501", "text": "Moreover, the programme adopted a social audit mechanism within communities to minimize the misuse of food 32 Government of Nepal, WFP, DFID and GTZ, Rural Construction Infrastructure Works: A Decade of RCIW, (Kathmandu: 1996\u20132007) . 37 Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes grains .

Rathin Roy Director UNDP International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth (IPC-IG) Brasilia, Brazil Dear Rathin: Responses to your questions are provided below . (1) What was the rationale provided to use cash transfers as a means to promote \u2018equitable distribution of wealth\u2019? The period up to 2008 saw a number of efforts being made to define the parameters of social protection in Pakistan . The most important among these was a review undertaken by a task force on social protection, working with the Planning Commission, which was mandated to draft a social protection strategy for the country . The task force completed its work in 2006, and the Policy Commission published a report in June 2007 . The National Social Protection Strategy (NSPS) 2007 reported on studies of existing cash transfer programmes; it found serious gaps in targeting mechanisms as well as flaws in design and implementation . It recommended that cash transfer programmes be consolidated into a unique social protection database from which beneficiaries should be selected . The NSPS 2007 further recommended a transition to conditional cash transfers and the use of methods such as proxy means test-based surveys and geographical and community-based targeting for beneficiary identification . The political and economic turmoil in Pakistan from around 2007 onwards, which culminated in the election of a new government in 2008 and the ending of direct military rule, proved to be a powerful catalyst for change . Soon after assuming office, the federal government announced the launch of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), and in its very first budget, presented to parliament barely 10 weeks after government formation, an amount of 34 billion rupees was allocated for BISP . At around the same time, the Punjab Government 39 Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes announced its Food Support Programme, a subsidized bread scheme, with a total outlay of 22 billion rupees . There was an element of political competition between the federal and the Punjab provincial governments in the launching of these programmes . Although nominally in alliance, the parties leading the two governments\u2014Pakistan Peoples Party at federal level and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz in the Punjab province\u2014also eyed each other as rivals . Whatever the immediate political motivations, it was clear that something quite dramatic was underway . The NSPS 2007 recommendations of raising fiscal allocations to social assistance programmes to 36 billion over the course of five years seemed meek compared with the bold increase in the first year . It is difficult to ascertain whether BISP was a response", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6902681-66b0-4602-8d19-dbf6838d8d00": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6902681-66b0-4602-8d19-dbf6838d8d00", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2dda3591bf68f3ca4c008a52647e55ecf835c89193aec0c5237197f52a7d3af1"}}, "hash": "2dda3591bf68f3ca4c008a52647e55ecf835c89193aec0c5237197f52a7d3af1", "text": "to the NSPS recommendations for effective targeting to promote equity, or whether the consultant who had contributed to the NSPS (who later became the special advisor to the Prime Minister) was responsible for BISP\u2019s design for promoting equitable distribution of wealth, but the fact that BISP identified women as primary beneficiaries, made it go beyond any other social protection intervention in Pakistan . (2) What proportion of total government current (revenue) expenditure roughly would be US$500 million? The federal budget for 2008-2009 was to the tune of Rs2300 billion . Funds allocated to BISP for the fiscal year 2008-09 were Rs34 billion, which made BISP allocation 1 .4 percent of the total budget . The current budget is normally around 80 percent of the total budget, so BISP would approximately be allocated funds equivalent to 2 percent of the 2008 current budget . The Rs 500 million that was spent is way below the actual allocation . (3) Was this all federal spending or was there a provincial and/or local government component? BISP is an initiative of the Federal Government and is entirely financed from the federal budget . (4) In your neighbouring country, India, introduction and use of the BPL card was a disaster. In some states of India, there are more cards than the poverty headcount. Do you have information on how the BISP card rollout is working in practice? Is there anywhere I can get more info on NADRA and the methodology used to ascertain the reduction in potential leakages? The receipt of the BISP card is contingent upon the conduct of the poverty survey . As at May 2011 23 out of the 120 districts of Pakistan had completed the survey . One of the key reasons for this slow pace of implementation is the heightened security risk in certain geographical regions that hampers conducting this survey . 40 For information on the methodology used to minimize leakages you may wish to contact Iftikhar Malik (mmalik@worldbank .org) Social Protection Specialist at the World Bank, supporting NADRA in the design and roll out of the poverty scorecard . With regards, Faiza Effendi Programme Specialist UNDP Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific New York Professor Darshini Mahadevia, Faculty of Planning and Public Policy and Member-Secretary, the Centre for Urban Equity, CEPT University, India Dear AP-IGD Members: I would like to discuss the Role of Tenure Security as Social Protection in Urban Areas of Southern Asia . Tenure Security is the starting point of social protection in the urban areas in Southern Asia . We carried out this research study under the programme \u2018Social Protection in Asia\u2019, managed by the Institute of Development Studies, Sussex and Institute of Human Development, New Delhi . The study\u2019s hypothesis was: tenure security has a positive relationship with living conditions, human development, economic status and access to entitlements . In other words, higher the levels of tenure security better are the living conditions, human development achievements, economic status and access to entitlements . The findings of this research study are equally relevant for the cities of other South Asian countries . The research locales were Ahmedabad and Surat in the state of Gujarat . In Ahmedabad, two locales were selected, one Vasna, which is a middle- income locale and another Amraiwadi, which is an industrial locale . Tenure security is a continuum of different levels of rights with regard to land (such as right to occupy, use, develop, inherit and transfer land) . Land tenure therefore is bundle of rights . In India, in general, and in the case study locales in particular, at the time of the research, there was no programme to grant tenure security to the residents of slums and squatter settlements, except in a few states, namely Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Orissa . Legal land rights have been given in these four states through what are called \u2018patta legislation\u2019, or \u2018land rights legislation\u2019, under which the slum dwellers living on lands belonging to the state and local government have been given lease rights for a period . Following the lease rights, the households have begun to invest in house renewal and personal level basic services . This research argued that once 41 Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes such tenure rights are given then there is positive spill over in terms of employment, human development achievements, and access to entitlements . In situations where the legal rights are not given, the urban poor, in general, made their own arrangements to access tenure security and they move from informal to quasi-legal (de", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3963645-bcdf-4938-9182-3b21dadca778": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3963645-bcdf-4938-9182-3b21dadca778", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d30931891f9c11786f65415e4d1ee58d98d90e838ab5aadb1b0d1c82c0e39530"}}, "hash": "d30931891f9c11786f65415e4d1ee58d98d90e838ab5aadb1b0d1c82c0e39530", "text": "facto) tenure through various processes . In Ahmedabad and Surat, the case study locales, the local government has extended de facto rights for 10 years, to be extendable to 20 years . One aim of the study was to observe the impact of such rights on social protection . In other words, the research was based on hypothesis that even such de facto rights, as in case of Ahmedabad and Surat, which the author calls strong de facto tenure, improve social protection . The study locales had three different socio-economic, institutional, and policy contexts . In the case of Vasna locale, where NGOs intervened in four of the six slums studied, high de facto tenure security was created because the NGOs were placed on board of the local government to grant the concerned slum 10 years of tenure security . They also managed to convince the local government to invest in basic services such as water supply, sewerage and drainage lines, and paved roads . The two NGOs engaged with slum development are Mahila Housing Trust (MHT) of SEWA and SAATH . The study finds that the positive spill over of such an intervention by an an external organization (NGO in this case) led to improvements in housing and basic services and had a positive impact on incomes and savings when compared to slums that lacked external intervention . In Amraiwadi, which is an industrial suburb of Ahmedabad, we could not find any significant intervention by NGOs, except in one slum where MHT was involved in organising women for upgrading the slum . In this ward, slums of longer duration had achieved de facto tenure security because they were on private lands and not public lands . Ironically, when slums are on public lands in 42 iStock Ahmedabad, they are more prone to evictions because land is required for some public purpose and slum development does not rank high on the list of priorities of the local government . Lastly, in Surat, we could not find any external agency intervention in slums . Instead, the local government proactively extended basic services in all city slums, irrespective of their tenure situation . As a result, the living conditions improved . We could not find any differences in economic conditions, human development and entitlements across different slums selected . The case of Surat also shows that local state intervention in extending basic services is the most inclusive way of improving the living conditions and also reflected the possibility of transformational or promotional form of social protection . In other words, social protection in urban slums can be taken care of through the (primary) development agenda of a city . This would also lead to local governments investing in basic services . The positive gender spill over of such development is not only improvements in living conditions, but women being relieved of menial duties including fetching water and an increase in women workforce participation . An increase in household incomes, an increase in children going to school, and an improvement in health on account of basic services were also observed . Shelter security also leads to people better able to face periods of unemployment and engage in home-based work . Moreover, shelter security gives poor households an address, which is an identity, and through that they can claim various entitlements and benefits including a ration card and shelter subsidies . Conversely, research also shows that evictions, without some form of tenure security, lead to loss of assets and savings, loss of employment, and low retention rates in terms of schooling . Generally, it is assumed that employment will lead to income and then to secure tenure . However, in our analysis, we do not find income explaining either the tenure variables or other outcome variables . On the other hand, tenure variables listed in Table 1 below explained the outcome variables such as living conditions, economic status and social development . The tenure variables are supply side issues and matters of policy . The local government can (1) encourage external intervention (i .e .

UNDP\u2019s Regional Crisis Prevention and Recovery team (Asia and the Pacific) having contributed to the Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction (GAR 2011 available at www .preventionweb .net\\gar) would like to share some insights from this report . Our team has supported the establishment and implementation of disaster loss databases in seven countries in Asia . The GAR 2011 provides recommendations on where government policies and programmes should focus to achieve disaster risk reduction . While the role of social protection instruments may not seem immediately obvious in reducing risks to disasters, they can be quite effectively employed towards disaster risk management . The GAR 2011 points out that social protection schemes can be useful before, during, and after a disaster . For instance, social protection schemes help provide safeguards to offset and reduce the potential impact of a disaster . Better housing construction in an earthquake prone area, for instance, can greatly reduce the negative impact . Social protection initiatives can also be effective in a post-disaster scenario, for 44 example, as an effective means to disburse funds through cash-for-work programmes . Hence, social protection schemes can be beneficial both in terms of mitigation and also during the recovery phase post-disaster . The GAR 2011 includes several useful examples from countries, both within and outside our region, that demonstrate the value of social protection instruments as tools for disaster risk management . We would like to share a specific example that highlights our work in Indonesia . The initiative, an online monitoring system, was developed through a partnership between the Government of Indonesia, UNDP Indonesia Country Office and the UNDP Regional Crisis Prevention and Recovery team . Background The National Planning Agency of Indonesia (BAPPENAS) embarked on a National Programme for Community Empowerment (PNPM Mandiri) which provided a framework for poverty reduction and community empowerment programmes across the country . The core programmes (focused on underdeveloped and vulnerable regions, rural infrastructure, social economic infrastructure, urban and rural areas, etc .) under PNPM Mandiri had overlapping activities resulting in inefficient use of resources . While there was information available on each of the programmes, there was no coherent and standardized data gathering and analysis mechanism to assess and monitor progress, and identify the gaps and constraints to the programmes . In response, and to fill this gap, UNDP developed an integrated Management Information System (MIS), which serves as a consolidated source of information from all programmes . The main purpose of establishing an integrated MIS was to support monitoring and tracking of all programmes, resources and beneficiaries spread across the country and to avoid duplication of activities and resources . Essentially making the programmes more efficient and effective . As UNDP had previously supported the establishment of an online disaster loss database called DIBI (Data and Informasi Bencana Indonesia) at the National Disaster Management Agency, the same methodology was adapted to suit the requirements of an integrated MIS for PNPM Mandiri . Application of the online monitoring system in Indonesia The integrated MIS for the PNPM Mandiri was launched in August 2009 and is known as SIMPADU (http://simpadu-pnpm .bappenas .go .id) . The online MIS allows for better monitoring of a range of indicators across 12 sectors (including transport, health, social sectors) for the community empowerment programmes at PNPM Mandiri . The establishment of a monitoring system made it possible for the government to track the number of programmes, beneficiaries, disbursement of funds, as well as to monitor progress against available baseline data and 45 Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes indicators at various levels (district, province, and national) . It is also possible to track the progress down to the village level . Beneficiaries are disaggregated as well (poor, male and female, for example)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84cb4d42-d34c-483d-9f66-22c8c51e813e": {"__data__": {"id_": "84cb4d42-d34c-483d-9f66-22c8c51e813e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "130fe17152fa4b48f84fa2dedf08ed78bc20c06c48cd193a48f5adc51d6bedbc"}}, "hash": "130fe17152fa4b48f84fa2dedf08ed78bc20c06c48cd193a48f5adc51d6bedbc", "text": ". Based on the establishment of the MIS, the government is now in a better position with regard to gap and lag identification related to programming . It is also more informed in terms of addressing the challenges . More complete information leads to better targeting of vulnerable groups and sub-populations . Building on the success of this online monitoring system, the Government of Indonesia has decided to extend the integrated MIS programme to cover all the programmes, and initiate improved monitoring and collection of data from districts . The government has already sought UNDP\u2019s support to continue further development and enhancement of the integrated management information system (MIS) during Phase II (2010-2014) . Benefits and replication Since both DIBI and SIMPADU use the same methodology and provide information across space and time in an aggregated and disaggregated manner, it has been possible to link the two databases, making it possible to carry out an online analysis of both poverty and disasters simultaneously . This is enabling the government to establish clearer linkages at the macro and micro levels between poverty incidence and disaster (and the impact of the latter on the former) . It is also helping to streamline both poverty and disaster risk reduction programmes . The establishment of the monitoring database is resulting in more informed decision-making, as policies and programme interventions are strongly grounded in evidence gathered . This methodology can easily be replicated in countries for monitoring and tracking a several parameters (over a period of time) for a given geographical area . Additionally, the methodology allows for disaggregation, which enables more in depth analysis and monitoring . Based on our experience in Indonesia, it is possible to have a functional database with trained staff in a short period of time provided data is available .

A country, which had among the lowest fiscal allocations for social protection programmes in the region, trebled its allocations real terms . A scheme of targeted cash transfers of unprecedented scale was put in place . While in 2007-2008 federal government cash transfers of US$154 million represented 0 .4 per cent of total government spending, in 2009-2010 it had risen to US$474 million or 1 .3 per cent . Providing a monthly cash payment of US$12 to selected beneficiaries, the scheme reached 2 .75 million families, or just under seven per cent of the total population by 2009-2010 . Early experience already provides some quick lessons Strategic timing can help establish political will . The increased allocation was a direct outcome of a change of regime, as an incoming elected government made political investment in a targeted cash transfer scheme known as the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) . The incoming government was responding to the food price crisis of 2007-2008, but was also driven by its election promises of expanding social protection . Strategic targeting can build visibility and widen support from below . This is the first programme in Pakistan whose primary beneficiaries are poor women\u2014men only qualify if there are no eligible adult women in a family, which otherwise falls within the poverty-related programme criteria . A list of filters was developed with the cooperation of National Database Registration Agency (NADRA) to identify potential beneficiaries through proxy means such as education, age, and reported occupation . While a statistical audit and impact evaluation of BISP beneficiaries is pending, rapid assessments in five villages in Punjab and Sindh suggest that the programme does have a visible presence among the poor on ground, in contrast with previous cash transfers of smaller scale . Upscaling can reveal infrastructure gaps in social policy systems . The increase in fiscal allocations exposed the major gaps in Pakistan\u2019s social policy infrastructure . 35 Haris Gazdar, \u201cSocial Protection in Pakistan: In the Midst of a Paradigm Shift?\u201d Economic & Political Weekly xlvi, no . 28 (July 9, 2011): 59-66 .

Exclusive reliance on NADRA was abandoned with a realization that as many as a quarter of eligible adults, mostly women, did not possess NADRA cards, entirely excluding the likely eligible participants from the database . An alternative measure, which was eventually used, was to refer to elected representatives to carry out the initial identification of potential beneficiaries . These beneficiaries were to be identified by parliamentarians in their respective constituencies and verified by NADRA . The difference from the earlier proposal was that now a person could be recommended for BISP by a parliamentarian without a NADRA identity card, and could gain NADRA registration as part of her BISP application . Reports suggest that there was a big rise in NADRA applications as a result of the BISP, particularly among poor women in relatively under-developed rural areas . In response to concerns about the obvious political hazards in parliamentarian- based targeting, an agreement was reached with the World Bank to carry out a poverty scorecard census across the country, and to revise beneficiary lists accordingly . The census is now complete in most districts, and there is evidence of a changeover to new beneficiary lists . Sustaining depends upon key local factors. It is premature yet to predict if the BISP will evolve into a full-blown social protection institution with multiple dimensions including exit programmes, emergency relief, and health insurance . There are indications of this direction being taken . The fiscal sustainability of such a move is dependent on, among other things, to a switch away from untargeted subsidies (mostly for urban consumers), which in 2009-2010 accounted for $2 .8 billion, or nearly six times the allocation for BISP . The sustainability will also be influenced by the degree and level of political investment by the present government . If pressure from below is maintained throughout, along with visibility, credible selection of targeted beneficiaries, and fair and well- understood exit criteria, social protection may become immune to political change . Whether Pakistan has undergone a paradigm shift on social protection, which endures political change, will require observing fiscal commitment to targeted options in place of untargeted subsidies . There are design issues as well that will signal a transition to a more inclusive social protection system . The BISP is one of the first programmes in Pakistan that is based on targeting from a well-defined universe . Its linkage with the NADRA system and the incentives that the programme itself provides for the registration of poor and marginalized women 48 can have long-lasting implications for social policy . Untargeted consumer subsidies from fiscal resources fail to establish a durable relationship between individual citizens and the state . Best regards, Haris Gazdar Collective for Social Science Research Karachi, Pakistan Pramod Kumar and Kazuyuki Uji, HIV, Health and Development Team, UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Dear AP-IGD Members: As the ongoing discussion in this forum continues to bring forth the strategic importance of social protection in reducing vulnerability of people to socio- economic risks and impoverishment; on behalf of the HIV, Health and Development Team at the UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre (APRC); I would like to bring to your attention the issue of HIV-sensitive social protection . HIV-sensitive social protection denotes integration of HIV, wherever necessary, into the existing social protection schemes . The increasing currency that the issue has gained recently is borne out by the fact that enhancing social protection for people affected by HIV was identified as a key priority by the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS36 in its Outcome Framework37 for achieving results at the country level . There is widespread acknowledgement in the region that HIV- sensitive social protection is a pre-requisite to strengthen impact mitigation, service delivery, and human rights . Socio-economic impact studies by UNDP in different Asia Pacific countries38 and a regional analysis39 clearly show that people living with HIV and their households, including those who suffered AIDS-deaths, are chronically burdened by illnesses, 36 UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, is an innovative partnership that leads and inspires the world in achieving universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support .

They are also affected by food insecurity, psychological stress and related morbidity, discrimination, social exclusion and impoverishment that are often irreversible . The impact is even more severe on women, and it exacerbates the disproportional household burden on them . The studies also show that HIV impacts every aspect of life of affected people\u2014 from quality of life and health to education\u2014and often, it has inter-generational consequences . For instance, the high rates of school drops-outs, particularly of girls, and irreversible coping mechanisms such as liquidation of assets, could push even future generations of affected households into poverty and vulnerability . A major recommendation of these multi-country studies for strategic impact mitigation is appropriate HIV-sensitive social protection . Despite the socio-economic vulnerabilities, the attention to strategically integrate HIV into appropriate social protection schemes is very limited in the region . The recent financial crisis and the constant food and fuel price inflation add a more complex dimension to the situation . Already burdened by the severe socio-economic impact of HIV, the affected people are among the most vulnerable to external shocks . A case study of several households impacted by the 2008 global financial crisis in Surat, India40 demonstrated the vulnerability of people living with HIV and their families to external shocks and the need for social protection to prevent them from falling into irreversible poverty . Available examples in the region and elsewhere show that social protection has significant AIDS mitigation impact . For example, cash transfer programmes piloted in countries with high HIV prevalence have a significant impact on poverty reduction in households affected by HIV and AIDS,41 while supporting livelihoods, enabling access to education and improving nutrition .42 The UNICEF State of Evidence43 notes that social protection, mainly through instruments such as social transfers, livelihoods, social health protection, legislation, policies and regulation, can promote universal access outcomes on HIV prevention, treatment, care & support . 40 UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, \"HIV and the Economic Crisis: Impressions from Surat, India\" (unpublished, prepared for internal circulation and discussion, 2009) . 41 UNICEF, ESARO, 2007, quoted in Ann Nolan, Irish Aid, Social Protection in the Context of HIV and AIDS, Promoting Pro-Poor Growth; Social Protection, (OECD, 2009) . 42 Ag\u0171ero et al., 2007, quoted in Ann Nolan, Irish Aid, Social Protection in the Context of HIV and AIDS, Promoting Pro-Poor Growth; Social Protection, (OECD, 2009) . 43 Dr .

According to the division of labour45 among UNAIDS cosponsors, UNDP is mandated to contribute to the efforts on HIV-sensitive social protection . In this context, UNDP, in partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO), UNICEF and the Asia Pacific Network of People Living with HIV, organized a high-level technical consultation on HIV-sensitive social protection for impact mitigation in Asia and the Pacific in Siem Reap, Cambodia in April 2011 . The consultation brought together senior government officials from eight countries (Cambodia, China, Nepal, India, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, and Viet Nam), UN agencies, civil society leaders and the community of people living with HIV, was unanimous that HIV-sensitive social protection should be a key strategy for the reduction of vulnerability of people to HIV as well as for impact mitigation . The Consultation also led to five key principles of HIV-sensitive social protection: 1 . Aim for HIV-sensitive social protection than HIV-specific social protection;46 2 .

Apart from ART, UHCS covers HIV prevention services: e .g . methadone maintenance therapy for people who inject drugs;49 HIV counselling and testing twice a year; PPTCT services (prevention of parent-to-child transmission of HIV); and ART for documented labour migrants . As HIV has been integrated in the mainstream social protection scheme, Thailand has one of the highest proportions, or 80 to 90 percent,50 of domestic funding sources for AIDS interventions among developing countries in Asia . The average of AIDS spending from domestic resources is 53 percent in low- and middle- income countries of Asia and the Pacific, where ART programmes are almost completely funded by donor resources except for a few countries . 51 This high donor dependence for ART poses serious sustainability risks and life- threatening concerns for people living with HIV, who must continue ART without interruption for a lifetime to stay healthy and productive . Therefore, the integration of ART into the free universal healthcare scheme in Thailand has brought sustainability, scale-up feasibility, and long-term security for people living with HIV as well as the ability of governments to address HIV over the long term . Free ART also reduces the overall socio-economic burden of PLHIV (people living with HIV) and their households . In Cambodia, where ART coverage is 94 percent, the household health expenditure is found to be lower than non-affected households .52 ,53 In May 2011, a breakthrough scientific finding from a large- scale clinical trial54 demonstrated the effectiveness of early initiated-ART in significantly reducing (a 96 percent reduction) the risk of HIV transmission to uninfected partners, which reiterates its social protection value .

In most of the pension schemes in different states of India, AIDS-widows do not qualify to benefit because of the high age ceiling . AIDS-widows tend to be much younger . The government in Rajasthan waived the age limit allowing access to all AIDS-widows, irrespective of their ag In the state of Orissa, people living with HIV have been included in a pension scheme that was originally established for the elderly, widows and persons living with disability . In this scheme, all PLHIV regardless of age, sex, and income and marital status are eligible, making it accessible by those from marginalized communities such as sex workers, men who have sex with men and transgender persons .

Many social protection schemes are designed for below poverty line households, excluding HIV- affected households without the below poverty line status . The conditional below poverty line status therefore allows HIV-affected households to access a few select schemes meant for below poverty level households such as food subsidies . One challenge unique to HIV is the issue of confidentiality . To access social protection schemes with special provisions for PLHIV, they are required to reveal their HIV status . Under circumstances where HIV is still highly stigmatized, public disclosure of HIV status could result in serious repercussions including physical violence, loss of job and forced relocation . Some attempts have been made to protect HIV confidentiality such as routing the registration process through HIV-related places (e .g . HIV counseling and testing centres) and removing HIV from entitlement cards . However, this issue still appears not sufficiently addressed, which could discourage many people living with and affected by HIV from availing schemes for fear of social sanctions . Legal responses as transformative HIV-sensitive social protection for the vulnerable The aggregate national HIV prevalence is low (far below 1 percent of the adult population) in almost all the countries in Asia and the Pacific . However, HIV prevalence is almost always much higher among people who are stigmatized, marginalized, and discriminated against for their behaviour, including sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender people and people who inject drugs . 53 Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes Evidence indicates, for example, that men who have sex with men in Asia face a nearly 20-fold likelihood of HIV infection as compared with the general population .56 The high HIV vulnerability of men who have sex with men corresponds to low levels of HIV service coverage in the region that reaches only 9 to 20 percent of MSM,57,58while corresponding figures for sex workers and people who inject drugs are also low, or 17 percent and 14 percent, respectively .59 One of the pivotal factors contributing to the high HIV vulnerability of these key populations is punitive legal environment and associated human rights violations:60 same-sex relations are criminalized in 19 out of 38 countries (50 percent) in Asia and the Pacific . Twenty-nine countries (76 percent) criminalize some aspects of sex work, while death penalty for drug-related offenders is found in 11 countries (29 percent) .61 Even in countries without such criminalizing laws, people from the key population often face harassment, violence, discrimination and other human rights violations . Fear of prosecution, stigma and rights violations under these punitive environments drives the key populations underground, discouraging them from accessing HIV services, and making them highly vulnerable to HIV . With continuous strong advocacy from civil society, some countries in the region are making progressive legal responses . For example, the Supreme Court of Nepal in 2007 ordered the government to amend all discriminatory laws against sexual minorities and to include the third gender category in relevant 56 S .

The protracted conflict in Afghanistan has taken a toll on livelihoods, especially livelihoods of people living in rural areas . This has exacerbated food insecurity as reflected by the high rates of malnutrition, particularly among women and children . About one third of the Afghan population is food insecure, more than half of the children suffer from chronic malnutrition and about three quarters of the population suffer from micro-nutrient deficiencies . In Afghanistan, the Social Protection Project sought to address issues of hunger and undernutrition with a particular focus on children and women . The Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock implemented this project in collaboration with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and with support from the Government of Germany . Due to the potential overlap in terms of beneficiaries (in rural areas), the project was coordinated across different sectors, including health, agriculture, and enterprise development . This cross- sectoral approach helped to achieve greater coherent overall, especially in terms of delivery . Key objectives of the project \u2022\ufffd Enhance food security by focusing on accessibility, availability and diversity of food (activities coordinated by the agriculture and health sectors) . \u2022\ufffd Support household food production, including home gardening, citrus production, livestock and food diversification to ensure access to diverse foods all year round . Institutional arrangements With the budget of approximately US$3 million, the project focused on integrating nutrition and food security components into existing agricultural and livelihoods programmes at the national and provincial levels (in Bamyan, Herat, Nangarhar and Badakhshan) .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15d6be58-5131-49e0-b6ec-4bd02fabac13": {"__data__": {"id_": "15d6be58-5131-49e0-b6ec-4bd02fabac13", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1cffac575ec115473e3e81aef239920f1a0c3c5120846bf0e3d562ebded11d4e"}, "2": {"node_id": "dbbb345b-40d7-464a-97e6-dfa160c299df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf0d6081ac677b698445b23533dc1866ce73eba6cf27ecaa769ddc50b5269256"}}, "hash": "d2fec2f1c7d2e5adec6574a803e0bfe41744434dfde8037d5aa991c91a5d21db", "text": "The Ministries of Public Health, Agriculture Irrigation and Livestock, Rehabilitation and Rural Development and Women\u2019s Affairs, and international development agencies (UNICEF, FAO, WFP, WHO), academics and civil society are all partners in this project .

Furthermore, the project also produced and disseminated training materials on nutrition and agro-processing activities among the target groups . These efforts were complemented by trainings for women and rural youth groups on a wide range of issues, including sustainable livelihoods, project management, concepts and approaches to empowering women and achieving gender equality . After the trainings, community-based food processing activities were introduced to the target groups . The project provided women with practical training in applying skills so as to help them secure employment or an income . The project was designed to primarily target women at central, provincial and community levels; and to address their basic household needs, and concurrently build the capacity of the Ministries of Public Health, Agriculture Irrigation and Livestock to address these needs in the long run . The project has in small measure helped the targeted beneficiaries by providing beneficiaries with some basic knowledge (e .g . food processing activities) and skills . In addition, the rural youth were given the necessary trainings to set up and manage agri-business enterprise . Over the course of project cycle, the nutritional intake of targeted households improved . Gender was an integral part of the project implementation . The following factors were part of the design of the project: \u2022\ufffd Most of the work was implemented by female project staff working closely with the women of the targeted communities; \u2022\ufffd Training materials and timings were sensitized to women needs; 57 Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes \u2022\ufffd Community-based activities were designed to support women groups and increase their economic opportunities; and \u2022\ufffd Gender awareness workshops were organised for both men and women in the areas covered by the project . Key strengths of the project \u2022\ufffd Access was allowed to government and public facilities during the course of the project . This enabled the project to cover a major part of the targeted provinces at a minimum cost . \u2022\ufffd The presence of qualified national staff, especially women, strengthened the quality of training programmes for at the grassroots level . \u2022\ufffd The synergy and collaboration among partners helped identify potential implementation bottlenecks as well as good practices emerging from the project . Key challenges \u2022\ufffd Security issues limited mobility and frequency of local exchanges in the field . \u2022\ufffd Movement restrictions also hampered monitoring of the project activities . \u2022\ufffd Cultural and religious norms proved to be key obstacles in terms of women participation in some of the training programmes . These factors also proved to be hurdles for women keen to set up their own business and/or income- generating activities . \u2022\ufffd There was limited access to land for diverse cultivation limited the supply of food for diversified consumption . \u2022\ufffd There was limited access to protein-rich food, such as milk and dairy products due to inadequate production and the relatively high price of these items . Lessons learned Successful components of the project have been integrated into other initiatives of the Ministries of Public Health, Agriculture Irrigation and Livestock for purposes of replication in other provinces . In addition, some NGOs were trained to implement similar interventions in different parts of the country .

Sirajuddin, Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled, Government of Afghanistan Dear Colleagues: Social safety net programmes are designed with the aim of providing support to vulnerable sections of society . Social safety nets play both a redistributive and a productive role in terms of managing risks . In this context, I would like to share a brief overview of the ongoing social safety net programme, which is a part of the Pension Administration and Social Safety Net project initiated in Afghanistan . Background The latest 2007-2008 National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment survey of Afghanistan estimated that the overall poverty headcount rate for Afghanistan was 36 percent of the total population suggesting that around nine million Afghans were unable to meet their basic needs . The data also showed that the incidence of poverty is unevenly distributed .

This process was initiated through the IDA-funded Pension Administration and Safety Net Project in the form of a pilot with a funding of US$ 1 .8 million . Pilot safety net programme in Afghanistan The objectives of the pilot programme are to (a) design a unified and effective platform of benefit delivery, (b) define and test such mechanism of benefit delivery, and (c) draw lessons from the pilot and develop a strategy and recommendations for establishing a permanent safety net scheme in Afghanistan in the form of a national programme . The key features of the pilot are (1) combination of geographic and community- based targeting; the targeted population are ultra-poor rural families with children, the disabled, widows, the elderly, and orphans; (2) coverage of three districts (Ab Kamari, Chahr Asyab and Shahari Buzurg) from three provinces 69 ICON-INSTITUTE, National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment 2007/8: A Profile of Afghanistan (Jehoon Printing Press Kabul: Afghanistan) .

The ultra-poor families with children (aged 0-14 years), the disabled, the elderly (aged 65 years and older), widows, and orphans are given priority for the benefit disbursement . The benefit under this pilot scheme is in the form of an unconditional cash transfer . The benefit amount is distributed by late autumn (November) to overcome difficulties in obtaining the food during the winter period . The benefit would also be distributed in spring (March) to support food consumption of poor families during the most difficult period of year (end of winter and first harvest season) . Safety net operational mechanism The main pilot provinces selected by the MoLSAMD were three provincial districts in Badakshan, Badgis and Kabul . Community development councils (CDCs) are implementing the pilot by (a) undertaking awareness campaigns, (b) preparing a shortlist of eligible families through a survey approach with a fixed inclusion and exclusion criterion, (c) ranking the eligibility of families based on the collected data, and (d) producing the final list of the selected beneficiaries . In this process, CDCs worked with the local NGOs, also known as facilitation partners\u2019 (FPs) to conduct a survey for eligible beneficiaries . They also worked together in the final auditing process and evaluation . MoLSAMD/Directorate of Social Affairs and Directorates of Ministry in provinces were responsible for overall supervision, management, and monitoring . As part of the selection process, the potential beneficiaries were given an opportunity to express their grievances, which were taken into account while compiling the final list of selected beneficiaries . The cash transfers were made through local banks . Facilitation partners and community development councils collected payments through local bank accounts and distributed it to the selected families . Facilitation partners monitored the process and provided transportation to collect cash from banks . The Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled designed a framework to implement the evaluation of the pilot . The outcome of the evaluation will be used for scaling up the programme in Afghanistan . The experience from Farza district in Kabul revealed that the implementation mechanism, enrolment forms, operational manual, and training worked fairly well . Moreover, an evaluation of 60 the operational process indicated that 47 percent of the total eligible beneficiaries were female-headed households . These beneficiaries indicated that their families benefited from the pilot programme . More detailed evaluation from the other pilots in the three provinces is underway . Potential risks Apart from the relatively low capacity of MoLSAMD/DoLSAMD and CDCs, there are several other risks that might affect the implementation of this pilot .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "464fdbac-189f-4487-a846-3b51117a8639": {"__data__": {"id_": "464fdbac-189f-4487-a846-3b51117a8639", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ced33067d8915abea763a49b4dc213c48257f6c325f73445e39746a8149822e"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b2a91b1-a118-4d5c-9d44-e94beea0e17c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d506cdae59be2e8319531ca0a0d43fffd6350d84329d429a16cd4eb4156c2acc"}}, "hash": "8354da040cbe153062ee4982489670660684145ab06d3fccefa0dc2fbdd43702", "text": "These include (1) worsening of security, (2) social instability that might arise from complaints from the non-piloted provinces/districts, (3) lack of transparency and failure to prevent leakages in benefit distribution, and (4) potential delays in benefit distribution due to slow procedures within the National Budgeting process .

Timor-Leste\u2019s constitution section 65, article 1 states that every citizen is entitled to social assistance and security in accordance with the law; article 2 of the same section states, \u201cthe State shall promote, in accordance with its national resources, the establishment of a social security system .\u201d In line with the constitution, The Ministry of Social Solidarity of the Fourth Constitutional Government in Timor- Leste (formerly Ministry of Labour and Social Reinsertion), at the beginning of its mandate in 2007 designed three main social protection programmes, namely: \u2022\ufffd Universalized pension programme ($30 monthly) to senior citizens (60 years and above), who have lived in the country for at least one year, regardless of their other incomes and economic status . \u2022\ufffd Universalized Pension Programme ($30 monthly) to disabled persons of 18 years of age and above, who have lived in the country for at least one year and whose disability impedes their ability to perform any productive labour activity . \u2022\ufffd Conditional cash transfers to widows, single mothers and mothers whose husbands are either disabled or are suffering from chronic illnesses . The transfer ($5 /person/month for eight months per year for primary school 61 Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes and $10/person/month for eight months per year for secondary school) is conditional upon these mothers (beneficiaries) (a) sending their children to school, and (b) taking the children to health centres for vaccination and immunization . The programme is intended to cover all vulnerable populations, however, a quota was established per sub-districts due to shortage of funds . UNDP Timor-Leste is currently working with the Ministry to improve this programme in the following areas: 1 . Monitoring and Evaluation: To assess the impact the programme is making on poverty, and how the programme can better respond to the necessities of families that do not benefit from economic growth and the opportunities it present 2 . Identification: Identify beneficiaries to avoid inclusion and exclusion errors and to ensure that vulnerable families receive cash payments based on a set of criteria . 3 . e-tools: The introduction of a web-application database system to better monitor the implementation of the programme . The system will also be able to cross-check beneficiaries of the programme with other existing government porgrammes to avoid double payments, and also to ensure equitable distribution of beneficiaries across the sectors and geographical territories . Conditional cash transfer programme The Ministry of Social Solidarity recruited social animators for each of Timor- Leste\u2019s 65 sub-districts . These social animators work together with local authorities to identify vulnerable families . There is a quota set up, based on level of education, for every sub-district . These animators fill in the application forms for these families and get them certified by the local authorities . These forms are reviewed and sent to the Ministry . The Ministry then reviews the application, carries out a final selection process, issues the final list of beneficiaries, and publicizes the list to each sub-district for verification for any complaints prior to disbursing payments . 62 iStock Due to the lack of adequate banking infrastructure, payment is made at sub- district office . The mothers/custodian of the students present their identity cards to claim the payment . The database of beneficiaries is a very basic and will require a cross-checking function in order to avoid double counting . In response to this issue, UNDP is currently providing the following technical assistance to improve the overall design of the programme . Developing a database of beneficiaries that allows for cross-checking of information on families benefiting from other schemes (to eliminate duplication of payments); \u2022\ufffd Developing participatory methods for improved targeting, especially of women; \u2022\ufffd Putting a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system in place; \u2022\ufffd Supporting the drafting of a legal framework for social protection schemes; and \u2022\ufffd Improving the implementation of existing conditional cash transfers through innovative means of cash payment, coordinated delivery of social services (health and education), and simple, but reliable means of identity verification . Furthermore, one likely change in the future design of conditional cash transfers is that benefits will no longer be provided to individual students within the family but to the vulnerable family itself . Unfortunately, there have been no prior feasibility studies to map vulnerable households . The total number of beneficiaries was determined by fiscal contract, which was as a consequence of this lack of analysis . Nonetheless, given Timor- Leste\u2019s recent past, these programmes were a direct and quick response to the urgent need", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8c3359a-64c8-429d-91ec-0c62f55db888": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8c3359a-64c8-429d-91ec-0c62f55db888", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c884d288c64c14194c8b14337522ffa8ddb8135e3356d0c4e42802f1875686c6"}}, "hash": "c884d288c64c14194c8b14337522ffa8ddb8135e3356d0c4e42802f1875686c6", "text": "of the population at large . The conditional cash transfers were both political and pragmatic in the Timorese context since delay associated with start-up was minimized . Given the post conflict context, and the fact the country is very young, institutional mechanisms are still in their infancy, and addressing the socio- economic needs of the people has been an immense challenge . It is an exercise in rebuilding communities and in overcoming political divisions and grievances due to years of occupation and conflict . To its credit, the government is attempting to address the weaknesses of these social protection programmes based on the lessons learned from the field (i .e . from other countries that have had some degree of success in implementing similar programmes) . A solution to address some of the bottlenecks in Timor-Leste\u2019s social protection scheme is to strengthen M&E based on evidence gathered on the ground . One way to strengthen this would be to provide continued investment in the capacity development of the social animators who are regularly interacting with people 63 Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes in their own communities . These animators need to have necessary skills and tools to collect accurate data (which would also need to be updated regularly) . With regard to the sustainability of the programmes, currently there is an effort to improve the design the programmes\u2019 legal framework through a decree law for social protection so that rights can be duly protected and guaranteed . Since their first implementation, the three social protection programmes in Timor- Leste have been fully funded by the government\u2019s annual budget . Donor support (such as from UNDP) is intended only to provide technical assistance in certain areas (e .g . M&E and staff training) . The decree law for social protection, when approved, will ensure the continued allocation of the state budget (note that 95 percent of state budget for 2011 was from petroleum royalties and remaining five percent of the annual budget was from internal tax revenue) to support these programmes . Finally, the conditional cash transfer programme is currently linked to human capital investments\u2014it enables children from poor households to access education and health services . It is recommended that in addition, cash transfers should be linked to income generating activities of beneficiaries . The Ministry of Social Solidarity, in partnership with local NGOs, helps to develop the business skills of beneficiaries so that they are more likely to pursue productive activities with the transfers they receive . This potentially can help accelerate overall development and poverty reduction by raising incomes . Regards, Alexandre R.B. Sarmento, Adviser to National Development Agency Office of the Prime Minister Timor-Leste Hussain Bux Mallah, Collective for Social Science Research, Karachi, Pakistan Dear all, My contribution is on Housing Security in the context of Pakistan . In many developing countries, access to housing is governed by formal and informal institutions, laws, customs and urban planning practices . Residential security needs to be analysed in the context of these various factors, not only as an issue of ownership . It becomes important, therefore, to view marginalization and discrimination in relation to prevailing institutions, structural inequalities, and the existing power relations within society . 64 In Pakistan, access to housing in rural areas is linked to the ownership of agricultural land, which is extremely unequally distributed . In addition, the village-based record of land rights and archaic systems of land ownership are powerful instruments to perpetuate marginalization . The housing security schemes in rural areas help to address some issues of marginalization under the current institutional arrangements of land administration . Although these schemes have been rarely discussed as part of the ongoing debates on social protection, for example, they have been more effective than conventional land reforms . It is worth pointing out that there has been strong resistance to institutional and structural changes necessary for the marginalized to gain access to housing mainly due to the fact that it also requires fundamental changes in existing power relations in society . Furthermore, the cultural class and caste system also helps maintain the existing inherently unequal social structure, which is especially visible in rural Pakistan . The poor and vulnerable are usually at the bottom of the class-caste hierarchy and susceptible to bonded labour . More attention is required from the government and non-governmental organizations to address such issues of social inequality . One of the most significant and positive developments in this regard has been a public housing scheme for the poor that targeted towards the most vulnerable segments in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69429c28-8c42-46b4-b2a2-dc9571d54250": {"__data__": {"id_": "69429c28-8c42-46b4-b2a2-dc9571d54250", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "443581a980da9b4983cda6f33ec6aa3513260d9d6990d56cba7ee6710669895d"}}, "hash": "443581a980da9b4983cda6f33ec6aa3513260d9d6990d56cba7ee6710669895d", "text": "the class-caste hierarchy .70 The regularization programme to improve the living condition by upgrading establishing physical infrastructure including roads and drainage, along with provision of basic services (including access to water and sanitation) can be viewed as a low-cost method of transferring assets to the poor . The rural regularization schemes can help to support the marginalized groups . Nonetheless, increasing trends toward fragmentation71 in rural settlements has been a major challenge to the provision of services and public infrastructure, particularly in areas where landownership is highly unequal . Therefore, regularization programmes and schemes have largely failed to reach scattered settlements the rural areas . In contrast, the regularization schemes in urban areas have effectively addressed the issue of housing security for the poor, because irregular settlements are largely held by the marginalized and vulnerable . The schemes tend to have relatively low inclusion errors . Nevertheless, other marginalized groups such as 70 For more information about this scheme, please refer to Haris Gazdar and Hussain Bux Mallah, Class, Caste and Housing in Rural Punjab: The Untold Story of the Marla Schemes, CPR Research Report 12, January 2011 . 71 It is widely thought that fragmentation in rural settlements has been used a strategy to leverage autonomy against landlords . 65 Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes migrants are usually excluded due to their temporary or non-existent resident status and/or the non-portability of their entitlements .72 The design of social protection interventions need to pay attention to broader institutional arrangements and the political and cultural context in which the scheme is being implemented . Defining the role and responsibilities of governance institutions is critical for the long-term success of social protection schemes, particularly in a kinship or class-based society . Regards, Hussain Bux Mallah, Research Officer Collective for Social Science Research Karachi, Pakistan Neera Burra, Independent Consultant Dear All: In August 2005, the Indian Parliament passed the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), which provides for 100 days of guaranteed employment to one member of every rural household . NREGA was implemented first in 200 of the poorest districts and now covers all rural districts . NREGA has successfully placed an enforceable obligation on the state . Under the provisions of the Act, state governments must provide unskilled, manual work within 15 days of a person submitting an application, within a radius of 5 km from the applicant\u2019s residence . Workers are entitled to a statutory minimum wages for their labour, to be paid within seven days after the work is completed . Men and women are to be paid equal wages . This Act is based on the principle of self-selection by focusing on unskilled, manual work . The NREGA has to work in tandem with another very important legislation, the Right to Information Act, 2005 . NREGA, unlike other employment programmes, has made employment a right . Panchayati Raj Institutions or institutions of local self-governance in rural areas have a major role to play in identifying works to be undertaken and also to help poor households to obtain job cards and work . It is their responsibility to ensure that wages are paid on time . Unlike other schemes, the NREGA budget has no upper limit or ceiling . Expenditure is dependent on demand for work . Sixty-seven percent of the total 72 See, UNESCAP, Social Protection in Asian Cities: Regional Trends, Issues and Practices in Urban Poverty Reduction, 2009 . 66 expenditure has been on wages, and the balance on material and other costs .73 NREGA wages had a major impact on wage rates in rural areas . Interestingly, the lobby of landlords was able to prevail upon the Government of India to reduce NREGA wages . In January 2009, the Ministry of Rural Development de-linked NREGA wages from minimum wages . Activists strongly opposed this as it was seen as an attempt to undermine the earning capacity of the rural workforce . It was pointed out that even in states where NREGA was not working well, rural labourers had been able to bargain for higher wages with other employers . People were able to assert their right to work for decent wages .74 While there are strong provisions for transparency and accountability at all levels\u2014for instance, wages are to be paid in the presence of the community on pre-specified dates, relevant documents are to be made available for public scrutiny (right to information act), and regular social audits of all works are to be conducted\u2014corruption, leakages of funds, delayed and non-payment of full wages to workers are the key challenges faced", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad84cc04-46a2-48d5-a4ba-f1ff6e755cf1": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad84cc04-46a2-48d5-a4ba-f1ff6e755cf1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ae13d4bbd53e08f34ace4d0fa6326924d5478204e738035a230f0323fc116f0"}, "3": {"node_id": "ce6961b5-bdbd-4483-9ca1-ed6fbf708927", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a132433859f721658aed0465cd07f2daf808405f3d00502af72136f159dea4a"}}, "hash": "d37f9132d3a014364df4faa45e5a68325fac08aacaaedf872523647367eaeba9", "text": ". Furthermore, NREGA has been beset with problems of lack of administrative preparedness to handle such a vast programme . Several reports have pointed to the accountability gap; corruption has been an issue in many parts of the country .75 However, where the conditions were more conducive to the scheme\u2019s implementation, the impact was positively strong . It has reduced distress migration, and increased incomes for the poor and marginalized, particularly women .76 It is the responsibility of the district authorities to register any household that seeks employment (given that its members are unemployed) and issue them job cards . The names and photographs of every household member are to be on this job card, and this card is to be kept by the household . However, in practice 73 There were major concerns among some economists in India that NREGA expenditure would destroy the economy . However, other pro-NREGA economists showed that the cost of NREGA would rise at the most from 0 .5 percent of India\u2019s GDP in 2005-2006 to one percent of GDP in 2008-2009 . It was also pointed out that India could afford NREGA by raising taxes, which were among the lowest in the world at that time . Six years later, the government of India has not been bankrupted by NREGA expenditures . Some state governments, like that of Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh, have built durable assets in the form of roads . The model is self-sustaining, provided state governments use the funds to build sustainable infrastructure .

In 2008-2009, over 45 million households were provided work, and the scheme provided 2,163 million person days of employment . Since NREGA pays minimum wages,77 rural wage rates have gone up significantly across the country . The focus of the public works undertaken has been regeneration and conservation of natural resources . Of the public works undertaken in 2008-2009, 46 percent were water conservation related, 18 percent were to do with improving rural connectivity, 15 percent aimed towards land development, and about 20 percent towards improving irrigation on smaller sized farms (typically owned by the poorer households) . Most of the work has been unskilled earth work . There are mixed assessments of the infrastructure developed under NREGA . Tamil Nadu was one state where the state government decided to use NREGA as a means of improving public infrastructure (roads and digging of ponds) . Other government development funds were dovetailed to ensure that the infrastructure was durable .78 In some areas, this led to improvement in water availability for agriculture .79 This claim is however contested by researchers . In several states, monsoon rains washed away some of the work . Of all those who received work, 48 percent were women . Assessments show that women were paid equal wages and personally retained the income received .80 However, lack of child-care facilities made it difficult for women with small children to work . Older women and the differently abled have also not been able to avail of this social protection scheme because it usually requires hard, manual labour .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce6961b5-bdbd-4483-9ca1-ed6fbf708927": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce6961b5-bdbd-4483-9ca1-ed6fbf708927", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ae13d4bbd53e08f34ace4d0fa6326924d5478204e738035a230f0323fc116f0"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad84cc04-46a2-48d5-a4ba-f1ff6e755cf1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d37f9132d3a014364df4faa45e5a68325fac08aacaaedf872523647367eaeba9"}}, "hash": "7a132433859f721658aed0465cd07f2daf808405f3d00502af72136f159dea4a", "text": "In fact, many of the social safety and security provisions of the Act, including first aid kits, shade facility, etc ., are not being implemented .

Available at http://www .thehindu .com/ 68 schemes . A system of social audits to monitor implementation was developed, and these audits are potentially powerful tools to reduce corruption . One key weakness of NREGA is that it requires extensive report writing at several levels, which has proved to be difficult given the lack of staff capacity . Also, there is a shortage of trained engineers who can measure the work done and certify its quality . PRIs have not played the role they were supposed to under the Act as many of them do not necessarily support pro-poor development, and perhaps more importantly, they lack essential capacity . Civil society organizations have not played as pro-active role as was expected . Perhaps, more meaningful cooperation and partnerships with them would allow for a greater sense of ownership . Without massive organization of workers and general social mobilization of communities around key issues, it is unlikely that the gap between what the Act intends to do, and what it actually accomplishes in practice will be overcome . Finally, while there are demands that NREGA be extended to urban areas from some civil society organizations, government of India has not indicated its intentions to do so as yet . Regards, Neera Burra Independent Consultant Alessandra Heineman, Feisal Hussain, Jill Engen and Neil Webster UNCDF and UNDP Nepal Dear All: We would like to share our experiences in formulating the Human Development and Social Protection Pilot in Nepal and some of the key lessons emerging from this engagement thus far . What are the key features of successful social protection schemes? The Human Development and Social Protection Pilot (HDSP) in Nepal is an initiative within the framework of the Local Governance and Community Development Programme (LGCDP) . LGCDP is a national programme led and implemented by the Ministry of Local Development (MLD), with support from six UN agencies and seven development partners . Primary financial support to this pilot is provided by UNCDF, with additional support from the World Bank . The HDSP aims to strengthen the capacity and role of local governments in delivering social protection in the form of cash transfers designed to improve access to basic services . 69 Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes The HDSP will provide an education grant to children in poor households to better facilitate and encourage school attendance, targeting primary and lower secondary school . The first cash transfers will be made in 2012 . The design of the pilot is innovative in a number of ways: \u2022\ufffd The HDSP seeks to link up the supply- and demand-side service delivery by taking local governments as its entry point . While cash transfers tend to work on the demand side of service delivery, either by making cash payments conditional upon the use of public services or by providing households with income supplements that improve their ability to access services, UNCDF\u2019s technical assistance and block grants to local governments will also help to fix supply side bottlenecks . At the same time, HDSP builds upon the LGCDP focus on linking citizens to local government through Ward Citizen Forums, Citizen Awareness Centres and Social Mobilizers, all of which can enhance the demand side . This is an area that UNDP is actively supporting . \u2022\ufffd By linking up supply and demand, essential feedback loops will be created that strengthen social accountability . The HDSP includes grievance and redress mechanisms, which will provide for a channel of communication between the recipients and the government institutions responsible for the transfer, helping for the early identification of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ea0ddcb-f161-4b80-bb71-1e82edd56e0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ea0ddcb-f161-4b80-bb71-1e82edd56e0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b96bfcbcd89f5778738ba0e9a843b6c8144f1033be1ccae7048ca1e945915e69"}}, "hash": "b96bfcbcd89f5778738ba0e9a843b6c8144f1033be1ccae7048ca1e945915e69", "text": "problems, and minimizing inclusion and exclusion errors, as well as ensuring overall transparency and accountability . \u2022\ufffd The HDSP will also make a significant contribution to the development of MLD\u2019s collection and management of data . Household registration in the two pilot districts will build upon and expand the current Vital Events Registration work at the lowest level of government . The database will not only enable household targeting for the pilot, but provide a database for the local government to further development . \u2022\ufffd The pilot aims to reduce the transaction costs of payments for the state and for people receiving payments and eliminates leakages by electronically transferring payments, through financial service providers, directly from central government in to bank accounts held by recipients . \u2022\ufffd It will also promote the financial inclusion of poor households by offering deposit accounts in which payments are made by the financial service providers; this will open up a window to a full spectrum of financial services offered by banks, including credit, credit-life insurance, remittances and other payment services, and cash-out withdrawal service through the branch and correspondence networks, and financial advice . \u2022\ufffd Finally, the HDSP is the first social protection project in Nepal to include poverty targeting . This runs counter to the present practice in Nepal of working with categorical targeting or universal targeting . Targeting will be based upon the Multi-Dimensional Poverty Index . 70 What are the key issue/s the scheme was attempting to address? This HDSP pilot seeks to enhance the effectiveness of the Government of Nepal\u2019s education cash transfers specifically, and the efficiency of the many other Government social protection payments that pass through local governments, (old age pensions, disability grants, child grants, widow\u2019s grants, etc) . The education grant is intended for children from poor households eligible to attend primary and lower secondary schools . The specific objectives of the pilot follow: Strengthen the management and decision-making capacity of local governments related to the cash transfers; 1 . Reinforce the linkages between local government and education (as a devolved sector); 2 . Set up accountability mechanisms for citizens; 3 . Build systems for delivery of cash transfers that are more effective and efficient, ensure financial inclusion to the recipients; 4 . Develop and strengthen a data collection and management information system that can benefit both local and national government; and 5 . Generate practical lessons and evidence to feed into the overall policy debate on future social policy options for Nepal . What are the institutional arrangements (between sectors, national and local levels, public sector institutions and other institutions)? The Human Development and Social Protection Pilot main institutional focus is to enhance the linkages between the education sector and local level governments, who are at the frontline of service provision . Another important institutional link established by the pilot is between the government and private sector financial service providers . The key points include: \u2022\ufffd Local government (Village Development Committees and District Development Committees) will manage the data collection and updating, the identification of beneficiaries and the control of that process in addition to the grievance procedures . This will ensure that data collection and complaint mechanisms are as close to the beneficiaries as possible . \u2022\ufffd The schools and the school management committees will monitor attendance . \u2022\ufffd The Ministry of Local Development will collect and approve the beneficiary list and pass this to the private payment service provider . \u2022\ufffd The private payment service provider will make the payments into a savings facility that can be accessed through a variety of means \u2013 we envisage a combination of bank ATMs, mobile telephones and point of sales devices . \u2022\ufffd The MLD will monitor and assess the pilot with support from the World Bank . 71 Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes What is the time horizon and operational implications (design, cost, implementation, accountability)? The initial timeframe for the project is two years . The first cash transfers will be made in late spring 2012 . The total cost is $5 million, which will is estimated to provide trimestral grants of approximately $6 to 24,000 school-age children in two districts in Nepal . Is it feasible to universalize and sustain the scheme/s? \u2022\ufffd The HDSP is a pilot and is therefore designed to test certain innovations in approach to social protection and the making of cash transfers in Nepal . Some of these system modalities can be scaled up to the national level without significant additional funding .

Local LGCDP social mobilizers will control for mitigating circumstances for non- attendance . There is an emerging interest on the part of the government in introducing some element of conditionality on several types of cash transfers, but there is also some opposition amongst some development agencies that oppose any form of conditional cash transfer, mainly on principle . This pilot is in line with UNCDF\u2019s approach to Social Protection, which is focused on a holistic system of interventions . While taking the citizen as the point of departure in designing this approach, it also connects various interventions and strategies to enable the public and private sector to deliver social protection through both social and financial services to the poor and vulnerable . Capitalizing on our investment mandate, the UNCDF approach to social protection is anchored around a cash transfer to poor and vulnerable citizens and builds other elements around it that maximize the positive externalities of the cash transfer: governance and policy interventions, coordination between demand and supply of services and financial inclusion . 72 Best regards, Alessandra Heineman, Programme Officer, Local Development, UNCDF; Feisal Hussain, Regional Technical Adviser, Inclusive Finance, UNCDF; Jill Engen, Deputy Head of Office and Regional Technical Adviser, Local Development, UNCDF; and Neil Webster, Policy Advisor, UNDP Nepal Dayachund Bundhoo, UNDP Mauritius Dear All: I would like to discuss the salient features of the Social Registry of Mauritius (SRM) Purpose and objectives The social welfare system in Mauritius is complex and costly to manage . There is a multitude of programmes, which spread across several ministries and institutions, the main one being the Ministry of Social Security, National Solidarity, and Senior Citizens Welfare and Reform Institutions (MSS) . The eligibility threshold differs across programmes, and its definition is heavily based on ad hoc welfare assessments to identify the beneficiary . Moreover, the existing databases do not contain all relevant information for poverty targeting and do not cover the poor who are not eligible for social programmes . The SRM initiative was introduced to modernize public resources management and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government spending . It was designed to become an exhaustive and centralized database of social programme beneficiaries with the following objectives: \u2022\ufffd Better target beneficiaries of social programmes; \u2022\ufffd Manage social programmes in an integrated way; \u2022\ufffd Better harmonize the criteria for the different social programmes run by different ministries; and \u2022\ufffd Analyse cyclical and structural poverty reduction policies . The main aim of the SRM project is to improve the targeting efficiency of social programmes so that maximum programme resources reach the poor (i .e . minimizing leakage to non-poor) and that the poor are not excluded (i .e . minimizing under-coverage of the poor) . Current status The SRM project was launched in 2008, and the first phase, which concerns the development of tools necessary for its implementation, is complete . The major tasks accomplished include: 73 Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes \u2022\ufffd Estimation of a General Poverty Line and a General Poverty Profile for Mauritius . Results are based on data from the Living Conditions Survey and the Household Budget Survey . \u2022\ufffd Production of targeting statistics for the current main social protection scheme in Mauritius (known as the Social Aid) . These statistics provide performance indicators of the current Social Aid and also help identify areas of improvement . \u2022\ufffd Development of proxy means tests . These tests will form the basis for benefit allocation rules, and include a formula to identify eligible applications and to calculate allocations for these eligible beneficiaries", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d595a232-752d-4c8e-ac5a-b1c82dd350d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "d595a232-752d-4c8e-ac5a-b1c82dd350d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e87899683f4f27f9947482a19d0a21d1142306698afa4794347f63b587fde878"}}, "hash": "e87899683f4f27f9947482a19d0a21d1142306698afa4794347f63b587fde878", "text": ". Proxy mean tests would be improved by including some additional questions in the next Household Budget Survey (these additional questions refer to key variables on living conditions that would potentially improve targeting) . \u2022\ufffd Design of the SRM Questionnaire that would be used to collect data on the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of poor households, and on their living conditions . \u2022\ufffd Development of the SRM software system to register and assess applications for social benefits . \u2022\ufffd On-the-job capacity building of staff of MSS on the use of the SRM software, and on the use of STATA software to produce relevant statistical analysis for more informed and evidence based policy decisions . Key features of the SRM 1 . Eligibility assessment mechanism: proxy means testing The assessment mechanism that will be used to target eligible beneficiaries is the proxy means testing . The proxy means testing is particularly useful in countries where the informal labour market is large (like in Mauritius) \u2013 which implies that incomes are not easily quantifiable and verifiable . Proxy mean testing is generally based on predictions of income from demographic, socio- economic and living conditions variables . 2 . The steps involved: The targeting process will involve the following basic steps: (i) Collecting data on potentially eligible households via interviews using a questionnaire; (ii) Entering data into the SRM main registry (with varying degrees of verification and consistency checks); (iii) Comparing the household characteristics with pre-established criteria for eligibility; and (iv) Establishing sub-registers of eligible individuals/households for the purposes of programmes implementation and payroll . 74 3 . Registration: Which approach to use? There are two main approaches through which potential beneficiaries can enter the SRM main registry . (a) On-demand application: The potential beneficiary calls at the regional social security office for registration . This is followed by home-visit/s by the field officer to verify certain information \u2013 particularly those on living conditions and household composition . The on-demand method is more appropriate for low-poverty regions and heterogeneous areas (i .e . areas which do not exclusively consist of poor households) . (b) Outreach approach: Field officers carry out home-visits to register the potential beneficiaries . This method is best suited in high-poverty situations and homogeneous areas (a rough comparison in Mauritius would be the pockets of poverty) . Entry in the SRM main registry will be primarily through the on-demand method . In some cases, the outreach approach will also be used in order not to miss the poor who may be less informed or who may have difficulty to travel to the Social Security Offices . 4 . Communications, transparency and confidentiality: In order to ensure a transparent, credible and quality data collection process, communications strategies, which include the following principles will be designed . \u2022\ufffd Any person will be able to register in the SRM main registry at any time \u2013 with the explicit understanding that registration does not guarantee benefits . \u2022\ufffd Claimants and the public in general will be informed of the confidentiality policy that will be adopted by the SRM . \u2022\ufffd Claimants will be informed of their rights and responsibilities, including any responsibilities for updates on household information or need for re-certification . \u2022\ufffd Claimants will be provided with information about who to contact for any questions on the status of their application . \u2022\ufffd Claimants will be informed of the outcome of their application . \u2022\ufffd Claimants will be provided with information about appeal processes . 5 . Identification of individuals: The national identity number will be the key identifier for each individual in the database . Duplicates will be automatically detected and flagged . 75 Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes Institutional arrangements The SRM operates under the aegis of the MSS with support from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, and with technical assistance from the UNDP .

I want to share some thoughts regarding China\u2019s social protection initiatives . As a country moving from a rural-urban divided structure to a more rural-urban integrated management approach, China\u2019s evolving social protection system has undergone some successful transformations . Apart from social relief efforts, the social security system is quite broad based, covering several different groups of beneficiaries . China\u2019s social security scheme, which started during the 1990\u2019s, primarily dealt with the economic fallout associated with state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform; it aimed to support workers laid off from urban factories . This sort of social safety net experienced challenges, but several valuable experiences emerged from it as well, which in turn allowed the safety net to be scaled up nationwide . With consistently high economic growth alongside uneven social progress, the government has realized the importance of distributing development gains more equally among the different factions of society . Specific schemes that started off as pilot efforts in certain areas, targeting different population groups (e .g . migrant workers, peasants, urban employees in non-SOE sectors, etc .), were later scaled up to offer more comprehensive coverage . Broadly speaking, based on different pilot schemes and policy advocacy efforts, the country has now established a broad framework of social protection, covering both social relief and social security . 77 Part 1: Key Features of Successful Social Protection Schemes This development is encouraging and a step in the right direction . For a large transition country such as China, with a population of 1 .3 billion, the commitments and efforts of the government to cover all its citizens are laudable given the enormity of the task . At present, the social protection system is addressing the needs of the vulnerable and managing social risks through a variety of schemes including: \u2022\ufffd Old age insurance/retirement pension; \u2022\ufffd Health insurance/immunization; \u2022\ufffd Unemployment insurance; \u2022\ufffd Work injury insurance; \u2022\ufffd Child birth insurance; \u2022\ufffd Housing fund; \u2022\ufffd Compulsory education; \u2022\ufffd Vocational education/skills training; \u2022\ufffd Minimum living allowance; \u2022\ufffd Senior age allowance; \u2022\ufffd Rural five supports; and \u2022\ufffd Allowance for ethnic minorities . UNDP has supported policy studies advocating equalization of basic social services and social protection for all . UNDP has also supported some pilots, such as ensuring the fiscal coverage of schemes for vulnerable groups (for example, for the migrant population) . Pilots were undertaken in towns where there is a high concentration of migrant workers; to test whether resources for social security and social services for migrant workers can be integrated into the overall government plan and budget . Policy recommendations\u2014on portability of social security of migrants\u2014have also been put forward . As migrant workers mostly work in high risks sectors, UNDP has worked together with the government at both the central and the local level to improve the management of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44bae5f5-ea11-45ab-9e4b-8c1374a2bedc": {"__data__": {"id_": "44bae5f5-ea11-45ab-9e4b-8c1374a2bedc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a0d0bafe5bb7bdf7052b407e8fcf3e039a5f5834e0f8f9a434a3e202ebd048b"}}, "hash": "6a0d0bafe5bb7bdf7052b407e8fcf3e039a5f5834e0f8f9a434a3e202ebd048b", "text": "worker injury insurance schemes . Emphasis has been put on prevention of injury through raising awareness so that migrant workers are more informed of their rights and the need to safe guard their rights . The cooperation project has also undertaken successful pilots to support the rehabilitation of migrant workers; support does not only include help for physical rehabilitation, but also psychological mentoring, and skill training for reintegration into the workforce . Such initiatives have provided useful and sparked the interest of the central government vis-\u00e0-vis strengthening policies on worker injury insurance . 78 Other good efforts such as social relief schemes in crisis situations have also been undertaken . During the Wen Chuan earthquake recovery and reconstruction period as well as during the aftermath of the financial crisis, policy measures were formulated and implemented quickly to help affected people better cope with the socio-economic impact of the crises . For example, with UNDP\u2019s support in Chengdu of Sichuan Province, physical job fairs and other platform to create job opportunities for the impacted people had been established . Moreover, a Policy study advocating for the establishment of a long-term emergency employment aid working mechanism under special circumstances in China was published . The study helped launch a new policy\u2014 \u201cThe Guideline in Promoting Emergency Employment Aid under Special Circumstances\u201d in May, 2010 in Chengdu, Capital of Sichuan Province . To conclude, building a resilient and sustainable social protection system is a priority of the government . The challenge now is bring together the various schemes, which are successful individually, but nonetheless fragmented when seen as part of a whole system . The aim in the foreseeable future should be on building a coherent structure that allows all the different schemes to function effectively as part of a comprehensive and integrated system targeting the various vulnerable groups of society . This is naturally a gradual and evolutionary process requiring changes on several fronts including in institutional reform, financial/fiscal guarantee, and implementation capacity . We hope these inputs are useful to the discussion, and we welcome your comments .

This set of questions aims to provide conceptual clarification of social protection to shed some light on constructing and designing better social protection initiatives . As the distinction between social protection schemes and standard development efforts (by the State) blurs, members were invited to share their thoughts on the topic question for Part 2 of the e-discussion: What Constitutes Social Protection? Members were requested to focus on the following aspects: \u2022\ufffd To what extent can social protection schemes be distinguished from general development efforts by the State? \u2022\ufffd Better provision of basic services, such as water sanitation, public health facilities and education systems, may reduce the need for extra measures in these areas and vice versa . For these basic services, what criteria (e .g . duration, coverage, nature of funding) could be used to differentiate social protection initiatives from general development efforts? \u2022\ufffd Clarity on the distinctions and overlaps can help to improve tracking and monitoring, and to ring-fence budgets for the most disadvantaged at the national and local levels . How do you propose the distinctions and overlaps be managed for development effectiveness? 81 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? Summary Dear Members: Over the course of Part 2 of the e-discussion on social protection, 26 September \u2013 17 October, we received 20 responses to the topic question, What Constitutes Social Protection? The enriching discussion drew from the experience and expertise of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) staff at global, regional and country levels, development practitioners from different United Nations (UN) agencies, civil society, academics and experts in social protection . Conceptual clarification is important for designing and implementing more effective social protection initiatives . Given the complexity of social protection concepts and approaches, finding a definitive consensus on the issue is challenging . The renewed interest in the social protection agenda reflects a move away from the narrow, conservative approaches characterized by structural adjustment programmes towards a more comprehensive and systematic approach to management of risks and vulnerabilities . These risks and vulnerabilities originate from various sources, including short- term exogenous shocks, as well as long-term structural issues for achieving sustainable poverty reduction and human development . In this light, emerging challenges such as high food prices reflect the need for emergency responses and long-term approaches to dealing with structural food deficits . Similarly, the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8798eec6-969f-4c79-a7f4-49d282032000": {"__data__": {"id_": "8798eec6-969f-4c79-a7f4-49d282032000", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "348f9197ee1b1f07245cc6d10523a6c09f40f9a63700a290bd1b869e9500c6cc"}}, "hash": "348f9197ee1b1f07245cc6d10523a6c09f40f9a63700a290bd1b869e9500c6cc", "text": "recent global economic crisis posed a sudden shock to the Asia-Pacific region . Even though it had relatively limited impact on gross domestic product (GDP) growth in Asia, the broader adverse effect remains rather profound on increasing vulnerability and precariousness of employment and growing informality of the labour market in the region . A more comprehensive approach to social protection should not only focus on income insecurity, but also address the dynamics and multidimensional aspects of poverty . This has a broader linkage to social vulnerabilities of the poor and disadvantaged, and their capacity to participate in a more inclusive growth and development process for building resilience against future shocks . To what extent can social protection schemes be distinguished from general development efforts by the State? \u2022\ufffd There is growing consensus that social protection is key to sustaining achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) with equity. An increasingly recognized dynamic and multidimensional view of poverty goes beyond income to include issues of risks and vulnerabilities, relative deprivation (as a result of social and political exclusion), structural 82 inequalities and inter-generational transmission of poverty . As highlighted by Sarah Cook, social protection is viewed as a means to provide an effective measure to address poverty dynamics, ranging from a short-term response to crisis and shocks to a long-term foundation for achieving sustainable poverty reduction and human development and security . \u2022\ufffd Different systems of social protections vary widely in the region but still reflect recognition of two common points: (a) the need to address the risks and vulnerability of the disadvantaged, and (b) the dynamic nature of poverty and human vulnerability . As pointed out by Katja Hujo, definitions of social protection tend to be either very broad or very narrow, with the broad variants equalizing social protection with social policy and the narrow variants defining social protection as policies targeted at the vulnerable and poor . \u2022\ufffd Armando Barrientos highlighted two different approaches to social protection: the social policy / public finance approach and the development approach . The social policy / public finance approach has a relatively narrow focus on social insurance, social assistance and employment- related policies and covers \u2018passive\u2019 policies to protect rights and entitlements and \u2018active \u2019 policies/programme to promote employment and productivity . The developmental approach encourages a broader and more comprehensive policy framework beyond the narrow focus on income to include human development to help synergize social and economic development . While Rui Gomes discussed the key types of social protection schemes that are popular as a means to address issues of poverty, vulnerability and inequality (namely labour market interventions, social insurance, and social assistance), Barrientos argued that protection and assistance are developmental in the sense that they contribute to social and economic development . \u2022\ufffd Many contributors emphasized that development is much larger than social protection . Therefore, social protection will be more effective if combined with policies delivering basic services and growth and not taken as a substitute for these . Julia Kercher, Shivani Nayyar and Claudia Vinay suggested that social protection should be seen as a means to achieve the objective of social and other development policies more broadly, especially to ensure that services are available, accessible and of adequate quality . \u2022\ufffd Boundaries and limitations of social protection schemes relative to the general development policies and programmes should be recognized . As Anuradha Rajivan and Ryce Chanchai pointed out, social protection initiatives cannot replace social infrastructure and basic services . This differentiation between the two is often complicated by the availability, accessibility, and quality of the latter, especially in health and education sectors . As the comprehensiveness of the basic social services increases, there is less need for specialized social protection measures . Social assistance (for example, cash transfers and school feeding programmes) has a primary role, whereas the basic system of social services is highly fragmented and 83 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? stratified . Understanding these boundaries helps to enhance monitoring the effectiveness of programmes, especially the use of targeting versus universal approaches, conditionality and accountability at all levels . \u2022\ufffd The issue or problem we are trying to address should determine the type of social protection measure to be employed . Taimur Khilji argued that social protection is analogous to a toolbox containing several different tools (instruments) that are meant to be used (implemented) for a particular purpose . Even without consensus on the definition, social protection programmes can be tracked and monitored to ensure they fulfil their purpose and are part of a broader and more comprehensive development effort . \u2022\ufffd", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e6ba8b3-4012-4e35-959a-d34487ededdc": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e6ba8b3-4012-4e35-959a-d34487ededdc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "63709e7a06dfe8f8c888e8417ba4d3ab232e7122626b78aecedd7e37a1df5156"}}, "hash": "63709e7a06dfe8f8c888e8417ba4d3ab232e7122626b78aecedd7e37a1df5156", "text": "In practice, investment in effective social protection policies and programmes should start with the needs, realities and priorities of the groups intended to benefit from social protection, based on fiscal sustainability . There is tremendous heterogeneity in poverty and vulnerabilities, and the design of social protection schemes must reflect this reality . To be effective, social protection schemes must be tailored to support different groups with varying degrees of risk and vulnerability . G\u00f6ran Jonsson argued that social protection schemes often overlook social dimensions of vulnerability since they focus on income poverty as opposed to other underlying causes of vulnerabilities . He highlighted the three dimensions of social protection: prevention, protection and promotion . \u2022\ufffd Social protection must be understood within a specific national context, including national-owned policies and instruments that reflect different priorities . As mentioned by Bishwa Nath Tiwari, there are diverse views on the coverage and scope of social protection, ranging from the traditional role of social insurance and social assistance to the broader view of sustained poverty reduction and human development . The concept of social protection is further complicated by the different terminologies (e .g . social protection, social security, safety net) used interchangeably among various donor and development agencies . \u2022\ufffd Furthermore, social protection interventions alone cannot addresses underlying long-term structural issues, especially inequitable and exclusionary development patterns, which are highly prevalent in the Asia-Pacific context . Social protection instruments cannot provide a comprehensive response to these structural issues, despite being well designed, funded and targeted . Understanding the distinction and overlaps between social protection and general development efforts: key programmatic and practical implications \u2022\ufffd Fabio Veras Soares emphasized that stand-alone programmes do not work well to address life-cycle risks and vulnerabilities; a more comprehensive approach is required . Therefore, the design needs to recognize the different needs of the targeted beneficiaries, such as households plagued by chronic food insecurity, which require a mix of direct support . Therefore, both the design and implementation need a high level of coordination and alignment 84 among donors and government, as well as the capacity to bring together multiple objectives . \u2022\ufffd Countries have different capacities in implementing social protection programmes . Middle-income countries (MICs) tend to have more fiscal space, whereas low-income countries (LICs) highly depend on grants and foreign aid . In countries with limited fiscal space, it is critical to identify clear priorities and choose programmes that foster productive activities and assets and have potential synergies with other priorities identified at the national and local levels . In practice, LICs tend to face challenges in designing social protection programmes that can manage both short-term and long-term aspects of risks and vulnerabilities . As Carol Flore-Smereczniak and Peterson Magoola pointed out, Papua New Guinea (PNG) has struggled to conceptualize and operationalize social protection due to limited data and cost-benefit analysis at the national level . Weak governance and administrative capacity has weakened this challenge, particularly at the sub-national levels . \u2022\ufffd As highlighted by Giorgia Giovannetti, successful social protection programmes require stronger synergies with other social, labour market and macroeconomic policies, and with a development agenda to reduce inequality, vulnerability and exclusion . Implementing this requires effective inter-ministerial and inter-sectoral collaboration, coordination and coherence . \u2022\ufffd Disadvantage is dynamic . As conditions and options of targeted beneficiaries improve, graduation out of eligibility should be considered . Nevertheless, clarification of this concept, whether it means graduation from poverty or graduation from programmes due to budget considerations, is necessary . \u2022\ufffd Several contributors emphasized that ensuring inclusiveness of social protection requires targeting groups with particular needs within the universal approach . Targeting can be highly political, especially when looking at various categories of poor households, including the ultra-poor, and chronic, transient and near poor . It is often complicated with technical issues, which involve different approaches such as geographical targeting poverty mapping, selection of beneficiaries (means testing), proxy means testing, multidimensional index, and household or community targeting . Roula Koudsi provided an example from Syria . The ultra-poor who live below the lower, extreme poverty line need to secure their basic food and non- food needs before being effectively targeted for particular social protection measures . This population may therefore be classified in two categories: (a) the vulnerable ultra-poor not able to work, and (b) the ultra-poor able to work if they are offered suitable assistance . \u2022\ufffd The selected method for targeting does matter . In practice, very few universal programmes are not targeted in some sense . For instance, they are universal within an age group, like universal social pensions (categorical targeting), within", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62f9e689-034f-466a-9957-37f3de87ff90": {"__data__": {"id_": "62f9e689-034f-466a-9957-37f3de87ff90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c5be0397f7ef1c53d718d930a37b21ebb37097c68bf6c7dda12cb9c0fff6ef39"}}, "hash": "c5be0397f7ef1c53d718d930a37b21ebb37097c68bf6c7dda12cb9c0fff6ef39", "text": "a specified district (geographical) . The common challenge is that these targeted programmes tends to benefit those who are already 85 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? better off and to provide relatively less benefit to the most poor or the most vulnerable groups . An important question was raised: how can we move towards universal systems that create the kind of inter-linkages between social classes, generations, gender, ethnic and regional groups that are conducive to greater social cohesion and sustainability of policies? \u2022\ufffd Broader issues of governance matter . Many contributors highlighted the importance of the political context, existing power relations and meaningful participation of the poor and marginalized to determine the long-term success of social protection schemes, especially where land and assets are evenly distributed, legal provisions and changes are critical to make social protection effective and sustainable for social inclusion . Governance mechanisms, including redress in case of errors, are required to ensure that the implementation of social protection schemes is transparent and accountable to minimize potential corruption and leakages . Qimti Paienjton argued that action is also required in the form of legislation . Anti-discrimination laws have potential to address exclusion faced by various subgroups, including women, people living with HIV and AIDS, people with disabilities, ethnic minorities, and migrants, among others . Such actions can contribute towards the realization of effective social protection, whether or not we consider them as constituting social protection . \u2022\ufffd Several contributors discussed the use of conditionality . The debate focused on whether or not social protection schemes, such as cash transfers, would have similar or better impact on low-income households without having behavioural conditions attached to them . The design of social protection with conditionality implies that basic facilities for health and education services must be available and accessible to the beneficiaries . In other words, supply-side constraints must be addressed . \u2022\ufffd Social protection schemes, such as emergency cash transfers, can be linked to longer-term social protection programmes, as highlighted by Henry Jackelen and Subathirai Sivakumaran . Experiences in Haiti and Pakistan, recurring emergencies in the Horn of Africa and chronic conflicts in other parts of the world suggest that these shocks are not isolated incidences affecting a specific population . . Transformative potential of social protection and the move to a social justice agenda Social protection policies and programmes can go beyond short-term healing and catalyse positive changes in power relations . As pointed out by Upendranadh Choragudi, political will and civil society also have an important role to play in sparking transformative change through social protection initiatives . 86 \u2022\ufffd The social protection discourse could be ambitiously oriented towards social justice . Gabriele Koehler argued that the general approach to social protection risks appearing as a development fad as it tends to rely on a one-dimensional approach that does not necessarily analyse and challenge inequitable structures . To transcend massive inequalities in the Asia-Pacific region, social protection policies need to be complemented by additional tiers of policy domains beyond transformative potential of social protection . It needs a fiscal policy stance that contributes to income and wealth distribution; an industrial policy that creates employment-oriented green growth and decent work;81 and international trade and investment policy and financial markets that are radically transformative and correspond to the interest of LICs and low-income people . Christoph Hamelmann also reinforced this perspective by calling for mandatory social financing mechanisms at the global level, such as a global social health insurance schemes that link to national schemes with the potential to replace the mechanisms of development aid in the health sector . \u2022\ufffd Rights-based approach to social policies must empower the marginalized . Social protection programmes with a strong component on women empowerment and gender equality can be transformative . Raymond Brandes and James Lang also emphasized that social protection should strive to address structural determinants of gender inequality, gender-based violence (GBV) and the indivisibility and alienability of gender rights and justice . To conclude, many contributors emphasized the need to focus on greater developmental impact of social protection, which may offset the resources used to finance them . For instance, investments in human capital can lead to a healthier, skilled and productive workforce . The creation of local infrastructure and income opportunities, including improving labour force participation (especially for women), can also generate positive effects on the local economy, raise household production, and reduce the need for risk-coping strategies that can undermine productivity, lead to the distress sale of assets or drive migration for employment .

Individual Contributions Anuradha Rajivan, UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Dear Colleagues and Friends: I would like to begin Part 2 of the discussion by highlighting some key areas of consensus and concerns around social protection . We have seen a number of very specific country examples covering a variety of schemes and programmes that address exclusions and risks with respect to employment, income, food, health and education . Newer vulnerabilities from climate change are also starting to receive international attention, even though they have yet to be operationalized . Social services, transfers and insurance are the most common instruments discussed . Based on the experiences presented, this contribution tries to pull together some of the (a) areas of consensus, and (b) issues of concern . Areas of consensus \u2022\ufffd No country questions the necessity of social protection, even though there may be differences in the local priorities, sectors, types, extent, coverage or financing . Most governments understand the need for social protection and would like to support it through policies and programmes . 123RF 88 \u2022\ufffd Exclusion and marginalization can benefit from social protection . They exist in all development contexts: least-developed countries, those experiencing high economic growth, middle-income countries, and high income ones, too . \u2022\ufffd Managing risks and shocks can also benefit from systematic social protection . Risks and shocks also occur in all development contexts . \u2022\ufffd Dedicated social protection schemes for particular sectors already operate in many countries . However, they may not be specifically identified as such; they are generally known by the types of exclusions or risks they cover . Elements of social protection can also be identified in some of the regular development policy programmes . \u2022\ufffd There is a multiplicity of terminology around what can be identified as social protection: social security, social insurance, employment guarantee, employment insurance, pensions, etc . Individual schemes are yet to be integrated into a coherent institutional policy framework . \u2022\ufffd The idea of social protection has come to receive increasing international policy attention, gaining much greater visibility since the recent global economic downturn . Inadequate aggregate demand has been one of the motivations internationally to reduce pressures for precautionary savings and boost aggregated demand . However, the issue has now taken on a life of its own in development discourse and ranges from targeting the vulnerable, to phased expansion, to a rights-based approach and universal coverage . Recognizing the recent fiscal problems in the developed world (fiscal sustainability issues) is also on the radar . \u2022\ufffd Yet, social protection is not new . While recent national instruments can provide a useful body of experience to draw policy implications, more traditional forms of social protection can also provide ideas (e .g . zakat, orphanages, homes for the aged, girls hostels, monasteries, private charities, mutual support of extended families and patron-client networks) . Lessons can be drawn from the varied experiences in establishing larger and more systematic options, for example, in prioritization, outreach or costing . Issues of concern \u2022\ufffd How should one distinguish between social protection and general development efforts? Better provisioning of social services (coverage and quality), for example can reduce the need for social protection . A better understanding can help in ring-fencing budgets, building political agreement on minimum standards, and monitoring coverage and financing . To be clear about what constitutes social protection, can we establish what it is not? \u2022\ufffd What are the linkages between structural macroeconomic policies and social protection policies? If growth is inequitably increasing or leads to increased casualization of workers, budgets for employment-linked social protection will balloon . Competitive pressures from globalization, for example, while providing new opportunities, are also putting pressures on labour markets, 89 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? including presenting some extreme forms of distress .

With best regards, Anuradha Rajivan, Practice Team Leader Inclusive Growth and Poverty Reduction UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Bangkok, Thailand 90 Gabriele Koehler, Institute of Development Studies Dear All: In my contribution I discuss moving social protection from a palliative to a social justice agenda . This e-discussion is devoted to social protection and progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) with equity . Perhaps one could be more ambitious and orient the discourse towards social justice\u2014the MDGs plus human rights, decent work, and social inclusion\u2014and discuss how current social protection policy efforts might contribute to moving in this direction . Social protection as a policy domain has gained traction especially over the past decade, so much so that it risks appearing as a development fad . Development fads generate the momentum necessary to reach the tipping point where resources are mobilized and decisive action taken to achieve particular outcomes . But development fads often owe their popularity to an overreliance on one-dimensional approaches; they do not necessarily analyse and challenge structures . Thus, the global popularity of social protection policy is partly owed to its simplicity . In their generalized form, the policy measures focus on individualized cash transfers, instead of addressing the structures that create poverty, vulnerability and exclusion . They focus on income streams and not on creating decent continuous work, or building and ensuring equitable access to productive assets . They do not address a redistribution of wealth, and they do not shift power and decision making to the poor and vulnerable . They thus risk being limited to serving as a palliative . The current social protection agenda Social protection has become the policy of choice in many low- and middle- income countries to address income poverty and socio-economic vulnerability and accelerate achievement of the MDGs,82 much as they have been in place for many years in the welfare states of the high-income economies . In Asia, social protection has been mainstreamed since the 1998 financial crisis, when basic forms of social insurance and assistance were introduced in several Southeast and East Asian countries . Examples include safety net programmes in Indonesia since 1998, the Minimum Living Standard Guarantee (dibao) in China since 1999, and the universal health insurance schemes developed in Thailand recently . In South Asia, social protection measures have been deepened as a result of political shifts since 2005 . Examples include public employment guarantee schemes developed in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan between 2006 and 82 UN General Assembly, Sixty-Fifth Session, Keeping the Promise: United to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals, Resolution adopted by the General Assembly, A/RES/65/1, 2010 .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b6e185d-e3ec-4810-81e2-98de046133bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b6e185d-e3ec-4810-81e2-98de046133bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f106ad93bb1958871c4bc77ebb50b16d16bf8292e9d5cb3ad03b8e6c3417495b"}, "3": {"node_id": "e711fe9a-cca6-4b58-8d7c-22afeb8ea0b9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "374875c27e3e1abd776a7cfcb436904f347f0c6a2ac6d1fb9d21c30b97892044"}}, "hash": "33b4e46e351024199f09298e98b5d9c47a53eea20c0980f5a8548c68a290f141", "text": "Available at http://www .un .org/en/mdg/summit2010/pdf/outcome_documentN1051260 .pdf 91 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? 2009; the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) in Pakistan;83 and the social health protection scheme for the informal economy adopted in India in 2007 . Having such policy instruments in place has had three effects . Firstly, they have helped cushion the impact of the 2008 food, fuel and financial crises, and the impact of the global economic crisis since then . Secondly, these instruments signal governments\u2019 general recognition that poverty and vulnerability are structural issues and remain threatening despite rapid economic growth in much of Asia . For example, in South Asia, the number of people surviving on less than $1 .25 per person per day increased between 1999 and 2005, from 589 to 596 million,84 and the majority of the world\u2019s hungry live in Asia . The employment schemes acknowledge that it is the depth of rural poverty and hunger that is driving distress migration out of destitute rural areas into urban mega-slums .85 And thirdly, some of the social protection measures are designed as rights based: the Indian NREGA is becoming justifiable; the BISP is disbursed to women heads of family and could bring some gender empowerment; social pensions such as in Nepal could enhance the autonomy of the aged .86 Moving towards a social justice agenda The social protection fad thus presents an enormous step forward . And, if current political patterns and citizens\u2019 movement remain in force, these social protection schemes may gradually grow beyond their current fragmented patterns and palliative nature, and cohere into systems of social protection for social justice that are provided, financed and guaranteed by governments in response to pressure from citizens . They can become levers for social and economic transformation . This however requires a number of complementary measures . The first complementary measure comes in the form of the social protection floor, adopted in a comprehensive fashion at the 2011 International Labour 83 Government of Pakistan, Benazir Income Support Programme, www .bisp .gov .pk (accessed February 17, 2011) . 84 UN DESA, Rethinking Poverty: Report on the World Social Situation (United Nations, New York: 2009) .

What is significant is that the social protection floor defines two areas as minimum conditions of human development: \u2022\ufffd Income transfers for situations of unemployment, accident, health incidents and child benefits (i .e . classical social protection); and \u2022\ufffd Access to a set of basic social services: at least health, education, water and sanitation . The International Labour Organization (ILO) casts these as mutually reinforcing and complementary . One area cannot be pursued at the expense of the other; rather they interlink and are conceptualized as universal: every citizen has a right to basic income and social services, and to claim these from their governments .87 However, to transcend the massive inequalities and inequities experienced by large groups of Asia\u2019s population, social protection policies need to be complemented by additional tiers of policy domains, reaching beyond even transformative forms of social protection . In the first instance, it needs a fiscal policy stance that assures public resources are available, and at the same time are designed in such a fashion that they contribute to income and wealth redistribution . Secondly, there is a need to rehabilitate industrial policy in the broad sense of the word, to create employment-oriented green growth and decent work . Industrial policy needs to be inspired by the global jobs pact proposed by the ILO, which includes job creation and the enforcement of core labour standards and rights .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e711fe9a-cca6-4b58-8d7c-22afeb8ea0b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "e711fe9a-cca6-4b58-8d7c-22afeb8ea0b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f106ad93bb1958871c4bc77ebb50b16d16bf8292e9d5cb3ad03b8e6c3417495b"}, "2": {"node_id": "0b6e185d-e3ec-4810-81e2-98de046133bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33b4e46e351024199f09298e98b5d9c47a53eea20c0980f5a8548c68a290f141"}}, "hash": "374875c27e3e1abd776a7cfcb436904f347f0c6a2ac6d1fb9d21c30b97892044", "text": "Thirdly, international trade and investment policy and financial markets need to be radically transformed to correspond to the interests of low-income countries and of low-income people .

Christoph Hamelmann, UNDP Europe and CIS Dear All: Further to Gabriele\u2019s contribution: If social protection is to be seen within a universal social justice framework as a basic individual right, then financing it in a global society should be seen not only in the context of nation states, plus charity and voluntary pledges from richer nations, but also through mandatory social financing mechanisms at the global level . This would call, for example, in the health sector (as one scenario) for a global social health insurance scheme linked to national schemes with the potential to replace most current mechanisms of development aid in the health sector . Best regards, Dr. Christoph Hamelmann, Regional Practice Leader HIV, Health and Development UNDP Europe and the CIS, Bratislava Regional Centre Bratislava, Slovak Republic Fabio Veras Soares, UNDP International Poverty Centre for Inclusive Growth Dear All: I would like to raise some issues with regard to the debate on social protection in the region, bringing some elements from the recent experience in the Global South that have been the focus of UNDP\u2019s International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth (IPC-IG) research and analysis . In the earlier part of the discussion, we have been discussing the experiences of stand-alone programmes (or in the best case, flagship programmes) and trying to understand the reasons for their success and sustainability . However, I would like to make the case that it is unlikely that a single programme can deal with all vulnerabilities and risks that individuals and families face during their life cycle . To deal with these vulnerabilities and risks, it is necessary to move away from flagship/stand-alone programmes towards more comprehensive social protection systems . There is no consensual definition of social protection . At IPC-IG we have been working with a definition that helps us to link social protection with inclusive growth that seeks to emphasize that social protection is not only a quick and ex post fix for inequities generated by the growth process, but also an important 94 component of the growth process itself . Social protection for inclusive growth in this approach comprises a set of publically funded actions that serve to (a) support individuals and families in addressing vulnerabilities over their life course; (b) help, especially the poor and the vulnerable, build resilience to respond to crises/hazards/shocks, including environmental threats; (c) foster social inclusion and assist people, especially those more vulnerable to poverty, to build human and social capital through facilitating income smoothing and encouraging/ensuring access to basic social goods and services; and (d) foster productive inclusion through enhancing the capabilities, rights and opportunities of the poor and marginalized/excluded, as well as those in formal sector jobs, to benefit from growth . Such a definition incorporates traditional features of social protection definitions, namely, social insurance, social assistance, and active labour market policies, but broadens the scope of these interventions in order to encompass some developmental objectives through direct links with access to social goods and services, as well as with productive inclusion, especially for those with no (or weak) links to the formal labour market . In this context, we also argue that a social protection system can have productive impacts at the macro level by stimulating aggregate demand and working as automatic stabilizers; at the meso level by fostering the local economy and improving local assets; and at the micro level by increasing household and individual productivity and decreasing vulnerability to negative shocks .88 Despite different levels of robustness with regard to the available empirical evidence, it is possible to assert that social protection does contribute to making the growth process more inclusive (and not only as a compensatory measure) . This is clearer when one analyses social protection programmes that have a productive component with strong spillover effects, but also with simpler cash transfer programmes that can have second-round effects at the macro and meso levels, and direct effects at the household level .

As a matter of fact, the discourse around \u2018graduation\u2019 is never clear whether one is talking about graduation from poverty or graduation from the programme due to budget considerations . In general, graduation concerns come with very scarce (if any) empirical evidence on beneficiary dependency . Eyal and Wollard (2011), for instance, shows that Child Support Grant in South Africa has enabled young mothers to send their children 88 Ruslan Yemtsov, \"The Productive Role of Social Protection\" (Presentation at the South\u2010South Social Protection Learning Forum, Addis Ababa, June 4, 2011) .

However, in order to facilitate this activation process, it is necessary to have more comprehensive information on the needs of the beneficiaries, on the potential of the local labour markets, and on the needs of the communities . The description of Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) by Faiza Effendi and Haris Gazdar, in the first part of this discussion, reveals some elements that have the potential to move in this direction . The dissemination of singles registries and/or of interconnected databases seems to be one important innovation that, even if initially linked to some flagship programme, was able to be implemented in a much broader manner . In Latin America, such systems became quite popular and proved its utility and multipurpose potential during the recent financial crisis . On the one hand, establishing these systems can be cumbersome and expensive; on the other hand, the synergies and potential improvement in the effectiveness of the social protection programmes are clear . Without denying the importance of cross- checking databases to avoid duplications and identifying inclusion errors, it seems that the information systems should be used to amplify the set of opportunities available to families, to decrease exclusion errors and improve coordination and impact of programmes . These systems can also affect evaluations whose results could feed back into a permanent process of redesigning the systems\u2019 programmes and refocusing their objectives . It is important to recognize, nonetheless, that countries have different capacities in implementing social protection and employment programmes . Middle- income countries tend to have more fiscal space to develop such policies, unlike low-income Countries that have a tighter fiscal space and are highly dependable on grants (e .g . Official Development Assistance [ODA]) . In such circumstances, the move toward a more comprehensive social protection system needs to be careful in identifying clear priorities and choosing programmes that have stronger synergies with the productive side and potential for integration with other locally identified priorities in the development agenda . Some innovative programmes like the Productive Safety Net Project (PSNP) in Ethiopia90 (See Lieuw-Kie-Song, 2011) have produced important lessons that 89 Katherine Eyal and Ingrid Woolard, \"Female Labour Force Participation and South Africa\u2019s Child Support Grant\" (Mimeo, 2011) .

Armando Barrientos, Brooks World Poverty Institute, University of Manchester Dear All: I would like to discuss the boundaries of social protection . As social protection programmes spread in developing countries, a number of researchers and policy makers acknowledge sharing some confusion over the boundaries of social protection policy . Is microfinance a social protection instrument? And what about programmes providing basic services such as healthcare, water or sanitation, are they part of social protection? Under what circumstances could policies addressing discrimination and social exclusion be considered as social protection? The aim of this brief contribution is to shed light on the boundaries of social protection . The discussion below contrasts two broad approaches to social protection . One approach starts from established social policy frameworks, tried and tested in developed countries . Let us call this the social policy / public finance approach . In this approach, social protection includes three main components: social insurance, social assistance, and employment related policies . Social insurance covers contributory programmes providing protection against life-course and work-related hazards . Social assistance covers tax-financed programmes addressing poverty and deprivation . And employment related programmes and policies cover passive policies that protect rights and entitlements of workers, as well as active programmes and policies that promote employment and productivity . The other approach starts from development frameworks and concerns . There are many variants of this approach, and wide areas of disagreement, but at its core it proposes that development is broader than rising incomes per capita, and includes attention to human development, governance, the environment, and empowerment . It advocates for integrated development strategies that advance, on all these fronts, a proposal captured in the notion of sustainable development . It is apparent from this brief characterisation of these two approaches that the development approach will consistently push social protection towards a broader, more encompassing policy framework . This is in contrast to the more focused scope proposed by the social policy / public finance approach . Many areas of apparent confusion and controversy over the role and scope of social protection in developing countries, and especially uncertainty over its boundaries, can be traced back to the spaces in between the social policy/public finance approach and a development approach . Finding common ground between them will help give social protection greater definition . 98 The social policy/public finance approach has a lot to offer . There is much for us to learn from the experiences of developed countries in poverty reduction and development . The crucial role of registration in enabling public assistance was well understood in 18th century England . The advantages and disadvantages of means testing and targeting assistance to poor households were comprehensively discussed in the United States in the context of its War on Poverty in the late 1960s and 1970s . At the same time, conditions in developing countries discourage slavishly transferring European approaches and institutions to developing countries . A development approach has much to contribute to enhancing the role of social protection institutions in developing countries . In particular, antipoverty programmes need to be designed and implemented in developing countries to help synergise social and economic development . Yet, there are limits to this strategy . The multifaceted nature of development, when applied to social protection, can result in a crippling loss of focus . Adding objectives and instruments to social protection strategies could quickly precipitate diminishing returns . Well-designed social protection programmes can be effective in reducing poverty; in the process, could have an impact on disparities in access to basic services; and could strengthen the productive capacity of groups in poverty . They are unlikely, however, to deliver economy-wide growth, gender empowerment or structural change . Policy gatekeepers (e .g . multilaterals, bilaterals, international NGOs) have redefined social protection many times over to make it fit with their versions of development .

The recent extension of social protection in developing countries has produced innovative larger\u2013scale programmes making a strong contribution to the reduction of global poverty .91 They constitute a significant step towards achieving sustainable development . Understanding the boundaries of social protection will be essential to maintaining a clear focus on the challenges ahead . Regards, Armando Barrientos, Research Director Brooks World Poverty Institute University of Manchester, UK Taimur Khilji, UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Dear All: I would like to discuss whether it is necessary to strictly define social protection . What is social protection? One way to address this question is by looking at how the concept of social protection is commonly used in development literature . The usage of the concept should point us towards its manifestations: policies, initiatives, projects and programmes that are cited as examples of social protection . We soon discover that social protection is used as a catch-all concept to cover a diverse range of initiatives that seem to have little in common with one another . Just glancing over Part 1 of the e-discussion, the diversity of social protection initiatives is apparent . Cash transfers, a national rural employment guarantee act, pension schemes, residential security, disaster risk management initiatives, a school stipend programme for girls (a conditional cash transfer), health programmes, etc . all feature as examples of social protection . 91 Armando Barrientos, Miguel Ni\u00f1o-Zaraz\u00faa, and Mathilde Maitrot, \"Social Assistance in Developing Countries\" (working paper series, Database version 5 Report, Manchester, Brooks World Poverty Institute, 2010) . Available at http://papers .ssrn .com/sol3/papers .cfm?abstract_ id=1672090 100 The World Bank (WB) classifies social protection into five broad categories\u2014 disability, labour markets, pensions, safety nets & transfers, and social funds .92 Whereas the Asia Development Bank (ADB) \u201cdefines social protection as the set of policies and programmes designed to reduce poverty and vulnerability by promoting efficient labour markets, diminishing people\u2019s exposure to risks, and enhancing their capacity to protect themselves against or cope with hazards and interruption or loss of income . Social protection consists of five major elements: labour markets, social insurance, social assistance and welfare service programmes, micro-and area-based schemes, and child protection .\u201d93 A multitude of schemes, initiatives and policies fall under the broad ADB definition, as well as ADB and WB categorizations of social protection . In fact, several examples of social protection schemes are arguably general development efforts by the State, such as India\u2019s Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act . Social protection, therefore, is a fluid term lacking in specificity . Reaching consensus on a working definition is yet to be achieved, as there seem to be several definitions . Instead of striving to reach consensus, an alternative approach would be to ask whether we really need to articulate social protection in stricter terms . Even without consensus on the definition of social protection, we could still monitor and track social protection programmes, and ensure they fulfil their purpose, are not fragmented, and are part of a broader and more comprehensive development effort . Thus conceived, social protection schemes can be effective and still be tagged as \u2018general development efforts by the state\u2019 without any contradiction . Social protection as a toolbox The problem of definition tends to dissolve once we focus on the issues and problems we are trying to address .

Just as a standard toolbox contains a screwdriver, a hammer, a saw, etc ., with each being an efficient and effective tool for a particular purpose, an imaginary social protection toolbox comprises instruments designed to address particular development issues . But, social protection instruments (just like tools in a toolbox) need not have anything in common with one another . A hammer has nothing in common with a saw, but both are efficient and effective tools for a particular purpose (i .e . hammering a nail and cutting wood, respectively) . Similarly, an employment guarantee scheme and a vaccination drive may have little in common with one another, although both may be effective in what they try to achieve . The former may be a permanent feature of the State\u2019s development budget, may work on the principle of affirmative action, may be limited to rural areas, etc .; whereas the latter may run for a limited duration, may not be part of the state budget but rather financed through a partnership between donors and the private sector, and may be universal and non-discriminatory (rich and poor alike are free to come and get vaccinated at no cost) . Both these initiatives that have practically nothing in common with one another are usually cited as examples of social protection . More importantly, both can be effective and efficient for the particular purpose they were designed to fulfil . At times, more than one tool (instrument) is needed to build something comprehensive, but during the process the purpose of each tool is well prescribed . Similarly, to build a comprehensive social protection system there would need to be clarity on how each initiative fulfils a particular purpose as part of a large whole . In sum, to obtain clarity on social protection, it matters more (a) what a particular scheme\u2019s purpose is (i .e . the problem it is designed to address), (b) how effective and efficient it is in fulfilling that purpose, and (c) how it serves to complement other initiatives as part of a broader development agenda . When we focus on the purpose of a particular programme, we consider aspects such as cultural context, public demand, incentive structure, behavioural traits of the beneficiaries, cost and benefit (social, political, and economic), the moral/ethical imperative, potential risks and externalities, duration expected for the programme to fulfill its objectives, etc . It matters less what common elements it may or may not share with other development initiatives also referred to as social protection . It may share some or none . Taimur Khilji, Policy Specialist UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Bangkok, Thailand 102 Sarah Cook, United Nations Research Institute for Social Development Dear All: Thank you for facilitating a very stimulating and informative exchange . The postings have highlighted a set of instruments or programmes, which have over recent years largely come to define the parameters of social protection . They have emerged out of various experiences of need and vulnerability in different parts of the world, but take particular shape in relation to specific local circumstances . In this part of the discussion, the question has been posed of whether such schemes can or should be distinguished from general development efforts by the State . Addressing this question involves a shift in thinking: from social protection primarily as instruments or programmes to a focus on their broader objectives: protecting people against livelihood downturns that might precipitate a fall into poverty or deprivation, and the guarantee of some basic level of security through social or public means . At a minimum, such provisions should be a matter of right\u2014to food, shelter, health care and education . However, basic security also contributes to economic development in multiple ways that are widely recognized, including through human capital formation, enhanced productivity and the capacities to engage in entrepreneurial activity . The linkages between social protection and wider development efforts operate in both directions .

A pattern of development that is highly unequal and exclusionary creates insecurities to which narrowly targeted social protection instruments, however well designed, cannot effectively respond . Without a more inclusive and equitable development agenda the demands on such programmes, particularly at moments of covariate shock, are likely to overwhelm them . Conversely, social protection interventions, if well designed, can be not only protective, but also developmental and possibly transformative: developmental, for example through encouraging human capital investment and entrepreneurial activity; and transformative through creating entitlements (based on citizenship, residence or other criteria), and enabling citizens to organize around such claims and to hold the State (or other actors) accountable . 103 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? Research conducted between the Asian and global financial crises provides some lessons on the developmental aspects of social protection .95 While some programmes (such as National Rural Employment Generation Scheme [NREGS]) build on earlier and long standing experiences, many new initiatives emerged or expanded in this decade . The impetus came from the recognition that, while growth had delivered rising living standards for some, the inequalities and vulnerabilities that accompanied uneven growth could not be resolved through market mechanisms or through residual ex post safety nets . Over this period, a significant body of evidence has been accumulated: first, on the nature of vulnerabilities across different countries and population groups in the region, and second, on what interventions are working and why . Here I note some general insights obtained from the comparative analysis of such experiences both across programmes and countries .96 \u2022\ufffd Social protection should not be viewed only as a response to risk and crisis; it is not only about addressing immediate exogenous shocks and contingencies (through consumption smoothing or risk management) . The varied nature of vulnerability in the region, including chronic poverty and deprivation, as well as exposure to volatility in unequal but growing economies, points to the need for differentiated responses (and thus instruments) to address the underlying causes . \u2022\ufffd By extension, the contexts and constructions of vulnerability matter; issues of age, ethnicity and gender, location or status (as migrant, rural, urban, etc .) all determine exposure to shocks and resources for coping, as well as opportunities for moving out of poverty . Social protection interventions may ensure minimal needs are met; complementary development efforts are necessary to create trajectories out of poverty and powerlessness . \u2022\ufffd Focusing on objectives leads to a broadening of the range of relevant instruments . One example, noted in earlier discussions (on India and Pakistan), concerns housing (or tenure) security . Housing has multiple roles in the lives of the poor and often underpins access to other forms of security . It is a source of protection (particularly for women); it provides shelter, a place of production and of identity . Whereas in Hong Kong and Singapore it formed a critical component of welfare policies, it is generally neglected in current social protection discussions . 95 The Social Protection in Asia (SPA) programme was initiated in the wake of the Asian financial crisis by the Ford Foundation . Details can be found on the programme site www . socialprotectionasia .org and at the IDS Centre for Social Protection website . Several of the earlier postings in this e-discussion drew on research undertaken within this programme . See also Sarah Cook and Naila Kabeer, eds ., Social Protection as Development Policy: Asian Perspective (London, New York, New Delhi: Routledge, 2010) . 96 See Programme Synthesis Report, Social Protection in Asia: Research Findings and Policy Lessons (2010) . Available at http://www .socialprotectionasia .org/Conf-prgram-pdf/SPA_SynthReport_web .pdf 104 \u2022\ufffd Social protection interventions do not work in isolation; the broader social protection system or policy framework locates particular programmes and ensures their effectiveness . For example, a programme with conditionalities related to health and education (premised on the need for incentives for behavioural change) cannot function effectively in the absence of accessible and quality services . If the constraint is supply or affordability, not behaviour, then a more effective intervention would be to ensure provision accessible to all . \u2022\ufffd There is a lifecycle to social protection interventions: they are not designed in a vacuum; they do not emerge fully formed; and they are often initiated on a piecemeal basis, emerging out of different measures that have been tried, tested, abandoned or occasionally institutionalized . Each has a history shaped by different institutional actors, interests and incentives, and responds to different (and changing) forms of insecurity .

The extent to which the state plays a role in integrating and institutionalizing interventions into national policy processes is a crucial determinant of comprehensive and transformative social protection systems . \u2022\ufffd Taking into account both the deeply entrenched forms of poverty and exclusion, as well as new forms of vulnerability generated through processes of rapid growth and global integration, it is clear that no one-size-fits-all approach, single instrument, or silver bullet exists . Social protection can only be effective in reducing poverty, vulnerability and marginalization if other policies (macro-economic, fiscal, labour market, etc .) work to reduce (and certainly not increase) inequality, vulnerability and exclusion . Within such a policy framework, three complementary prongs of a developmental approach to social protection are needed: (a) interventions to smooth consumption and protect livelihoods as immediate response to crisis or shocks; (b) ex ante protective measures of support including income transfers and basic social investments; and (c) a longer term perspective that links social protection concerns with building trajectories towards more secure lives through the mainstream development agenda . 105 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? \u2022\ufffd Recent experiences point to numerous ways in which social protection programmes within a supportive broader policy environment have developmental impacts, which may in fact offset the resources used to finance them . These include investments in human capital leading to a healthier, skilled and productive workforce; the creation of local infrastructure, rising incomes that generate local economy effects or relaxation on constraints to labour force participation (particularly for women), or that raise household production; and a reduction in coping strategies that undermine productivity or lead to distress sales or migration . While the wider developmental impacts of social protection interventions call for more systematic study, well-designed social protection interventions can provide the opportunity ladders to climb out of poverty, enhance participation in social and political life and contribute to wider processes of development and inclusive economic growth . Regards Sarah Cook, Director United Nations Research Institute for Social Development Geneva, Switzerland Carol Flore-Smereczniak and Peterson Magoola, UNDP Papua New Guinea Dear Colleagues: We would like to discuss protection, assistance, empowerment and transformation: four key concepts that characterize social protection in Papua New Guinea (PNG) . This contribution will provide an overview of the current situation in Papua New Guinea and the way forward, highlighting the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF)\u2019s contribution in supporting what the government has initiated for social protection . Assessments and studies of social protection initiatives undertaken in the Pacific by the World Bank and the Asia Development Bank (ADB) indicate that PNG ranks low on the Social Protection Index (SPI) among other Pacific countries (SPI measured by expenditure, coverage, impact, and distribution) . This means that in PNG, there are social and economic challenges such as poverty (or hardship as it is referred to in this region), access to and quality of education, and access to health services among others, which create a greater burden on Papua New Guineans, as compared to households in other Pacific countries . It is worth 106 pointing out that PNG accounts for 80 percent of the Pacific\u2019s population, thus their greater need to address the plight of the most vulnerable and marginalized communities . About 85 percent of the population of PNG lives in rural areas and depends on subsistence agriculture for its livelihood . Social protection mechanisms are not new in the Pacific, but the recent global economic crisis has brought the issue to the fore; governments realize that more needs to be done to build resilience during better times so that communities can cope in times of hardships and crises . Given this context, the PNG government through the Department for Community Development has embarked on the initiative to support the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9b69258-c259-4c20-a411-0070e60a2347": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9b69258-c259-4c20-a411-0070e60a2347", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1659264d91e629f26a7af8c125fc17698711212106951abab20b511fab1f04e"}}, "hash": "a1659264d91e629f26a7af8c125fc17698711212106951abab20b511fab1f04e", "text": "establishment new social protection programmes and strengthen existing ones . This is viewed as a means of improving access to and quality of social services at the household level, as well as providing a basis for the achievement of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) . As we know, social protection aims at reducing the vulnerability of households . For those already below the poverty line and those susceptible to fall into poverty, it affords the opportunity to rise above it by cushioning the impact of shocks (such as sickness and crop failure) and allows better access to economic opportunities . For those above the poverty line, social protection initiatives provide a buffer so that shocks and risks are better managed . While the \u2018wantok\u2019 system97 of PNG provides a safety net for family members who are in need, it also puts financial and other pressures on families and communities to care for an extended group of family members . The Government of Papua New Guinea has, for some time, been looking into the type of social protection system that is most suitable for PNG, recognizing that there are various models available . Consequently, a Social Protection Task Force has been established through a decision of the National Executive Council, based on a joint submission by the 97 \u2018Wantok system\u2019 refers to community ties whereby when something happens to one family member, other family or community members pool resources together to support the one(s) in need . 123RF 107 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? Ministers for Community Development and the Treasury . The task force is chaired by the Department for Community Development, with other members including the Department of National Planning and Monitoring, the Department of Treasury, the Department of Education, the National Department of Health, the Department of Agriculture and Livestock, the Department of Labour and Industrial Relations, the Department of Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs, as well as development partners, civil society organizations, and the United Nations (UN) . The composition of the task force signals an all-inclusive approach that also draws from experiences and lessons learned from other parts of the world . The main objective of the task force is to investigate and develop a formal policy framework for social protection in PNG and report back with relevant recommendations of the type of social protection model or approach most suited for the country . The Government has highlighted that their social protection policy can be characterized by four broad areas of focus: \u2022\ufffd Protection of the poor and vulnerable from unexpected risks in their daily life as well as from economic shocks; \u2022\ufffd Assistance to people during vulnerable periods (the concept includes vulnerable groups who need care and assistance both in cash and in-kind); \u2022\ufffd Empowerment of families and communities so that they can rebuild, reconstruct, and reorganize themselves in order to deal with similar situations on their own; and \u2022\ufffd Transformation: the ultimate outcome of social protection programmes in PNG must aim to provide an environment for affected individuals, families and households that is conducive to transforming their lives for the better in order to escape poverty and vulnerability . Enabling mechanisms and strategies allow for households to better cope with vulnerability and risk in the future . The initial work of the task force was to analyse current social protection models and recommend a model suited to PNG for government adoption . After a detailed analysis and various rounds of reviews, a report recommended social safety nets as the most appropriate model for social protection in PNG . This model drew from existing practices from across different regions, including from countries in Africa, South America, Middle East, South Asia, and South East Asia . Following this report, the task force called for a High Level Stakeholders Consultation to review the findings and recommendations and gather additional inputs from stakeholders . The consultation took place from 1\u20134 August 2011 in Port Moresby . We should highlight that consultations have been held at provincial levels to ensure that the policy is understood by all and is grounded in reality . 108 The UN, particularly UNICEF and UNDP, has played a significant role in the process by providing technical assistance to the National Task Force on Social Protection in mapping and analysing the various social protection models . Furthermore, to address the social and economic impact of HIV on women and children in PNG, the task force requested both agencies to provide specific technical assistance in designing and implementing child-focused and HIV- sensitive social protection programmes .

In addition, a national level consultation on social protection was conducted, aimed at providing an opportunity for national actors including the private sector and civil society to share experiences and contribute to the development of a social protection strategy and policy . The PNG UNDP country office, through the HIV, Health and Development portfolio, provides support to this process to ensure key cross-cutting issues are part of the policy . For example, to ensure that: \u2022\ufffd Children as well as elderly and people living with disabilities benefit directly from the government\u2019s assistance so that they can access their right to health, education and a quality of life that allows them to realize and reach their potential . \u2022\ufffd HIV-affected populations or those living with HIV and its life-altering consequences should be able to access their entitlements . As a lead up to this, people living with HIV will be widely consulted in developing policy, and an HIV impact assessment of communities will be conducted; the findings of which will subsequently be fed into the policies and programmes being developed . \u2022\ufffd PNG has a traditional system where affected groups, such as orphan children, are supported by community structures that will be strengthened . HIV- sensitive social protection focuses on three core schemes: 1 . Social insurance for people living with HIV; 2 . Social safety nets (conditional and/or non-conditional); and 3 . Social schemes to support employment and access to services . \u2022\ufffd Resources are put into the hands of women through existing micro-credit schemes, livelihood opportunities, or engagement into extensive agricultural initiatives, so that they are adequately empowered and have direct access to their entitlements . \u201c\u2026Past experience has demonstrated that money put into the hands of women is more likely to be invested in the family than money put into the hands of men,\u201d and resources in the hands of women seems to be a viable strategy to promote inclusive and sustainable development in PNG . 109 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? Key challenges In moving forward with these initiatives, the country has encountered a range of challenges, including: \u2022\ufffd Limited data to identify potential beneficiaries; \u2022\ufffd Lack of understanding of the entire social protection programming, including the cost-benefit analysis at the national level; and \u2022\ufffd Weak governance and administrative capacity, at national and sub national levels . Looking ahead There is an ongoing debate in PNG with regards to whether social protection policy should be targeted or universal . In response, it has been suggested to \u2018start small\u2019 and upscale gradually based on the success from selected areas . In addition, there needs to be a greater understanding of the models that could be adapted such that they take advantage of and build upon indigenous practices, such as the one-kina-per-child initiative in West New Britain, whereby each selected child from vulnerable families is awarded one kina/per day98 as support to access education and health services . The cost is borne by the provincial administration . In the final analysis, the UN system\u2019s role in this process is to ensure that the upcoming social protection policy contributes to a more equitable distribution of gains achieved through high economic growth, and consequently accelerated poverty reduction as part of the MDG plus agenda . We know that social protection programmes are not sufficient, but need to be coupled with sound macroeconomic policy and good governance . There is also a need for various groups to be involved and consulted during the development of the social protection policy . Particularly for HIV sensitive social protection initiatives, HIV positive people need to be involved such that their concerns and issues are aired appropriately and adequately addressed . In addition, more discussions are required with both public and private sectors to deepen understanding on issues related to social protection, including the financial/fiscal implications of a comprehensive social protection strategy in PNG .

While discussions on what constitutes social protection are valuable on their own, it is probably as important to seek answers on what social protection aims to address and how . With regards, Raymond Brandes, Programme Specialist; and James Lang, Programme Coordinator Partners for Prevention (P4P) Bangkok, Thailand Giorgia Giovannetti, University of Firenze Dear All: I would like to share some lessons learned on social protection . Interest in social protection, triggered in part by the rapid sequences of food, fuel, and financial crises between 2008 and 2011, has been recently growing in the developing world, also triggered by the rapid sequences of food, fuel, financial crises between 2008 and 2011 . The G20 \u2018Seoul Development Consensus (2010)\u2019 identified growth with resilience as a key pillar, and put specific emphasis on social protection mechanisms that support resilient and inclusive growth . The African Union stated that social protection is a crucial piece of the development puzzle . The European Commission and seven EU countries published a report (\u2018European Report on Development (ERD) 2010\u2019, \u201cSocial Protection for inclusive Development\u201d), which reviewed the reasons for success and failure of new generation of social protection programmes and maintained that under a number of preconditions, social protection is possible and feasible even in low-income countries . As result of this timely and lively debate around social protection, a consensus is emerging that social protection itself is not only a right, but also an indispensable instrument in supporting progress towards achieving inclusive growth and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) . Social protection can then be seen as an investment and its positive externalities on other social policies can be exploited . An increasing number of recent publications (academic, policy briefs, etc .) provided evidence that social protection programmes can mitigate risks and reduce poverty and vulnerability without producing significant distortions or disincentives on labour supply . However, (a) implementation is crucial and requires adequate fiscal space, and (b) programmes need to be made sustainable through clear and enforceable criteria .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c4d195a-29bb-449e-8801-d6685ccf1359": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c4d195a-29bb-449e-8801-d6685ccf1359", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a6929101869132716c8aec65cd9451d7998569d953e385cccc287e040cd758d6"}, "2": {"node_id": "1be02a67-6e43-42ed-b697-5014aae5d24f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5eac34383b06e50888231e5269a4f9cf4bc1a4f3f0b2fe5359f462c9cae38a10"}}, "hash": "f27b61d3b2c84e12dcfbb622bc2710dfe95a8ec679be539a9eb9674c456069da", "text": "Hence, institutional and administrative 112 capacity must be adequate for programme design and implementation; programmes in turn are likely to be more effective if built on pilots and on community and household networks (a sort of crowding in rather than crowding out!) .

Chile Solidario was driven by the need to coordinate different programmes) . Moreover, conditionalities of a new generation of cash transfers may require the use of health and education facilities;: cash transfers increase the use of medical facilities, implying that they have to be available (as shown by many examples in Latin America show) . Also public works, mainly building infrastructures in rural areas, potentially supports the objectives of the agriculture and development ministries (even though in this case the available evidence is limited in this case) . Finally, political commitment (both domestically and of donors) is very important and has been the key to almost all successful schemes . Of course such conditions are not equally available in developing countries nor across continents . Heterogeneity is very large among different development contexts, so that specific programmes and implementations have to be devised to accommodate the heterogeneity in different development contexts . However, in most low-income countries, including much of Sub Saharan Africa, some simple programmes, exist\u2013 such as non-contributory social pensions or child benefits, \u2013exist and that are administratively feasible, particularly with technologically-innovative cash-delivery systems that avoid targeting errors, cut costs and speed up the delivery processes . These programmes can also be fiscally sustainable (the cost is not too high, as pointed out for instance by recent research on the social protection floor by ILO), and have only few, if any, negative incentive effects, if any . If this is the case, these programmes can garner broad political support and trigger a virtuous circle out of poverty . Over time, more complex administrative arrangements, including co-ordinated packages, can become feasible as countries accumulate experience and build up domestic resources . In the longer term, low income countries can build on the simple programmes to create a platform for social protection that consists of several co-ordinated programmes, depending on their particular needs and fiscal space (which of course should be improved) . Such a social-assistance-based platform of social protection schemes must be consistent with a strategy to move progressively to a system based predominantly on domestic financing\u2014 \u2013 either through the tax system, or some form of contributory social insurance, or, even better, systems combining the two . In any case, programmes or systems 113 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? cannot merely be replicated across countries and continents, but have to be adapted to local circumstances . As far as the UNDP is concerned, it is crucial to understand a country\u2019s specificity and the possible interactions and externalities between programmes rather than selecting a specific programme suitable for every situation . However, learning from existing experiences and from the positive spill-over effects of social protection measures, UNDP could provide support for some simple programmes (such as pension schemes, child benefits, health programmes and the like) and then build up from there . It could also be important for UNDP to support programmes that have been implemented, but have to be discontinued due to lack of funding could be important .

In doing so, it first points out some reasons why social protection lacks a uniform definition . The first reason for the difference in definition is related to the lack of agreement on the coverage or scope of social protection: whether it is to focus on its traditional role of social insurance and social assistance or take a broader view of sustained poverty reduction and human development through economic and social policy . The concept is diluted with the use of different terminologies by different agencies (for example, \u2018social protection\u2019, \u2018social security\u2019 and \u2018social safety nets\u2019 are used interchangeably, with agency-specific connotations) . Another reason for discrepancies in definitions has to do with differing context and priorities of developed and developing countries . The concept of social protection evolved from social security aimed to support people in developed countries who fail to earn income because of disability, old age, unemployment, 114 or imperfections in the labour market .

All these features together with a large concentration of the population living in rural areas (with diverse and diffused occupations) create further economic and administrative challenges for implementing social security measures in these countries . In addition, the implementation of short-term project-based poverty reduction measures together with perennial measures of social insurance policy, which generally cover the formal employment sector, creates confusion as to whether social protection is a short- or long-term measure . Many developing countries lack a comprehensive social protection policy altogether . Finally, social protection gets renewed focus with the risks and vulnerability growing over time . In order to address the impact of global crises of the last decade, an emphasis has been placed on social protection by UN agencies .104 Now social protection is being advanced as a new policy paradigm, with the prospect of attaining growth alongside protection of vulnerable and excluded groups . Social protection can help achieve growth differently through: \u2022\ufffd Consumption smoothing: it can help meet basic needs including food during economic crisis, thus smoothing consumption (keeping demand for goods and services in the economy constant in order to avoid recession) . \u2022\ufffd Multiplier or Keynesian effect: it encourages production through increased demand for commodities . The poor have a relatively higher marginal propensity to consume . \u2022\ufffd Sustaining human development outcomes: it can support parents to keep their children in school, and seek medical services even during the economic crisis . This leads to sustained human development outcomes . \u2022\ufffd Decreased dependence on foreign market: it can help build savings and assets of the poor and excluded groups, which encourages demand for local goods and services . 104 ILO and WHO, The Social Protection Floor: Joint Crisis Initiatives of the UN Chief Executive Board of Coordination on the Social Protection Floor (Geneva: October 2009) . 115 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? \u2022\ufffd Maintaining political and social stability: finally, social protection could help decrease the gap between rich and poor, thus maintaining stability .105 The concept of social protection is evolving over time even in a developing country context: from a more passionate supply-driven to a demand-driven approach incorporating a rights-based approach along with encouraging human agency, from short to longer term focus, and from the narrow confines of smoothing income and consumption during shocks to contributing to a more inclusive form of growth . In sum, social protection consists of all policy and programmes, which are part of development policy, which ensure inclusive growth and development and reduce vulnerability to risks . To what extent social protection can help protect the poor and vulnerable groups depends on the governance capacity and fiscal space . Some studies point out that political will is of greater significance than fiscal resources for effective coverage of social protection .106 However, both economics and politics are equally important to guarantee human rights, such as the right to food or work, which are enshrined in the constitution of several developing countries . While it remains a right in principle, the challenge is to ensure that it is properly enforced . Best regards, Bishwa Nath Tiwari, Deputy Programme Coordinator Human Development Report Unit UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Bangkok, Thailand G\u00f6ran Jonsson, UNDP Bangladesh Dear All: The rationale for social protection is to mitigate risks and address vulnerabilities . In short, it protects against the negative consequences of uninsured risks . Different vulnerabilities require different policy responses . However, when decomposing the vulnerability package it is easy to see that the social protection agenda often overlooks social dimensions of vulnerability .

Social protection seldom addresses the structural root causes of poverty . It has become an instrument to react to shocks contingent on specific events like cyclones, floods and spiralling food prices, more than proactive intervention to address or reform structures of social exclusion and discrimination . Social protection is considered to have three dimensions or roles: prevention, protection and promotion . In addition, it has also been acknowledged that social protection has a transformative potential; it can empower poor people and provide them an opportunity for greater participation and voice . It has potential to address social and political exclusion and economic marginalization . The transformative potential of social protection can actually go a long way in addressing the root causes of vulnerability; eradicating certain forms of social injustice can help reduce the need for social protection measures, such as social transfers . However, social transformation does not happen automatically . Social protection schemes require special attention to the design and implementation, particularly targeting of the poor and marginalized . Without these considerations, social transfer programmes could unintentionally reinforce the abuse of power and paternalistic patterns by supporting detrimental patron-client relationships . A transformative approach needs to achieve a positive change in such power relations . Strengthening the capacity of the poor to make demands and claim entitlements should be a central part of social protection . A need-based approach recognizes that poor households deserve assistance . In contrast, a rights-based approach recognizes that they are entitled to assistance . Crucially, poor people\u2019s choice of livelihood strategies, their willingness to take risks, the asset accumulation and other outcomes they can achieve through a combination of own agency and social transfers are heavily influenced by powerful external factors which constitute the vulnerability context . In determining benefit packages of programmes including a graduation trajectory, it is important to have a deep understanding of the vulnerability situation to address . Social protection can assist poor households to upgrade survival strategies to dynamic livelihood strategies, including a diversified livelihoods portfolio to spread the risks . Diversified livelihoods are a patent way for the poor to protect consumption, and programmes should enhance their skill base to make it possible for them to participate in the labour force at a higher level of the productivity scale\u2014with the government stepping in only as the employer of last resort when everything else has failed . Beneficiaries of social cash transfers often use these mechanisms to invest in productive activities and assets, thus setting a multiplier effect in motion . They feel more secure to take up more rewarding, but riskier activities if there are benefits from a social safety net (like predictable and regular transfers or savings 117 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? accumulated from earlier transfers) to fall back on . They also do not have to resort to damaging and often irreversible coping strategies, like distress sale of productive assets, if affected by shocks . However, it has to be realized that moving out of poverty is a cumulative process, which is most often achieved in tiny increments and with occasional setbacks in case of adversities . This results in a seesaw pattern of slow upward movement . In order to address structural poverty, it is crucial not to be blinded by the symptoms of extreme poverty, but to dig deeper to understand the underlying causes or triggers of poverty, and to drive in a counterattack aimed directly at these triggers . Illness is commonly observed as a driver of poverty; a specific measure like health, or at least hospitalization, insurance could drastically reduce the occurrence of chronic poverty . The economic and social dimensions of social protection are obviously intertwined . Social stigmatization makes it very difficult for some people to at all participate in the economic life of the local community . People can survive by living on the dole, it can even give a sense of uprightness to receive relief from government, but it is hardly adequate for a modern social protection agenda . Most vulnerable groups can be mainstreamed in the economy, with relief being only a temporary contingency measure . Social protection does not work in isolation from other policy instruments . Important preventive strategies that fall outside the purview of current social transfer policies include sound (inclusive) macro-economic policies, fiscal stimulus to counter global economic downturns, infrastructure development, and policies for delivery of basic services like health and education . There are also complementarities between social protection and policy instruments", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ab0330e-2a24-4240-9dd1-96532a4ffc6a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ab0330e-2a24-4240-9dd1-96532a4ffc6a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3351c7fcf4943a8091e7df604629972b72944f8dca7615791307c668c4bad899"}}, "hash": "3351c7fcf4943a8091e7df604629972b72944f8dca7615791307c668c4bad899", "text": "for productive sectors . Guaranteed purchase of principal crops at pre-announced minimum prices makes farmers less at the mercy of volatile farm gate prices and provides some security needed for farmers to take risks and plan ahead . Measures like better tenancy terms for tenant farmers and registration of ancestral lands of farmers belonging to ethnic minorities would promote productive investment for now very insecure farmers . It is important, in particular for the promotion or graduation aspect of social protection, to look at market integration: how to make markets work better for the poor . This includes looking at the poor as producers, suppliers of labour and consumers of basic services: three aspects where the market often fails to permit access or where the transaction costs for the poor are high . If beneficiaries of social transfer programmes cannot participate in markets that are inclusive, programme impact will not be sustainable . A major barrier preventing people from breaking out of poverty is not poverty itself but the problematic 118 environment in which poor people are forced to pursue their livelihoods . It, therefore, becomes important to level the playing field and make the poor better positioned and more capable to participate in market systems on equal terms and not as losers in perpetual need of social assistance . G\u00f6ran Jonsson, International Team Leader Rural Employment Opportunities for Public Assets \u2013 Capacity Strengthening Team UNDP Bangladesh Upendranadh Choragudi, ActionAid International Dear All: Social protection in developing countries has become popular in the context of increasing risks and vulnerabilities resulting from recent crises and shocks, including disasters, which have decreased security of employment, especially for those working in the informal sector . There are a variety of social protection programmes . They aim to address risks and shocks such as loss of employment, retrenchments, poor health, disability and work place accidents . Because the poor in most developing countries lack capabilities to secure livelihoods and avail themselves to social security benefits, a wider notion of social protection incorporates basic social security (capability- enhancing mechanisms) and contingency social security (mostly work-based security) . It is widely argued that social protection policies and programmes can contribute to poverty reduction and development gains . As the literature reveals social insurance, social assistance and social security form the core of social protection .107 The Social Protection in Asia (SPA) Research Program has identified conceptualization, vulnerability analysis, programme design, governance and institutional aspects as important factors for determining success of social protection initiatives .108 Political will and civil society also have important roles to play in sparking transformative109 change through social protection initiatives . 107 See www .socialprotectionasia .org . 108 See SPA Synthesis Report, available at www .socialprotectionasia .org . 109 Social protection programmes (design and implementation) are expected to be transformative in the sense that these programmes would create entitlements and sustainable livelihoods, and enhance social status of the recipients; would have potential to alter power imbalances including intra-household division of resource ownership and access; and would respect social and cultural values . 119 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? In several developing countries, social protection programmes are yet to be properly institutionalized, and comprehensive social protection systems are yet to take hold . Limited administrative capacities and ineffective governance structures are identified as major challenges in this respect . Moreover, there is a resource crunch; governments in the current climate are unable to domestically finance their social protection programmes . Transformative social protection As discussed above, social protection discourse addresses shocks, risks and vulnerabilities through schemes and programmes . Sometimes, outcomes of such policies and programmes can go beyond short-term healing and can catalyse positive changes in power relations . For example, India\u2019s public employment programme (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act [MNREGA]) not only offers employment for those who are unemployed, but also includes enablers of more long-term transformation110 . Public works projects, such as repairs of water bodies and development of barren and fallow land belonging to scheduled caste and tribe households, not only improve agricultural output, but also provide households with additional skills developed through employment on these projects . Other critical components of transformative social protection include the idea of universalism, citizenship-based entitlements, voice and representation, and transparency and accountability in the implementation of social protection schemes . The communities we work with in developing countries articulate the importance of these foundational features . Thus, social protection itself can potentially be part of the realization of economic, social and cultural rights . An important criterion for evaluating the success of a social protection programme should", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6bf7246-cade-463d-9b07-27767a3097b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6bf7246-cade-463d-9b07-27767a3097b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "652454e43ebb0597ccf9aacfe062d5c969554b6b30e7daddca2f4bb9f245c9c3"}}, "hash": "652454e43ebb0597ccf9aacfe062d5c969554b6b30e7daddca2f4bb9f245c9c3", "text": "be to measure the redistributive impact (i .e . to what extent social protection programmes are redistributive, rebalance the existing power relations, and/or empower communities and individuals to become more resilient) . Incorporating equity and justice into this paradigm becomes essential as the impact of social protection schemes may largely depend on power relations, elite capture and social discrimination . Social protection and development agenda Realization of development goals involves an appropriate policy mix in terms of development investments, as well as financing social protection schemes and programmes . Conditional cash transfers, which have education or healthcare 110 See working papers and reports of studies on MNREGA conducted as part of SPA research . Available at www .socialprotectionasia .org 120 requirements built into them, can aid in the realization of development goals . At the same time, essential development infrastructure (including provision/ delivery of basic social services) should be provided . It is essential that supply- side challenges and constraints are adequately addressed in the design phase of the programme so that programmes are able to achieve their stated objectives . The government\u2019s sectoral policies can also incorporate incentives (in cash or in kind) in order to induce positive behavioural change . For example, universal education policies can incorporate incentives like cash scholarships, meals, free books, and uniform . Such incentives may encourage parents to send their children to school . For social protection to really take hold it should be integrated as part of the social and economic policy agenda of the country through the respective economic planning ministry . This would also ensure that adequate resources are set aside for programmes that are designed to address essential needs . For example inclusive growth policies (employment augmenting) should be combined with specific social protection measures that further build resilience of the rural poor . Such joining-up of standard development efforts with more targeted social protection initiatives can create a positive multiplier effect . For a long time, social protection initiatives have been seen as residual and add- on programmes (often funded through external resources), separate from standard development programming . It is essential that social protection be mainstreamed as part of development planning . This would entail synchronizing social and economic policies with ideas of protection, as well as promotion . At the same time, social protection should not be seen as a replacement or alternative for development investments, including investments in education and health infrastructure . In the final analysis, social protection should supplement standard development efforts by the state . However, to achieve meaningful impact and sustainability, social protection should become a permanent feature of development budgeting and planning . Regards, Upendranadh Choragudi, Asia Coordinator Just and Democratic Governance ActionAid International Bangkok, Thailand 121 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? Julia Kercher, Shivani Nayyar and Claudia Vinay, Poverty Practice, UNDP Bureau of Development Policy Dear All: We would like to share some thoughts on two aspects of the discussion so far . Social protection and other development policies In terms of the relationship between social protection and development, it may be useful to see social protection as a means to achieve the objectives of social and other development policies more broadly, especially by making basic goods and services accessible to everyone . If the ultimate objective of social policies is to realize people\u2019s social rights, social policies need to ensure that services are available, accessible and of adequate quality (these are the three dimensions that the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has defined as the core content of economic, social and cultural rights agreed upon by 160 countries; see, for example, \u2018General Comment No .14 on the Right to Health\u2019) .111 Social protection can then be seen as a means to achieve specifically one of those objectives, namely the accessibility of basic goods and services . Social protection could thus be understood as a set of nationally owned policies and instruments that support access to basic goods and services by all households and individuals in situations of vulnerability . In some cases, vulnerability may be short term and social protection aims to ensure access while also preventing setbacks in long-term human development . In other cases, vulnerability can be chronic and social protection can build resilience in 111 Available on the Official Document Systems of the United Nations (ODS) available at http:// daccess-ods .un .org/access .nsf/Get?Open&DS=E/C .12/2000/4&Lang=E 122 order to prevent it from being passed on to the next generation . Lastly, vulnerability may be long-term, for instance for the elderly or persons with disabilities, and social protection can ensure access to social", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01c02549-7d7d-4a31-8111-2bcffc814d35": {"__data__": {"id_": "01c02549-7d7d-4a31-8111-2bcffc814d35", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c7e7d7f011d28aaa76f709a0245ad91498355f63a2798509dd29f8295273123b"}}, "hash": "c7e7d7f011d28aaa76f709a0245ad91498355f63a2798509dd29f8295273123b", "text": "services more continuously for those groups .112 In short, since there will always be people who cannot enter the labour market due to illness or disability, or who cannot go to school due to lack of resources or the involved opportunity cost, there will always be a need for social protection to ensure the effectiveness of other development policies . This also means that social protection policies should not exist on their own but should be part of a broader system of development policies . In our view, it would therefore be advantageous to consider these two policy areas as complementary rather than substitutes . This links to a very important point, which has been mentioned by other contributors: social protection should be conceived as a coherent set of services and interventions with proper linkages to other policies in the same sector and across policy areas . While the primary objective of social protection may be to ensure the accessibility of social services and other development interventions (see above), social protection may at the same time also facilitate the availability and quality of broader social services . For example, conditional cash transfer programmes can encourage complementary government action to ensure the availability of health and education services . This is a way to operationalize the complementarity between social protection and broader development and it is also a way to work towards universality in coverage . It also helps in avoiding duplication of objectives and coverage in certain populations and vulnerabilities while underserving others . A coherent system can have targeted interventions for the poorest that can enable this group of people to access other programmes and schemes of more general coverage . For example within Chile Solidario, a social protection programme in Chile, poor households are informed of other existing programmes that address different issues and are supported by social workers in accessing these benefits . The intentional links that other successful programmes have made to broader development objectives and policies have contributed to realizing the full potential of both these programmes and development objectives . Public works programmes, for example, can enable the development of community assets and preservation of natural resources . Financial trade-offs and progressive realization This well-integrated system has to be constructed at a speed and scale in accordance to the needs of each country, and accompanied by concerted development of financial, administrative and technical capacities . Through its counter\u2010cyclical nature, social protection expenditure provides a cushion against risk and shocks in individual incomes and aggregate demand . On the other hand, it also means it has to be activated when public revenues are under pressure . 112 For a similar distinction, see Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, A64/279 . 123 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? Whether a particular social protection intervention can or should be financed in the first place requires an assessment of its benefits and costs, relative to other options arriving at similar objectives . Once the benefits and costs have been carefully studied, fiscal space for social protection programmes needs to be created in ways that are sustainable . In practice, this would mean a combination of mobilizing additional resources (through taxes, grant financing or borrowing), reallocating expenditures across sectors (particularly freeing up resources being used inefficiently), and building up reserves in good financial times for social protection in bad times . However, the potential for reaching satisfactory levels of expenditure on social protection and thus to achieve universal coverage within public budgets may inherently be limited in low-income countries . Hagen\u2010Zancker and McCord examine the issue of financial capacity by comparing the totality of five African countries\u2019 recommended expenditure levels per internationally agreed targets in six key sectors\u2014social protection, health, education, agriculture, infrastructure, and water and sanitation\u2014to actual government expenditures .113 They find that in all but one case, the current size of the budget does not allow all of these 113 Jessica Hagen-Zanker and Anna McCord, \"The Affordability of Social Protection in the Light of International Spending Commitments\" (ODI Background Paper, March 2011) .

This is where the human rights concept of progressive realization becomes relevant; it constitutes a recognition of the fact that full realization of all economic, social and cultural rights will generally not be able to be achieved in a short period of time .

For example, in relation to the question regarding the inclusiveness of social protection, and in particular the debate between targeted and universal approaches, while universal coverage is desirable, reaching it might require different approaches given each country\u2019s vulnerabilities and needs . In this sense, one could be thinking in terms of a menu of programmes and mechanisms that respond to vulnerabilities faced by individuals and households at different stages of the life cycle and under different circumstances . This menu could include targeted interventions, when they make sense, while others are broader; the combination of these can amount to universal coverage . The concept of progressive realization allows for this as long as concrete steps are taken and progress is monitored and ensured to leads to increased equality rather than reinforcing discrimination . Targeting can therefore be a valid policy decision as long as certain qualifying principles are considered (see report of the Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, A64/279)114: eligibility criteria need to be fair, reasonable, objective and transparent, and mechanisms for redress in case of errors are necessary . To this end, social protection systems, especially targeted ones, need to be designed and implemented with the involvement of those who are supposed to benefit from them . Lack of information may lead to unfair exclusion and lack of transparency and accountability may easily expose social protection systems to corruption and manipulation, all of which increase the risk of neutralizing the benefits of targeting . With regard to discrimination, it is important to ensure that targeted schemes do not lead to the stigmatization of beneficiaries . With regards to gender, social protection policies and programmes that address vulnerabilities and risks related to the formal sector can exclude women and girls who are usually overrepresented in the informal sector . On the other hand, schemes that explicitly target or involve women may not automatically lead to transformative change in the lives of women, or more generally, to gender equality . For example, some programmes (such as conditional cash transfers or social pensions for elderly women taking care of children) target women, but only in their role as 114 Available on the Official Document Systems of the United Nations (ODS) available at http:// daccess-ods .un .org/access .nsf/Get?Open&DS=A/64/279&Lang=E 125 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? mothers or care-takers . This may reinforce women\u2019s traditional roles or overburden their already scarce time in complying with the requirements of the programme . There may well be benefits to these interventions; but from a gender empowerment perspective, it will be necessary to analyse and address power dynamics that may affect the impact of such programmes .

Public funds were also instituted to support poor children . This form of social protection was believed to be a means to maintain a certain living standard and address transient poverty . Social protection can be clustered under four main models . First, the Nordic model, which is rooted in the principle of citizenship, provides the social insurance with little or no conditionality . Unemployment is suppressed through rapid inclusion of the unemployed into the labour market . Second, the Continental model, rooted in the principle of security, provides pensions and invalidity subsidies . Here active labour market policies seem to be less important than in the Nordic model . Third, the Anglo-Saxon model, which is rooted in the principle of one\u2019s productivity, provides social assistance and subsidies to a greater extent to the working population, and pensions to a lesser extent . Hence, active labour market policies are of extreme importance . Fourth, the Mediterranean model is strongly based on pensions and to a lesser degree on social assistance . As to the labour market policies, legislation on employment protection is rigid and there is frequent resort to early retirement as a means to improve employment conditions . 115 Within the welfare state thinking, the state is responsible to provide welfare services to citizens because they form the core of people\u2019s rights that need to be fulfilled .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d20323a-eae9-4611-a304-f961f1167a9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d20323a-eae9-4611-a304-f961f1167a9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dcb48734444c8726acbfdf29b91e1b32965556c1b76b54b823c37dc224ace0b7"}}, "hash": "dcb48734444c8726acbfdf29b91e1b32965556c1b76b54b823c37dc224ace0b7", "text": "Welfare services can then be provided by corporations, government, individual or charity . 126 Today developing nations have also used social protection as a powerful policy tool to address issues of persistent poverty and inequalities, and also to target certain structural causes of vulnerability . What is Social Protection and why is it necessary? Social protection is a system with aimed to maintaining peoples\u2019 welfare without guaranteeing anything . It is not a panacea for welfare . It is meant to compensate for the absence of income or loss of income due to certain circumstances, such as illness, maternity, work-related accidents, physical and mental incapacity, aging, death and unemployment . There are four reasons for setting up a social protection system . First, it is a basic human right (see Articles 22 and 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights) . Second, it helps reduce hardships among families . Third, it generates economic activity by introducing money into the local economy, which in turn increases (internal) demands . Fourth, poverty among children affects their health status, reducing and impairing their productivity when they become adults . Most of the social protection schemes in the Asia-Pacific region follow this line of thinking per the International Labour Organization\u2019s (ILO) 102nd Convention . Types of Social Protection In general, there are three types of social protection interventions: labour market policies and scheme, social insurance schemes, and social assistance initiatives . \u2022\ufffd Labour Market Interventions: Labour market policies can potentially provide protection for those poor and vulnerable that are capable of gaining employment . Passive policies may alleviate financial burdens of unemployed people but may not necessarily improve their employability . Examples of these include unemployment insurance, income support and changes in labour legislation . Active policies seek to help people get absorbed by the labour market in order to help them overcome hardships resulting from unemployment or sudden loss of income . The main difficulty in implementing active labour market interventions has to do with extending coverage to include the informal economy, which is often a significant portion of the workforce in developing countries . \u2022\ufffd Social Insurance: Social insurance schemes are contributory programmes that protect beneficiaries from catastrophic expenses in exchange for regular payments of premiums . Health costs can be very high, so health insurance schemes are a popular way of reducing risk in the event of external shocks . However, an individual with low income may not be able to afford insurance . Community-based health insurance allows pooling in settings where institutional capacity is too weak to organize nationwide risk-pooling, especially in low-income countries, making insurance more affordable . In 127 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? risk-sharing schemes, the insurance premium is unrelated to the likelihood that the beneficiary will fall ill and benefits are provided on the basis of need . \u2022\ufffd Social Assistance: Social assistance schemes comprise programmes designed to help the most vulnerable individuals, households, and communities (i .e . those with no other means of support, such as single parent households, victims of natural disasters or civil conflict, handicapped people, or the destitute poor) to live a decent life . Social assistance is fundamentally a redistribution mechanism of income (funded through taxation or national revenues) . Social assistance interventions may include provision of welfare and social services to groups of people with physical or mental disability, orphans, or substance abusers; cash or in-kind transfers (e .g . food stamps and family allowances); and temporary subsidies (e .g . life-line tariffs, housing subsidies, or support of lower prices of staple food) in times of crisis . Informed policy and decision makers will have to carefully consider whether there is political support for such social protection schemes, administrative capacity of the government to implement them, and commitment to ensure financial sustainability so that schemes are effective and efficient . Regards, Rui Gomes, Programme Specialist UNDP Timor-Leste Roula Koudsi, UNDP Syria Dear All: I\u2019d like to discuss the poverty situation in Syria and also briefly go over what the government intends to do in the near future vis-\u00e0-vis social protection . While development is improving people\u2019s lives by increasing their choices and opportunities, social protection starts by providing basic needs to the ultra-poor and moves towards ensuring sustainable human development . The ultra-poor who live below the lower poverty line, and cannot cover their basic food and non-food needs, cannot be targeted with development programmes before securing their basic needs . This group of the population may be classified in two categories: (a) the vulnerable ultra-poor not able to work, and (b) the ultra-poor able", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "190fcdd1-45d5-4bbe-8721-869ae990aa6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "190fcdd1-45d5-4bbe-8721-869ae990aa6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ensuring Inclusion: e-Discussion on Social Protection", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ensuring-inclusion-e-discussion-social-protection", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce7b6ecf35a2edc4a5ae377acc8d4d26f17ed2a334f293b84abb1fa403448ef4"}}, "hash": "ce7b6ecf35a2edc4a5ae377acc8d4d26f17ed2a334f293b84abb1fa403448ef4", "text": "to work if they are offered suitable assistance . 128 Poor that fall under this first category need to be targeted through a proper mechanism that provides subsidies and cash assistance to help them secure their basic needs . This mechanism may take the form of cash transfers through a national social welfare fund . Statistics and surveys that estimate poverty can help identify such groups . In addition to this, the State needs to ensure the provision of basic services such as drinking water, health-care, sanitation, roads and schools . The second category of persons can be targeted by development programmes combined with better provision of basic services . Those programmes can be planned through an integrated community development approach, which ensures sustainability and real change in poverty . These concepts help to frame the poverty situation in Syria . The recent UNDP poverty study116 provides detailed information about poverty in Syria, including its geographical distribution . In 2004, about 2 .2 million people (11 .4 percent of the population) lived under the lower poverty line, meaning they could not satisfy their basic food and non-food needs . However, this statistic masks the following important details: 1 . Poverty appears to be more of a rural phenomenon than an urban one, with poverty incidence in rural areas 1 .55 to 1 .96 times higher than in urban areas . 2 . Poverty is strongly concentrated in one region of the country, the North- East, which hosts less than 45 percent of the population but 58 percent of the poor . In addition, this region exhibits the highest level of inequality . The middle and coastal regions also have significant concentrations of poverty . Finally, the southern urban region is relatively more affluent; yet, even within this region, there are pockets of poverty developing in unauthorized settlements around cities, such as Damascus . 3 . While overall poverty decreased in Syria between 1997 and 2004, the rural southern and urban coastal parts benefited from the most positive pattern in term of poverty reduction; there was an increase in per capita expenditures combined with an improved income distribution . All urban regions, except the coastal ones, experienced an intermediate pattern, with the positive impact of per capita expenditures\u2019 increase being hampered by a worsening income distribution . Finally, the rural North- eastern region displayed the worst pattern: poverty level increased as expenditure per capita decreased, and income distribution worsened . 116 Heba El Laithy and Khalid Abu-Ismail, Poverty in Syria: 1996 \u2013 2004: Diagnosis and Pro-Poor Policy Consideration (UNDP, April 2005) . 129 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? Main characteristics of the poor Education: There is a very high correlation between education and poverty in Syria . The great majority of the poor (81 percent) have only a primary level of education or no education at all . Eighteen percent of the poor are illiterate, and poverty is the most severe within this group . Health, including reproductive health: \u2018The Household Income and Expenditure Survey\u2019, 2003-2004 reveals that only three quarters of the rural population are within 5 kilometres (km) to health units and hospitals . Maternal mortality ratio has significantly dropped from 134 per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 57 .4 in 2004; however, wide disparities exist, from 34 .3 in Damascus to 81 in Al-Raqqa governorate in the eastern region . In rural areas, 50 .8 percentof the birth deliveries were at home, out of which only 30 .9 percent were supervised by a traditional birth attendant . 123RF 130 Employment, unemployment and underemployment: In general, the participation rate of the poor is relatively inferior to the non-poor, particularly in urban areas (the ratio reaches 37 .5 percent and 39 .5 percent for rural and urban areas, respectively) . When they work, the poor are more often engaged in irregular or seasonal activities . The number of persons among the poor holding more permanent or secure employment is significantly lower in comparison to the non-poor: the difference is 15 percentage points for urban areas, and 12 percentage points for rural areas . Economic sector and employment status: At the national and regional levels, poverty is highest among workers in the informal private sector and lowest among public sector employees . Sector-wise, the poor are over-represented at the national level in agriculture and construction, and to some extent in the manufacturing industries; all these sectors pay relatively low wages . About 38 .3 percent of poor are engaged in agriculture; poverty incidence is highest in this sector .

Fifty-three percent of the poor live in households with more than three children, and 44 percent of families comprise seven to nine persons . The fertility rate remains high, but has declined from 5 .1 during 1991-1995 to 3 .6 in 2004 . Social Protection and other measures in Syria Subsidies still constitute one of the main pillars of the Syrian social protection system . On an annual basis, $3 .8 billion (14 percent of GDP in 2005) are devoted to maintain the price of energy (oil, petroleum derivate products, gas and electricity) and basic food products . To increase the welfare impact, the Government is considering their removal in favour of cash and in-kind transfers (similar to Iran) . While different scenarios for lifting subsidies are still under discussion, the idea of establishing a Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) is well accepted . The tenth five- year plan call for establishing an SWF that aims to lower the poverty incidence by one-forth (i .e . by 2 .85 percent points) . The SWF is likely to be used as an emergency fund targeting the ultra-poor, especially those that are unable to work (aged, disabled, orphans, widowed and divorced females head of households) . The five-year plan also mentions establishing the Development Wakf Fund . 131 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? In the category of risk mitigation, the most important instrument at the disposal of the Ministry of Social Affairs is the Social Insurance Establishment, responsible for three distinct funds: a pension, a work accident insurance and a death insurance fund . Despite it being offered to workers in both the public and private sectors, only 27 .7 percent of the employees benefited from social security and pension funds in 2004 due to various administrative bottlenecks . Poverty alleviation is considered to be the top priority of the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2006 \u2013 2010) . Chapter six of the Plan, entitled \u2018Inter-Sectoral Common Issues\u2019, adopts the following five objectives: 1 . Link the macroeconomic policies to poverty reduction and social cost; 2 . Expand investment in human development sectors and increase opportunities of the poor to access the social and financial resources; 3 . Expand economic opportunities of the poor and the underdeveloped regions through targeting programmes and projects, paying special attention to the North-Eastern region; 4 . Increase the coverage and accessibility of the poor to social protection programmes by expanding their inclusion process and setting up suitable social safety nets; and 5 . Increase the capacity and empowerment of the poor and enhance their community organizations . 6 . Beyond this, the plan also mentions increasing the coverage of the poor with social protection programmes and through expansion of social safety nets (in relation to Objective 4) . Also, adoption of a direct cash subsidy or transfer system that targets the vulnerable ultra-poor (after revising the present subsidy policy) and implements emergency programmes is to become the core of a forthcoming social security system . Specifically, they intend to target those that are unable to work (due to chronic illness, disability and old age or due to social reasons such as widowhood or divorce), under-age children, orphans and disabled .117 Regards, Roula Koudsi, Programme Officer Social Development Team UNDP Syria 117 10th 5 Year Plan, Arabic version, pp 167, 170 and 223 . 132 Henry Jackelen and Subathirai Sivakumaran, Private Sector Division, UNDP Partnership Bureau Dear All: We would like to discuss emergency cash transfers . Regarding what constitutes social protection and how can (or should) it be distinguished from general development efforts, we propose the following . Social protection cash transfers have had a long and varied history . The issue of relief payments in the realm of emergencies and how these can be linked to longer-term social protection programmes is an interesting issue for us . While sustainability of social protection is the ideal goal to reach, the reality of many social protection programmes is that they are contingent on funding, political will and a number of other supply-side, as well as demand-side, issues . In this way, they are not very different from significantly long-term (more than a year) emergency cash transfer programmes whose objectives are similar (in reducing vulnerability for the poorest, ensuring access to basic human rights and in smoothing consumption) . Yet, both governments and donors insist on treating these two areas differently: in terms of funding, programme design, implementation and monitoring .

In that context, understanding the purpose of cash transfer programmes is important . The purpose of most programmes is to ensure basic food security, though more experimentation is being done now to ensure tenure security, education access and wealth accumulation . Government agencies work with relief agencies to ensure logistical access and cooperation; but little coordination is achieved (in the later stages of the emergency; not even the initial stages) between welfare ministries and relief departments, let alone finance departments . We do not propose to add an intensive administrative burden during the already overstretched times of an emergency; however, pre-emptive framework planning, especially in countries that are prone to repeated disasters or prolonged conflict, can help to integrate relief agencies and government ministries into the specific area of cash transfers, in order to achieve sustainability and bridge the gap between relief and early recovery . UNDP has recently conducted research on this topic in the area of Haiti where UNDP is leading 12 NGOs in the Early Recovery cluster . A draft report entitled \u2018Lessons Learned from Cash Transfers in Haiti\u2019 examines the lessons learned in disbursing cash transfers as part of humanitarian protection and specifically looks at private sector involvement in emergency cash transfers . This report will 133 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? serve as a basis for continuing programming in Haiti by the community in 2012 . In addition, the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries in Istanbul in May 2011 featured the launch of a joint Bureau on Crisis Prevention and Recovery (BCPR)-Partnerships Bureau (PB) publication, \u2018From Emergency to Recovery: Partnering with Financial Service Providers in Emergency Cash Transfers\u2019, which examined many of these issues from a global perspective . Both the primer and a draft of the first part of the report can be obtained by contacting owen .shumba@undp .org or Sahba .sobhani@undp .org . Government-to-persons payment and the potential of payment mechanisms in introducing financial inclusion . On a separate note, there has been significant research and exciting innovations in leveraging traditional social protection cash transfer programmes to also include financial inclusion for the poor (through access to accounts and access to saving methods; whether it is through formal bank accounts, electronic debit cards, mobile accounts or other forms) . Such payment methods are already revolutionizing much of the world of traditional banking; and by employing them in social protection cash transfers, the potential to include vast numbers of the poor into the formal economy is huge . Of course, concomitant advances need to be made in the areas of agent banking, furthering low cost transactional methods, and identity and fraud protection; but these advances are already being made, and should be exploited to their full potential in the developing markets of the poor . In order to achieve the fullest impact from both social protection and development programmes, traditional silo approaches should no longer be employed; rather, an emphasis should be placed on leveraging multiple existing programmes and policies in an era of diminishing fiscal ability . We would also note that cash transfers, regardless of underlying purpose, can prove to be high risk and poor policy options if the interface between recipient and provider is not carefully designed . Unintended consequences of civil servants distributing physical cash include fostering dependency and opportunities for corruption . For these reasons we would argue that as much effort as possible be given to at least providing the stipend via a pre-paid/debit/ ATM card . While this does not resolve all the issues raised, it does allow for transparency and recipient privacy . In this area UNDP has also established partnerships with the New America Foundation, Ford Foundation and Citi Foundation, which launched an inaugural Savings and Conditional Cash Transfers Colloquium last year in November 2010 . The colloquium seeks to investigate the particular strand of how conditional cash transfers can lead to savings, focusing on how recipients can be incentivized to accumulate wealth . 134 The report from the colloquium was jointly published recently, as \u2018Savings Linked Conditional Cash Transfers: Lessons, Challenges and Directions\u2019118 . In tandem with this partnership and conference, UNDP, together with New America Foundation119, also published an advocacy white paper, called a \u2018Third Way for Official Development Assistance: Savings and Conditional Cash Transfers\u2019 .

Such challenges can keep the poor and marginalized vulnerable for a very long time, even with social protection floors in place . Without explicit linkages to broader social and economic development policies, social protection instruments cannot provide a comprehensive response to these structural issues, despite being well designed, well funded and well targeted . \u2022\ufffd Addressing the supply side is just as important as responding to demand: In the push for largely need-based interventions, sufficient attention has not been paid to the supply-side issues and constraints, especially the provision of basic social services (e .g . health and education) to meet the demand . Sometimes, overcoming the supply side issues becomes the main purpose of a social protection scheme; but, the basic supply needs to be part of broader development . Bringing it under social protection may not be fiscally sustainable . \u2022\ufffd Caution about cash: While cash transfers (conditional or unconditional) could provide a good option, they may not work in many specific situations in the Asia-Pacific, where basic social services are inadequate . Provision of cash may be an easy way out for governments, but cannot address the issues of accessibility, affordability, acceptability and availability . There are no substitutes for supply . \u2022\ufffd Sustaining social protection: Fiscal sustainability requires close attention . There are lessons from the recent fiscal turmoil in many developed countries . And it is not just the cost and financing of social protection . The better the provision, quality and coverage of regular basic social services, the less there is a need for social protection interventions (less pressure on fiscal space for additional protection measures) . \u2022\ufffd Disadvantage is dynamic: The concept of \u2018graduation\u2019 out of eligibility needs to be considered as conditions and options of targeted beneficiaries improve . This will minimize elite capture and allow next batches of the vulnerable and disadvantaged to enter into the social protection programmes . \u2022\ufffd Money matters; monitoring budget share: Everything good is not social protection, even though there is a trend to include a wide range of development measures under social protection . Without this clarity, calculating percent share of budgetary expenditure on social protection may produce questionable or non-comparable results .

Should monitoring of social protection go hand-in- hand with monitoring social services, since better provisioning of the latter 136 can reduce the need for special schemes? To be clear about what constitutes social protection, can we establish what it is not? It may be useful to see social protection as means, one among others, to achieve the objectives of development policies, with its focus being on making basic goods and services accessible to all, i .e . bringing down barriers to access. Barriers to access include economic obstacles (affordability), but also structural, transient or long-term barriers .

This may be a meaningful and practical way of responding to all the points above . Best regards, Anuradha Rajivan, Practice Team Leader; and Ryce Chanchai, Programme Analyst Inclusive Growth and Poverty Reduction UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Bangkok, Thailand Qimti Paienjton, UNICEF East Asia and the Pacific Regional Office Dear All: As has been noted by several of us already, the relationship between social protection and broader development is characterized by significant overlap . It has also been noted that one can promote the other (i .e . social protection can promote broader development objectives) and vice versa . Furthermore, the answer to \u2018what constitutes social protection?\u2019 varies depending on whether one views social protection as a policy instrument or policy paradigm; while it can be both, considering it as one or the other when addressing the question is likely necessary in order to reach a meaningful conclusion . I share here a few thoughts that may be of relevance to the question and the discussion that has ensued . If viewed as a policy paradigm, social protection entails ensuring that everyone has access to essential social services (e .g . health and education) and minimum income security . This requires policy instruments and mechanisms that cater to the rights and needs of those who have been excluded or marginalized from broader development, as well as policy instruments and mechanisms to address specific risks and vulnerabilities that people may face at different stages in their life (age-specific vulnerabilities) and due to external shocks and circumstances (such as natural disasters, conflicts and economic crises) . 137 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? In order to achieve effective social protection, action is needed at various levels and on different fronts . On the policy side, action is needed to ensure that availability and quality of essential social services are adequate in addition to the availability of social assistance, social insurance and other measures that help to improve accessibility of these services . Action is also needed in the form of legislation . Anti-discrimination laws can go a long way in addressing exclusion faced by various population subgroups (women, people living with HIV/AIDS, people with disabilities, ethnic minorities, migrants, etc .) . All these actions contribute to the realization of effective social protection, whether we consider them as constituting social protection or not . Finally, as proponents of a human rights-based approach, we must be careful not to discredit ourselves by making inappropriate claims . There is no legal basis for the claim that social protection is a right . A right to social protection is not enshrined in either the Universal Declaration on Human Rights or in the Convention on the Rights of the Child . Social security is a right in itself . But social security does not equal social protection; it is narrower and therefore merely a component of social protection . That social protection is not a right per se does not make it any less important . Social protection, by addressing the needs of those whose rights are not met, is an extremely useful policy tool to ensure universal realization of basic rights . Best regards, Qimti Paienjton, Consultant Social Policy and Economic Analysis UNICEF East Asia and the Pacific Regional Office Bangkok, Thailand Katja Hujo, United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) Dear All: Thank you very much for this interesting online debate on social protection in Asia and beyond . As other colleagues have already pointed out in this forum, social protection policies are increasingly perceived as very useful instruments to foster development and human well-being and to mitigate the negative impact of economic crisis, natural disasters and environmental change . On the other hand, there is an ongoing and sometimes contested debate on best practices, underlying principles and strategies, long-term and short-term goals, integration of social protection policies into broader policy frameworks, impact measurement, and sustainability of systems . 138 I would like to respond to the main question of this second part of the online debate on how we can distinguish social protection policies from general development policies of the State, and also provide some general thoughts on how to move the debate further . Social protection is an important part of development policy, but not every policy that promotes development with potentially beneficial effects for the broader population is a social protection policy .

In the previous contribution to the e-Discussion, Barrientos has put forward a convincing distinction between approaches that are based on the experience of the more developed welfare states (what he labels the social policy / public finance approach) with the traditional classification of social insurance, social assistance and labour market policies, and development approaches that place greater emphasis on poverty reduction and aspects of promotion . Social protection, as the term implies, protects individuals and households against income loss due to lifecycle contingencies or market risks and also tackles permanently low incomes in the case of marginalized and excluded population groups . This happens usually in the form of cash transfers or in-kind assistance, such as food . Social protection defined as income transfers is therefore one pillar of social policy, with social services, such as education, health, care, water and sanitation, and housing, constituting the second main pillar . Based partly on findings emerging from UNRISD research on combating poverty and inequality122 and subsequent discussions on the report, the following issues invite further thinking: \u2022\ufffd How can we design and implement social policy systems which are transformative,123 contributing more effectively to economic production, redistribution, social reproduction, protection, democratization and equality? \u2022\ufffd How can we move towards universal systems that create the kind of inter- linkages between social classes, generations, gender, ethnic and regional groups that are conducive to greater social cohesion and sustainability of policies? \u2022\ufffd How can we link contributory and non-contributory programmes in order to avoid adverse incentives and to contribute to both, increased formalization 122 UNRISD, Combating Poverty and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy and Politics (Geneva: United Nations Research Institute for Social Development, 2010) . 123 UNRISD, Transformative Social Policy: Lessons from UNRISD Research (Geneva: Research and Policy Brief No . 5, 2006) . 139 Part 2: What Constitutes Social Protection? of the economy and extension of social rights for those that have been excluded in the past? \u2022\ufffd How can we move beyond fragmented projects and programmes that stabilize minimum living standards and achieve the meaningful participation of the poor in processes of growth (social mobility)? \u2022\ufffd How can we understand what drives reforms and how progressive social change evolves in different country contexts? \u2022\ufffd How can we design rights-based social policies that effectively empower citizens (and other residents such as migrants) and foster broad-based participation? \u2022\ufffd How can we fund social policies in a sustainable way, making sure that financing policies are equitable and contributing to redistributive goals? \u2022\ufffd How can we integrate social policies and social objectives into national development strategies and macroeconomic frameworks in order to produce positive synergies between social and economic goals?

This diversity of contributions made the discussion truly global in nature and provided a platform for sharing and exchanging knowledge across all regions . The contributions were rich and broadened our understanding of social protection in terms of policies and programmes. The lessons and experiences that emerged from the e-discussions were shared with 18 UNDP country offices as well as other UN agency staff at a recent Community of Practice meeting held in October 2011 by the Inclusive Growth and Poverty Reduction Team in Bangkok . The cross-regional experiences shared through the discussion also enriched our regional UN Development Group (UNDG) meeting on social protection . In addition to advancing understanding and fostering an exchange of experiences, the e-discussion was invaluable in enriching the debate on the practical implications of social protection . It also created opportunities for collaboration among UNDP staff at the global, regional and country levels; development practitioners from different UN agencies; civil society, academics and experts . These partnerships will hopefully spur the necessary actions in promoting effective social protection initiatives in the Asia-Pacific region . The e-discussion responses are available on the UNDP Teamworks at https:// undp .unteamworks .org/node/124146 .

About This Handbook The idea for this resource emerged from the Asia-Pacific Regional Workshop on the Protection and Promotion of Women\u2019s Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that was conducted by Equitas and the Commission on Human Rights (Philippines) in January 2006 in partnership with the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Commonwealth Secretariat. Participants from fourteen Asia Pacific national Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights viii human rights institutions, along with international resource persons from the Philippines, Venezuela and Sri Lanka, suggested that a handbook of this kind was needed to provide national human rights institutions with tools they needed to address women\u2019s equality through economic, social and cultural rights.

As the project developed, however, we recognized its potential as a resource for national human rights institutions anywhere in the world, and we added case studies and examples from Africa, North America and Europe. Why a handbook? There are already many excellent resources available on women\u2019s rights, as well as on economic, social and cultural rights, and on national human rights institutions. But there does appear to be a gap in resources that address the intersection of all three areas. This Handbook is intended to help fill the gap by offering a specific tool for national human rights institutions to enhance their work in protecting and promoting women\u2019s equality through economic, social and cultural rights. This Handbook is intended to complement rather than duplicate existing resources. It is not a legal treatise on equality law or economic, social and cultural rights: there are many excellent academic, international and NGO resources available on these matters. With respect to relevant handbooks already in existence, we draw the reader\u2019s attention to the UN Office of the High Commission for Human Rights 2005 Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: Handbook for National Human Rights Institutions,1 and to Equitas\u2019 2006 training manual National Institutions at Work: Asia-Pacific Regional Workshop on Women\u2019s Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 2 which are both available online. Several international organizations work, at least in part, in the intersection between national human rights institutions on the one hand, and economic, social and cultural rights and women\u2019s rights on the other. The \u201cbest practice\u201d series and reports of the Commonwealth Secretariat,3 the British Council\u2019s \u201cGender\u201d, and \u201cLaw and Human Rights\u201d publications and the \u201cOur Rights Are Not Optional\u201d publication by International Women\u2019s Rights Action Watch (IWRAW) Asia Pacific on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) are among the many valuable resources that are available online.4 Throughout, we have tried to minimize jargon and acronyms. However, acronyms, abbreviations and certain more technical terms have become very common in the area of human rights, and in the international context in particular. We offer several tips and tools to assist the reader: \ufffd Common acronyms are spelled out in full at the beginning of each Module and are explained in a glossary (Appendix 1). \ufffd Words that require further explanation are identified in bold the first time they appear in a module and are also explained in the glossary. About this Handbook Equitas ix A. Who This Handbook Is Intended for This Handbook is primarily for staff and members of national human rights institutions (NHRIs). By NHRIs we mean: \ufffd Human rights commissions at the regional, national and sub-national levels \ufffd Ombudsman offices, public defenders and public protection offices that have human rights mandates5 \ufffd International, regional and national associations of national human rights institutions In addition, organizations that work with NHRIs will find this resource useful as a way to enhance organizational development, capacity building and collaboration with NHRIs. For example, the UN and its specialized agencies are often partners in capacity building and other programs to support and develop NHRI effectiveness. Other bodies, such as the Commonwealth Secretariat, the British Council, La Francophonie, the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions (APF), the Network of African National Human Rights Institutions, the Raoul Wallenberg Institute, the Danish Institute for Human Rights, the International Service for Human Rights, the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights, the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, the International Ombudsman Institute and other leading international and regional organizations, also perform these roles and have various levels of engagement with NHRIs, women\u2019s equality and economic, social and cultural rights. As well, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) work at many levels with NHRIs and may also have an interest in this resource. Finally, Government is a vital partner for NHRIs and is the primary deliverer of basic social services on which women\u2019s equality rights depend, as well as being a respondent to human rights complaints. In addition, other national institutions (gender commissions and children\u2019s ombudsmen, for example) and independent agencies whose mandates are closely linked to NHRIs may also benefit from these materials.

In the course of their work, NHRIs struggle with basic questions about their own mandates, how to set priorities and how to address the particular challenges that are involved in equality rights and ESC rights. This Handbook attempts to help NHRIs get better at answering these questions by providing tools and information about how institutions around the world are tackling these complex challenges. C. Organization of the Handbook This Handbook is divided into six modules. The modules are structured so that readers should be able to read and understand a module that is relevant to their needs without necessarily having to read the preceding ones. While this makes a certain amount of repetition inevitable, we have tried to minimize this through cross-referencing and referring the reader to other resources provided throughout the Handbook and the Appendices. Module 1 \u2013 Positioning the Issues introduces the key concepts dealt with in the handbook and examines an ESC-related rights scenario in a developing country. The case study on housing rights and forced evictions illustrates how an NHRI might be best structured to handle the issue, and goes on to look at investigation, monitoring and other possible strategies to protect women\u2019s equality through ESC rights. It also looks at how an institution might use the case in advising its Government on remedying the rights violations, as well as at various strategies to promote the human rights raised in the case in various sectors of society. The case study is included at the beginning of this handbook to illustrate the potential of NHRIs in the area of women\u2019s ESC rights and to provide readers with an overview of the overall content of the handbook. Modules 2 and 3 contain important background information about the history and evolution of equality rights and women\u2019s ESC rights, as well as the legal groundwork on which they all rest. Module 2 \u2013 Equality, Development, and Rights \u2013 Making the Connections, serves to place women\u2019s ESC rights in context. Starting with the evolution of these rights, it discusses the particular challenge of cultural rights, the relationship between ESC rights, About this Handbook Equitas xi equality, good governance and development and, finally, women\u2019s security. Section 1 also introduces concepts like \u201csex discrimination\u201d, \u201cgender discrimination\u201d and \u201csubstantive equality\u201d, from the particular perspective of national human rights institutions. Module 3 \u2013 The Legal Framework, sets out the legal framework that applies to NHRIs in general, and in relation to women\u2019s equality and ESC rights in particular. It starts with the NHRIs themselves, and the enabling legislation that gives NHRIs the legal power to promote and protect human rights. It also sets out the basic legal rights and obligations that flow from international law and Treaty bodies, and national constitutions. Section 2 also canvasses key principles that have developed to guide and inform the development of women\u2019s equality and ESC rights by NHRIs. Modules 4, 5 and 6 outline how NHRIs work and how they carry out their functions to strengthen women\u2019s equality and ESC rights. Module 4 \u2013 Organizing NHRIs to Achieve Women\u2019s ESC Rights, examines how NHRIs can enhance women\u2019s equality through ESC rights by developing appropriate internal organizational structures and systems, policies, and planning tools. Strategies discussed include strategic planning, \u201cmainstreaming\u201d gender issues into organizational activities, creating institutional areas dedicated to women\u2019s issues within the organization (special units, for example) and the use of specialized research projects.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b9ed3276-8ca6-47e0-ada2-8b64c00d9383": {"__data__": {"id_": "b9ed3276-8ca6-47e0-ada2-8b64c00d9383", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9da985f277385ad5b2faf34e1e19c446afff8388a3d5ed79637505895a12959f"}, "2": {"node_id": "5aee79ad-9342-4318-bb69-613a1c3c57a9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2616804851da34f9d341d80108bd959204421ed3f26f4f46a2d195207491913"}}, "hash": "312fbd80d999f464fa30214d1510f36c1d533c0e04f46d0e2f421cf92eea7bc5", "text": "Module 5 \u2013 The Protection Mandate \u2013 Complaints Handling, Investigation and Monitoring, examines how NHRIs can protect women\u2019s equality rights through ESC rights.

Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 2 Module 1 Introduction National human rights institutions (NHRIs) are expected to have broad mandates as well as the necessary powers and resources to effectively protect and promote human rights6. International experience has shown that NHRIs face unique challenges in living up to this expectation. They may encounter limitations on their mandate or powers resulting from their founding statutes, a shortage of human and financial resources, or constraints arising from the social and political environment in which they function. Therefore, out of necessity, NHRIs are compelled to make strategic choices about how to focus their efforts to ensure that they are having the desired impact. This Handbook argues that these choices must ensure that gender equality is in the forefront of their considerations, particularly as the NHRIs address economic, social and cultural rights (ESC) rights. However, a commitment to gender equality is not enough to ensure effective protection and promotion of women\u2019s ESC rights. NHRIs must also ensure that they have the capacity to: \ufffd Understand and apply the appropriate international, regional and/or domestic legal framework to the situation \ufffd Develop effective internal systems, procedures and plans to address women\u2019s ESC rights \ufffd Identify the most effective and appropriate strategies to address particular issues Module 1 provides an overview of some of the key content included in subsequent modules. It is intended as an introduction for those who will be reading through the entire Handbook or as a practical summary that will give a reader a sense of the possibilities for NHRI action. The Module identifies some key concepts related to women\u2019s ESC rights, some of the challenges facing NHRIs as well as the different types of strategies that can be adopted. A case study on housing rights and forced evictions illustrates how an NHRI might put these tools to use in practice in its efforts to ensure the equal enjoyment of ESC rights. Key Concepts This Handbook emphasizes two main ideas: \ufffd Economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights are essential to equality for women \ufffd NHRIs have a fundamental role in connecting ESC rights to equality There has been growing recognition of the importance of ESC rights as interdependent and indivisible from other human rights. No longer the \u201cpoor cousins\u201d of civil and political rights, ESC rights are increasingly understood as Module 1: Positioning the Issues Equitas 3 Module 1 Human Rights Watch, Women\u2019s Rights Division \u201cAbuses against women are relentless, systematic, and widely tolerated, if not explicitly condoned. Violence and discrimination against women are global social epidemics, notwithstanding the very real progress of the international women's human rights movement in identifying, raising awareness about, and challenging impunity for women's human rights violations.\u201d http://www.hrw.org/women/. inextricably linked to human well-being and development. Moreover, while the acceptance of this idea has not always been universal, this Handbook asserts that a rights-based approach transforms ESC rights from positive aspirations to State obligations that can be enforced. In practice, making ESC rights a reality presents significant challenges for NHRIs. First, the legal context is complex. Do NHRIs have jurisdiction? How do they know what the legal basis for their actions should be? The answers are not always simple. In addition to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), many other human rights instruments are relevant to this area. Thus, the Handbook reviews the various applicable legal sources that are relevant for women\u2019s equality and ESC rights. The promotion and protection of women\u2019s equal enjoyment of ESC rights present unique and specific challenges. Women experience particular and severe forms of discrimination \u2014 including system-wide forms of discrimination. These forces combine to create a context of social beliefs, legal regimes, and economic structures that subordinate women to men in many countries, cultures and communities around the world. As a result, women\u2019s equality cannot be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fcf21689-6ae5-4e9d-8d92-fb039cd97854": {"__data__": {"id_": "fcf21689-6ae5-4e9d-8d92-fb039cd97854", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7aeeb2cc9884c821b2be2d43ba0b531599c87f1d84a7dd9c9c9e80d63df1a991"}}, "hash": "7aeeb2cc9884c821b2be2d43ba0b531599c87f1d84a7dd9c9c9e80d63df1a991", "text": "understood outside the context in which women live. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), and many other international instruments form a group of rights that support the achievement of equality for women. They include such rights as the right to an adequate standard of living (housing, adequate food, shelter); the right to health; and the right to education, to name a few. This group of rights presents several unique challenges in relation to women because of the particular way in which women\u2019s rights are embedded in historical, social economic and cultural contexts. Cultural rights create particular challenges, but also offer opportunities for NHRIs working locally. In their efforts to promote and protect women\u2019s ESC rights, NHRIs should look beyond formal equality to ensure that equality contains a substantive meaning. Gender-neutral laws and policies can perpetuate sex inequality because they do not take into account the economic and social disadvantage of women; they may therefore simply maintain the status quo. Whether the measures taken to protect rights are adequate \u201cmust always be assessed against the background of women\u2019s actual conditions, and evaluated in the light of the effects of policies, laws and Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 4 Module 1 practices on those conditions.\u201d7 (Adapted from principle 9 of the Montreal Principles) By examining more closely the basic concepts linked to women\u2019s ESC rights \u2013 notably discrimination, equality, intersectionality and temporary special measures \u2013 it becomes easier to identify not only what these concepts mean, but how NHRIs can be more effective in using them to enhance the quality of life for women and girls. The Challenges The complexity of women\u2019s ESC rights may not be readily apparent to an NHRI when investigating single incidents of human rights violations. Rather, the issues are lodged in systems, traditions, social structures, budget allocations and Government programs. They can be hard to identify, let alone understand and address. Below are some challenges specific to the promotion and protection of women\u2019s equal enjoyment of ESC rights that are addressed in the Handbook. A. From a Socio-Cultural Perspective Inequality in the enjoyment of human rights by women throughout the world is often deeply embedded in poverty, history, social structures and culture, including religious attitudes. Protection of ESC rights often requires looking closely at areas that were, until relatively recently, considered to be beyond the reach of human rights law; such as, the family, religious and cultural areas, and so on. Equality requires a critical analysis of the power dynamics between men and women that are inherent in family and social structures. Addressing women\u2019s ESC rights requires fundamental changes to social structures and the culture of respect for human rights in all aspects and sectors of society. B. From a Legal Perspective Legal regimes are frequently discriminatory against women. There are many international and regional human rights instruments that define a State\u2019s obligations to respect, protect and fulfill women\u2019s ESC rights. These instruments interact and overlap. Understanding the legal regime at the international, regional and domestic levels is not a simple process, even for experts. Many countries have ratified human rights instruments, but have issued reservations to protections for women. For example, many of the reservations to CEDAW \u2013 to fundamental equality rights, for example \u2013 seriously undermine the basic objective of the instrument. Other nations point out, with justification, that reservations should not be used in this way. Module 1: Positioning the Issues Equitas 5 Module 1 Ratification of human rights instruments does not necessarily translate into the political will to implement these legal standards. Addressing women\u2019s equality rights in the ESC context almost always requires more than just addressing single episodes of human rights violations. Similarly, ESC rights frequently engage more than one \u201cperpetrator\u201d or person responsible for the violation because problems are systemic in nature. For both historical reasons and as a self-serving strategy, some countries do not recognize the enforceability of ESC rights. Since women\u2019s enjoyment of human rights generally resides in and depends on ESC rights, this is a serious barrier to equality. C. From the Perspective of NHRI Programming NHRIs are not always well-structured to identify and address women\u2019s equality issues. With so many competing priorities for NHRIs, it is often difficult to know where to begin. Even when ESC rights are identified as priorities, the daily urgency of incidents involving civil and political rights frequently push ESC rights to the background in NHRI programming and activities.

Protecting women\u2019s ESC rights often requires long-term and progressive effort in collaboration with multiple stakeholders, partners and funders. Protecting women\u2019s ESC rights also often requires challenging deeply held traditions and cultural norms and widening the concept of human rights beyond the conventional wisdom. D. From a Broader Perspective of Democratic Development and Good Governance There are close links between the enjoyment by women of their rights and a particular country\u2019s development performance by means of democratic development and good governance. \ufffd Women\u2019s groups and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are generally less equipped to carry out their work, because of power imbalances. As part of their own good governance projects, Governments need to ensure a \u201cvoice\u201d for women when public policy is being developed. NHRIs must do the same. \ufffd Development programs usually have a good governance envelope or component, which generally include a range of justice projects, as well as projects to increase Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 6 Module 1 the capacity and effectiveness of Government (including NHRIs) and local leadership, as well as civil society. All these players are part of achieving equality for women. \ufffd There have been global efforts to \u201cmainstream\u201d women\u2019s rights into human rights work and good governance agendas. However, gender mainstreaming has had its limitations, sometimes at the expense of dedicating efforts and resources to the women who most need assistance. \ufffd The capacity to identify progress depends on access to good data across most of the rights areas addressed by ESC rights. This requires access to accurate and timely sex-disaggregated data. The Legal Framework NHRIs function within a specific legal framework. The NHRIs enabling legislation creates an NHRI\u2019s mandate. The legal or normative framework includes not only the human rights obligations that flow from international and domestic law, but also includes principles that inform the development of rights, the acceptance of universal human rights, and respect for the rule of law. Strategies NHRIs have a variety of strategies and possible actions available to strengthen efforts to protect and promote women\u2019s ESC rights. In this Handbook, these have been organized under the following headings: \ufffd Developing Institutional Capacity to Achieve Women\u2019s ESC Rights \ufffd The Protection Mandate \u2013 Complaints, Investigations and Monitoring \ufffd The Promotion Mandate \u2013 Providing Advice, Raising Awareness and Education A. Developing Institutional Capacity to Achieve Women\u2019s ESC Rights Strategic planning helps to identify priorities for the NHRI and helps to guide the allocation of resources. Strategic planning is important for the NHRI because: \ufffd It helps direct energy and resources towards important, achievable program initiatives \ufffd It provides a mechanism by which progress can be measured \ufffd It can be used to communicate and coordinate with other stakeholders in a transparent, mutually respectful and beneficial manner To achieve its targets in the area of women\u2019s ESC rights, NHRIs must also develop their institutional capacity in the following areas: Module 1: Positioning the Issues Equitas 7 Module 1 \ufffd Human resources \ufffd Gender mainstreaming v. specific programs for women\u2019s equality \ufffd Organizational structure and development \ufffd Knowledge management \ufffd Training NHRIs should also be structured internally to cooperate and collaborate with a variety of stakeholders, including Government, civil society and the private sector.

The Protection Mandate \u2013 Complaints, Investigations and Monitoring The Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions (Paris Principles) provide that NHRIs should promote and protect human rights. The protection aspect of the mandate depends on the NHRI\u2019s power to investigate and monitor human rights and, in most cases, to accept and investigate individual complaints. The Handbook also proposes that alternative dispute resolution and public inquiries can enhance the protection of women\u2019s ESC rights. In the context of ESC rights, the complexity of social beliefs, legal regimes, and economic structures that give rise to rights violations are not always easily attributable to single incidents or particular perpetrators. The classic investigative techniques that are well suited to most civil and political rights cases may not necessarily lend themselves as well to ESC complaints and women\u2019s equality issues. Although generalizations are difficult to make, it is often true that systemic approaches, grouped complaints and research-based approaches to establishing a fact base may be better suited to these complaints.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfd602fc-cb92-466e-a9f7-f33c02c010f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "cfd602fc-cb92-466e-a9f7-f33c02c010f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6779ae0a47e507d8bcacf1a3d777db31bd1237f56678af397740cf7150488b92"}, "2": {"node_id": "f680c6ca-bd2f-4618-9dfc-087bd7475e46", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ca84f77677ac1b742dd75f45f0c7c507176c92c1568a51c8b52c72a2e512bd4"}}, "hash": "43f2a91a538a7fa85d041e97a91fbe56412cd1ee092ce910fe2f91b16fe2e55b", "text": "The Handbook proposes that a mix of gender mainstreaming coupled with more directed and targeted approaches are required to address women\u2019s ESC rights, rather than adopting one or the other of these approaches.

The following case study is intended to identify some of the approaches and strategies that National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) can apply to effectively protect and promote women\u2019s economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights. It is included at the beginning of this handbook to illustrate the potential of NHRIs in this area and to provide readers with an overview of the overall content of the handbook. Page references are included in the case study to make it easy to refer to the relevant section in the handbook. The case study is also meant to act as a tool to stimulate creative thinking about the work of NHRIs in the area of women\u2019s ESC rights.

They are intended to be generic enough so that the reader can identify similarities with the issues they face and the institutions with whom they work. The Facts The Government Decides to Revitalize the National Railroad In recent decades, the national rail system has fallen into a state of disrepair. There are only limited operations south of the nation\u2019s capital, and operations have completely ceased in the northern part of the country. The Government has decided to modernize the system by making structural changes to accommodate diesel-fueled trains, rehabilitating rail stations, and reinforcing tracks and bridges. The overall aim of the project is to reduce traffic congestion, improve transport between the airports and seaports and generally to strengthen economic activity that might be dependent on rail travel. The national Government is leading this renewal project; however, funds for the project are also coming from International Export and Import. The Relocation of \u201cSquatter\u201d Communities In order to implement this project, the Government will evict \u201csquatter\u201d communities who are living along the railway lines, many of whom have lived there for decades. Approximately 70,000 families will be affected. The Government has pledged close to $100 million to cover the relocation costs of settlers living along the railway through a home ownership scheme. Families are to be provided with a no- interest loan to build their own homes. The loans will be amortized over 25 years, with the first year being a grace period where no loan re-payments need to be made. The Government recently started to implement the relocation process, evicting close to 30,000 families and resettling them to various relocation sites. Many families have been relocated to sites several hundred kilometres from their original homes. Others have been relocated to sites in closer proximity to their original homes. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 10 Module 1 The Human Rights Impact of the Resettlement Process The problems associated with the relocation process, in general, include: \ufffd Lack of information and consultation with affected families \ufffd Eviction from their homes and relocation to the sites before the sites are actually habitable \ufffd Insufficient Government-provided loans for the construction of houses \ufffd Few economic opportunities at the relocation sites \ufffd Lack of basic services such as potable water, electricity, adequate drainage, as well as health and school facilities at the sites For one group in particular, the relocation site is situated adjacent to a waste dump. During heavy rains, flood waters are contaminated by run off from the dumpsite which then floods houses in the relocation site for hours on end.

There is no functioning health clinic at the site, and the nearest hospital is not obliged to accept people from the relocation site. In an attempt to address some of the concerns identified in the resettlement process, the Government established a Coordinating Committee, chaired by the Mayor of the municipality. Despite the presence of some representatives of NGOs, the Coordinating Committee lacks transparency and is not considered credible by the families who have been relocated. The Community Mobilizes to Voice its Grievances Seeing no other options, the women of the community decide to organize a series of peaceful demonstrations near the site of their old homes and in front of Parliament to raise awareness of their plight and seek Government action. The protest attracts media attention and the families\u2019 concerns are widely reported by independent newspapers and radio stations; however, they are ignored by the Government. Realizing they are getting nowhere, the women\u2019s group leading the protest submits a complaint to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) alleging that they are being denied their ESC rights and that the women in the community have become victims of discrimination and sexual violence due to the relocation process. The complaint identifies the following respondents: \ufffd Ministry of Transportation which initiated the evictions \ufffd Ministry of the Interior which is responsible for the police who carried out the evictions \ufffd Ministry of Social Affairs which was designated to provide services to the relocation sites Module 1: Positioning the Issues Equitas 11 Module 1 The Role of National Human Rights Institutions The National Human Rights Commission Enters the Picture As recommended by the Paris Principles, the NHRC\u2019s enabling legislation grants it a broad mandate to protect and promote the human rights defined in the Constitution as well as those included in the international instruments that have been ratified by the State. In this case, the State has ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). The statute also provides the NHRC with broad powers to: \ufffd Inquire and investigate into all allegations of violations of human rights, including the power to undertake investigations on its own motion (i.e., without the need to receive a formal complaint or invitation from a Government agency) \ufffd Monitor compliance with the State\u2019s domestic and international human rights obligations \ufffd Advise the State on issues related to human rights \ufffd Promote awareness and education about human rights Organizing the NHRC to Promote and Protect Women\u2019s ESC Rights With increasing attention being given internationally to issues of ESC rights and gender equality, the NHRC had recently committed itself to strengthening its institutional capacity to promote and protect women\u2019s ESC rights. During the recently completed Strategic Planning process, the NHRC had recognized its role and responsibilities in protecting women\u2019s ESC rights, promoting gender equality and addressing the root causes of gender inequality in society. Important outcomes of the Strategic Planning process to which the NHRC committed itself included: \ufffd Taking steps to ensure a gender balance in its own membership, senior management and staff \ufffd Adopting internal policies and procedures to promote gender equality within the institution \ufffd Establishing a special multidisciplinary Task Force with a mandate to coordinate an approach to all investigation, monitoring and promotion activities related to women\u2019s ESC rights See Module 3, section 1: \u201cThe NHRI Enabling Legislation\u201d (pp. 56-61).

Keeping in mind the principle of Article 3 of the ICESCR (non-discrimination and equality between women and men), the Task Force realizes the need to look at the situation from the perspective of substantive equality and assess whether the eviction has had a disproportionate impact on women. This will include looking beyond equal treatment under the applicable law or policy to examine whether the relocation has resulted in a negative impact on the ability of women to enjoy their rights. Identifying Strategies to Respond to the Situation from a Gender Equality Perspective In looking at the rationale for taking on the complaint, the Task Force determines that this particular complaint is part of a pattern that may lead to many more such complaints. As the Government seeks to make the country attractive to foreign investors, a number of large-scale development projects are being planned that call for relocations. Understanding that such initiatives could generate more complaints that may overwhelm the NHRC\u2019s modest resources, the Task Force convinces the Commissioners of the strategic value in responding in a holistic manner. The Task force recommends that the NHRC undertake the following actions in response to the complaint: \ufffd Investigating the complaint \ufffd Monitoring, over a period of time, the Government\u2019s compliance with its obligations to realize the ESC rights of women in communities affected by relocations and evictions \ufffd Advising the Government on the steps required to respect, protect and fulfill the rights of women who are affected by forced evictions \ufffd Implementing an education campaign about the values and principles of women\u2019s ESC rights aimed at Government officials, affected communities, NGOs and the public in an effort to prevent rights abuses See Module 2, section 3A: \u201cWomen\u2019s Equality and Discrimination\u201d (pp. 40-41); section 3B: \u201cEquality\u201d (pp. 41-42).

Module 1: Positioning the Issues Equitas 13 Module 1 The Protection Mandate \u2013 Complaints, Investigations and Monitoring \u2013 Does the NHRC\u2019s Statute Permit It to Intervene? Following their standard procedures, investigators review the complaint to consider whether it is admissible. \ufffd Is the complaint within the NHRC\u2019s jurisdiction? \ufffd If proven, will these allegations constitute violations of human rights under its statute? With reference to the sex-discrimination allegation, the Constitution protects women\u2019s equality rights and the right to be free from discrimination based on sex. Furthermore, the State has ratified CEDAW and the ICESCR. Therefore, the NHRC can establish its jurisdiction based on the explicit recognition of women\u2019s equal rights with respect to the right to adequate housing in the ICESCR. Launching an Investigation Having concluded that the complaint is admissible, a detailed Investigation Plan is developed. The Investigation Team proceeds to conduct its investigation following established procedures and principles. The investigators undertake the following steps to ensure that they will be able to assess the complaint in a gender-sensitive manner: \ufffd Analyzing the role of gender in the community \u2013 What are the roles and needs of men and women, and how do they differ? How are resources controlled in the community? \ufffd Ensuring that interviews with women are conducted in a sensitive manner with female investigators taking the lead during interviews with women who were victims of violence during the eviction process. \ufffd Ensuring that counselling services are available for those who have been traumatized. The Findings of the Investigation Team The investigators record the following findings on the allegation of sex discrimination: \ufffd Police and security guards who participated in the forced eviction (a violent act itself) were involved in gender-specific violence against women in the community \u2013 sexual assault and rape. \ufffd Women community leaders were not consulted in a meaningful way before, during or after the eviction, despite being at the forefront of the resistance to the eviction (often, literally standing in front of bulldozers, confronting State authorities, etc.).

Children were bewildered by the violence of the eviction and being removed from their communities and schools. As women are often the emotional centre of the family, it fell on their shoulders to ensure the emotional well-being of all members of the household, while at the same time coping with their own emotional upheaval. \ufffd The relocation sites did not have basic services such as potable water, electricity, health clinics and schools. This increased women\u2019s daily workload and anxiety as a result of their role within the family. They were required to carefully ration food and other basic necessities to ensure the rest of the family is adequately provided for. \ufffd Title for houses in the relocation sites were only being registered in the name of the male \u201chead of household\u201d. Where no male of head of household was available, women had to receive the consent of a male relative in order to secure a home within the new relocation site. \ufffd Single women with children had a particularly difficult time repaying the housing loan because of the lack of opportunities for employment and given the economic situation of most female-led households. \ufffd The women noted that their standard of living was higher in their original communities. Because the relocation sites are removed from the city centre, women find it difficult to engage in informal sector employment \u2013 which was their chief source of income \u2013 as there is not enough city foot-traffic to sustain such businesses. Moreover, because households within the relocation sites are poorer, there is less money for non-essentials, making their businesses less viable. The NHRC Makes a Determination on the Complaint Based on this evidence, the Commission concludes that the forced eviction is a violation of women\u2019s equal rights to housing under international human rights law. Discrimination and inequality must be addressed as a matter of immediacy (progressive realization does not apply), unless the State can demonstrate that to remedy the violation immediately would cause \u201cundue hardship\u201d. The Commission finds that a number of remedies can be implemented without causing the State undue hardship, and in fact, will cost the State very little. The Commission further finds that the forced eviction and relocation constitute a \u201cretrogressive measure\u201d as the See Module 3, section 2: \u201cInternational Human Rights Framework\u201d (pp. 62-74). Module 1: Positioning the Issues Equitas 15 Module 1 women had, on the whole, suffered a decline in living standards once evicted and relocated to the new site. Retrogressive measures are prima facie violations of economic, social and cultural rights. The NHRC Identifies Remedies to Adequately Address the Issues Raised The Commission makes the following recommendations to remedy the violations found in the complaint: \ufffd The State should cease and desist immediately from evicting families or individuals living along the railway lines until such time as all existing relocation sites meet international and national housing rights standards \ufffd In this regard, at a minimum, the State must immediately ensure that all communities have easy access to potable water and electricity and other basic services including medical clinics and primary and secondary schools \ufffd The State should immediately create an effective review mechanism for complaints regarding the housing and living conditions of evictees living in relocation sites. This mechanism must include community members in decision making roles, and must have the authority to remedy complaints \ufffd The State must immediately establish support services for women victims of violence in consultation with women community members \ufffd The State must ensure that female-headed households and single women are provided title to their new homes, without requiring the consent of a male family member \ufffd The State needs to address the livelihood issues confronting the evictees in relocation sites. Efficient, cost-free transportation must be put in place to ensure evictees can return to their former jobs or employment opportunities need to be created in and around the relocation sites.

An alternative could have been a National Inquiry aimed at bringing the systemic issues related to the eviction to the attention of the Government and public at large. When the NHRC launches public inquiries, it establishes a Panel with defined terms of reference, and a mandate to hold hearings to which witnesses can be summoned to testify. In its proceedings, an inquiry acts somewhat like a court, but with less formality. The ultimate purpose is to make comprehensive, sound recommendations for dealing with the issue under review. In addition, inquiries are useful in monitoring Government activity in a defined area, and promoting public discussion and examination of an important issue, potentially bringing a hidden issue into the public domain. Following up the NHRC Investigation After informing the complainants and the Government of its findings and recommendations, the NHRC adopts a detailed plan to address the systematic issues raised in the complaint. In this instance, the NHRC chose to proceed with an investigation given the immediacy of the issues and the time and resources required to plan and undertake an inquiry. Having produced its findings and recommendations, however, the NHRC noted that a Public Inquiry might be needed in the future if the Government does not implement its recommendations and changes its practices when it comes to evictions. Monitoring the Government\u2019s Performance over Time Following the investigation, the NHRC develops a plan to monitor the Government\u2019s performance in meeting its obligations to respect, protect and fulfill women\u2019s economic, social and cultural rights that would examine the impact of evictions on women\u2019s rights across the country and over a period of time. Their plan includes the following steps in the monitoring effort: See Module 5, section 4: \u201cMonitoring\u201d (pp. 118-123). Module 1: Positioning the Issues Equitas 17 Module 1 Monitoring Plan Steps 1. Identifying appropriate indicators compatible with the State\u2019s obligations in relation to economic, social and cultural rights, for monitoring these rights at the national and international levels; in particular, by reviewing existing international commitments and targets such as the Millennium Development Goals and the Beijing Platform of Action as well as any concluding comments or recommendations that were produced following country reports to the CEDAW Committee or Committee on ESC rights 2. Establishing appropriate national benchmarks and targets in relation to each indicator and asking: \u2022 What movement has there been from the benchmark and, if there has not been positive movement, why not? \u2022 Has the State set targets and, if not, why not? \u2022 Have the targets been met and, if not, why not? 3. Collecting data (during the monitoring period) which can be disaggregated according to gender and which are comparable, accurate, impartial and provided over time. 4. Analyzing results, drawing conclusions, making recommendations and reporting on findings for the monitoring period by: \u2022 Considering data from indicators with established benchmarks (national and international) to give the current status of economic, social and cultural rights and help in developing targets to be met; \u2022 Gauging trends by comparing results over time with previous monitoring periods (multi-year analysis) to determine whether and what progress has been made and national benchmarks achieved; \u2022 Comparing results with international benchmarks also. Gendering Budgets Recognizing that part of the problem stems from the way the Government is allocating its budget, the NHRC decides to monitor financial allocations in the National Budget for building new schools, health centres, digging wells and providing the other services the relocated communities are lacking. Having found that resources for the Ministries of Education, Health and Social Affairs continue to be going disproportionately to middle class areas, the NHRC successfully argues for increased investments in communities that have been relocated or evicted. Advising the Government The NHRC also recognizes the need to work with the Government to change the legislative and policy framework that makes the violation of women\u2019s ESC rights possible. At the instigation of the NHRC, a Working Group on Women\u2019s ESC Rights is established that brings key ministries, civil society organizations and the NHRC together at the same table.

Overview of Module 2 Module 2 contains five sections. \ufffd Section 1 \u2013 Equality Rights and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, offers a preliminary overview of ESC rights including the State\u2019s minimum core obligations. This section also briefly discusses the particular challenges faced in securing women\u2019s equality, with particular regard to cultural rights. \ufffd Section 2 \u2013 Women\u2019s Equality and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Context, presents ESC rights as a complex interplay of historical, traditional, economic, social and cultural factors. Human rights violations related to ESC rights are frequently attributable to system-wide problems and to the activities of many persons and organizations - both official and unofficial. This section looks at key dimensions of women\u2019s equality in relation to good governance, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and women\u2019s human security. \ufffd Section 3 \u2013 Key Concepts, discusses concepts that are essential to this area of work and to national human rights institutions (NHRIs) seeking to be more effective in dealing with women\u2019s ESC rights. The concepts discussed are: discrimination, substantive equality, interdependence and indivisibility, multiple grounds of discrimination (or intersectionality, along with its special role in protecting women within vulnerable and disadvantaged groups), temporary special measures, and the principle of non-retrogression. \ufffd Section 4 \u2013 The Role of National Human Rights Institutions, examines the emerging role of NHRIs in the area of women\u2019s rights and ESC rights. \ufffd Section 5 \u2013 Legal Obligations of Non-State Actors, looks at the responsibilities of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), corporations, and other non-State actors. NHRIs often have legal mandates that extend to these actors, and so it is important to understand what the standards are and how NHRIs can engage non-government actors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "540e7a42-8df0-48ea-a2c4-70f27ddc88e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "540e7a42-8df0-48ea-a2c4-70f27ddc88e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "327c929c8cce247757fded9fe28af396df0e9dec494fb8cd729e135742c409ba"}, "2": {"node_id": "63717897-f217-4587-98f6-bcd664bf5965", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5186035e6e7ec31d80daf2caed4ea9c1242a98feea257c74c7a491f14f05ea0b"}}, "hash": "9b2806425e9631c5038cf6427c6dd1f787ebf3dd60e8a5fb6b6e0a778d7fb5bf", "text": "Module 2: Equality, Development and Rights \u2013 Making the Connections Equitas 21 Module 2 Women\u2019s ESC rights include: \ufffd Adequate standard of living \ufffd Assistance and protection for families \ufffd Benefiting from scientific progress \ufffd Education and training \ufffd Employment and safe working conditions \ufffd Equal marriage rights for men and women \ufffd Forming, joining and acting together in trade unions \ufffd Freedom from violence \ufffd Healthy environment \ufffd Owning and inheriting property \ufffd Participating in the cultural life of the community \ufffd Social security Section 1 Equality Rights and Economic, Social & Cultural Rights Economic, social and cultural rights are human rights that address the fundamentals of human existence: the right to basic necessities of life; the right to learn, to work, and to form a family as well as the right to enjoy one's cultural identity and the benefits of science and development.

They developed the Montreal Principles on Women\u2019s Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Montreal Principles). The following sections offer categories that are adapted from the Montreal Principles.

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), for example contains an equality guarantee in Article 26 which states that \u201call persons are equal before the law and entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of law.\u201d The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and a number of labour instruments from the International Labour Organization also address ESC rights. For more details, Appendix 2 contains a table of key international human rights instruments dealing with equality rights for women and ESC rights. A table of regional instruments can be found in Appendix 3. Section 2 Women\u2019s Equality and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Context11 ESC rights are fundamental human rights. They are enshrined in international human rights instruments and are integral to the legal framework in which NHRIs operate.12 Nonetheless, women\u2019s experiences show that inequality persists and is deeply rooted Module 2: Equality, Development and Rights \u2013 Making the Connections Equitas 23 Module 2 in history, tradition, and religion. These forces combine to create a context of social beliefs, legal regimes, and economic structures that subordinate women to men in many countries, cultures and communities around the world. If the ICESCR has had little relevance to many women, as some say, it is primarily because it has failed to reflect the economic, social and cultural contexts within which most women live. In order to understand women\u2019s equality, these contexts must be considered a critical factor, significant to rights, and their implementation. ESC rights and equality can therefore best be understood in their specific context, and in the lived experience of women. For example, Article 7 of the ICESCR sets out the right to just and favourable conditions of work but is restricted to the public sphere. It ignores the activities which women perform without pay in their households \u2013 and yet for many women these activities are at the centre of their lives. The complexity, context and interdependence of rights are elegantly described in the excerpt below: In lived experience, the denial and exercise of certain rights is often dependent upon others: access to education and literacy may be necessary for meaningful participatory democracy. Likewise, democratic participation in the political process may be necessary to achieve access to clean water. Some critics of ESCRs contend that the inclusion of these rights into mainstream human rights work ought to be limited because of the difficulties of objectively defining what constitutes their meaningful exercise\u2026 this is a strength of ESCRs: they are best understood, negotiated and prioritized in particular contexts.13 Public policies that implement ESC rights must account for women\u2019s realities and lives. NHRIs in turn should be able to identify and address the specific ways in which women\u2019s rights are not being respected, protected and fulfilled, or in which", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72f29f90-f435-45bc-943e-70543cc6ffd2": {"__data__": {"id_": "72f29f90-f435-45bc-943e-70543cc6ffd2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f5d5bc898554f0397a5e459eca9e6d37f5adaf2d5a84e786d9da53624760a0e"}, "3": {"node_id": "faf980ca-c83e-4eb2-83c6-d1d34aef7714", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-women-handbook-nhris-economic-social-and-cultural-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71ea7f9ab4401227fcb93739bb815c41459e0ec1b2b634e5405b4e20e3b698e6"}}, "hash": "ea7674f1d73da08e858e71e6b87d2dc30c31bc8b2818826d90b29873dd23b0d3", "text": "they are assumed to have fewer rights. A. Understanding the Connections: Women\u2019s Rights, ESC Rights and NHRIs Equality is at the hub of women\u2019s rights. Article 3 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) provides that States Parties should: Undertake to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural rights\u2026. Although this seems simple, human rights bodies, Governments and policy makers have often ignored ESC rights in general, and women\u2019s rights in particular. Some States Parties, for example, claim that ESC rights are not justiciable, meaning that they are only \u201caspirations\u201d, and cannot be enforced or brought to the courts. Second, for many years, women\u2019s rights were insulated from the reach of human Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 24 Module 2 rights because violations were sheltered by family, traditions and culture, or by religious rules. Despite these and other obstacles, links have been slowly forged between human rights in general, women\u2019s rights in particular, and the overarching framework of ESC rights as a force of law and a source of norms about good governance. This evolution gained considerable speed in the mid-eighties. Following is a list of important documents which NHRIs should be aware of. Limburg Principles (1986) In 1986, a group of distinguished international law experts met at the University of Limburg at Maastricht, the Netherlands and developed a set of principles on ESC rights called Limburg Principles.14 They created an explicit link between the equality rights in Article 3 of the ICESCR, cited above, and CEDAW as well as with other relevant instruments, and with the activities of the CEDAW\u2019s supervisory committee. Vienna World Conference (1993) In 1993, the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna strengthened the link at the urging of women\u2019s groups from around the world who demanded that women\u2019s rights be understood and treated as a central element of the human rights framework. Through the \u201cVienna Declaration\u201d, human rights generally were declared to be indivisible and interdependent. Women\u2019s rights were declared to be human rights by all State Parties, and this cemented a commitment at the State level to both the principle and its practical implementation. Paris Principles (1993) Also in 1993, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution approving the Paris Principles that set the basic standards for NHRIs and identified them as key national actors in the protection and promotion of human rights. Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing, 1995) In 1995, the Fourth World Conference on Women produced the Beijing Declaration and the Beijing Platform for Action, calling for new (or stronger) national institutions, strengthening women\u2019s human rights, gender mainstreaming and the development of programs to protect the human rights of women by national mechanisms.15 For strategic reasons, many women\u2019s organizations positioned their work in the context of civil and political rights, although by the late nineties, equality rights were much more firmly anchored in ESC rights as well. Maastricht Guidelines (1997) In 1997, the Maastricht Guidelines reviewed the decade of progress since the Limburg Principles, reiterating that discrimination against women under the ICESCR should be understood in light of equality for women under CEDAW. The Module 2: Equality, Development and Rights \u2013 Making the Connections Equitas 25 Module 2 additional link was then made between ESC rights, women\u2019s rights and the elimination of gender discrimination arising out of social, cultural and other structural disadvantages.16 By 2000, NGOs which had traditionally concentrated on civil and political rights began to gradually and slowly expand their focus to include ESC rights. The research agenda of organizations such as the Center for Economic and Social Rights, and its focus on monitoring, advocacy, and the development of good socio-economic data, point to the development of multidisciplinary and multi-actor approaches to resolve ESC rights violations.17 United Nations Sub-Commission Resolution 1997/19 For the first time, in 1997 the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) adopted a resolution on women\u2019s rights to land, property and adequate housing.

National Human Rights Institutions: Best Practice (Commonwealth Secretariat , 2001) In 2001, the Commonwealth Secretariat issued National Human Rights Institutions Best Practice (Best Practice Guidelines), which stressed that \u201cregardless of a country\u2019s formal recognition of economic, social and cultural rights, national human rights institutions should be well versed with those rights. [They] should develop and conduct educational programs to promote rights awareness in this category of rights.\u201d 19 The Best Practice Guidelines state that NHRIs should be prepared to address human rights violations committed because of a victim\u2019s gender or sex, and NHRI staff should be properly trained to respond sensitively to human rights issues or violations related to sex or gender. Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 26 Module 2 The Best Practice Guidelines also suggest that NHRIs should: \ufffd Advise Government on the development and implementation of economic policies to ensure that the ESC rights of people are not adversely affected (e.g., structural adjustment programmes and other aspects of economic management) \ufffd Facilitate public awareness of Government policies relating to ESC rights and encourage the involvement of various sectors of society in the formulation, implementation and review of relevant policies Regional Workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions and Other Mechanisms in Promoting and Protecting Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (2001) Also in 2001, the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions (APF), together with the Hong Kong Equal Opportunities Commission, hosted a regional workshop on the Role of National Human Rights Institutions and Other Mechanisms in Promoting and Protecting Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The workshop highlighted the importance of addressing discrimination in the implementation of ESC rights and the importance of developing national institution expertise with regard to such rights. Affirming the importance of international standards in the area of ESC rights (and in particular the ICESCR), the workshop stated that \u201cGovernments and national human rights institutions have a responsibility to ensure that no peoples are discriminated against in their enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.\u201d20 Montreal Principles on Women\u2019s Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (2002) In 2002, reflecting the growing interest in ESC rights and especially the impact on women, the Montreal Principles on Women\u2019s Economic, Social and Cultural Rights were adopted at a meeting of experts. The Principles were the first articulation of the meaning and application of ESC rights for women. They offer a guide to the interpretation and implementation of the guarantees of non-discrimination and equal exercise and enjoyment of ESC rights.21 The Principles also explicitly identify the need for a national system of institutions and mechanisms, including NHRIs, commissions, and Ombudsman offices, to support strategies, plans and policies specifically designed to guarantee women\u2019s equal exercise and enjoyment of their ESC rights. Round Table of National Human Rights Institutions and National Machineries for the Advancement of Women (2004) From 15-19 November 2004, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Division for the Advancement of Women/Department of Economic and Social Affairs held a Round Table of National Human Rights Institutions and National Machineries for the Advancement of Women in Ouarzazate, Morocco. The meeting recommended that NHRIs should ensure that the protection and promotion of women\u2019s rights are an integral part of their own work and that they should use CEDAW as a framework for their activities.

These institutions should investigate and address alleged violations relating to the equality of men and women and provide remedies for such violations, or engage with States Parties to ensure that such remedies are effectively implemented. Asia-Pacific Regional Workshop on Women\u2019s Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, January 2006 In 2006, Equitas and the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines convened an international workshop, sponsored by the OHCHR, the UNDP and the Commonwealth Secretariat, to explore in depth the role of NHRIs in promoting women\u2019s ESC rights. The conclusions of that group included the development of a practical tool to better focus on the developments at the intersection of ESC rights, women\u2019s rights and the role of NHRIs as a key agent in the protection and promotion of both sets of rights. This brief overview is by no means exhaustive, as there have also been several regional and international workshops and conferences that have dealt with ESC Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 28 Module 2 rights and women\u2019s rights since the Vienna Declaration in 1993. Reports and conference information can be found online at http://www.nhri.net. Progress, while slow, has also been positive overall, and has helped shine light on some of the persistent and intractable obstacles to women\u2019s rights. One of these areas is cultural rights. B. The Challenge of Cultural Rights Culture is one of the two or three most complex words in the English language. This is so partly because of its intricate historical development\u2026but mainly because it has now come to be used for important concepts in several distinct intellectual disciplines and in several distinct and incompatible systems of thought. 24 Inequality in the enjoyment of human rights by women throughout the world is often deeply embedded in tradition, history and culture, including religious attitudes. While culture is central to ESC rights, it also poses unique and particular difficulties for equality between women and men. On the one hand, culture and traditions play an important role in human development. On the other hand, while they form part of our identity and basic rights, they are also the source of traditions and harmful traditional practices that discriminate against women and girls. This group of rights can be especially divisive when questions of religious observance, ethnic identity and established tradition confront women\u2019s equality claims. Despite the profound links between culture and women\u2019s equality, the relationship received comparatively little attention until the early nineties. This has been changing, as experts have sought to reframe the issues so as to draw on context and local realities to find innovative solutions, and have developed new theoretical perspectives on the topic.25 As one commentator who reviewed this Handbook observed, powerful elements such as peer pressure are part of culture and may affect attempts to eliminate harmful practices. For example, peer pressure should not be underestimated in programs and awareness campaigns focused on female genital mutilation (FGM), as young girls feel pressure to undergo the rite and not feel left out or socially excluded. Therefore, NHRIs need to first ascertain the cultural rationale behind such violations of women\u2019s rights before launching into investigations or promotional programs. It should also be noted that in male-dominated cultures in developing countries, there is the perception that empowerment of women will mean the disempowerment of men. This has led to a backlash against women perceived to be empowered. NHRIs have an important role in addressing these changes and reactions through public education and promotion programs. Following is a list of important international documents related to cultural rights.

The 2005 UNESCO Convention also acknowledges and addresses the tension that sometimes exists between culture and human rights: Cultural diversity can be protected and promoted only if human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of expression, information and communication, as well as the ability of individuals to choose cultural expressions, are guaranteed. No one may invoke the provisions of this Convention in order to infringe human rights and fundamental freedoms as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or guaranteed by international law, or to limit the scope thereof. The recognition of the dignity and worth of women as full human beings is fundamental \u2013 cultural rights or religious norms cannot be invoked to deny or violate women\u2019s human rights and fundamental freedoms. As such, \u201ccultural relativism\u201d is not an excuse to violate or deny human rights. It is for this reason that CEDAW specifically obliges States to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices, customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women.28 Equitas Equality for Women: A Handbook for NHRIs on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 30 Module 2 General Comment No. 28 UN Human Rights Committee\u2019s General Comment No. 28 provides a critical link between the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), cultural rights, and women\u2019s issues, specifically addressing the role of NHRIs in matters of tradition, history and culture: 5. It is in this framework of interdependence and careful weighing of relative rights and obligations that NHRIs should address cultural issues in the context of women\u2019s equality rights and ESC rights in particular. [Women\u2019s] inequality \u2026is deeply embedded in tradition, history and culture, including religious attitudes\u2026 The subordinate role of women in some countries is illustrated by the high incidence of prenatal sex selection and abortion of female foetuses. States parties should ensure that traditional, historical, religious or cultural attitudes are not used to justify violations of women's right[s]. States parties should furnish appropriate information on those aspects of tradition, history, cultural practices and religious attitudes which jeopardize, or may jeopardize, compliance with Article 3 [of the ICCPR], and indicate what measures they have taken or intend to take to overcome such factors. 29 Fribourg Declaration (2007) More recently, women\u2019s active participation in the interpretation of culture was affirmed by an international group of experts in the Fribourg Declaration on cultural rights.30 Care should thus be taken to ensure that women have an active role in interpreting and communicating their own traditions and cultural perspectives, and to ensure that their voices are given equal weight in understanding history, religion and tradition. Culture and equality can be balanced one against the other, rather than being opposed. In an equality framework, women are part of the process of defining the delivery of social rights in a culturally sensitive way. And what of the role of NHRIs in helping build these bridges? The following case study offers a revealing and exciting strategy for treating culture as an opportunity for reform rather than an obstacle to progress. NHRIs are playing an important role in navigating these difficult waters as the following example from the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights demonstrates.
