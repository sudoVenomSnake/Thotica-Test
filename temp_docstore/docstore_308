, rolled out and supported by APRC\u2019s CDDE Facility, nine Asia-Pacific countries strengthened the partnership between donors and government in their delivery of Official Development Assistance with clearer mutual accountability for progress on targets and indicators in aid performance. UNDP worked with Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan and Viet Nam to provide facilitation support to donor- government high level meetings and advice on aid policy reform that directly contributed to this achievement. Examples of success include the reform of the Aid Effectiveness Forum in Viet Nam, now directly linked to the Consultative Group of donors and national partners meeting and the Round Table in Lao PDR that has closer links to sector policy reform issues. APRC teams in Bangkok and Suva helped to include cutting edge work on peer review and mutual accountability from Asia and the Pacific region in the global development effectiveness dialogue. An example of which was the government of Viet Nam\u2019s innovation in reforming the national aid policy and institutional arrangements for coordinating development partners to include issues around climate finance, private-public partnerships and South- South Cooperation, thereby provided strong impetus to the Outcome Document of the 4th High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan. Cited for its user friendly design and regular update the official portal for the Busan High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness aideffectiveness.org attracted in 2011 more than 180,000 visitors. Managed on a day-to-day basis by APRC the portal served partner countries and development partners to articulate a common understanding of the principles of development effectiveness and the priorities of the aid reform agenda. How to deconstruct the development buzzword \u201cengendering\u201d Evidence from international research and practice suggests that incorporating a gender perspective in climate change policies and initiatives is crucial to effectively address the climate change crisis.

The Farmer Water User Committees, which are the local authorities responsible for irrigation management, have historically been comprised of only men, which can potentially skew decisions made in men\u2019s favor. The RGAs found that women and men use the irrigation water in different ways and that women are a better medium of early warning in rural communities, especially with regards to the slow onset of calamities such as long rain or droughts. These findings led to the modification of the project design to establish women\u2019s volunteer groups as a messenger of early warning information. Engendering UNDP Cambodia\u2019s Environment and Energy (E&E) Portfolio is a joint initiative by UNDP Cambodia, APRC and the International Network on Gender and Sustainable Energy 2011 UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Annual Report Page 12 (ENERGIA). It was applied during the inception phase of Promoting Climate Resilient Water Management and Agricultural Practices, a project funded by Global Environment Facility/Least Developed Countries Fund, which is the first climate change adaptation project that directly addresses the adaptation priorities as identified in Cambodia\u2019s National Adaptation Programme of Action. The application of this initiative resulted in modifications of the stakeholder\u2019s engagement plan for the project in the context of gender integration. The project team is now sharing the lessons learned from their experience not just in Cambodia but also at international platforms such as the Adaptation Learning Mechanism, which is the collaborative knowledge-sharing platform facilitated by UNDP in close partnership with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNEP, the World Bank and specialized United Nations agencies. Building Crisis Resilient Societies The Asia-Pacific region is extremely vulnerable to natural disasters and accounts for the majority of global disaster victims even without taking climate change into account. Climate change exacerbates extreme weather events and the severity of impact on localities and livelihoods. Countries, especially least developed ones, face challenges in providing public services related to disaster risk management such as risk assessments, early warning systems, land use planning, ecosystem management, improvements of critical lifelines and enforcement of building codes. Moreover, these countries often lack ability to provide effective humanitarian assistance and support to gender-responsive recovery that is required due to the heightened vulnerability of women during and in the aftermath of natural disasters. Natural Disasters Prevention and Recovery UNDP has made disaster risk reduction (DRR) central to its development agenda and crafted specific products and approaches for DRR programming and advocacy. These DRR signature products include risk assessment, policy development, capacity assessment, capacity development and community based disaster risk management. On 12 October 2011 more than 20 Indian Ocean countries participated in Exercise IOWave11 that simulated a fictitious earthquake of the same magnitude that generated the devastating tsunami of December 2004. The exercise provided an excellent opportunity for the Indian Ocean countries to test their operational capacity and efficiency of warning chains down to the community level as per their agreed standard operating procedures. The Exercise IOWave11 marked a significant milestone in the development of tsunami warning system for the Indian Ocean region, which has started receiving tsunami warning from the designated Regional Tsunami Service Providers (RTSPs) of Australia, Indonesia, India and Thailand-based RIMES (Regional Integrated Multi-Hazard Early Warning System for Africa and Asia). Until recently, the Indian Ocean countries were receiving tsunami warning from the Japan Meteorological Agency and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre. APRC supported several regional and national processes contributing to the development of the tsunami warning system for the Indian Ocean. UNDP\u2019s support was crucial at the regional level in harmonizing warning procedures and protocols to ensure that tsunami warning is received from RTSPs in a format which could be easily synthesized by countries and also at the national level in preparing institutions, strengthening warning dissemination procedures and simulating evacuation drills with participation of all stakeholders such as communities, businesses, local governments, police and community based organizations. The tsunami-warning infrastructure, backed by appropriate regional coordination mechanisms, national institutional and legal frameworks as well as well-prepared coastal communities reduces the risk of losses from potential tsunami disasters. At the time of the 2004 tsunami, a 2011 UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Annual Report Page 13 warning system for the Indian Ocean was not in place and only a few scientists knew of the tsunami risk. If this warning system was in place prior to the 2004 tsunami 160,000 deaths might have been prevented. Heavy rain isn\u2019t unusual in Thailand, Cambodia or the rest of Southeast Asia. However 2011 was exceptional as the rainy season started earlier than normal.

Some early assessments of the damage concluded that these events produced a new level of suffering and loss. In response to requests from the UNDP Country Offices in Cambodia Lao PDR and Thailand, APRC experts facilitated the approval of immediate assistance from a UNDP special fund and participated in missions to conduct both damage and needs assessment and to develop early recovery programmes. Resilient Local Communities Across Asia and the Pacific disaster risk reduction initiatives addressed institutional capacity strengthening and policy framework formulation. APRC crisis prevention and capacity development experts assisted the capacity assessments for disaster management of local authorities in Indonesia and the Philippines and were consulted on the design of their capacity development strategies and responses. An Indonesian National Team who received APRC supported training in 2010, subsequently applied and tested draft standard guidelines on tsunami risk assessment and mitigation in Aceh and West Sulawesi, two of the most tsunami prone locations in Indonesia. Based on results and adjustments during the implementation revised guidelines were provided to the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), which intends to make it obligatory for all local governments to use the level of tsunami risks as the basis for allocation of funds. This will make Indonesia one of the few countries to use a risk assessment process as the basis for fund allocation for disaster risk management and it is hoped that the full process inclusive of guidelines development, peer review and verification, training, testing and official approval will be replicated for other types of hazards such as climate risk, landslides, earthquakes and volcano eruptions in the Indonesian context. In the Philippines the capacity assessment methodology was first piloted in the provinces of Benguet and Albay and later shared with stakeholders at national level. Following recommendations from UNDP\u2019s experts and spearheaded by strong political leadership and participation of various partners, the capacity development work in Albay focused on promoting the primacy of the local government units in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation issues. The Albay Centre for Initiative and Research for Climate Adaptation in partnership with public institutions and organizations of local authorities championed the dissemination of this integrated capacity development approach to other provinces and government units. When in November 2011 the government and communities of Padang hosted local planning and disaster management authorities from eight disaster-prone provinces of Indonesia, experts from Bangladesh, the Philippines, Thailand and Sri Lanka joined in to discuss their experience in making local communities safer through disaster risk reduction management. APRC experts and the UNDP Indonesia Country Office helped to conceive and conduct this exchange of knowledge amongst local authorities on institutional and policy development, capacity and risk assessment and community based disaster management. 2011 UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Annual Report Page 14 Climate Change Concerns and Disaster Risk Management The correlation between climate change and the rising frequency and intensity of natural disasters is increasingly being recognized by governments in Asia-Pacific and has been reflected in their climate change strategies and National Adaptation Program of Action. It is an important element in the programming support provided by APRC. In 2011, 10 countries were assisted in accessing global climate change funds, much of this funding destined to address climate- induced natural disasters such as floods and tropical cyclones. In the Hindu Kush Himalayan region APRC experts assist Bhutan, Nepal and Pakistan in reducing the risks from Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF). Significant synergies are expected from these initiatives through regional knowledge exchange, enabling the replication of effective disaster risk reduction measures and adaptation to climate change in other countries facing climate change-induced GLOF risks. The success of these initiatives helps to establish UNDP as one of the foremost organizations working in this area. In Southeast Asia APRC is helping countries to address flooding and drought related risks by working with coastal communities in Thailand and with farmers in Lao PDR. APRC increased the portfolio of activities in the Pacific and Island States on strengthening national and local government capacity to identify, prioritize and execute actions to address climate and disaster risks. Work on tropical cyclone related risks in Tuvalu and the introduction of climate resilient island planning in the Maldives are examples of shifting focus from reactive responses for disaster recovery to local government planning and budgeting capacity towards reducing future risks.

After a sneak preview in Bangkok and a premiere screening at the Asia Society in New York the documentary was aired on Discovery Channel Asia reaching nearly 100,000 people and was featured on the Eve of the Earth Summit in Abu Dhabi. The film is used by UNDP Country Offices in advocating for efficient national responses to the challenges of climate change. Prominent requests for copies of the movie have been received by the office of Vice President Al Gore; the Office of the Under-Secretary for Democracy and Global Affairs of the U.S. Department of State for a screening at a South Asia Forum; the National Academies of Sciences for use at its Forum on Himalayan Glaciers; Carlton University; the University of Wisconsin; Duke University; Dartmouth College; The Near East South Asia Centre for Strategic Studies, associated with the US National Defense University; the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID); the Secretariat of SAARC; the Asia Institute of Technology in Thailand and the Stockholm Environment Institute.

The five studies facilitated by the APRC in collaboration with the participating UNDP Country Offices, research institutions and indigenous people\u2019s organizations represent a valuable analysis of the overall context of indigenous peoples, their media and communication environments as well as the main development challenges being faced. The assessment process also resulted in the capacity building of researchers and participating indigenous people organizations. A summary report, titled Indigenous Voices in Asia: Assessment & Strategy summarizes lessons learned and recommendations for future actions. The next phase of the regional initiative will see regional organizations such as the Asia Indigenous People\u2019s Pact (AIPP), the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters (Asia-Pacific) (AMARC) and additional partners at the country level promoting the rights of indigenous people to have access to all forms of non-indigenous media, without discrimination, and to strengthen the role of indigenous media in enhancing indigenous voices, culture, language and identity. In the long run it is expected that the results achieved so far through the Indigenous Voices Initiative will contribute to enhancing indigenous people\u2019s participation and representation in democratic and political processes. In doing so governments will be held more accountable for their actions and promises with respect to international norms on the rights of indigenous peoples. Implementation of International Norms and Standards on Anti-corruption and Human Rights APRC consolidated regional partnerships on access to justice and human rights with the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR), the Asian Consortium on Human Rights Based Access to Justice, the Legal Empowerment Asia Partnership and the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions (APF). Working jointly with the Regional Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), APRC consistently applied the United Nations human rights based approach to development in advocacy, knowledge sharing and capacity development activities. Key results of this collaborative work include: \uf0fc The Asia Regional Consortium on Human Rights-Based Access to Justice offered foundational training modules on human rights based access to justice to government and civil society representatives from 30 countries who are now embedding this specialized knowledge in institutional reform initiatives and rights-based justice programming; APRC directly realizes or assists the implementation of several UNDP global programmes and global funds: \uf0a7 Environment and climate global trust funds: Global Environment Facility; Least Developed Country Fund; Special Climate Change Fund; Adaptation Fund; and the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund; \uf0a7 Multi-donor global programmes: UN-REDD Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation; Poverty Environment Initiative; Mangroves for the Future Programme; Global Climate Policy Programme; and \uf0a7 Global programmes in governance: Global Programme on Electoral Cycle Support; Global Human Rights Strengthening Progrmme; Programme on Anti Corruption for Development Effectiveness; Governance Assessments Programme; Global Programme on Access to Justice.

APRC strengthened South-South Cooperation among anti-corruption agencies and actors: \uf0fc By convening three anti-corruption commissions (ACC) from Bhutan, Maldives and Timor-Leste to share experiences that resulted in improved internal procedures and overall effectiveness of the anti-corruption commissions of Maldives and Timor-Leste; and \u201c...the best experience sharing I have ever had\u201d, Commissioner Mohamed Shafeeu, ACC Maldives \u201cThis South-South exchange has been my best reading on corruption yet\u201d, Commissioner Ad\u00e9rito de Jesus Soares, ACC Timor-Leste \uf0fc By mobilizing comparative expertise and sharing national best practices and global experiences on effective anti-corruption policies, APRC and the India Country Office provided timely advice to the Standing Committee of the Indian Parliament to table the LokPall Bill, the first attempt to comprehensively address the endemic corruption in India. UNDP\u2019s global portal www.anti-corruption.org, developed with APRC\u2019s contribution, was launched on 9 December 2011 in celebration of Anti-Corruption Day. 2011 UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Annual Report Page 18 Efficient HIV, Health and Development Response The achievement of the MDGs and equitable human development requires strengthened action on the linkages between HIV, health and development. APRC ensures that HIV is addressed within broader democratic governance, poverty reduction, gender equality strategies and supports countries to respond to the key social drivers of their HIV epidemics such as the protection of human rights, the legal environment and the status of women. Central to this work during 2011 was the strengthening of partnerships between affected communities and governments for a more effective and inclusive governance of HIV responses. APRC partnered with USAID in follow-up to a series of 2010 city-level consultative processes (Bangkok, Chengdu, Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta, Manila and Yangon,) that culminated in a 2011 report on municipal HIV programming for men who have sex with men and transgender populations. Findings from the report revealed that progress in HIV responses at the city-level are hampered by restrictive legal environments and policies as well as selective police enforcement practices. This Six Cities report serves as the basis for UNDP Country Offices and partners work in expanding the governance of municipal HIV responses in China, Myanmar, the Philippines and Viet Nam. APRC played a leading role in the region in advocating for policy change on removing punitive laws and on the issue of intellectual property. HIV-related travel restrictions across Asia-Pacific infringe the rights of migrants to move, work and access health care. In addition to a number of key publications that highlighted the challenges faced by migrants due to such restriction, APRC through the Joint United Nations Initiative on Mobility and HIV/AIDS in Southeast Asia (JUNIMA), convened a symposium at the 10th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific showcasing positive examples from countries that have removed travel restrictions and provided health care access for migrants.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03e8a260-2119-4821-801b-a7f7cb78b282": {"__data__": {"id_": "03e8a260-2119-4821-801b-a7f7cb78b282", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-regional-centre-annual-report-2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Annual Report 2011", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-regional-centre-annual-report-2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f10ebe44d6fe8ca604e2980bfdc825857a85171807d7f8574fed03488172d67"}, "2": {"node_id": "df522448-8a84-494d-8473-b156deb124d5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-regional-centre-annual-report-2011", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80c18b4a8c6f4c93b8541a3108d109805484941204cc2864784fe39361b252b1"}}, "hash": "c90c93e7ff92167a7b5d4ed6a1db20b7169e2ea85354b6d9a89f46b862f8f286", "text": "In partnership with the ASEAN Secretariat, APRC convened a high-level dialogue on HIV prevention, treatment, care and support for migrant workers.

Financial resources are then used to enhance the capacity of countries to design and implement policies and programmes promoting green, low emission and climate resilient initiatives. In 2011 APRC supported such policy and market transformations in 35 countries. UNDP experts and advisors were engaged in the design and implementation of over 200 specific interventions worth approximately US$600 million in grant funding in the areas of energy, climate mitigation, climate adaptation, natural resource management, biodiversity, forests, land, water and chemicals. In 2011 UNDP successfully assisted 18 countries to access international environmental funds, thus mobilizing resources for government partners amounting to over US$125 million. Resources mobilized for country programmes (climate, chemicals, energy & environment) in 2011 Total: US$125 million In the area of energy/climate mitigation APRC supports national initiatives that transform, influence and develop markets for energy efficiency, renewable energy and low greenhouse gas emitting technologies. This includes support to 21 clean technologies such as renewable energy technologies (wind, solar, hydro, biomass), energy efficient buildings (such as lighting and appliances), industrial processes and sustainable transport measures. With UNDP assistance in the formulation of policy and legislative frameworks Viet Nam drafted an Energy Conservation and Efficiency Law that was enforced on January 2011 and Malaysia enacted a Renewable Energy Act and feed-in-tariff mechanisms. APRC assisted UNDP Country Offices and their partners in both Papua New Guinea and Thailand to conceptualize and formulate new ecosystem projects and worked with the global UNDP/GEF team to secure access to GEF co- financing for these initiatives that will strengthen community access to ecosystem assets: US$6.9 million for activities in Papua New Guinea and US$2 million to support the work in Thailand. APRC regional advisors continued to provide support to ecosystem management initiatives across the region, including nine GEF-funded projects under development and implementation (with a total GEF allocation of US$42 million) and the regional Mangroves for Workers plant mangrove seedlings in an estuary in Bali, Indonesia, at low tide to help fight erosion. 2011 UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Annual Report Page 20 the Future (MFF) initiative now operating in seven Asia-Pacific countries (India, Indonesia, Maldives, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam). A capacity self-assessment framework with specific gender dimensions developed by an APRC cross-practice team of experts was piloted in Sri Lanka by the National Coordinating Body of the Mangroves for the Future programme. The framework identifies and addresses capacity gaps at the institutional and technical implementation levels and will ultimately assist the MFF National Coordination Body to effectively fulfill its mandate. This capacity self-assessment tool is being assessed by the MFF Partnership for potential application to other MFF countries in 2012. As part of their commitments on meeting the control measures of the Montreal Protocol for protecting the Ozone Layer developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region agreed in 2007 to accelerate the phase-out of HCFCs (Hydrochlorofluorocarbons), which are used as refrigerants and blowing agents in air conditioning and refrigeration equipment. During 2011 UNDP assisted ten countries in the region to realize US$95,380,000 in approvals for the period of 2011-2014. This grant funding from the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol (MLF) is for technology transfer investments, technical and policy assistance and other activities for supporting and sustaining phase-out of HCFCs in foams, refrigeration and air conditioning equipment, to low-global warming potential and ozone- friendly alternative technologies. Towards an \u2018Energy Plus\u2019 Approach for the Poor. Between 2009 and 2011 APRC documented good practices and lessons learned in addressing energy poverty and expanding energy services for the poor based on energy access programmes in the Asia-Pacific region. A synthesis report entitled Towards an \u2018Energy Plus\u2019 Approach for the Poor: A Review of good Practices and Lessons Learned from Asia and the Pacific and accompanying 17 case studies as well as an Action Agenda Note were launched in January 2012.

Particular emphasis was placed on using communities of practice as an effective planning and implementation approach. As a result, the fourteen regional communities of practice hosted or moderated by APRC, were invigorated and strengthened to provide solution-oriented exchange of knowledge that was directly applied to improve programme implementation: \uf0fc The Asia-Pacific Community of Practice on HIV, Gender and Human Rights (HIV-APCoP), a vibrant on-line community with 560 active members held two e-discussions with over 33 submissions to the discussion linked to the Asia-Pacific Regional dialogue on the Global Commission on HIV and the Law and 18 specific examples to illustrate the socio- economic impact of HIV on women and girls and the household level; \uf0fc The Asia-Pacific Integrity in Action Network (AP INTACT) grew in the past 20 months from having 60 to over 400 members. Its 4th annual meeting in Kathmandu became a dynamic South-South exchange amongst participants from 20 Asia-Pacific countries on measurements of corruption, implementation of national anti-corruption strategies and anti- corruption in health, education, water, forestry sectors and new technologies to fight corruption. Partially as a result of this meeting, the Indian ipaidabribe.com initiative is now likely to be replicated in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Thailand; \uf0fc At the 5th Asia-Pacific Gender Community of Practice face-to-face event, the regional gender team and 26 gender focal points, specialists and advisors revitalized the core community around a common identity, purpose and set of objectives; strengthened linkages between UNDP Country Offices; expanded the understanding, knowledge and expertise on gender equality priorities; \uf0fc N-Peace evolved into an active knowledge sharing community that offers demand-driven services to over 220 members from some of the most conflict stricken Asia-Pacific countries and uses social media tools effectively in communications and advocacy campaigns. Drawing on the community of practice approach and with support from knowledge management and crisis prevention experts, N-Peace members developed the network\u2019s vision statement, identified new areas for peer-support and collaboration and launched the network\u2019s portal www.n-peace.net to connect, consult and promote their work; \uf0fc Through the Disaster Risk Management Asia Knowledge Community over 250 practitioners adapted a capacity development methodology to disaster risk reduction projects and interventions. APRC experts in crisis prevention and recovery and capacity development finalized it in the form of a Primer on Strengthening Capacities for Disaster Risk Reduction, which is available as an online resource for DRR practitioners across the region; \uf0fc A global e-discussion on social protection, conducted through UNDP\u2019s social platform Teamworks and Lyris, generated over 45 responses accumulating collective experience and knowledge. UNDP staff, development practitioners from United Nations agencies, civil society, academics and independent experts generated more than 750 hits on the Teamworks page and over 87 per cent of feedback from participants highlighted an increased understanding of the complexity of social protection issues thanks to the e-discussion; \uf0fc Twenty-five concrete examples of the role of social media in widening democratic space were shared by over 50 participants in an e-discussion, looking particularly at the role and experiences of civil society organizations from across the region; and \uf0fc APRC experts developed a knowledge sharing mechanism for sustained interaction between the ASEAN Secretariat, the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights and other regional and global mechanisms. It also serves as a platform to frame face-to-face exchanges and identify South-South Cooperation initiatives and partnership among regional human rights bodies. Knowledge networking made headway thanks to the United Nations-sponsored Solution Exchange (SolEx) initiative. The SolEx Outreach team in APRC assisted the launch of four new communities of practice.

The three largest areas of support that accounted for 57 per cent of total service time were Environment and Energy (25 per cent), Democratic Governance (17 per cent) and HIV, Health and Development (15 per cent). By country classification the service time was distributed to middle income countries (46 per cent), least developed countries (per cent) and least income countries (13 per cent). By sub-region: Southeast Asia (46 per cent), South Asia (34 per cent), East Asia (11 per cent) and the Pacific (9 per cent). Ninety-eight per cent of the requesters were satisfied with the timeliness and relevance of APRC\u2019s support; 96 per cent believed APRC support has made impact on their work. 2011 UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Annual Report Page 23 APRC Partnerships \uf0fc APRC works on a number of enduring development issues with regional intergovernmental organizations such as ASEAN; SAARC; and the network of the Pacific Islands Regional Organizations; \uf0fc A partnership existing between ADB, UNDP and UNESCAP to accelerate MDG progress in the Asia-Pacific since 2004 has resulted in better monitoring, awareness raising and advocacy for improved policies for achieving the MDGs. Six Asia-Pacific MDG Reports produced so far are the landmark result of this tripartite collaboration; \uf0fc Partnering on-policy advocacy for an efficient HIV response across the region materialized in important results. APRC-led assistance in drafting renewed commitment to HIV/AIDS was endorsed at the ASEAN Summit in Bali. APRC\u2019s engagement in the Colombo Process (migration) meeting resulted in the Dhaka Declaration including recommendation on migrant-inclusive health policies. A partnership consultation with SAARC resulted in a plan to launch a SAARC APEX body for women and girls living with HIV; \uf0fc Under the regional partnership between UN Women, UNESCAP, UNFPA and UNDP, APRC helped organize the inaugural meeting of the Asia-Pacific Advisory Group on Women, Peace and Security, which is the first regional high-level advisory panel of its kind. The Advisory Group was set-up to support the United Nations Regional Coordination Mechanism Thematic Working Group on Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women and other stakeholders for effective implementation of UN Security Council Resolution on Women, Peace and Security in the region; and \uf0fc As an active member of the Secretary General\u2019s UNiTE campaign for the Asia-Pacific UNDP supported the advocacy campaign, the development of a Regional Action Plan and participated in the Global UNiTE Meeting hosted in Bangkok. Asia-Pacific Regional Programme - Financial Results in a Snapshot The 2011 financial support from our partners to UNDP regional projects and initiatives amounts to US$6,703,053; in the period 2008-2011 APRC received cost-sharing contributions totaling US$19,542,350. Our top donor countries in 2011 were Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom. 2011 UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Annual Report Page 24 In 2011 APRC awarded US$621,651 in grants to nine civil society organizations for the implementation of joint public advocacy and capacity development initiatives in the areas of gender equality, democratic governance and crisis prevention, HIV, health and development. APRC is currently implementing two civil society-led grants from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria addressing the HIV needs of men who have sex with men covering 11 countries in South Asia and Insular Southeast Asia.

vulnerabilities in the Pacific 3 Executive Summary The objective of this report is to provide a rapid assessment of migration and mobility as key influences on the distribution and spread of HIV in the Pacific. While this has been established globally with targeted and tailored prevention programmes on mobility and HIV in a number of countries, the Pacific has yet to develop appropriate responses that take migration and mobility into consideration and ensure that HIV interventions address the drivers of mobility and the specific vulnerabilities that mobility creates. It is expected that this report will contribute to the development of multi-sectoral responses required to address the HIV epidemic in the Pacific region and provide the impetus for the development of effective and targeted interventions for people on the move. The report establishes migration, mobility and urbanisation as key facilitating factors in the transmission and spread of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the Pacific. Although HIV was first detected in the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) in 1982, Papua New Guinea (PNG) has the highest recorded cases in the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa4a4dc0-cf3e-4f75-b6cc-b9be98b1f9c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa4a4dc0-cf3e-4f75-b6cc-b9be98b1f9c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Migration, Mobility and HIV: A Rapid Assessment of Risks and Vulnerabilities in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a093114c2e260214afad1c052a1abe2919c11032076d5181b0c9e9b986c802e5"}}, "hash": "a093114c2e260214afad1c052a1abe2919c11032076d5181b0c9e9b986c802e5", "text": "region today. Case numbers outside of Papua New Guinea remain low, however, the high prevalence of STIs and teenage pregnancies point to the possibility of possible higher HIV transmission in the future. According to reported data in most Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs), sexual activity, heterosexual predominantly, is by far the most common mode of HIV transmission. However, vertical transmission (from mother- to-child) and transmission through the sharing of infected needles amongst injecting drug user is also reported although the latter remains relatively uncommon in the Pacific compared to Asia and other regions. This report reviews a number of different migration behaviours in the Pacific. Open island economies are fragile and many rely heavily on migration for economic opportunity to the point of being characterised by some as MIRAB economies (Migration, Remittances, Aid and Bureaucracy). There is a dichotomy between predominantly internal migration, notably urbanisation, and external migration \u2013 individuals leaving the Pacific and those entering the region. Within this broad pattern are vastly divergent mobile groups such as skilled workers, seafarers, students, traders, civil servants, military personnel and sex workers. These groups are mobile and characterised by different behaviours, access to services and risk exposure to HIV and STIs. While the report covers all Pacific island states, some emphasis is given to Papua New Guinea where the prevalence and impact of HIV are greatest. According to country data collected by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) from the end of 2008, there were about 29,631 cumulative reported cases of HIV and AIDs across all Pacific Island Countries and Territories, of which 28,294 in Papua New Guinea alone. The high prevalence of HIV in Papua New Guinea points to the significance of internal migration, rather than international migration. Most internal migration is to the larger urban centres and to some mining towns that are \u201chot spots\u201d for HIV transmission. In the Pacific, the rationale for urbanisation is consistent throughout the region as employment opportunities and services such as education and health are concentrated in the urban areas. Within PNG, the contemporary incidence of HIV is seen as having much to do with \u201cmobile men with money\u201d MMM- who characterise larger urban areas and are even personified as a new kind of \u201csugar daddy\u201d \u2013 the dakglas kar man (dark glass car man): businessmen, landowners and politicians with plenty of disposable income (Lepani 2008a). However, international migration is also on the increase with some migrant groups vulnerable. Workers who engage in circular migration such as working in mines, construction, plantations/forestry and military personnel are at higher HIV risk exposure due to long periods away from home, relatively high salaries and a risk-taking ethos. Another group that also exhibits risky sexual behaviour is transport workers and seafarers. They tend to be younger males who leave their families for extended periods of time, have relatively well paid employment in distant locations and are more likely to turn to commercial sex. Sex workers, both commercial and transactional, are also at-risk communities, many of whom migrate domestically or internationally. Sex workers are often some of the most marginalised members of society, thus heightening their vulnerability to HIV. High risk sexual behaviour and high levels of migration coincide in urban areas. Urban populations grow steadily alongside a growing \u201cfloating\u201d urban population of informal squatter settlements. Commercial sex and the unprotected sex that is associated with it is a key source of HIV and STI transmission, and is mainly an urban phenomenon. Commercial sex tends to concentrate on locations where foreign visitors can be found such as in ports, development enclaves, military installations and tourism locations. In such situations, HIV risk is indirectly linked to poverty or Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 4 hardship. Many of the mobile groups such as soldiers, seafarers and guest workers have some degree of economic foundation compared to other members of the population. Persons providing sexual services to these groups (mostly women) are, however, often driven by poverty and lack of opportunity. The lack of specific data on the sexual behaviour and risk factors of migrant groups in the Pacific makes the development of firm conclusions difficult. Additionally, information on the number and trends of migrant groups such as guest workers and students is not currently available. Given this, more research is needed to determine levels of risk and factors that drive decision-making of mobility and sexual behaviour. While all countries have some degree of mobility-related HIV vulnerability, a few countries stand out.

Additionally, Guam, Northern Marianas, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Palau, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia and French Polynesia have relatively significant sex worker populations, growing urbanisation and other high risk migrant groups such as soldiers and seafarers. Some specific urban centres such as Suva in Fiji, Honiara in Solomon Islands, Guam, Saipan in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and Tarawa in Kiribati are hotspots worthy of further/enhanced preventive interventions. Greater recognition is needed over the present and potential significance of migration for the transmission of HIV in order to develop effective interventions specifically suited to the Pacific\u2019s social, epidemiological and behavioural context.

KIRIBATI HAWAI\u2019I Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 10 The Pacific region has a strong tradition of mobility. The current migration situation varies dramatically from country to country, and within each country. Urbanisation and internal migration are predominant in Melanesia while international migration is more significant in Micronesia and Polynesia, and is increasing. However, recent labour migration from Vanuatu and other Melanesian countries suggests some limited convergence between the regions. Australia has recently followed New Zealand\u2019s seasonal worker/ fruit picking scheme, granting allocations of time-limited work visas to Pacific island nationals each year. In almost every context, migration occurs for economic reasons in response to uneven development, though there are social considerations. While economic development issues and the role of employment in migration are significant, migration and mobility and their link to HIV risk and transmission are not strictly just a question of poverty. Despite increased concern over the prevalence of HIV in the Pacific region, there is still limited data available. The first case of HIV in the Pacific was reported in 1982 in Northern Marianas followed by French Polynesia in 1984 and Guam in 1985. HIV cases have since been reported in most countries except in small and isolated states like Niue and Tokelau (Sladden 2005). While the numbers are low in most countries (although there is probably significant under-reporting), nowhere are they declining. Papua New Guinea stands out from the rest of the Pacific in terms of its HIV situation and, through its large population, distinct internal migration structure, economic and social diversity and urbanisation. Given the definition of vulnerability to HIV as \u201cthe lack of power of individual and communities to minimize or modulate their risk of exposure to HIV infection and, once infected, to receive adequate care and support\u201d (Gruskin et al 2002), it is not so much migration itself that is relevant for HIV vulnerability, but the social context that drives migrant behaviour. As an International Organization for Migration (IOM) report from 2006 notes: Potential risk factors for migrants include separation from families and partners, and separation from the socio-cultural norms that guide behaviours in more stable communities. Population mobility may also affect HIV vulnerability of people who do not migrate at all, such as people in communities along major transit corridors or Introduction with major construction sites, or those whose partners are working abroad. Finally, migrants often have limited access to health services, including to health promotion, to HIV prevention, to voluntary counselling and testing, and to HIV care and support. In a broader sense, and in the Pacific context too, higher HIV risk exposure has therefore been associated with increased mobility (Herdt 1997). More specifically, in Papua New Guinea, it has been linked to the rise of a relatively new social group called \u201cmobile men with money\u201d (MMM). This is primarily an urban phenomenon but is significant in many social contexts of high population movement and economic disparity. This is especially so where men are involved in various forms of itinerant wage labour, often in resource enclaves such as mining and logging, and where limited educational and employment opportunities for women encourage commercial and transactional sex (Lepani 2008a: 152, Wardlow 2007, Koczberski 2000, Wilde 2007). In several rural parts of Papua New Guinea and elsewhere in the region, HIV is seen as a \u201cforeign disease\u201d that can only be contracted by people moving away from their home areas (Wilde 2007), or is associated with tourists coming into the Pacific.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c31ec3d6-db69-43d7-8569-25d090d9bf99": {"__data__": {"id_": "c31ec3d6-db69-43d7-8569-25d090d9bf99", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Migration, Mobility and HIV: A Rapid Assessment of Risks and Vulnerabilities in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26343f7a9a662a556e54b1617176d344176e38718949d6be2f23b85d2f8a2f93"}, "2": {"node_id": "ac0502ab-65b2-4bff-9e2d-6475e87b34bd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1986575218a1403fdabd72631f6c54b4abece035f9f9f468395bb607f41ff5f8"}}, "hash": "c49415f93569127b8b730384e86c1884dabe75796c205ab14885bc2d34357f18", "text": "Based on the situation in other parts of the world, it is reasonable to argue that understanding the complex issues of migration, mobility and HIV is critical to addressing the HIV epidemic both regionally and globally.

Migration data are collected very differently within the Pacific (for example according to de facto or de jure populations) and in the main destinations (New Zealand, Australia and the United States of America). At this stage, therefore, clear conclusions on the basic geography of both HIV and migration are impossible. Similarly, data on HIV incidence, awareness and sexual behaviours are highly uneven. There are large numbers of sources for information on HIV and AIDS in the Pacific, though consistency, quality and scope vary considerably. Reports Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 11 from the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS) exist for 5 countries in the region while other prevalence and epidemiological data are available from various surveys and documents (Pacific Regional HIV/AIDS Project Country Updates 2007, Pacific Regional Strategy on HIV/AIDS 2004-2008 and 2009-2013, Jenkins 2005, WHO 2006, Report of the commission on AIDS in the Pacific 2009). Mobile populations and migrant behaviour (other than seafarers) are not explicitly mentioned in the Pacific Regional Strategy on HIV and Other STIs 2004-2008 (Pacific Regional Strategy 2005). And while the Pacific Strategy 2009-2013 notes migrant and mobile populations as one of a number of key populations, the targeted and tailored prevention programmes for mobile populations still need to be further developed (SPC 2008). The International Organization for Migration, which has programmes on mobility and HIV in Latin America, Asia, Africa and Europe, does not have any programmes in the Pacific. While the issue of mobility and HIV is acknowledged in the Pacific and there have been some activities with specific groups, there has been no comprehensive focus on this area and further attention is needed. Data on sexual behaviour and social aspects of sexual intercourse are more accessible in Papua New Guinea than for some of the smaller island states (though the social diversity of Papua New Guinea means that what is valid in one cultural group may be invalid elsewhere in the country). However, speaking on sexual matters is socially inappropriate in most contexts (thus challenging the development of educational programmes) and some of the established churches (which hold considerable social importance) discourage the promotion of condoms (which are not easy to find on sale in many parts of the region). Approaches to sexually transmitted infections and HIV have not been consistent in education or health programmes (partly because of low prevalence) with the generally low status of women and the special health risks they face as well as sexual violence placing them at a higher risk of HIV. Women in PNG have low life expectancy largely because of the health risks posed by childbirth, malnutrition and malaria. Women also have a literacy rate about 10 per cent lower than men. While almost equal numbers of men and women are reported to have HIV, women are generally infected at a younger age. Women are particularly disadvantaged by limited employment opportunities and may lack information about medical services, counselling or support services. Because of the difficulties of economic survival, many women trade sex for money or other goods. In some circumstances, sexual transactions are brokered by male relatives [Hammar, 1998].

How HIV spreads in a community is shaped by culture, economy and complex social interactions. \u201cVulnerability to HIV and AIDS has increasingly come to be understood as fundamentally linked to questions of social and economic equality and justice\u201d (Parker 2000).

However, some will be more vulnerable as a group due to the selectivity of the migration process which means that people with higher HIV risk exposure are more mobile (i.e sex workers, seamen, soldiers, miners...). The context of the migrant is determinant at destination and while migrating in particular and may predispose toward high risk behaviour\u201d Vulnerability to HIV is not just an issue for migrants or mobile individuals only. It involves families and communities. Moreover, as Paul Farmer noted of rural Haitian women, \u201cthe chief risk factors seem to involve not number of partners but rather the professions of these partners\u201d (Farmer 1999). Another reason for viewing HIV vulnerability as a family issue is that migration decisions are often taken in the context of nuclear and extended family considerations and constraints. \u201cVulnerability to HIV is not just an issue for migrants or mobile individuals. It involves families and communities\u201d The above contextualisation informs the present assessment. Though this document is organised by mobile groups, the interactions between the groups are significant and the organisation of the review is not meant to imply that these groups are static in their composition and that there are no links between them. Understanding the interaction and sexual networking between these groups is necessary to address vulnerability and develop appropriate responses. A study in the Marshall Islands documented \u201chigh risk sexual networking links between foreign sex workers, seafarers, Marshallese young women involved in the informal exchange of sex, local women and men, and migrant and expatriate workers\u201d (Buchanan-Aruwafu 2007). This complexity needs to serve as an underlying framework for the review, as similar and different complexities exist elsewhere. This rapid assessment aims to contribute to current, broader efforts to understand the epidemiology and social- behavioural context of the disease in the region toward more Pacific-centred solutions rather than simply adopting models developed for other parts of the world. Such an approach depends on multi-disciplinary or integrated initiatives and research on critical areas such as mobility and migration. Box 1. Why do people move? People move from one place to another temporarily, seasonally or permanently due to a host of push and pull factors. Pull factors include the search for professional or economic opportunities or to join family members living away from home. Examples of push factors include poverty, food insecurity, warfare or other violence, human rights abuses, political repression, ethnic tensions, and persecution. There is ample evidence to demonstrate a close association between increased vulnerability during mobility and the spread of HIV, and many people believe that migrants and mobile populations bring HIV with them when entering countries or communities. Evidence has established, however, that the opposite is more likely to be the case: rather than bringing diseases, migrants often become vulnerable to contracting HIV during transit and after they arrive at their destinations. The linkages between population mobility and HIV/AIDS are related to the conditions and structures of the migration process, including in communities of origin, during transit, at destinations, and on return. Factors linking population mobility and increased vulnerability to HIV include poverty, lack of legal protection and of power, discrimination, and exploitation. (International Organization for Migration 2005) Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 13 Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 14 The methodology undertaken in this desk review has been an exhaustive search for and analysis of existing documentation on migration and HIV. A mix of existing qualitative and quantitative data has been used to determine estimates of the number of people who migrate in the Pacific as well as a description of the populations. These sources include epidemiological data available from the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, the World Health Organisation and United Nations sources, programmatic data from the Pacific Regional HIV/AIDS Project (PRHP) and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, newspaper articles and academic literature, and some online sources. Relevant experiences from other parts of the world have been included though it is acknowledged that those experiences may not be directly applicable to the Pacific. The review is intended to be as comprehensive as possible, and therefore includes data that has been reliably verified but also anecdotes and assertions found in various reports. While it is acknowledged that some of these assertions might not be verified, given the lack of data and research in some areas, such information is needed to give a full picture of the complex", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c6e5cbf-e98d-4960-a741-0b0d678672db": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c6e5cbf-e98d-4960-a741-0b0d678672db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Migration, Mobility and HIV: A Rapid Assessment of Risks and Vulnerabilities in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d0f4df636d1a4539a5f943c83f162284f45a8652402df8ea64362beba7a5faa"}}, "hash": "0d0f4df636d1a4539a5f943c83f162284f45a8652402df8ea64362beba7a5faa", "text": "world of mobility in the Pacific. Migrant groups have been identified along a number of axes focusing on type of employment, reason for migration and characteristics. The document is organised in two broad sections: migration that is predominantly internal to the Pacific island countries and territories and migration Methodology that is predominantly international. Acknowledging that these categories are too blunt, they nevertheless provide a useful frame for analysis. For each of the migration groups identified, discussion of HIV vulnerability behaviours and access to services are addressed using existing reports from comparable groups in other parts of the world where specific data are available. Using the information collected, maps can be created to highlight areas where migration is significant and rate routes or destinations as high, medium or low risk for HIV transmission. Because of the complexity of this task and the difficulty in collecting adequate data, this has been done sparingly at this stage. While this report covers all Pacific island states, it has given some emphasis to Papua New Guinea where the prevalence and impact of HIV are greatest. Papua New Guinea is also a country with particular challenges where more practical policies and solutions have been put in place, and where data on the social context is more readily available. Less emphasis has been placed on smaller states, where the prevalence of HIV is minimal and documentation is limited or non-existent. The report has not been able to comment adequately on the situation in the French territories of New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna and French Polynesia due to the lack of sufficient data accessible to English speakers. While some data points are included, more evidence will be needed to strengthen assertions. Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 15 Background Population In the Pacific where data exists, they are generally adequate enough to enable gross estimates of the populations where migration/mobility is significant. Though a small number of countries have poor census data, good census data exists for most countries in the region. All Pacific states are still going through the demographic transition but population growth remains high in some places, including the larger Melanesian states (see Table 3). While the average population growth rate in the region is around 2%, in Vanuatu and Solomon Islands it is around 2.6% but it is decreasing. Only in Fiji has there been significant adoption of modern family planning techniques. Outside Melanesia, emigration has long been an important regulator of demographic change, especially as modern contraception has not been easily available. Hence migration has partly been a \u201csafety valve\u201d for both population growth and economic stagnation. In almost every state, population growth rates are as high as or higher than economic growth rates. Life expectancies have risen over the past quarter of a century but remain lowest in Melanesia - less than 55 in PNG but over 70 in most Polynesian states. Longer life expectancies, aging and growing populations, the rise of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the migration of people in working age groups have increased the stress on all health care systems. Infant mortality rates are highest in Melanesia, with Vanuatu (at 67 per 1000) the worst of the region compared with most parts of Polynesia (less than 15 per 1000). In PNG, infant mortality is increasing because of inadequate and declining provision of health services to rural areas. Total fertility rates (Table 3) remain very high, especially in parts of Melanesia and Micronesia because contraceptive rates are low compared with developing countries of similar income levels (Ahlburg 1996). Fertility control is a taboo topic in most Pacific countries and contraceptive prevalence rates (CPR) vary throughout the region but are rarely above 40% and may be as low as 3-4 % in Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. Although recent surveys have shown increases in Vanuatu (37%) and Solomon Is (34%), most data are suspect or include significant reliance on \u201ctraditional\u201d methods (Rallu and Ahlburg 2008). Data on unmet contraceptive needs available from health surveys during 2006-7 in the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Solomon Islands and Nauru show that teenagers have higher unmet needs in the Marshall Islands. Many reasons explain limited use of modern family planning techniques including the need for the work of children, conservative social and religious attitudes and the unavailability (and perhaps expense) of contraceptives. A decade ago Port Vila had a fertility rate of 4.5 compared with a national average of 5.3. In 1994 more than half of urban women reported that they used contraception.

This situation was and is probably true of other Melanesian towns and cities. The only independent state with relatively high access to family planning is Fiji, where in 1990 some 27% of women were reported to be using contraception. Health Health status varies considerably within the Pacific. The large Melanesian states have the lowest levels of access to essential primary health services (Taylor, Bampton and Lopez 2005) while the less tropical states with substantial aid, notably Niue and the Cook Islands, have fewer health problems and better funded health services. Variations are a function of local conditions, economic and social development, the isolation of many parts of Melanesian and Micronesian states, and the status of health care. Even greater variations exist in health services provision and financing. At the core of the uneven distribution of human resources, hospital beds and other physical resources are the significant variations in funding, in absolute terms, and in the proportion of national budgets spent on health care. Health services are highly concentrated in urban areas. The reductions in spending on health care systems in the Pacific, that became evident from the 1980s, have had a damaging result in sustaining a skilled health labour force, meeting national health needs and developing preventative systems that are appropriate for dealing with HIV. Small Pacific island countries and territories continue to face significant health challenges ranging from the spread of malaria in Melanesia to the rise of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) throughout the Pacific (Gani 2008). These health challenges also include \u201cthe unfinished agenda in achieving the MDGs, high fertility rates, continued prevalence of communicable diseases and emerging threat of HIV/ AIDS, combined with a rising, and in many cases a crisis in, NCD prevalence\u201d (World Bank 2007).

In several parts of Polynesia and Micronesia, suicide rates are very high. The Pacific, particularly the Marshall Islands, has some of the highest rates of youth suicides in the world (Rubinstein 1992, Booth 1999, ADB 2006:118, Jenkins and McSwain 2005). In Samoa a couple of decades ago, this high suicide rate was associated with migration because of the breakdown of family structures by the absence of parents during migration (Hezel 1989) and the declining opportunities (Macpherson and Macpherson 1987). HIV As of 2007, there were an estimated 33 million people living with HIV and AIDS globally (UNAIDS 2008). Most of these cases are in sub-Saharan Africa (67%) followed by south and south-east Asia (13%). The Pacific region accounts for just 0.2% of the global burden of HIV, with the majority of these cases occurring in Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand. According to data from the Secretariat of the Pacific Community from the end of 2008, there were about 29,631 cumulative reported cases of HIV and AIDS across all Pacific island countries and territories, of which over 28,000 cases occurred in Papua New Guinea (Table 4). However, the 2007 Estimation Report on the HIV Epidemic in Papua New Guinea estimates that there are in fact 54,000 cases of HIV in Papua New Guinea, demonstrating the difficulties in obtaining reliable epidemiological data both nationally (National AIDS Council PNG 2008) and in particular regions (Haley 2008). While there are low numbers of HIV in the Pacific \u2013 barring Papua New Guinea in particular and New Caledonia, Guam and French Polynesia to a lesser degree \u2013 a number of social and behavioural factors common across the region present risk factors for transmission. The primary means of HIV transmission in the Pacific is via unprotected heterosexual intercourse. Levels of sexually transmitted infections are relatively high, in some islands even appearing in the leading five causes of morbidity (eg. WHO CNMI 2007, WHO New Caledonia 2007). Other significant risk factors include highly mobile populations, a large population of seafarers, attitudes of taboo toward sex and sex education, and high levels of stigma and fear surrounding HIV (Hammar 2007; Jenkins 2005). Data collection and research on the extent of the sale of sexual services and male-to-male sex, and their effects on HIV, have been limited to Papua New Guinea. Additionally, there are relatively high levels of early sexual debut and unprotected sex among young people (Jenkins 2005; WHO 2006). While levels of awareness are increasing, the response to the epidemic in the region has not been sufficient to date. Papua New Guinea stands out as the Pacific nation most affected by HIV and AIDS. It is critically important to understand why this has been so, what policies and practices might reduce the extent and minimize the further spread of HIV and what the experiences of Papua New Guinea imply for the rest of the region. The factors driving the epidemic in Papua New Guinea are not universally agreed but low levels of condom use, concurrent sexual partnerships, unequal gender relations which restrict the ability of women to negotiate safe sexual practices, high prevalence of untreated sexually transmitted infections, low levels of literacy, a weak health system within patriarchal societies and a high prevalence of sexual violence against women are all posited as explanations (Hammar 2007, Wardlow 2007, Dundon and Wilde 2007). Moreover, in many parts of Papua New Guinea, basic knowledge of HIV is largely absent (Wilde 2007, Haley 2008, Lepani 2008b). Both commercial sex and increased HIV transmission have followed increased urban poverty and greater rural poverty such as in the context of the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea (Wardlow 2007: 1008, Wardlow 2008). In some places where alternative incomes are particularly difficult to obtain, commercial sex has become \u201csurvival sex\u201d (Beer 2008). Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 18 Population mobility, however, is another factor that is not sufficiently understood, but the relatively recent emergence of mobile men with money is a significant factor in the rise of HIV, and a measure of the importance of mobility. The combination of mobility and extramarital relationships has meant that marriage tends to be a very significant risk factor in Papua New Guinea as it is in other parts of the world.

The increase in sexually transmitted infections coincides with a recent increase in teenage pregnancies. Rates of condom use at last high-risk sex with a non-commercial partner ranges from 12.5% in Fiji to 45.1% in the Solomon Islands (WHO 2006). In the Second Generation Surveillance conducted by the World Health Organization, Secretariat of the Pacific Community and University of New South Wales, the percentage of youths reporting 2 or more sexual partners in the last 12 months ranged from 43.3% in Vanuatu to 12.7% in Samoa (WHO 2006). In Saipan, teenagers are sexually active and condom use is less than 20%. In Fiji and Vanuatu, survey respondents believed that a large majority of the population was sexually active before marriage (Ahlburg and Larson 1995). High teenage fertility is consistent with low contraceptive prevalence among teenagers. This is linked to the more general factors noted above, alongside the lack of information and reluctance of teenagers to visit health centres to discuss sexual and reproductive health as well as social disapproval of (illegitimate) births in some contexts. Extra-marital sex may also be increasing in significance. In Papua New Guinea, data indicate that 23% of married men, 6% of married women, 33% of bachelors and 12% of spinsters aged 15 to 49 years reported having non-regular sex in the last 12 months (that is, sex with a person who is not a regular partner or a spouse). Individuals with a high prevalence of changing sex partners play a disproportionate role in the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Of Tonga\u2019s 9 HIV cases since 1998, four were believed to have become infected while in the United States and one other while travelling overseas (Viekune 1998).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8d68005-ff26-4726-8185-2b441c2ebe62": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8d68005-ff26-4726-8185-2b441c2ebe62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Migration, Mobility and HIV: A Rapid Assessment of Risks and Vulnerabilities in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28a53d93c88b8cbfcdbc8c7a1104f5954ba9d367c8ebf28a3f4d5a9e904f8a21"}, "2": {"node_id": "01cdb14a-2812-4049-91b3-8b58adb53d11", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1885a6fdb251e3faee4c583a2c887fd6bbcd1394246c467e96007d5e38743eee"}}, "hash": "6a6a5ec9e7b6601cdb15ab4ea9fc77c7884ef52c87bc27b0a4349d06ac235802", "text": "Similarly, New Caledonia\u2019s 2008 HIV report contains a table outlining the risk factors that led to the infection of 316 people living with HIV or AIDS (PLWHA) in the territory.

A recent UNAIDS report on the Mapping of restrictions on the entry, stay and residence of people living with HIV or AIDS highlights these restrictions since the beginning of the HIV epidemic as governments have used these measures as an attempt to prevent the spread of HIV and avoid the possible cost of treatment and care related to HIV. However, there is growing international momentum to rescind HIV-related restrictions given the recognition by public health and human rights experts that there is no public health rationale for them and that they are discriminatory and could well impede effective HIV responses. Economic Development, Income and Remittances The economies of Pacific island countries and territories are constrained by various factors linked to their size, remoteness and isolation, diseconomies of scale, scarce natural and human resources, and vulnerability to external shocks and natural hazards. Commercial agriculture has been hindered by world prices, access and attitudes, and key commodities such as sugar in Fiji which has been propped up by preferential trade systems. Similarly, fisheries failed to achieve broad economic success and licence fees from leasing exclusive economic zones to distant states have been an important income source. Mining is highly localised and has brought limited benefits to local landowners. Industrial development is largely absent but tourism has flourished locally despite its vulnerability to economic uncertainty and political instability. Two consequences of limited economic development have been an increased push toward migration and a substantial dependence on overseas aid. The decline or stagnation of the productive sector, especially agriculture, and the growth of imports offset by aid, remittances and tourism revenues in a situation where much employment is concentrated in the Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 20 public sector has led to the conceptualisation of the smallest Pacific island states as MIRAB (Migration, Remittances, Aid, Bureaucracy) states (Bertram and Watters 1995). This analysis, first propounded for Kiribati, Tuvalu, Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau, is applicable to a greater or lesser extent in most island states. Aid dependence emphasises vulnerability. The combination of migration, growing urban permanence (see Section 9 below), few new urban employment opportunities and the lack of industrialisation has resulted in the growing significance of the informal sector as a source of livelihood \u2013 though governments have been slow to recognise its role in employment creation and poverty alleviation. In some of the larger cities - particularly Port Moresby and Suva - the most visible elements of the informal sector include marketing. Formal sector employment in Kiribati is estimated at only 21% of adults, and often these individuals have to support large households. Only around one-quarter of the 2000 annual school leavers can hope to find full employment (ADB 2002). Even formal sector employment does not guarantee escaping income poverty. In Fiji in the mid-1990s, about 47% of full-time employed people lived below the poverty line and two-thirds of these were women. In the future, the informal sector is likely to be the most important and accessible entry point into business and income generation for the poor. A very significant proportion of female workers in the informal sector in Papua New Guinea are sex workers (Levantis 1997) and these proportions may be increasing elsewhere. Given the challenges of finding formal or informal sector employment there and elsewhere, it is likely that both numbers and proportions will grow in most urban areas (see Urbanisation section below). Urban poverty is more than just an insufficient income. It is also about lack of services, poor living conditions, difficulty in meeting basic needs and a lack of representation in the decision-making process. The growth in urban poverty is likely to become the most important development in the Pacific over the coming decade and threatens progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. Because of the prevalence of the informal sector, there are few adequate measures of employment in use in the region. In the early 1990s, a third of the population of Port Moresby was searching for work, with most of the unemployed being in the 15\u201319 age group and many of them with little or no education (Connell 1997: 196). The extent of urban unemployment has contributed to social disorganisation.

In most other states, they are probably somewhere in between, though they may be between 10% and 15% in Fiji, Cook Islands, Palau and Samoa. Poverty is resulting from, and manifested in, increasing urban populations, a lack of employment opportunities, the absence of effective safety nets, and limited access to land and quality housing. In squatter settlements, hunger and poverty are no longer unusual, nor is the sight of families picking through municipal garbage sites for food and other goods. A further consequence of difficult urban conditions is the growth of suicide and domestic violence, though neither are exclusively urban phenomena, and the increase in the number of female-headed households that follows on the heels of family breakdown and social disorganisation. Such female-headed households have significant problems of income generation and may result in some orientation towards commercial sex work. Though based on small samples, a number of recent surveys from the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the Ecumenical Centre for Research, Education and Advocacy (ECREA) and academics in Fiji have pointed to the following trends. Firstly, about 80% of those living in informal settlements in Suva fall below the \u201cpoverty line\u201d (although this is an estimated figure); secondly average incomes in settlements were $90-100/week, even though at least one adult was working full time and most families had a second source of income; thirdly urban poverty is increasing with migration and growth. In 1997, urban poverty was estimated at 27.6% of the Fiji population, in 2002 29.3% of urban households fell below the poverty line and figures released in 2006 estimate that between one- quarter and one-third of urban populations continue to live below the poverty line. Urban poverty in the region\u2019s smaller states is also related to low incomes and high rates of domestic migration, leading to overcrowding. In south Tarawa, for example, those living below the poverty line had a household average of 11.7 persons compared to families above the poverty line with 7.7 persons/household (ADB 2002: 68). As a reflection of the lack of space, knowledge and essential tools, I-Kiribati on Tarawa are increasingly dependent on the monetary economy and imported food. Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 21 Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 22 In almost all Pacific island states, urban poverty is a growing problem. It is poorly measured and understood, and constitutes both an absolute poverty in terms of lack of adequate incomes and a poverty of opportunity. Urban poverty is more than just an insufficient income. It is also about lack of services, poor living conditions, difficulty in meeting basic needs and a lack of representation in the decision-making process. The growth in urban poverty is likely to become the most important development in the Pacific over the coming decade and threatens progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Incomes and Remittances In some states, urbanisation and low incomes have resulted in a downward spiral where there is little hope of improvement, waiting for uncertain opportunities, securing multiple jobs, maintaining strict budgets and abandoning some \u2018traditional\u2019 obligations to get by. Urban and rural \u2018safety nets\u2019, where extended families support those with problems, are breaking down. Absolute poverty is increasing, but a poverty of opportunity and dignity is more critical. Poverty data have been unavailable in the past partly because, amongst other reasons, poverty was considered non-existent by Pacific governments. Only three countries - Fiji, Samoa and Kiribati - have the most basic time series data. Poverty is more easily measurable in Fiji because of the greater extent of monetisation of the economy, even in rural areas where poverty is more prevalent than in urban areas (38% against 32%). By contrast Vanuatu and Solomon Islands have higher poverty in urban (33%) than in rural areas (between 15% and 20%) due to the lower cost of living and the large subsistence economy in rural areas. Tonga and Samoa are estimated to have about 20% of their population under national poverty lines, but percentages are probably higher in most parts of Micronesia (38% in FSM and around 50% in Kiribati and the Marshall Islands) and also in Papua New Guinea (30%).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "64c96a78-2236-4a52-96f5-c09e9cb561a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "64c96a78-2236-4a52-96f5-c09e9cb561a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Migration, Mobility and HIV: A Rapid Assessment of Risks and Vulnerabilities in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f39209d381340645dcc8204da86b2f1a565aaacb9ab93fe74b2826cab77f8bab"}, "2": {"node_id": "a5b87bf5-623c-447c-b402-eb3ec90f5f6b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "772e2b32d6eaf7fcb1de445df09d7262d901f36358633c1f15162b9a0340a50c"}}, "hash": "db4b978ce6f3964c9e5d317258690a3f3d5db131fe3e5406e6cf769775ea468d", "text": "Weak national economies and low national incomes suggest that most island states are ill-prepared to tackle poverty, HIV and sexual and reproductive health issues which directly affect population growth and well-being.

Income inequality has increased in recent years as has the extent of poverty and hardship (Abbott and Pollard 2004, ECREA 2006). In such circumstances, remittances play an increasingly important role in national and household incomes, especially in the smaller island states. In many countries, remittances form a significant part of disposable income. In states such as Samoa and Tonga, they constitute some of the highest proportions of the Gross National Product (GNP) of any country in the world. In both countries remittances are well over 50% of GNP and in aggregate more than three times the total value of exports (Connell and Brown 2005). Remittances are also steadily increasing in Micronesia and now notably in Fiji. On the coral atoll of Nanumea in Tuvalu, remittances grew from being about half of the island income in the 1970s and 1980s to some 75% in the 1990s, in large part because of the collapse of copra marketing as world prices slumped (Chambers and Chambers 2001: 156). In Kiribati, the 2000 census recorded that overseas remittances, primarily from seamen, were the primary source of income for as many as 30% of households in the urban centre of south Tarawa. And in 2002, some 35% of all households in Tuvalu received remittances. Conventional wisdom suggests that remittances are overwhelmingly used for consumption and inadequate amounts are directed towards investment. After debt repayment and new forms of consumption (housing, community projects, air fares and education), remittances are used for various forms of investment in the agricultural sector but more frequently in the service sector such as stores and transport businesses. Migration The movement of people within and between islands has intensified in volume, increased in distance and become more complex in pattern and purpose since the conclusion of the Second World War. The shift of Pacific islanders from rural to urban locales has also become more permanent. With the development of modern transportation, the continued stagnation of rural economic development and the increasing significance of urban economies in globalising spaces, the opportunity for and logic of migration has increased in a region that has historically been characterised by high mobility. Throughout the Pacific there are a number of general trends in population movement, although not all are necessarily present. First, international migration extends beyond the region; second, small islands are being depopulated as people move to large islands; third, mountain populations are moving to lowlands, usually along the coast; and fourth, urban populations are continuing to grow. Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 23 Alongside migration, there is considerable short term mobility. Some of this, such as working as shipping crew, may extend over very long distances, and some work employment (for example in mines) takes workers for lengthy periods away from their home areas. There is also significant short-term mobility such as the movement of students to universities, colleges and boarding schools, and patterns of visiting that take people to stay with their kin for various periods of time. Over the past two decades, two themes have remained central to migration in the Pacific region. Firstly, there has been continued centralisation of populations on large islands and especially in urban centres as people have moved to take advantage of new employment opportunities and access to modern services. Secondly, international migration to the metropolitan states on the periphery of the region has continued. Both trends complement each other as Pacific populations increasingly become more urban. They have also intensified in the present century as economic circumstances in the region have worsened. Less numerically important trends, but with significant social consequences, have involved the movement of larger numbers of migrants, especially from Asia, into the region, and the movement of a growing number of temporary migrants to the Middle East (Connell 2006). Contemporary migration has continued to bring new migrants to the Pacific islands whether as miners, bureaucrats or commercial adventurers. While there have long been Chinatowns in most Pacific towns, Chinese migrants, most from southern China, have become established in several countries, including Tonga, Fiji and the Solomon Islands. Smaller numbers of Indians, Filipinos and others represent distinct population flows, and a regular flow of Europeans and others have come as miners, aid donors, missionaries, university lecturers and so on. The Pacific is now as cosmopolitan as it has ever been. Migration has had important effects on age structure and dependency ratios.

Pacific Population Movements: Indicative Flows Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 24 these migrants are often the more educated and skilled within island populations. International migration is primarily a Polynesian phenomenon, but more recently a Micronesian one (Map 2). Guamanians and Samoans are some of the most numerous Pacific Rim immigrants, followed by Fijians (mainly Indo-Fijians), Tongans, Cook Islanders and American Samoans. Perhaps more than any other group Samoans have something of a global distribution. In parts of Polynesia, more people are resident overseas than in the home islands. This applies almost as much to island states with large populations (Tonga and Samoa) as those with small populations (Niue, Tokelau, Wallis and Futuna, and the Cook Islands). A substantial majority of the ethnic population of the Cook Islands, American Samoa, Wallis and Futuna, Niue, Tokelau and Pitcairn live overseas. Four times as many Niue-born live in New Zealand than in Niue, and those of Niuean descent are even more numerous there. Much the same is true of Tokelau. By contrast, and very differently from the blackbirding era of a century ago, few Melanesians are now overseas. Most international migration, such as that from Tonga and Samoa and the smaller Polynesian states, is to New Zealand, the United States and Australia. Fiji has experienced significant outmigration since the two coups in 1987 and a third in 2000, and in this century has provided the largest flows in the region, both to the \u201ctraditional\u201d destinations of North America (including Canada), Australia and New Zealand, but more recently to the Middle East. After the Former Trust Territory states signed Compacts of Free Association with the United States, migration to the United States grew dramatically, especially from the Marshall Islands. Guam and the Northern Marianas have also received large numbers of Micronesians and Asian migrants, but most Micronesians now move to Hawai\u2018i and the mainland United States (Hess at al 2001). Over time, the United States has become the preferred migration destination. The primary motive for migration in the Pacific, as elsewhere, is economic improvement for migrants and their families, although political, environmental and cultural considerations also affect flows. This is as true of internal migration as of international migration. Growing inequalities, uncertain economic futures, coupled with rising expectations are the concomitants of increased migration. Internationally, young adults find better-paying jobs overseas and their families benefit from their remittances. To some extent migrants from a single extended family may be distributed in different countries, in what has been described as a \u201ctransnational corporation of kin\u201d (Marcus 1981), which strategically allocate family labour to local and overseas destinations (and also different employment sectors) to maximise income opportunities, minimize risk and benefit from resultant remittance flows. This \u201cinsures\u201d the family against economic crises and unemployment, and enables the ease of possible return migration. The removal of many young, educated people from the population slows the pace of social change, partly because of limited return migration. Migration decisions are usually shaped within a family context, as migrants leave to meet certain family expectations and financial support for kin. Migration is directed at improving both the living standards of those who remain at home and the lifestyle and income of the migrants.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab81299b-00bd-4962-b577-795db80b61db": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab81299b-00bd-4962-b577-795db80b61db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Migration, Mobility and HIV: A Rapid Assessment of Risks and Vulnerabilities in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1dfa20becb021a36cb014d5ec9c68956dd7248b59a85e8168e8b4eab1b3bbae0"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e9caabd-39e3-4339-a76c-5e9c35d573a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "413be2d41c203d811a8d7f90aa7d896fccf67b99235883f92f37c4643d730e1d"}}, "hash": "2cdb69135fb8d5f8db99b93c19a7b3f881cc9e5774a074ee10744e1f96a13234", "text": "Consequently \u201cfamilies deliberate carefully about which members would be most likely to do well overseas and be reliable in sending remittances\u201d (Gailey 1992: 465).

The next six sections focus on mobile groups whose movements are predominantly internal to the Pacific \u2013 either within countries or within Pacific island countries and territories. Urbanisation In almost all Pacific island states, a significant demographic, economic and cultural transformation is taking place as urban populations are growing faster than total populations. If Papua New Guinea is excluded, more than half of all Pacific islanders live in urban areas, reflecting the global watershed heralded by the United Nations in 2007. In some countries - such as the atoll states of Kiribati, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands - this growth has resulted in exceptionally high population densities, comparable with those in the most highly populated Asian cities, resulting in significant environmental and health problems. In larger states, such as Fiji, the majority population now lives in cities and towns. Only a few mining towns do not have relatively balanced sex ratios. Where urban areas still account for a minority of people such as Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, urban growth rates are amongst the highest in the Asia-Pacific region, foreshadowing a late, though, inevitable urban revolution. Almost everywhere, urbanisation has been accompanied by rapid population growth (heightened through the limited impact of family planning), with the result that natural increase has become as important an influence on urban growth as rural-urban migration. Most internal migration is to the larger urban centres, and to some mining towns that are \u201chot spots\u201d for HIV risk exposure. Though migration still drives much urban growth, an increasing share is generated by birth rates of second and third-generation urban citizens, indicating the permanent shift of many Pacific islanders from \u201ctraditional\u201d rural societies to urban centres and contradicting the still held view that migration is temporary and urban challenges can be met through rural development. The rationale for urbanisation and increased population concentrations is consistent throughout the Pacific: employment opportunities and services (especially education and health) are concentrated in the urban centres. In small island states, where the labour force and capital are often limited, this urban concentration is inevitable to some extent. Predominantly Internal Migration Urbanisation is proportionally least in Melanesia, though towns and cities are larger, since modernisation has been belated. Greater Suva and Port Moresby are significant cities. Port Moresby (the National Capital District) had more than 250,00 people in 2000 and was growing at a rate of 3.6% per year, and, like some other rapidly growing urban centres, had a sex ratio of 121 males per 100 females. The more educated have tended to migrate first. Urbanisation characterizes contemporary migration within and beyond the Pacific. The existence of kin in urban areas is a major influence and support. Early migrants are beach heads for those who follow. Not only do they provide demonstrations or create images of an impressive lifestyle, they may also provide remittances, fares and accommodation for new migrants to the city. Indeed migration is often best seen \u201cas an almost inevitable decision that they [villagers] will have to make sooner or later and once this view is accepted a sort of migration momentum develops\u201d (Walsh 1982: 7). Not only have the attractions of urban life, in terms of employment, access to services (notably education) and even the \u2018bright lights\u2019 drawn many people, and especially youth to urban areas on a semi-permanent basis, they have also resulted in considerable mobility in and out of towns and a relatively large \u201cfloating\u201d population with uncertain allegiance to rural or urban areas. This particular fluctuating group, without permanent jobs or income, is at particular risk in urban areas. Moreover, they are also associated with a rise in urban crime rates most evident in Port Moresby and other urban centres in Papua New Guinea (Levantis 1997, Connell and Lea 2002, Buchanan-Aruwafu 2007). Critical issues concern the growth of squatter settlements in the Pacific such as urban south Tarawa where the incidence of HIV tends to be greatest. Land tenure shapes the pattern and availability of affordable and secure housing. Housing is often a barometer of people\u2019s income, their level of security and their access to resources (including land).

This is also the case for the settlements around Port Moresby, Lae, and Honiara. Increasingly these settlements consist of makeshift shelter, with no water supply, sporadic access to electricity and are increasingly characterized by overcrowding, leading ESCAP to note that \u201cthere is a need for governments to take a more proactive approach with squatter settlements particularly in promoting a greater understanding of rights and services\u201d (ESCAP/POC 2002: 30). Inadequate finance for urban development has meant that Pacific urban centres are increasingly unhealthy and dangerous places to live, a trend noted almost two decades ago (Bryant 1993). Although progress has been made on health facilities, Pacific towns, particularly Majuro, Ebeye, Kolonia (Pohnpei, FSM) and south Tarawa (ADB 2002, Storey and Connell 2008), face periodic threats of cholera and other water-borne diseases. The Pacific faces an uncertain urban future. Social disorganisation and crime increasingly result from inequalities in the cities and have grown in concert with the increasing size of urban populations. In Nuku\u2019alofa and Honiara there have been riots over inadequate urban employment and quality of life. Increases in poverty, crime and periodic unrest can be seen in towns and cities as diverse as Lae, Nuku\u2019alofa and Suva. Law and order is a key area of urban concern in many countries, notably Papua New Guinea, and there has been a steady rise in the incidence of violent crime. In Papua New Guinea there has been a \u201cpervasiveness of sexual assaults and gang rapes\u201d and this impersonal and institutional violence against women, even among groups such as the police, has direct implications for the increased incidence of HIV (Lepani 2008a: 150, 156) and for the breakdown of family structures (Wardlow 2004). Outside Papua New Guinea it remains rare. In the failure to deal effectively with urban futures and in the absence of opportunities for growing populations in both rural and urban areas, the Pacific is likely to encounter greater political instability and social insecurity in the decades to come. Sexual behaviour and risk factors Across the world in general, infection rates have tended to be higher in urban areas (Dyson 2003; Figure 2). This holds for Papua New Guinea until 2006 (figure 3) however an apparent rapid increase of HIV prevalence in rural areas (figure3) tends to lately inverse the trend. This is a particular cause for concern given that 83% of the total population of Papua New Guinea live in rural areas. However this apparent sharp increase in rural area needs to be treated with caution as it may only reflect the expansion of testing sites from 2006 (Commission on AIDS in the Pacific 2009). 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 Burundi 1997-8 Malawi 2001 Namibia 1998 Urban Rural Figure 2: HIV prevalence (%) among pregnant women in urban and rural areas (Dyson 2003) Urban areas are associated with certain HIV risk factors. Dyson, in his article on HIV and urbanisation, notes that \u201crates of social interaction are higher in urban areas, and fields of social interaction are wider too-phenomena that doubtless have implications for patterns of sexual interaction\u2026 And higher- risk behaviours (such as commercial sex activities) tend to be more prevalent in towns and cities.

Where poverty is relatively high and services are less available, there are greater risks of HIV vulnerability. This has been seen in slum areas of east and southern Africa where transactional sex, poor health indicators and inability to negotiate safe sex are more prevalent. Surveys conducted among students in Honiara found that around one fifth of respondents reported they had exchanged sex for money or goods in the previous year (Buchanan-Aruwafu, H. 2007). In Papua New Guinea, infection rates are particularly high in urban areas and amongst young girls and women, indicating that adolescent girls and young women are particularly vulnerable to cross-generational sexual relations (Lepani 2008a: 151). Their vulnerability to HIV is further compounded by unequal gender relations which often leave young girls and women at the mercy of men wielding power and dictating the terms of sexual relations. Activities and interventions HIV activities are generally more prevalent in urban areas due to ease of access, proximity to decision makers and funders, and number of non-governmental organisations and other community groups. For example, the first HIV antibody tests and treatment were available in Port Moresby before it was gradually available in other larger cities. The extension of services to rural health centres has been slow. This holds true for other large islands and archipelago such as Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Tonga and Fiji (to a lesser extent). Commercial Sex Work The role, geographical distribution and social significance of sex work are important in the spread of HIV. Though most data are anecdotal, the selling of sex for cash is significant in many parts of the region, spearheaded by Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Solomon Islands. Commercial sex work is often informal, sporadic and largely transactional in nature rather than a full-time situation (PRHP 2007). Most commercial sex workers are women; men and transgendered sex workers are relatively rare. A relatively small number of studies provide some information on commercial sex, but much is dated and primarily refers to Papua New Guinea. Only fragmentary data enable comparisons with other parts of the region, though commercial sex work is generally of less significance elsewhere (apart perhaps from Honiara, Suva, Guam and Saipan). While most commercial sex workers are probably indigenous to the region, there is a growing number of migrant sex workers in the region mainly from China (see below). This section is thus divided into two sections dealing with a domestic commercial sex work context and an international migrant context, which are to some extent separate and distinct.

Noumea and Papeete are similar but larger port towns, while New Caledonia\u2019s urban sex workers have been identified as a priority high-risk group (Agence Sanitaire 2007, Germain et al 1998). Asian sex workers in Fiji tend to be organised in brothels, and local sex workers are found in diverse locations, on particular streets and in certain clubs. Commercial sex workers are in many case migrants themselves and rarely practice their business in their home communities. There is a growing recognition, firstly, that the general age of sex workers is becoming younger (eg Save the Children Fiji 2005: 16, 25), and, secondly, that the principle influence on women becoming sex workers is poverty. In the case of Fiji, it has recently been reported by Save the Children that girls as young as 13 are engaged in commercial sex. In Papua New Guinea, there has been recent concern that growing urban poverty has increased the extent of commercial sex (The National, 28 October 2008) and some women who become pasindia meri (sex workers) exhibit a degree of rebellion and autonomy that gives them an ability to \u2018move through the local and national landscape that other women do not exercise\u2019 (Wardlow 2004: 1019). In most contexts there is relatively little information on how sex work is organised, or indeed whether it is organised (though massage parlours are becoming more common), who the sex workers are (their ethnic origin), their incomes, whether they are long-term or temporary workers (and whether they drop in and out of urban life), their health status and level/ extent of safe sex practices. Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 31 International Sex Work Migration of sex workers into the region is of some significance. In Papua New Guinea, Northern Marianas, Marshall Islands, Palau and Fiji, there has been recent migration of Asian sex workers. Since this is illegal, data remain largely anecdotal but it is extremely important for the incidence of HIV. A further significant migration stream into the region is American military into Guam, and this is about to increase. Since both Saipan and Guam are significant tourist destinations and sites of a large, but sometimes itinerant, American military presence, they are critical hotspots. In Saipan, commercial sex is centred in the urban area of Garapan where there are numerous massage parlours, clubs and karaoke bars, many of which are oriented at an Asian tourist clientele. Commercial sex is reported to have increased in significance in recent years as Asian workers (mainly from China and the Philippines) have been displaced from the garment industry and tourist numbers declined. Some female factory workers who had not earned enough income to pay off their contracts may have been effectively forced to remain in Saipan in an unusual form of trafficking. Others were brought as \u2018waitresses\u2019 but forced into sex work. Court cases have been mounted against traffickers. Indicative of the kinds of statements and speculations made and issues raised were those expressed in July 2007 by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Insular Affairs, David Cohen, testifying before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Box 3. Challenges of International Human Trafficking in CNMI. David Cohen, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Insular Affairs, CNMI, 19 July 2007 (accessed online: http://www.doi.gov/oia/press/2007/07192007.html) Serious problems continue to plague the CNMI\u2019s administration of its immigration system, and we remain concerned that the CNMI\u2019s rapidly deteriorating fiscal situation may make it even more difficult for the CNMI government to devote the resources necessary to effectively administer its immigration system and to properly investigate and prosecute labor abuse.

We believe that steps need to be taken to protect women from such terrible predicaments. We are also concerned about recent attempts to smuggle foreign nationals, in particular Chinese nationals, from the CNMI into Guam by boat. A woman was recently sentenced to five years in prison for attempting to smuggle over 30 Chinese nationals from the CNMI into Guam. The extent to which this remains the situation in Saipan is unknown, but there is little doubt that this is the main centre of any human trafficking for the sex trade purposes in the region. While Guam has a thriving commercial sex industry, with sex workers from Asia, trafficking may be generally absent. (Indeed Guam is the only place in the region where there have been government level discussions over whether to establish a \u201cred light district\u201d in order to group all \u201cadult entertainment\u201d outlets in one Tumon tourist district). However, in 2008 there was some consternation over the trafficking of a group of eight 18-22 year old women from Chuuk (FSM) who had been promised work as waitresses and shop workers, had their airfares to Guam paid for them but were forced into commercial sex work upon arrival. Micronesians from Chuuk had acted as intermediaries for Chinese-owned business (Marianas Variety, 11 February 2008). Federated States of Micronesia migrants are free to go to Guam under the rules of the Compact of Free Association with the US government, but this appears to be the only documented example of trafficking for the sex trade of local people occurring within the Pacific region. Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 32 Box 4. Sex work and International Migration in Fiji (Asia Times September 16th 2002) In Fiji, a sudden rise in the number of Chinese in the island has coincided with a rise in prostitution, drugs, gambling and people smuggling, according to news reports. This month, joint raids by police, immigration and home affairs officers on nightspots throughout Suva led to arrest of 12 Chinese illegal immigrants. According to immigration officials, there are about 2,000 illegal immigrants in the Fiji Islands. Police and naval officers suspect that human-smuggling syndicates from China offload illegal immigrants from fishing boats in remote islands and bring them to Suva and other cities through domestic navigation routes. For most of this year, media have reported about Chinese triad rings operating out of Fiji, as well as reports of gang fights breaking out on the streets of the capital Suva. Newspapers have also reported that Chinese are running exclusive prostitution rings in Suva, and barring access to brothels by non-Chinese visitors. In its latest issue, Pacific Monthly reported that Suva has at least 40 brothels. \u201cA flood of mainland Chinese into Fiji is embroidering Suva\u2019s social scene with \u2018Chinese only\u2019 whorehouses,\u201d the magazine claimed, adding that these were serving an increasing number of Chinese fishermen and businessmen allowed to open shop in Suva. To try to cope with this wave of immigration and its effects, Fiji has reduced its tourist visa from four months to just one month. Officials are also grappling with how to address illegal immigration while encouraging the investments that Fiji needs. Many Chinese, mostly women, come to work in garment factories set up by Chinese investors. But in March, the government found that it had issued eight work permits to a Chinese investor to bring in workers for a firm that has not been in operation for a year. But police believe this is an excuse to bring in women to work as prostitutes. \u201cWe must remember that these women are being brought to work at a cheaper rate than the locals. They need money to live here. This is the reason they engage in prostitution,\u201d said Inspector Unaisi Vuniwaqa. ____________________ There are allegedly foreign teenage prostitutes as young as 17 years engaged in prostitution in Papua New Guinea. The prostitutes, reported to be mainly from Asian countries, are part of an illegal chain of businesses operated allegedly by the Chinese mafia gang members\u2026 These prostitutes were reportedly brought into the country illegally and are engaged in prostitution behind closed doors with arranged clients (20 March 2008 Illegal migration, which may", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6334722a-45d4-495e-8006-7b4b0eef7a36": {"__data__": {"id_": "6334722a-45d4-495e-8006-7b4b0eef7a36", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Migration, Mobility and HIV: A Rapid Assessment of Risks and Vulnerabilities in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a26ebc3a25297687112f7d9f72ed658c631adc98a934c6223e67b767d1023897"}}, "hash": "a26ebc3a25297687112f7d9f72ed658c631adc98a934c6223e67b767d1023897", "text": "amount to trafficking, also occurs elsewhere in the context of sex work. Information on this issue is by nature sketchy and hard to source and verify when existing. News paper reports such as the ones cited below in boxes provide however anecdotal information that needs to be taken with caution as to the extent of the phenomenon. Broadly this situation appears to have remained unchanged since then. With the passing of the new Crime Decree in Fiji a number of police raids were conducted in massage parlour in Suva and resulted in the arrest of illegal immigrants allegedly engaged in sex work. Similar patterns are in place for Papua New Guinea as the Post Courier recorded earlier in the year (though once again such statements are largely anecdotal and must be treated with caution): Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 33 Similar movement of Chinese women has also been reported by the press in the Solomon Islands for Malaysian loggers and Asian crews of foreign vessels (Solomon Times, 19 April 2008). Comparable instances certainly occur in the Marshall Islands, and perhaps elsewhere in the region. It is not clear to what extent sex workers are coerced into working in the Pacific region, even in Saipan and Guam, but if they are coerced this is probably the only example of human trafficking in the region. Sexual behaviour and risk factors Sex workers engage in sexual activity with a high number of partners. The transactional nature of the interactions limits the ability of sex workers to insist on condom use in the absence of strong legal or government engagement (as in Thailand where a 100% condom use in brothels policy has increased condom usage). Some clients will even pay extra for sex without a condom. A 2002 study of 407 female sex workers in Port Moresby and Lae revealed an HIV prevalence of 10% and sexually transmitted infections ranging from 31% to 36% (Mgone et al 2002). The sex workers in Port Moresby had significantly higher HIV infection (17%) than those in Lae (3%). Condom use among the sex workers was very inconsistent; 85% reported that they did not use condoms at all times when having sex with their clients. Common reasons cited were dislike by clients, unavailability, alcohol use and familiarity with a client. Another Papua New Guinea study noted relatively high levels of condom use among sex workers, with between two thirds and three quarters of female sex workers reported using a condom the last time they sold sex (National AIDS Council Secretariat Papua New Guinea & National HIV/AIDS Support Project, 2007). A further study in Eastern Highlands found that 74% of female sex workers were positive for at least one sexually transmitted infection and 43% had multiple infections (Gare 2005). Condom use was very low among these sex workers due to unavailability, dislike by clients, drunkenness or use of marijuana. A Vanuatu report noted that condom use among transactional sex workers was not consistent (Wan Smol Bag 2006). Education is needed not only among sex workers but also among their clients \u2013 mobile groups are among the most frequent sex worker clients. In a study in Port Moresby published in 2000, 60% of married men acknowledged engaging in commercial sex (WHO 2000). Among males in Fiji, some 16% had engaged in commercial sex compared with 10% in Marshall Islands and 2% in Samoa (Jenkins 2005). By the age of 19, about 16% of Fijian men had visited sex workers (Kaitani 2004). A study in Thailand noted that condom usage differed significantly according to client region of origin with 76% of westerners, 52% of foreign Asians and only 27% of native Thai men using condoms (Buckingham et al 2005); hence similar variations in the Pacific may not be unexpected. Fiji\u2019s UNGASS report of 2006 notes that only 7.7% of men reported using a condom at last sex with a commercial female partner. In Port Moresby, sex work had increased significantly between 1998 and 2002 and condom use increased over the same time period, suggesting some This brought an online response: Reports of Asian girls involved in prostitution highlights that PNG has now become a destination country for the global sex industry through the trafficking of women and girls.

According to the 2006 UNICEF, UNESCAP, ECPAT Regional Report on Child Sexual Abuse and Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children in the Pacific, trafficking in children for sexual abuse and exploitation is occurring both internally as well as across the Indonesia border. Very young girls from poor Central and Gulf villagers are handed over to men who offer large amounts of money. There are men negotiating these deals for payment. One report alleges that a doctor from Simbu province has bought a ten year old Waiori girl and has already slept with her. Uneven distribution of wealth, economic hardships and the increased demand for women as sex objects fuels the global problem. Organised criminal networks that abduct and illegally bring foreigners into PNG for their evil exploits are facilitated by their PUPPETS at strategic locations, such as immigration, air/sea port security or customs and government departments. Generally, the women and children are always the victims and the culprits who are the key players go unpunished, and continue to use the system as their pawn. Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 34 Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 35 positive response to the HIV epidemic, though risky behaviour remained high (Yeka et al 2004). Sex workers are also more likely to engage in drug and alcohol abuse which may be a significant contributing factor to HIV risk. Though specific evidence of this is scant for the Pacific, studies in other small island states in the Caribbean confirm this risk behaviour (Surratt 2007). There is no specific data on the behaviours of Chinese and other Asian sex workers in the Pacific. Studies in Asia however have shown that girls who are trafficked into sex work have a higher risk to contract STIs and HIV, suffer qualitatively and quantitatively different levels of sexual risk as compared with non-trafficked sex workers, and are less likely to be reached by HIV prevention programme (Harvard School of Public Health and UNDP 2009 communication at International Congress on AIDS in Asia Pacific, 12 August 2009 Bali, Indonesia). Interventions and Activities A few groups in the Pacific are working with sex workers on HIV awareness and activities. The Pacific Regional HIV/ AIDS Project funded by Australia, New Zealand and France and managed through SPC has funded non-governmental organisations in Fiji, the Marshall Islands, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands to conduct awareness and condom use activities with sex workers. The total funding allocated for these activities in 2004-2007 was about A$665,000 (PRHP 2007). These projects include providing improved access to sexually transmitted infection diagnostic and treatment services for sex workers, peer education sessions, a project to distribute condoms to sex workers through taxi drivers in Honiara and the establishment of the Sex Workers Action Network in Fiji (PRHP 2007). The Global Fund Round 2 Multi-Country Pacific HIV/AIDS funding application noted that \u201cachievement of 70-80% of most at-risk populations (sex workers, seafarers) reporting consistent condom use with non regular partners is expected\u201d. This demonstrates that Pacific island country and territory governments and agencies are increasing their focus on sex worker interventions (Global Fund 2003). The Papua New Guinea Transex project began in 1996 and targeted transport and sex workers with specific prevention messages and tools. This has been claimed to be the first successful example of a targeted intervention for HIV in Papua New Guinea. In general interventions targeting sex workers are rendered more difficult by legislation that criminalise sex work, which is the case in most Pacific Island Countries. Plantation Employment Plantation work and other forms of short-term and seasonal migration for employment are less common than in the past but are of continued significance in some parts of Melanesia, primarily Papua New Guinea. Oil palm estates are still increasing and attracting some new migrant workers. Most plantations are on the north coast of New Guinea and in several parts of the island provinces. The cocoa/coconut plantation sector is declining partly because of low prices. Highland coffee plantations have also experienced decline and former migrants have tended to move on to urban areas such as Lae and Madang. There is some evidence that a growing proportion of workers on plantations are not short term migrant workers but established (a generation perhaps) migrants who are there as family groups. Rather like plantations, other sources of \u2018male\u2019 employment such as logging camps tend to have more local workforces.

There is every reason to suppose similar practices occur in Papua New Guinea. Indeed workers in logging camps are generally regarded as having a high incidence of HIV and STIs (Dundon and Wilde 2007). Sexual behaviour and risk factors In the oil palm areas of West New Britain (Papua New Guinea), there is some evidence of sex workers being available on pay days for both smallholder and plantation workers. These are believed to be mainly \u2018local\u2019 women (that is descendants of established settlers, most of whom came to the area from Sepik and elsewhere in earlier decades). More detailed information on the risk behaviour of plantation workers and loggers is not available, though one can assume some similarities with mine workers (see section below). Interventions and Activities No information was available on specific HIV relevant activities being made available to seasonal plantation workers though, at least one oil palm company provides condom information on HIV to migrant workers, and this may be a model for similar situations in rural Melanesia (Sales 2004, Hargy Oil Palms 2008). Mining Increasingly more important than plantations for \u2018male migration\u2019 are mines, again now almost entirely in Papua New Guinea with some activity in New Caledonia. Mining centres Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 36 tend to be dominated by relatively young men and the most skewed urban sex ratios are in centres such as Tabubil (near Ok Tedi mine). Larger mines such as Ok Tedi and Lihir each employ about 2000 workers, most of whom are men from Papua New Guinea. Many overseas workers reside in northern Australia and are involved in fly-in fly-out schemes. In the past, sex workers moved to mining centres such as Mt Kare and Tabubil/Ok Tedi (eg Ryan 1991, Polier 1966) but there is ambiguity on contemporary practices, though sex work is certainly present in Tabubil (Hammar 2008b) and at Lihir. Much information remains anecdotal, but it is reasonable to assume that there is significant commercial sexual activity around most mining centres. Indeed, mines have been cited as a contributing factor to the growth of commercial sex in Papua New Guinea as early as 1900 (Jenkins and Massey 1998). Sexual behaviour and risk factors Information on sexual activity around mining sites in the Pacific is scarce, though the fastest growing HIV epidemic in the nearby province of West Papua (Indonesia) is at Timika, the mining town for the giant Freeport mine where poverty, poor health, migration and unemployment co-exist (Eves and Butt 2008; 12). Certain conclusions reached in some other parts of the world indicate similar possible parallel scenarios in the region. The mines of southern Africa have been seen by many as the epicentre of the HIV epidemic in the region with elevated prevalence among miners. Miners leave home for extended periods and live in intense, male-dominated and high-risk environments. In general, miners are more likely to have unsafe sexual behaviours such as low levels of condom use, high number of concurrent partnerships and visiting commercial sex workers. A study in China found that 61.2% of miners never used condoms with female sex workers and 84.1% never used condoms with their regular partners (Xu et al 2008). The risk factors are not only relevant for the miners themselves but also for the surrounding communities. A study in Tanzania revealed very high HIV prevalence for women in communities neighbouring the mines, suggesting high levels of interaction between not only sex workers and miners but between miners and community members (Clift et al 2003). Quite recently, the mining boom in Western Australia has been cited as fuelling an increase in HIV infections due to the FIFO \u201ctwo-weeks-on, two-weeks-off nature of work\u201d which keeps men away from their wives or partners for extended periods (Williams 2008). Interventions and Activities Mining companies have been at the forefront of the response to HIV in southern Africa.

Refugees and Internally Displaced People There are few international refugees in the region, with the exception of West Papuans in Papua New Guinea. There are about 10,000 West Papuan refugees in Papua New Guinea, about 5000 in border areas, 2500 in the East Awin settlement and 2000 in other urban areas (United States Committee for Refugees 2008). Little is known about their social behaviour but refugee populations are at high risk of sexual exploitation and usually have limited health services (Spiegel and Nankoe, 2004). In the past there has been resettlement of islanders from densely populated islands or from areas of mining or military activity, including the movement of Gilbertese to the Solomon Islands, Vaitupu (Tuvalu) islanders to Kioa in Fiji, Banabans to Rabi in Fiji, and Bikinians (and others) to more southern parts of the Marshall Islands. These movements took place in colonial times and have not been replicated subsequently though these groups largely remain away from their \u2018home\u2019 islands. At various times there have been other displaced groups within countries. Between 1998 and 2000, 20,000 people were displaced in the Solomon Islands after violence in Honiara and Guadalcanal. Some Bougainvillean groups were similarly displaced in the violence that lasted during the first half of the1990s. Most of these moved to new villages nearby or returned to the home areas they had previously migrated from. Massive population movement after conflict has also been documented in Timor-Leste (Earnest and Finger 2006). There have also been significant localised movements following floods, cyclones and volcanic eruption, notably in Vanuatu (where Ambrym islanders have moved to Efate) and Papua New Guinea (where Manam islanders have moved to the mainland near Bogia, and some Carteret Islanders have moved to Bougainville). Sexual behaviour and risk factors Conflict and displacement increase the vulnerability of individuals, especially women and children, to HIV. Women account for the vast majority of those adversely affected by conflict, and are often seen as targets by different factions resulting in increased sexual and gender-based violence. Life as a refugee, whether within an established refugee camp or otherwise, often means struggling to meet basic needs which can lead women and girls into exchanging sexual services for resources. Beyond the increased vulnerability, refugees are often accused of bringing disease and HIV into an area. In some ways, however, refugees are protected from the high levels of vulnerability encountered by other groups. Quesada has written that \u201cwhilst poverty and exploitation are common to many mobile populations, separation from families and partners is a potent vulnerability factor which does not necessarily apply to refugees, especially camp-based refugees, who often move as a family and maintain a strong sense of community\u201d (Quesada 2007). Despite this, the vulnerability of refugees to HIV, particularly the vulnerability of women and girls, remains elevated. In the Pacific, a 2006 study shows HIV prevalence in West Papua of 2.4% (15-49 age group) which is higher than that of Papua New Guinea (Statistics Indonesia 2006). This suggests that the refugees arriving in Papua New Guinea might have higher prevalence than those in the rural areas of Papua New Guinea. Where there have been localised violent conflicts in the region, notably in Bougainville and Guadalcanal, sexual violence has been reported.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4641d05f-382b-4d89-9f11-85ccca0a47d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "4641d05f-382b-4d89-9f11-85ccca0a47d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Migration, Mobility and HIV: A Rapid Assessment of Risks and Vulnerabilities in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b73a59702fa4e6d859c2d366f2facd70d987b3d0c3c1c7ef8f19a5d934b7e95"}, "2": {"node_id": "973cd7d3-8dd4-4e00-a2c7-662f3a014bbb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d93d720e23150c1f79ec702c3d8d0835ca2367f8f6bd61c00d513b307b776f32"}}, "hash": "ed485063a7f44bffdc8a6935ba7d1eebd2f0e62e306449947060ba5491f952cc", "text": "During the Solomon Islands conflict, there were a number of reports of sexual violence against women and girls by militants and police (Buchanan-Aruwafu 2007, Buchanan-Aruwafu and Maebiru 2008).

Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 39 Students Throughout the region, universities, university centres, teaching and nursing colleges bring together a youthful population for extended periods in different ethnic or international contexts. In Suva, the University of the South Pacific (USP) alone has around 10,000 students. While most are from Fiji, a large number come from 12 other island states alongside a handful of international students from more distant metropolitan states. The Fiji Institute of Technology in Suva and the University of Fiji in Lautoka are destinations for a smaller scale and much more local migration. USP also has campuses in Samoa, Vanuatu and elsewhere. Similarly, in Papua New Guinea there are three different universities and various other tertiary training institutions where students migrate between provinces. The main university, UPNG, has 15,000 students mainly based at the Port Moresby campus. Other significant university campuses are in Lae and Goroka. The University of Guam, with over 3000 students, is a key destination for Micronesian students. Elsewhere the range of tertiary institutions is much smaller, but in almost every state, nursing schools and some other training institutions draw particular groups of people usually in urban centres. A substantial number of Pacific students are in Australia, New Zealand and other overseas destinations, often for several years but also for short term training courses. Sexual behaviour and risk factors Students are generally young, sexually active and spend considerable time away from home and their support networks. Very little data is available on the sexual behaviour of students in the Pacific but evidence from other countries suggests that sexual risk taking is relatively high. In Madagascar, only 5.7% of university students reported consistent condom use in a survey (Rahamefy 2008). As mentioned above, surveys conducted in the capital of Solomon islands, Honiara, have shown that one fifth of students had exchanged sex for money or goods, few of them reporting consistent condom use, similarly behaviours are also reported for female students from boarding schools in the outer islands of the Marshall Islands (Buchanan- Aruwafu 2007: 22). Similarly in urban Fiji, school girls (usually from outer islands but resident in Suva) have been reported as becoming engaged in small scale commercial sex to pay their way through school (Save the Children Fiji 2005: 25). These situations may not be atypical and may be seen in other parts of the Pacific. Interventions and Activities In general, HIV awareness services are available on university campuses as are basic health services. A number of HIV awareness activities are taking place at the USP campus in Fiji, including peer educators and counselling services, and HIV awareness through sport and arts. University campuses are usually in urban centres thus making access to services easier for students. Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 40 The next six sections focus on mobile groups whose movements are predominantly external to the Pacific \u2013 those groups that often travel outside of the region or who travel into the Pacific from outside the region. Transport Routes and Seafarers Transport hubs that are centres of HIV transmission in other parts of the world (IOM/UNAIDS 2005) are rare in the Pacific, although the Highlands Highway in Papua New Guinea is significant. Commercial work became significant on the Highlands Highway in the 1970s soon after its opening. More than 200 sex workers have been identified in surveys along the Highway (Gare et al 2005). This is the highest concentration of sex workers outside urban areas, so much so that the 700km route has sometimes been called \u201cthe AIDS highway\u201d. The converse of this is the manner in which, at least in Tari (Southern Highlands), men who were drivers spoke freely about the extent of their sexual relations on the highway (Wardlow 2007: 1009). The Highlands Highway has provided a fast route for the virus to spread throughout the country, and the high level of HIV and AIDS in Western Highlands is a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15078379-7aeb-4308-91db-721477df2d4f": {"__data__": {"id_": "15078379-7aeb-4308-91db-721477df2d4f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Migration, Mobility and HIV: A Rapid Assessment of Risks and Vulnerabilities in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3378d1638a027e1759809174b939031153e0960ab0be7c27572d54b3ed4d0559"}, "3": {"node_id": "189bf2ad-5e9c-4a37-821f-3bd1924f0536", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f00906e8790d3b99bd1b922ad96bb529250f37157083472d63ded064417e43ae"}}, "hash": "19db4576add21579cd99933b359497b9ffb1b568262c26f0e3e20d3da5814ce2", "text": "partial outcome of the presence of the road. Commercial sex on this road is a source of income for several hundred young women seeking a living. Additionally, in several parts of the Highlands, traditional movements in association with exchange and ritual obligations have brought people together for significant periods of time. These social events can become high risk settings for the transmission of HIV. There are few parallels elsewhere in the region. The seafaring industry is a significant source of employment for many men in most countries, but especially in Kiribati and Tuvalu (as a proportion of all employment). Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Tuvalu and, to a lesser extent, the Marshall Islands supply most of the region\u2019s 6000-7000 seafarers, most of whom are men (Oriente 2006, Buchanan-Aruwafu 2007). Tuvalu has 1200 persons registered as seafarers or fishers, some 10% of the national population. In Kiribati and Tuvalu, at least each seafarer supports an average of seven people (Dennis 2003) and the contribution to Gross National Product in Kiribati and Tuvalu is significant (Clark 2003). Beyond Pacific island seafarers, thousands of overseas sailors and fishers move through the region; about 10,000 move through Majuro each year (Oriente 2006). During the first six months of 2003, over 4000 seafarers \u2013 primarily from China, Korea, Indonesia and Japan \u2013 docked in Majuro with an average nine-day stay (Blair 2005). Sex workers in Kiribati are characteristically referred to as Te Korekorea, those who have sex with Korean seafarers (Buchanan-Aruwafu 2007). Seafarers spend little time in port but when they do disembark, it may be for several days at a time. Seafarers make up the main clientele for the international sex work industry. Sexual behaviour and risk factors Seafarers have been noted as one of the highest priority high- risk groups for HIV transmission in the Pacific. Documents assert that HIV was most likely brought to the Pacific region by seafarers. The first reported HIV infection in Fiji was in a seafarer as were the first two cases in Tuvalu. Of the 46 HIV and AIDS cases in Kiribati as of December 2004, 19 were seafarers and their wives (Oriente 2006). Of the nine HIV cases in Tuvalu, all were among seafarers, their wives and children (Global Fund 2007). Sentinel surveillance studies conducted in Kiribati among 386 seafarers in 2003 revealed very high sexually transmitted infections with 28% having at least one infection although only one case of HIV was detected (WHO et al 2004). Despite these, less than 5% had ever been diagnosed suggesting a dangerous lack of awareness and action with regard to sexually transmitted infections. A later study among 304 seafarers in Kiribati reported that 23% of seafarers had sex with a sex worker in the past year and only 22% used condoms consistently with these commercial partners (WHO 2006). Around 6% had male to male sex and 66% had never been tested for HIV. Only 16.6% were deemed to have correct and comprehensive knowledge of HIV. A study on HIV and seafarers from 2005 noted that the seafaring lifestyle \u201callows for very low condom use, excessive alcohol consumption, multiple sex partners, group sex, commercial sex and the development and circulation of lore and misinformation on HIV. Furthermore, Pacific island seafarers typically subscribe to the traditional gender roles and attitudes that remain dominant in the region, and are resistant to talking openly about sex and sexual health or negotiating safe sex with their partners\u201d (Oriente 2006: 156). These behaviours and attitudes contribute significantly to a heightened HIV transmission risk. About half of all seafarers literally seek \u201cwomen in every port\u201d, some remaining with the same woman for several Predominantly External Migration Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 41 Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 42 days. Despite educational programmes from a diversity of sources, less than a quarter of the seamen used condoms and less than half knew how HIV was spread. Seafarers tended to have high numbers of sex partners per year than other identifiable groups (Peteru 2002). 47% of seafarers aged between 17 and 35 had two or more sex partners in the past 12 months with 14% having more than five.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "189bf2ad-5e9c-4a37-821f-3bd1924f0536": {"__data__": {"id_": "189bf2ad-5e9c-4a37-821f-3bd1924f0536", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Migration, Mobility and HIV: A Rapid Assessment of Risks and Vulnerabilities in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3378d1638a027e1759809174b939031153e0960ab0be7c27572d54b3ed4d0559"}, "2": {"node_id": "15078379-7aeb-4308-91db-721477df2d4f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "19db4576add21579cd99933b359497b9ffb1b568262c26f0e3e20d3da5814ce2"}}, "hash": "f00906e8790d3b99bd1b922ad96bb529250f37157083472d63ded064417e43ae", "text": "Among seafarers older than 35, some 29% had more than five sexual partners over the past year with one respondent claiming 20 partners.

Seafarers themselves note that sex workers are easily accessible throughout Pacific ports with American Samoa, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Nauru, New Caledonia, PNG, Samoa and Tonga explicitly mentioned. The use of sex workers by seafarers is often characterised by longer term relationships consisting of total time in port rather than just one night (Peteru 2002). This type of relationship has similarities with the concurrent partnerships of southern Africa that have been described as the major cause of high levels of transmission in that region (Halperin and Epstein 2007). Alcohol use accompanies unsafe sex among seafarers, and is cited as the major barrier to increased use of condoms (Peteru 2002). In response to a question regarding reasons for unsafe sex, \u201cdrinking too much alcohol\u201d was the response given by about 80% of seafarers from Tuvalu, Kiribati and Fiji (Dennis 2003). Time in port has been characterised as a time for heavy drinking, actively seeking entertainment and sexual activity. The 2003 Kiribati study noted that 85% of seafarers drink alcohol (WHO et al 2004). Peteru\u2019s (2002) study of seafarers noted that 65% of seafarers interviewed could not describe HIV and AIDS or how it is transmitted, and 50% did not know what a sexually transmitted infection was. Most admitted to having had some HIV awareness training but could not remember the information. Seafarers under the age of 25, however, provided most of the correct responses suggesting that messaging has reached a younger generation. Knowledge about condoms and how to use them is also poor among seafarers (Peteru 2002; Armstrong 1998; Borovnik 2003). Additionally, cultural taboos exist against discussing sex and condom use thus reducing opportunities for open discussion and learning (Borovnik 2003). Truck drivers play a very significant role in the transmission of HIV in Africa and south Asia, and a number of reports have been written on this phenomenon (Alam 2006; Morris and Ferguson 2006, 2007). Data on truck drivers in Papua New Guinea support the characterisation of this group as most at risk. A survey revealed that 60-70% of truck drivers paid for sex in the previous 12 months (National AIDS Council Secretariat Papua New Guinea and National HIV/AIDS Support Project 2007). Only 1 in 3 (33%) of the truck drivers said they always used condoms with sex workers. Additionally, immediately after the construction of the Highlands Highway there was an epidemic of syphilis in the Highlands as a direct by-product of the increased access afforded by the highway (Hughes 1997). Interventions and Activities A significant number of organisations are involved in providing HIV information to seafarers including the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, shipping agencies, maritime training schools and non-governmental organisations. The Secretariat of the Pacific Community\u2019s HIV/AIDS and STI Project works closely with its Maritime Regional Program and Fisheries Division. In addition to providing information materials, the Secretariat has trained 35 peer educators from six islands who work on ships manned by Pacific islanders (SPC 2002). The Papua New Guinea Institute for Medical Research has also produced Information, Education and Communication (IEC) materials popular among seafarers. The TRANSEX project in Papua New Guinea trains sailors to become peer HIV educators and the ADB-funded Coastal Fisheries Management Development Project in PNG supports HIV education. Seafarers generally have low levels of literacy, thus limiting their ability to access many information sources (Oriente 2006; Dennis 2003). So despite the availability of Information, Education, Communication materials, many do not appeal to seafarers nor are particularly accessible. More basic information packs are often required. The Pacific Regional HIV/AIDS Project (PRHP) funded by AusAID, NZAID and France provided small grants to a number of organisations to conduct awareness building in the Pacific and a small number were conducted with seafarer groups. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s HIV/AIDS Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 43 Prevention and Capacity Development in the Pacific Project, which started in 2006, focuses on seafarers explicitly and on vulnerable groups generally. US$1.092 million was targeted for vulnerable groups. Five drop-in centres were proposed for seafarers as well as funds for regional maritime schools to do training programmes on HIV. However, such education and awareness programmes are limited in extent and reach.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbd8f33b-a1a8-4a19-aa99-1490a87f2b4b": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbd8f33b-a1a8-4a19-aa99-1490a87f2b4b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Migration, Mobility and HIV: A Rapid Assessment of Risks and Vulnerabilities in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "024fe4f15c0dca4bee92539e5d75d7c64771bee104bca1b2943fa33837eb1e67"}, "2": {"node_id": "d274ace3-3891-4958-b41b-1739860725ad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "feb609428b84b41fe3870f04f377a2f9e96a2a529617c3df3936892f5c2bcf2f"}}, "hash": "a4aa24b914a7fc05d38df8fc5e5d03b8c8f10d4978cbf3340fe151b45574abfe", "text": "However, such education and awareness programmes are limited in extent and reach.

Oriente notes that \u201cin Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Vanuatu, and Kiribati, graduates of the training institute must pass a test on basic HIV information\u201d (2006: 166). No evidence on the efficacy of these various approaches is available but one can assume that HIV awareness will improve suggesting some improvement in risk behaviour. Other groups involved in HIV activities among seafarers include the International Organization for Maritime. While it does not have any programmes specifically for Pacific island countries, they did develop a project in 2004 in the Philippines called Seafarers Health Education Counselling which focussed on a pre-departure orientation seminar for those seeking overseas employment. This workshop included HIV information. Additionally, Philippine law requires that HIV testing be administered and the International Organization for Maritime project supported training. For truckers in Papua New Guinea, the Wagi Valley Transport Company is the first trucking company in the Western Highlands to have an AIDS education programme. The company sees HIV education as an economic necessity after two of their 22 drivers died from AIDS-related infection. AusAID funds the education programme and provides funding for condom distribution among drivers. Military In the past decade, new and socially important migration streams have emerged in the region. Workers from Pacific island countries and territories have taken up overseas employment opportunities in the Middle East and elsewhere, mainly to work in the armies or in security. These individuals are mainly male, and from Fiji, Tonga, American Samoa and most of the formerly known Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands (Micronesia). Incomes are substantial and the impact of distance and high incomes has significant social consequences. Pacific island soldiers and policemen are in UN peacekeeping missions and military conflicts overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq either through formal enlistment or as contract workers. Elevated HIV risk among military and police personnel is well known and well documented by such agencies as the UN\u2019s Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO). This UN Department has written a number of reports on HIV among the military and has implemented control programmes including condom distribution and awareness building in peacekeeping missions around the world. The Pacific\u2019s involvement in military migration globally has been increasing significantly over the past decade, and there are potentially important impacts on HIV transmission. United Nations Peacekeeping Operations According to the UN\u2019s figures as of 31 January 2010, there are 268 Fijians, 15 Samoans and 34 Ni-Vanuatu serving as soldiers or policemen in UN Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO 2010). The majority of the Fijians are serving in Iraq, a country with very low HIV prevalence, but 46 Fijians and 29 Ni Vanuatu and 11 Samoans are serving in sub-Saharan African countries (Figure 4). While HIV prevalence in Sudan (1.4%) and Liberia (1.7%) is low relative to that of other African countries (UNAIDS 2008), there is elevated risk of HIV exposure when compared to the soldiers\u2019 home countries. Indeed, many of the locations of UN peacekeeping operations are high prevalence areas (Figure 5). 1 Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 44 Figure 4: Pacific Islanders in United Nations Peacekeeping Operations by Country, January 20102 Figure 5: HIV Prevalence and United Nations Peacekeeping Missions, June 20043 2 http://www.un.org/en/peacekeepingcontributors/2010/jan10_5.pdf 3 UNAIDS Fact Sheet, \u201cHIV/AIDS and Peacekeeping,\u201d UNAIDS Office on AIDS, Security and Humanitarian Response, June 2004.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2baf1b7e-4c85-4634-89dd-e324b093c3e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "2baf1b7e-4c85-4634-89dd-e324b093c3e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Migration, Mobility and HIV: A Rapid Assessment of Risks and Vulnerabilities in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5e143e6fdfbe464553a9a91a4a3c43f27897e472dcdf88c2b4fd04fd4f6aa2e2"}, "2": {"node_id": "d6e7ce3e-7a71-4322-b584-711631c10893", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39de748ab863439d3bd5896fe87503920a30abed736aced19d8a29dca5a629f3"}}, "hash": "781f982a417ffdcaaa44f41e9dcde2f12e1e21c6f0bfacc6f6ed2862d4ed963d", "text": "300 250 200 150 100 50 0 Fiji Timor-Leste Darfur South Sudan Liberia Iraq Samoa Vanuatu 15.0% - 38.05% 5.0% - 15.0% 1.0% - 5.0% 0.5% - 1.0% 0.1% - .05% 0.0% - .01% Not available MINUSTah 2004 UNaMSIL 1998 MINURSo 1991 UNFIcyp 1884 UNTSo 1946 MoNUc 1889 oNUB 2004 UNMee 1974 UNDoF 2000 UNMISeT 2002 UNMogIp 1849 UNoMIg 1998 UNIFIL 1975 UNaMa 2008 UNMIk 1889 UNocI 2004 UNMIL 2003 Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 45 Pacific islanders in the Middle East Tonga sent a force of 55 Royal Marines stationed to Iraq in 2004 as part of the Multinational Force in Iraq (separate from the UN).

Of the 182,000 contractors/mercenaries serving in Iraq, 43,000 are third-country nationals (ie. not Iraqi or American) from an estimated 30 countries. One estimate has over 1000 Fijians working in Iraq and Kuwait as soldiers, security guards, drivers and labourers (Maclellan 2006). These individuals are actively recruited by such organisations as the British-based Global Risk Strategies which went so far as to open a branch in Fiji to recruit ex-military personnel for contracts around the world. Such individuals have been lured by salaries of US$1700 a month, substantially more than they were likely to receive at home. American and French Military in the Pacific A third important component of military migration in the Pacific is the American military presence in Guam. There has been an American military presence in Guam for decades with about 10,000 military personnel and their family members on the island as of 1997 (Guam Military Overview 2008). Guam is set for a \u201cpeacetime invasion\u201d over the coming years which \u201cwill balloon the island\u2019s population by about 40,000 service people, contract workers and dependents\u201d (Harden 2008). This represents an increase in the total island population of about 25%. More than 12,000 of these temporary migrants will be US Marines who are being relocated from bases in Okinawa, Japan (Casa 2008). One journalist has already noted that \u201cthe newcomers will be mostly young, mostly single men trained as warriors - and periodically looking for a big night out on a small island\u201d (Harden 2008). The presence of US servicemen has been associated with sexual violence in the Asia-Pacific region since the conviction of three US Marines for rape of a Japanese schoolgirl on the island of Okinawa. While documentation of increased sexual violence rates with the presence of US military is difficult to gather empirically, the possibility of high-risk sexual activity and possibly HIV transmission is certainly elevated. In the Marshall Islands, there is considerable interaction between Marshallese citizens living on the tiny, overcrowded island of Ebeye and the nearby US military base on Kwajalein. There are also French military bases in the Pacific, but in the middle of 2008 France took action to reduce significantly the numbers stationed in French Polynesia. Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands Fifteen Pacific states contribute soldiers, policemen and advisers to the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI). This ranges from two policemen from the Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Niue and Palau to larger groups of 93 from New Zealand and 379 from Australia. Pacific Island Militaries Domestically Military forces in the Pacific (Fiji and Papua New Guinea each have about 4000 military personnel) also experience internal migration of soldiers travelling from base to base and relocating periodically depending on threats or location of exercises. Throughout the world, military forces have been cited as high-risk groups due to the predominance of young men, lack of education and predisposition to risky behaviour. In 2004, there were 108 soldiers living with AIDS in Port Moresby barracks alone (Steven 2004). A Papua New Guinea survey by the National AIDS Council revealed that as much as 60-70% of military personnel paid for sex in the previous 12 months (National AIDS Council Secretariat Papua New Guinea & National HIV/AIDS Support Project, 2007). The senior Medical Adviser of Papua New Guinea\u2019s National AIDS Council notes that \u201cthe defence force gets called upon to attend various crises around the country and the region which puts their exposure levels up\u201d (quoted in Steven 2004). The movement of soldiers also increases the risk in the communities through which they pass and in which they are stationed. Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 46 Sexual behaviour and risk factors In general, soldiers and policemen earn significant incomes - certainly higher than most would earn at home and/or in other occupations \u2013 creating a situation where significant numbers of mostly young men are a long way from home, in a stressful environment, without any social safety net, with money in hand and sometimes with time on their hands. Militaries are also characterised by an ethos of risk-taking behaviour thus making soldiers a particularly dangerous mode of transmission of HIV (Bazergan 2004). A behavioural surveillance survey conducted in Fiji in late 2004 among 257 male military personnel and policemen (WHO 2006) revealed that only 5.8% of respondents admitted having sex with a sex worker in the past 12 months and only 7.7% of them used a condom the last time.

With regard to having sex with a male partner, 6.7% reported it with less than 2% in the past year. The UN Department of Peace Keeping Operations has documented the risk behaviour of peacekeepers on overseas missions in an attempt to better understand how to intervene and protect peacekeepers. The Department has fielded Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) surveys in a few peacekeeping missions including in Liberia where 22 Pacific islanders are stationed. Though the survey was not specifically done amongst the Pacific islanders, it noted that the literacy rate was 98% and over 88% of respondents were married or had long-term partners at home. Despite this, 18% of peacekeepers reported having had sex while in Liberia and this is assumed to be underreporting (Bazergan 2006). Additionally, some of the soldiers had just arrived in country. Of these, 40% had two or more partners. Though condoms were readily available, 21% did not use a condom every time they had sex in the mission area. While these figures are probably better than they would be among other groups in other situations, there remains significant potential risk for HIV transmission for both peacekeepers and the host community. A major reason for the relatively low rates of sexual activity and relatively high rates of condom usage is that few soldiers reported drinking or drug use. Similar surveys among peacekeepers in Eritrea and Haiti reveal generally comparable behaviour patterns. It is possible, therefore, that such behaviours also exist for peacemakers in other contexts including within the Pacific region, and anecdotal evidence of RAMSI involvement (Christian Care Centre 2004). Activities and interventions The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1308 of 2000 encouraged countries to develop HIV education strategies for uniformed services and obligates the Department of Peace Keeping Operations to provide HIV awareness and prevention programmes for UN peacekeepers. The UN General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS of 2001 required the Department and countries to \u201censure the inclusion of HIV/AIDS awareness and training, including a gender component, into guidelines designed for use by defence personnel and other personnel involved in international peacekeeping operations while also continuing with ongoing education and prevention efforts, including pre-deployment orientation, for these personnel.\u201d HIV training is the responsibility of troop-contributing countries and, therefore, the Department of Peace Keeping Operations has developed a generic training module on HIV in order to assist countries with pre-deployment HIV education. It has also posted HIV advisers in its major missions to provide \u201congoing sensitization and prevention programmes, including voluntary counselling and testing\u201d (Bazergan 2006). These various interventions are generally seen as successful as evidenced by the fact that 80% of the peacekeepers serving in Liberia in 2005 had undergone an HIV test as part of their pre-deployment preparation (Bazergan 2006). The Liberia survey also confirmed that in some battalions, 100% of soldiers received HIV and AIDS pre-deployment training. The lowest figure was 56%. The Department of Peace Keeping Operations also distributed 273,000 condoms in six months (December 2004 to May 2005) in Liberia, not including any stocks that forces brought with them. This helps to explain the relatively high condom usage among soldiers in the Liberia and Haiti surveys. UNAIDS has developed an HIV and AIDS awareness card for peacekeepers in 12 languages. While the interventions conducted as part of the UN missions are laudable, the majority of work is conducted pre-departure and while on the field. Interventions and programmes on return are non- Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 47 Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 48 existent. Therefore, when the soldiers return to their home communities, the support that they received in the field vanishes, thus increasing potential risk of engaging in risky behaviour. Knowledge levels and behaviour among non-UN soldiers are more difficult to ascertain. While the Department of Peace Keeping Operations and UNAIDS focus on HIV among soldiers, evidence on activities by national Pacific island militaries and security contractors are limited. The US Department of Defense\u2019s HIV/AIDS Prevention Program was present at a workshop in Bangkok in 2005 that brought military medical officers from 22 countries together to discuss HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care in militaries.

Security contractors recruiting Fijian army soldiers are unlikely to emphasise HIV awareness and services, thus making that group potentially the most at- risk of all the mobile military workers included in this report. Guest workers Another very new stream is the guest worker migration to New Zealand following increasing pressure from island governments on metropolitan countries as a response to domestic economic stagnation. In 2007, New Zealand implemented a new policy of allowing a quota of 5000 guest workers from several island states to work in the agricultural industry (Levick and Bedford 1988). Continued pressure from island states resulted in Australia introducing a scheme to begin at the end of 2008 for 2500 workers. Between 2007 and 2008, about 4500 seasonal workers travelled to New Zealand to be employed in various parts of the agricultural industry. Most were from Vanuatu with others from Kiribati, Tuvalu, Samoa and Tonga. Both male and female workers were selected from productive age groups (25-55) mainly from rural areas. About two thirds of those who were recruited have been men. Preference was given to married men and women but only one of a married couple was recruited to avoid substantial disruption to families who remained at home, hence individuals went alone (Hammond and Connell 2009). Most of the recruits stayed in shared accommodation, such as in caravan parks and, while employed, earned sums several times that available at home. Although it was intended that most workers stay in New Zealand for a maximum of seven months, some returned before that period was over. A roughly similar scheme will begin between Australia and four Pacific island states (Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Kiribati and Tonga) at the end of 2008 and is expected to take 2500 workers over the course of three years. The social consequences of men and women travelling without their partners are important. Anecdotal evidence is suggesting that single workers in New Zealand are more likely to take advantage of \u201cfreedom\u201d to engage in social activities less available or condoned at home. Sexual behaviour and risk factors While the rationale for having only one member of a married couple join the scheme makes sense from the perspective of social stability, it increases the likelihood of increased numbers of sexual partners. This trend has been seen in seasonal plantation and mining work where one member of a couple is away for an extended period. Therefore, the guest worker model might increase the number of sexual partnerships and put men and women at greater risk of HIV transmission. No data is available specifically for guest workers under this scheme. Interventions and Activities There has been no mention of a specific HIV component to the guest worker scheme to mitigate the potential impact of the migration, though at least in Vanuatu there are briefing sessions for guest workers that cover some issues related to sexual behaviour. How effective and general these may be is unknown. Skilled Workers International migration flows have increasingly been of skilled workers. In recent years, general migration opportunities in metropolitan states have tended to decline, and migration has been increasingly targeted toward skilled migrants rather than family reunions. Structural changes within metropolitan states have meant that certain sectors, notably health, are short of skilled workers (Connell 2004) while there has also been a significant flow of teachers (Voigt-Graf 2003), engineers, IT workers, airline pilots and others. Pacific island Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 49 nurses, usually entering the bottom levels of the \u2018global health care chain\u2019, have migrated much greater distances, to the United Arab Emirates and beyond, as demand intensifies, and also to new destinations within the region, including the Marshall islands and Palau (eg Rokoduru 2008, Connell 2004, 2009). Similarly, the globalisation of sport has meant rugby players going beyond the \u201ctraditional\u201d destinations of New Zealand and Australia to Japan and Europe. (Low remuneration, poor promotion opportunities, limited training and further educational opportunities, poor working and living conditions, particularly in remote regions, are push factors for skilled migrants (Connell 2006). The growing shortage of skilled workers has also contributed to increased inter-island migration, with workers migrating to countries offering better work conditions and salaries, such as Fijian teachers and nurses migrating to the Marshall Islands, and Fijian tourism workers moving to the Cook Islands. Several cities, notably Suva, host major regional institutions and UN agencies that are also important destinations for regional skilled migration. There is also considerable short- term mobility of skilled workers within", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9da28bb2-bfa4-4ada-a240-4290210e7b62": {"__data__": {"id_": "9da28bb2-bfa4-4ada-a240-4290210e7b62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Migration, Mobility and HIV: A Rapid Assessment of Risks and Vulnerabilities in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "961fd2a1bcee2ec5d978e06e269281eb8f278f723e7f2bc7c4577bf58ea06644"}}, "hash": "961fd2a1bcee2ec5d978e06e269281eb8f278f723e7f2bc7c4577bf58ea06644", "text": "and beyond the region. Bureaucrats and others move around the region, attending conferences and workshops. Sporting teams and dance groups similarly move around for such events as the South Pacific Games and the Festival of Pacific Arts. In some smaller states, the brain drain has been equally excessive. The Cook Islands, for example, lost more than half its vocationally qualified population in a single decade (1966- 76) and much the same happened again in the mid-1990s when the national economy collapsed (Connell 2005). Many islands and island states now also experience a shortage of airline pilots, accountants, engineers, IT workers and other skilled groups. Even tiny Niue has had to import refrigeration and other engineers from the Philippines because of its losses (Connell 2007a). The shift to skilled migration, despite remittances, has been at some cost to service provision in many islands, rural and regional areas (especially in Papua New Guinea) and island states, and has resulted in reduced public health capacity in several states, and notably the rural areas of PNG. As skilled migrants have moved away from the region they have also been replaced by others moving into the region. Thus in the health sector there are doctors from a range of European and Asian countries, significant numbers of migrants from south Asia and the Philippines in many skilled occupations and international bureaucrats from a range of countries. Many of these migrants are well-paid individuals living apart from their families. Sexual behaviour and risk factors There is some limited data on increases in sexually transmitted infections and possibly HIV following the staging of large scale pan-Pacific events such as the Festival of Pacific Arts and the South Pacific Games. Specific commentary on the variety of skilled workers who are mobile is difficult due to the range of occupations, destinations and situations. In general, however, if one assumes that skilled workers have higher levels of education, they are more likely to have been exposed to HIV information than unskilled workers and might therefore be at less risk. This is less likely to be true of some groups moving into the region. An additional consideration regarding vulnerability and migration is that the migration of health workers from the Pacific limits the health response to HIV in the region. Most Pacific island countries and territories have much lower rates of health workers per population than countries such as Australia and New Zealand. Further migration only limits the ability of Pacific countries to develop a comprehensive response to HIV and to provide treatment to those living with HIV. These factors can contribute significantly to the spread of the epidemic as it can spread unchecked. A vigorous public health response, often led by health workers, is necessary to prevent high rates of transmission. Interventions and Activities There are very few specific HIV interventions for skilled workers in the Pacific. UNAIDS does some limited work with sportsmen and women who travel for competition and there are opportunities to inform parliamentarians who travel on official business about HIV through the Asia-Pacific Leadership Forum and other bodies. Tourism Tourism is important in many parts of the region, but is of least importance in urban Papua New Guinea where HIV incidence is greatest. Guam and Saipan, being of great importance in Micronesia, receive tourism mainly from Asia (especially Japan, and emerging markets in Taiwan and Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 50 Korea and PR China). Fiji, and to a rather lesser extent, Tahiti, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and the Cook Islands are important elsewhere in the region. Fiji and Vanuatu benefit from tourism from the south, mainly from Australia and New Zealand, and Tahiti benefits from tourists from France and from the United States. Visitor numbers have been influenced by political instability, usually short-lived, and changes in airline routes. Since the 1990s, cruise ship tourism has boomed, especially in the western Pacific (and particularly in Fiji, Vanuatu and New Caledonia). In some countries, notably Vanuatu, there are more cruise ship tourists than all other kinds. Passengers stay onshore for about eight hours. There is no indication that commercial sex has developed in response to cruise ship tourism, but this may merely be a matter of time. Ironically, in a number of parts of the region, including Vanuatu (Cummings 2008), HIV is seen as a \u201cforeign disease\u201d associated with and introduced by tourists, though there is little real evidence of such aetiology. With the exception of the Cook Islands and Palau, smaller countries have largely been unable to gain access to significant tourist markets because of their location,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb4ddcd5-68ea-4d6f-9431-e80c89c0516e": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb4ddcd5-68ea-4d6f-9431-e80c89c0516e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Migration, Mobility and HIV: A Rapid Assessment of Risks and Vulnerabilities in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ab3db69344174555e0eb574a6a5ac152f494f293ef7e504f7a9f23b87d1149c"}, "3": {"node_id": "fb1d5d2b-8dc9-403c-9717-d4769abaf8c0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab7dadcccd77e22f231a6e35a7b3d94efc3bcfc0209d3b5788507e775dc15b6a"}}, "hash": "648384b5ecfd2413fba450562bad835906e8272ca2e5e1ebfe3e73c47e175da6", "text": "intervening opportunities and a lack of standard attractions. In both these countries, annual tourist numbers are significantly greater than the resident population hence the scope for tourism-initiated change is considerable. Within the region, some of the smaller destinations seek to find their own niche markets (eg ecotourism, honeymoons) so as to exploit their unique selling points, and Tonga and Samoa have had some limited success. Most tourists stay no more than a week or so, many are families and a large number spend a significant time close to the resorts. Sex tourism from Papua New Guinea to neighbouring Jayapura in Indonesia has been reported in the Papua New Guinea press for 20 years and has been confirmed by a 2005 UNICEF-funded survey (HELP Resources Inc 2005). Some male tourists may also engage in sexually activities with other males, particularly in Fiji and some parts of Polynesia. Few specific reports or articles are available on risk factors for HIV in the tourism sector in the Pacific. Two reports that do contain some relevant information on the Fiji and Solomon Islands situation focus on the commercial sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children (Save the Children Fiji 2005; Christian Care Centre 2004). While the Solomon Islands study cited a few instances, the Fiji study covered incidences of sex tourism and noted anecdotal evidence confirming that tourists travel to that part of the Pacific looking for anonymity and the availability of children in prostitution. Child sex tourism is partly driven by poverty and weak law enforcement, but also by demands for greater access to cash, parental neglect and abuse at home (Save the Children Fiji 2005: 17-18, 23-25).

While the most obvious temporary \u201cin-migration\u201d into the Pacific region is that of tourists, there are other short term visitors such as business workers (and even FIFO miners from northern Australia to Papua New Guinea). While the extent, duration and diversity of such visits are unknown, such visitors may be involved in the same risky behaviour as some tourists. In Cairns (Queensland), there has been a recent increase in HIV that can be linked to men travelling to Papua New Guinea on business or in some leisure areas. Sexual behaviour and risk factors The Save the Children and Christian Care Centre studies noted above confirm high risk sexual encounters between tourists and young girls and boys in the Pacific, but primarily in Fiji, though they are unable to quantify the aspects of the interactions. The Christian Care Centre report on the Solomon Islands noted that child sex tourism is \u201crelatively uncommon\u201d whereas in Fiji it appeared to be becoming more common. In neither country was it easy to distinguish child sex tourism from more general commercial sex. Studies from other parts of the world confirm that tourists can engage in significant high risk behaviour. A qualitative study in Brazil noted that \u201calcohol and other drug use by tourists increases their vulnerability to HIV transmission through favouring casual sexual intercourse without condoms\u201d (Santos and Paiva 2007). Other studies note high rates of sex tourism in Costa Rica, Dominican Republic (Kelly 2005) and Kenya (Romero-Daza and Freidus 2008) and Asia.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb1d5d2b-8dc9-403c-9717-d4769abaf8c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb1d5d2b-8dc9-403c-9717-d4769abaf8c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Migration, Mobility and HIV: A Rapid Assessment of Risks and Vulnerabilities in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ab3db69344174555e0eb574a6a5ac152f494f293ef7e504f7a9f23b87d1149c"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb4ddcd5-68ea-4d6f-9431-e80c89c0516e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/migration-mobility-and-hiv-rapid-assessment-risks-and-vulnerabilities-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "648384b5ecfd2413fba450562bad835906e8272ca2e5e1ebfe3e73c47e175da6"}}, "hash": "ab7dadcccd77e22f231a6e35a7b3d94efc3bcfc0209d3b5788507e775dc15b6a", "text": "There is reason to believe that as governments crack down on sex tourism elsewhere, there is a better prospect of it becoming more important in the Pacific.

The recent emergence of Business Coalitions Against HIV and AIDS in the Pacific (BAHA Fiji in the footsteps of BAHA PNG) may however contribute to increases prevention activities as the private gets more involved. Return Migration At no time during the past quarter of a century has there been substantial permanent return migration of international migrants to their home islands and island states, despite the centrality of an ideology of return. Return has been greatest where distances have been less and economic opportunities greater, and consequently least in more remote islands and regions. Limited return migration is partly due to the great differences in income levels with the metropolitan periphery, but also to a host of social factors. Hence it is greatest in the larger states where opportunities are greatest and least in the smallest island states. The return migration of those with skills has tended to be limited in part because those skills cannot be practised locally and return migrants are poorly recompensed. Skilled migrants nonetheless do return often for family reasons or to establish businesses. Most island states, however, have been unable to benefit from contemporary strategies to benefit economically and socially from diaspora populations, since economic opportunities are limited in many island states. Return migrants tend to be absorbed within the service sector, rather than directly in production, as in Tonga, where remittances have been used to set up market stalls which become the prelude to stores and business ventures. Disappointments discourage other returnees, and return migration may be the start of a new phase of circulation. Limited return is also function of a social context where the children of migrants are educated in the destination country, have lost some degree of contact with \u201chome\u201d societies and critical linguistic and other skills. Importantly, however, there is a great deal of circular migration as migrants return temporarily or for holidays just as islanders visit their kin in metropolitan (and other destinations). This short term movement, a key means of transferring remittances to the region, is largely undocumented but highly important for the various forms of social and economic relations. It is particularly common throughout Polynesia and Micronesia. While it is known that some Pacific migrants are employed as sex workers overseas (Federated States of Micronesians in Hawaii), the extent of this employment is largely unknown, and the extent to which workers who may have contracted Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 53 diseases overseas and then returned home is similarly unknown. The social and economic consequences of return migration are variable and the impact on public health is poorly understood but is likely to have some significance for the transmission of HIV. Sexual behaviour and risk factors Return migrants often come home with increased status and resources, thus potentially increasing the opportunities for sexual engagement and partnership. The Global Fund Round 7 multi-country Pacific application, for example, notes that \u201csignificant numbers of Federated States of Micronesia citizens reside in Guam and Hawai\u2019i where HIV prevalence is considerably higher and there is ready movement of people between these populations. It is anticipated that this will be the main source of future HIV infections diagnosed in the Federated States of Micronesia\u201d (Global Fund 2007). Similarly, for the Marshall Islands, it is asserted that \u201ccitizens of the Marshall Islands have the right of residence in Hawai\u2019i and the mainland United States (where the HIV prevalence is higher) and there is considerable travel between the countries.\u201d While these conclusions are certainly true, the extent of mobility between metropolitan states and \u201chome states\u201d is largely unknown. Interventions and Activities There are currently no HIV activities specifically targeted to return migrants in the Pacific. Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 54 In reviewing the complex migration pathways in the Pacific and the behaviour of specific mobile groups, a number of key issues emerge. Migration and mobility are powerful mechanisms in the Pacific. As long as urban employment appears more prestigious and city life is perceived as being of higher quality than rural life, population pressures in urban areas will increase. The social, economic and environmental future of the region depends to a great extent on how successfully these problems can be solved.

Although poverty is not a welcome word in most parts of the region and few countries officially admit that it exists, there is now growing evidence that it is widespread, though disguised by words such as \u2018hardship\u2019 (Abbott and Pollard 2004), and is a critical factor in the rise of commercial sex work and HIV transmission. A second consequence is sustained rural-urban migration. A major task for most states is to create employment and provide services, for outer islands and remote places, that would stimulate development, reduce migration and contribute to national growth. Island states, individuals and various international agencies have attached new and increased significance to migration, remittance flows, return migration and the role of the diaspora in contexts where \u201cconventional\u201d national development strategies have achieved limited success. The high level of HIV in Papua New Guinea points to the significance of internal migration rather than international migration as the critical influence. This also indicates that an increasing prevalence may be more likely to occur in such urban areas as Honiara, Suva, and perhaps elsewhere in Fiji, where rural-urban migration is considerable, natural population increase remains relatively high, international migration opportunities are scarce and urban unemployment rates are very high. Conclusion Other countries and urban contexts where this conjuncture is emerging, notably Port Vila in Vanuatu and in other large towns in Fiji, may become of more critical concern. However, as the situation in Papua New Guinea indicates, rural areas are far from immune to HIV. Beyond the general process of urbanisation, there are also a number of key migration groups that exist in large numbers in the Pacific including seafarers, military personnel and commercial sex workers. Urban areas where they tend to congregate, permanently or temporarily, are particular hot spots. Each of these groups is at particular risk of HIV transmission due to behaviours and attitudes. Mining centres and logging camps are lesser hot spots. Specific interventions and policies are needed to address the challenges that each group faces. Migration and mobility are underestimated risk factors for HIV in the region. Greater recognition is needed among policy makers regarding the present and potential significance of migration for the spread of HIV. This recognition has come in Africa and Asia but is not sufficiently widespread in the Pacific. Although Asian Development Bank and AusAID- funded projects exist among seafarers, migration as a whole is not recognised as a driver of the epidemic in the region. While the report has highlighted the sexual behaviour associated with a number of mobile groups from anecdotal evidence and the pockets of research conducted, the intervention and activities are limited reflecting the lack of appropriate responses when dealing with migration and mobility and the specific vulnerabilities to HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections associated with mobility. The report has drawn attention to the few groups in the Pacific working with sex workers on HIV awareness and activities and there are targeted interventions developed for seafarers and within some mining communities in Papua New Guinea. However, data collection and research on the extent of the sale of sexual services, male to male sex and their effects on HIV have been limited to areas within PNG. Further research is also needed to better understand the interaction and sexual networking between mobile groups as well as the specific vulnerabilities of women in the Pacific i.e. lack of legal protection and power, discrimination and exploitation manifesting in sexual and gender based violence. Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 55 Stigma and discrimination regarding HIV remains prevalent and the response to the epidemic has also been slowed by the conservatism of some Pacific leaders and institutions that have been reluctant to discuss issues of sex, marginalisation, men who have sex with men , sex work and access to condoms. It is significant that while there is no public health justification, out of 59 countries and territories that still have some form of HIV-specific restriction on entry, stay and residence that is based on HIV status, at least nine are in the Pacific (the information is not available for 5 additional Pacific Island Countries).

Further effort also needs to be made towards addressing the social context that drives migrant behaviour which is linked to the search for professional or economic opportunities and health and education services. Driving factors are also exacerbated in contexts of conflict, political tensions, repression and human rights abuses. Because of the complexity of migration pathways (which are constantly evolving) and the diversity of countries within the region (in terms of social organisation, economic development migration and HIV status), any intervention will need to be equally diverse and involve \u201cmultisectoral approaches that bring together key actors from source, transit, and destination communities\u201d (IOM 2006). It is the challenge facing the Pacific to integrate the twin challenges of HIV vulnerability and mobility decision-making in order to develop appropriate and targeted interventions. Suggested recommendations On the basis of this rapid assessment and given both the complexity of the issues involved and the diversity of the region, it is inappropriate to make firm and very specific recommendations on the type of intervention or on the policies that need to be put in place to address mobility related HIV vulnerability. The following suggestions are made based on these preliminary findings and are in line with principles and good practices internationally recognised: Improve the evidence base In order to better inform the multi-sectoral approach necessary to deal with the challenges of HIV vulnerability and mobility, the lack of knowledge and specific data on the sexual behaviour and risk factors of migrant groups in the Pacific needs to be addressed. A number of key areas of insufficient data emerge as priorities for future research. The most prominent of these include: l Sufficient data on the increasing movement of people to urban areas and the development of informal settle- ments in the Pacific is not available. This movement is driven by poverty of opportunities and lack of available resources which can lead to sex work and poor health outcomes. Research on the drivers of urbanisation, types of settlements, and specific risk behaviours associated with the movement is needed to develop a further understanding of urban poverty as well as its link to HIV vulnerability; l While quite a few studies have been conducted on commercial sex workers \u2013 in Papua New Guinea in particular \u2013 the issue of foreign sex workers migrat- ing and some of them possibly being trafficked to the Pacific has not been understood sufficiently and might be an area of priority research given the high risk of HIV transmission; l Migration of a predominantly male labour force for plantation and mining work has been linked to HIV transmission in Africa and elsewhere; more research needs to be done in the region on this. This might be an opportunity to partner with private sector organisa- tions in Papua New Guinea to conduct relevant studies and develop response strategies; l Specific studies on the behaviour and attitudes of Pacific military and security forces are not available. These intermittently risk-taking young men are increas- ingly globally mobile and receive substantial salaries. The potential for risky sexual behaviour is high as is the likelihood of returning with and spreading sexually transmitted infections if they do not practice safe sex and do not test themselves upon return; l Whereas the UN High Commission for Refugees in Africa has done much work on HIV vulnerability of refugees, this does not seem to have been the case to date in Papua New Guinea among Papuan refugees. This might be an area of priority research as the epi- demic escalates in Papua New Guinea and as climate change may result in more refugees in the region; Migration, Mobility and HIV A rapid assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the Pacific 56 l French Polynesia and New Caledonia have some of the highest numbers of reported HIV cases in the Pa- cific. This might be linked to better surveillance systems, or the large tourism industry in those islands or to spe- cific migration from metropolitan France but, at present, not enough information is available; l Relatively little research has been done on the vulnerability of family members of migrants and mobile workers. Additional research on issues of economic and social vulnerability when an adult breadwinner travels would be appropriate to develop a more holistic understanding of relevant challenges.

The mobility system encompasses origin, transit, destinations, return and what moves people around. A mobility system wide approach is necessary because migrants and mobile populations interact all along the mobility system and not only at their destination. In addition, migrants and mobile populations do not have a higher incidence of HIV per se; they are more vulnerable because the context of migration or mobility put them at increased exposure risk than people who do not move. Their degree of HIV vulnerability depend essentially on the conditions under which they move, interact, access or not services at different points of the mobility system. The most vulnerable amongst migrant groups are the undocumented ones. Therefore interventions need to not only focus on the migrants themselves or at only one particular point of the system but also on: l Host resident communities and workplaces l Sending communities (i.e the home villages, families and communities of migrant workers) l Communities at transit points as well as in the other areas where migrants are going l Addressing/ improving the general condition under which people migrate, move and work or live within the mobility system, in particular in terms of access to adequate services ; l Efforts to provide HIV and STI prevention care and treatment services for migrants and Mobile populations should be in proportion to their HIV risk vulnerability. In general this risk is greater for undocumented migrants; Interventions should be grounded in human rights, promote and protect the human rights of both migrants and host residents; Migrants being foreigners in host communities are often stigmatised and see their rights violated. They have are often perceived has \u201cvectors\u201d of diseases and or associated with social problems such as crime, theft, drug use, etc... The reaction to this perception by host communities is often repressive, thus heightening migrants\u2019 vulnerability to HIV. To counteract this, all stakeholders must ensure that their responses are gender responsive promote and protect human rights and are culturally relevant. All mobile populations \u2013 nationals and non-nationals alike \u2013 should benefit from access to evidence-informed HIV programmes as part of efforts to achieve universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support and to implement effective responses to HIV. Legal barriers to HIV prevention, treatment and care services as well as to the free circulation of people living with HIV should be removed has they have no public health justification and are discriminatory. They restrict the participation of HIV positive people in major life activities and reduce their involvement in the response to HIV. They interfere with the rights to life, privacy, liberty, work, the highest attainable standard of health, the rights of women, the rights of the child, the rights of migrants, and the rights to seek asylum and to protect the unity of the family. As recently highlighted by an International Task Team as well as the UN secretary General , there is no evidence that HIV- related restrictions on entry, stay and residence protect the public health and may in fact impede efforts to protect public health (UNAIDS 2008b).

A key challenge for us always is to show results and to ensure what we do has an impact on the lives of the people in the Pacific. We continue to try and improve in this area and to find ways to report effectively on our contribution to bringing about change and advancement while reflecting on the need to build capacity and local ownership. In 2010 there emerged significant support for financial inclusion in the Pacific that will see this joint UNCDF and UNDP programme expand its reach and scope of work in areas such as mobile money, promoting savings and financial literacy. It will also be the largest of the four pillars in terms of resource use. A key aspect of the work of the Pacific FinanciaI Inclusion programme is its work with Central Banks to develop policies and regulations that enable a broad range of financial service providers to reach low income clients. It has also helped build public-private partnerships with government, central banks, commercial banks and mobile network operators to broaden the reach of financial services offered in the region.It is well on target to see an additional 250,000 people \u2013 of whom most are among the poorest in the region \u2013 become participants in the finance sector. Crisis prevention and recovery, a pillar that combines support for the prevention of conflict as well as ways to reduce the risks of disasters. This was the second biggest programme area for the Centre in 2010. Under this pillar a community of practice has been established to address regional and national issues of peace and development and for building the capacity in a number of countries of governance institutions to oversee and manage security institutions. Both these initiatives required careful planning and coordination with a diverse range of partners and considerable patience as such issues are sensitive and often difficult to confront. In the area of disaster risk reduction, the Centre led the establishment of an innovative South-South project that has seen exchanges and knowledge sharing between the Caribbean and the Pacific. This work, as well as support for specific initiatives on climate change, has attracted international attention. In the area of Democratic Governance the Centre, in partnership with UNODC, held an information exchange among Pacific Island countries on the value of UNCAC. While this exchange occurred only in July 2010, there already positive signs that at least three countries will move towards ratification in 2011 \u2013 if this happens these countries will join PNG, Palau and Fiji, which have already ratified UNCAC. Support to Pacific Parliaments has steadily borne fruit and demonstrates the strength of UNDP\u2019s work at Message from the Pacific Centre Manager UNDP PACIFIC CENTRE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 6 both national and regional levels with a network of national projects and a regional platform of support. Working with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association \u2013 Australia Region, the Centre helped mobilize financial support and a twinning arrangement to more sustainably assist the Parliaments of Kiribati, Tonga and Tuvalu. The Centre has also played a strong and visible role in advancing the role of women through the development of tools and knowledge products to facilitate law reform (e.g. CEDAW indicators, drafting instructions for human rights-based legislative reform); support for Pacific CSOs\u2019 engagement with international human rights mechanisms; and to advocate for the adoption of temporary special measures to promote gender equality in Pacific parliaments. For the MDG and Poverty pillar, support was provided to countries in the Pacific as they seek to make progress under the MDG\u2019s; in addressing poverty and increasing disparities and marginalization in the community; the more efficient use of energy and better environmental outcomes; and ways to prevent the further spread of HIV and AIDS in the Pacific. Much of the work under this pillar demands a multi- sectoral approach that has most impact when tailored for specific country needs. The Centre supported the UNDP country offices and UN agencies in the staging of the Pacific Conference on the Human Face of the Global Economic Crisis that was held in Vanuatu in February 2010. The outcomes of this conference were considered by Pacific Leaders at the 39th Forum Leaders meeting and were captured in Pacific positions expressed during the global Summit in September 2010. Environment and Energy issues have taken on even greater importance in the Pacific with the spike in fuel prices in 2009 and increased focus on climate change. Ground breaking research has been undertaken to strengthen Fiji\u2019s response to HIV and AIDS.

The Centre\u2019s work was reviewed as part of the mid-term review of the Asia Pacific Regional Programme. There has also been a follow up to a 2009 review of the Asia Pacific regional centre architecture that included amongst its recommendations that there was a need for the operations of the Fiji Multi-Country Office and the Pacific Centre to be better integrated. The contractual arrangements for more than half the international staff in the Centre also changed and this required an adjustment and complete re-recruitment exercise for 10 posts. The Pacific Centre is now one of two in Asia Pacific. The Colombo Centre closed in 2010 through an amalgamation with the large Centre in Bangkok. While the Bangkok Centre team is expected to support activities for all of the Asia and Pacific region, the Pacific Centre has a specific mandate to support UNDP\u2019s work in the Pacific island countries. The regional network together with access to global knowledge and experience ensures that UNDP, through its country offices, is able to provide well considered advice and support. In conclusion I would like to express my appreciation to the Centre\u2019s many partners and supporters, to our colleagues in New York, Bangkok and the UNDP Pacific country offices and especially to the team in the Pacific Centre who worked tirelessly throughout 2010. UNDP PACIFIC CENTRE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 7 Economic Trends in the Pacific Pacific economies continued to suffer from the impact of the global economic crises, with little or no signs of recovery. Actual growth rates of GDP in 2009 and updated estimates for 2010 fell below last year\u2019s forecasts in most Pacific countries, with very modest exceptions for Samoa, Palau and Tuvalu. Growth in Solomon Islands, on the other hand, has significantly exceeded 2009 forecasts due to a rise in commodity prices, and consequently, a significant increase in exports. The average growth rates for the region as a whole (3.7% and 4.3%) were higher than forecast (2.8% and 3.7%) for both 2009 and 2010 respectively, due to positive growth in PNG, Solomon Islands and Timor Leste. GDP real growth rates in Vanuatu were slightly disappointing, 3.8% for 2009, lower than the forecast 4.0%, and 4.0% for 2010, lower than the forecast 4.6% despite the increase in exports -- mainly copra, coconut oil, timber, kava and beef-- resulting in improvement in merchandise trade and current accounts balances. ADB\u2019s optimistic forecast of 5.5% GDP real growth for 2011 is primarily due to the performance of these same resource-driven economies. According to ADB, 2010 estimated growth rates for Fiji and Tonga are negative (-0.5% and -1.2%, respectively). Meanwhile, Kiribati, RMI, FSM, Palau, Cook Islands and Samoa, all of which have experienced negative growth in 2008 and 2009, are out of negative territory, yet growth remains weak, averaging around 0.5%. The negative growth rates in 2009 were not exclusive to the Pacific. The global economic crises pushed the growth rate of many developing countries and LDCs in Asia into negative in 2009, including Armenia (-14.2%), Georgia (-3.9 %), Hong Kong (-2.8%), Maldives (-3.1 %), Cambodia (-2.0%), Malaysia (-1.7%), Singapore (-1.3%) and Thailand (-2.2%). All these countries showed some signs of recovery in 2010, recording positive estimated growth rates. Weak performance of tourism, a traditional source of growth in the Pacific, persists during 2010, as modest increases in tourist arrivals in some Pacific countries were offset by substantial price discounts, as in the cases of Fiji and Vanuatu. According to the national bureau of statistics in Samoa, the contribution of the hotel and restaurant sector to GDP experienced negative growth of -23.4 % and -20.2% (in real terms) in the first and second quarters of 2010 respectively. The slight improvement in the estimated real growth rate of GDP for 2010, 0.5 %, in comparison with -0.8 % in 2009, was due to post-tsunami reconstruction and, surprisingly, a considerable boost in manufacturing output, particularly food and beverages, during the first two quarters of 2010. Furthermore, remittances, development assistance and agricultural exports failed to show any major signs of recovery sizable enough to reverse the worsening trends of economic growth. Meanwhile, inflationary pressure due to international high energy and commodity prices continues threatening to increase poverty levels, as real incomes decline throughout the region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee163b94-e11a-4819-92d3-937478231351": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee163b94-e11a-4819-92d3-937478231351", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Annual Report 2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7bbe639435af6308dc5897b9f57bc1f91fa476b16add3839bdfdab680facd7f9"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa35513c-df2d-4e97-b9af-fc2bb06caf89", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b58d2964a09a5bcf3477930917b353b1b27c9ecd65d90d37c7659149f6d847df"}}, "hash": "ee811704a2b1ec187a87ff0f6e9989d9b4083c9a380121fd2b714914c4393753", "text": "The estimated average inflation rate for the region as a whole, according to ADB ADO 2010, is estimated at 9.5%, 5.4%, 5.9% and 5.4% in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.

The economic trends continue to remind us of the vulnerability and fragility of the economic structure in most Pacific Islands. Enabling Environment for Change UNDP PACIFIC CENTRE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 8 Poverty and Vulnerability Trends The incidence of extreme poverty, those living below the food poverty line is relatively low, averaging around 7% of households and 10% of the population for the region as whole. For Palau, the incidence of food poverty is estimated at zero, in Kiribati, Samoa, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Tonga, the level of incidence is estimated at approximately 5-7% and it is estimated at between 10-12% in FSM, Fiji and Solomon Islands. Only in PNG and Fiji is the level of extreme or food poverty becoming a serious concern. Evidence suggests that serious hardship, hunger and malnutrition, although not widespread not only exist, but are increasing. This conclusion is supported by an analysis of household income using the World Bank\u2019s estimates of PPP for non-ICP countries in the Pacific, which also suggests that the incidence of extreme poverty (less than US$1.25 per capita per day) is low. Meanwhile, the proportion of the population under the basic need poverty line as well as different forms of hardship are quite high and rising throughout the Pacific. The results from Fiji\u2019s 2008-09 Household Income/Expenditure Survey (HEIS) are not yet available. Narayan (2009), however, estimates poverty in Fiji in 2008 to be around 40%. Samoa\u2019s 2008 HIES reveals that around 37% of total household expenditure is on food. It also shows that lowest income percentile receives only 1.9% of total income, while the highest income percentile receives nearly 40% of total income. All Pacific countries, with the exception of Vanuatu, are net food importers. Furthermore, large segments of the population in the Pacific are net food buyers, not only in urban areas, but also in many parts of the rural areas. The most vulnerable populations in urban areas are generally those who live in squatter settlements surrounding capitals. The impact of the financial crisis on nutrition and hunger, particularly among children, are increasing concerns for the urban poor. Meanwhile, in rural areas, the thin line of support that subsistence farmers or fishermen had in order to obtain cash, was seriously diminished. Atoll countries are exceedingly vulnerable to food insecurity. They are affected by the impacts of volatile international food and energy prices due to inherent resource limitations, particularly productive land resources, in addition to geographic remoteness and isolation that increase transaction costs, such as cost of shipping and communications. Recent Household Income/Expenditure Surveys currently underway in several PICs may demonstrate that the presumption that hunger is not a pressing issue in the Pacific is no longer valid. Higher expenditures on food and fuel have reduced expenditure on health and education and have squeezed expenditure that might otherwise have been used for agricultural inputs, such as better seeds, fertilizers and tools, to expand food production. It is estimated that at least 6.44 million people in the Pacific are potentially vulnerable to the impacts of the global economic crisis \u2013 defined here as women, children under 15 years of age, and people over 60 years of age \u2013 or 67 per cent of the current total Pacific population of 9.68 million. These numbers could be higher if the jobless and those struggling under debt burdens are included. Of those affected, the ADB estimated that 50,000 would join those already living below the poverty line in 2010, because of the crisis. Expansion and Outreach in the Financial Sector The increasing monetization of Pacific economies is placing an ever greater burden on Pacific Islanders to earn, manage and save cash resources. Earning money remains a challenge throughout the Pacific. However there has been significant progress in assisting others in managing, moving, and saving cash resources. The financial sector remains dominated by three banks in the region. Banking remains a profitable enterprise throughout the region and recent studies on fees and interest rates have shed light on the relative high cost of banking here. However, there have been efforts to reduce costs and improve access to communities. It started with the Bank of the South Pacific of PNG finalizing its takeover of Colonial Bank in Fiji as part of its strategy to compete regionally with Westpac and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94da5085-82af-4725-8771-84c75bcb3022": {"__data__": {"id_": "94da5085-82af-4725-8771-84c75bcb3022", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Annual Report 2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99b7719865704d9cd8312e590c596169821cd252d4a46f0cb0fc708ccc4ef505"}}, "hash": "99b7719865704d9cd8312e590c596169821cd252d4a46f0cb0fc708ccc4ef505", "text": "ANZ banks of Australia. In several countries the three banks have introduced interoperable ATM machines. BSP took the World UNDP PACIFIC CENTRE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 9 Bank Group\u2019s International Finance Corporation as an investor and created BSP Rural in PNG, a wholly owned subsidiary charged with providing appropriate deposit services in rural PNG using technology and streamlined branches and agencies to be cost effective. Westpac Bank piloted a point-of-sale (POS) based deposit and withdrawal service to enable Westpac account holders to deposit or withdraw funds with any Westpac POS merchant. This is part of a new Westpac regional strategy to move from primarily a corporate bank to a full service retail bank. Its efforts have included a large investment in financial literacy training of new clients. ANZ continues its Rural Banking programme in three countries and is developing a regional microfinance strategy. In June and July 2010, two mobile network operators (MNOs) in Fiji launched mobile money services to facilitate domestic person-to-person payments at a far lower cost than existing services. In the first six months of the services, Vodafone and Digicel have registered over 300,000 customers \u2013 a third of the population of Fiji. Both are beginning to pilot new services including utility payments and have begun expanding their agent networks into more rural areas of Fiji. Digicel has announced its intentions to launch in several other countries in early 2011. Microfinance institutions play a minor role in the region except for PNG and Timor-Leste, where the MFIs are fairly large deposit-takers. In Timor-Leste, PNG and Fiji, central banks have begun developing regulations to enable them to better oversee the work of MFIs. Samoa\u2019s South Pacific Business Development (SPBD) expanded operations into Tonga, rolling out in dozens of villages and reaching thousands of women with small loans, then opened its doors in Fiji in late 2010. Each of these efforts marks a significant shift from the past, and the beginning of a \u201cPacific solution\u201d to financial services for the poor is emerging through the efforts of these regional companies. Political Developments Elections were held in four Pacific Island countries in 2010. In Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Cook Islands, the elections resulted in the installation of new Governments. In Solomon Islands a new coalition government with a narrow majority came to power. Tonga witnessed historic elections in November 2010, when the first parliament was elected following major constitutional reforms. For the first time, seventeen members of the Legislative Assembly were elected by ordinary people or commoners, while nine members continued to be elected by Nobles. Two additional Members of Parliament were subsequently appointed by the King as Ministers. In Vanuatu, a series of no confidence motions and the subsequent shift in the Government\u2019s coalition partners resulted in the election of a new Speaker in the January 2010 session of Parliament. In November 2010, a no confidence motion was again flagged and a subsequent change in coalition partners resulted in the formation of a new Government. In Nauru, a referendum was held in February 2010 proposing a range of governance reforms. The referendum was unsuccessful. Following the long political impasse in which the Government twice called elections to resolve the resulting stalemate and declared a state of emergency, a Government was finally formed. A number of priority parliamentary reforms have since been flagged by the Government. In Papua New Guinea, after eight years, the Supreme Court struck down key sections of the Organic Law on the Integrity of Political Parties and Candidates (OLIPPAC) in July 2010. OLIPPAC was seen to be a key factor in the stability of recent PNG governments, as it restricted the ability of individual MPs to cross the floor in no confidence votes. The Government indicated it would review the law and make amendments as necessary. A no confidence motion was immediately flagged by the Opposition, but Parliament was subsequently adjourned. The Opposition has since taken the Speaker of Parliament to Court on the basis of his ruling on their motion. In November 2010, another no confidence motion was flagged, but it was not tabled. In December 2010, in advance of an expected referral to a Leadership Tribunal under the Leadership Code, Prime Minister Somare stepped aside and his deputy, Hon Sam Abal, became Acting Prime Minister. UNDP PACIFIC CENTRE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 10 In December 2010, President Tong of Kiribati and his Government survived a motion of no confidence lodged by the Opposition on the last day of the sitting of Parliament.

It is not known when Parliament will meet again, or who will form the new Government. In Fiji, the Interim Government which came to power following the December 2006 coup continues in control. Fiji\u2019s diplomatic relations with a number of countries in the region remains strained. The country\u2019s Public Emergency Regulations remain in place. In June 2010 the Government passed a Media Industry Development Decree, which has been criticized by media freedom advocates. The Decree, which requires national ownership of all media outlets, resulted in the forced sale of the Fiji Times. In July 2010, the Fiji Government organized an \u201cEngaging Fiji Meeting\u201d attended by leaders and senior officials from 10 Pacific island countries. The meeting was convened following a decision by the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) to postpone its own meeting in Fiji due to concerns raised by the Vanuatu Prime Minister over Fiji chairing the MSG. The impasse over Fiji\u2019s chairing has only recently been resolved. Governance matters continue to be a major challenge in the region. In March 2010, concerns were raised by anti-corruption advocates about proposed changes to the PNG Constitution to limit the powers of the PNG Ombudsman Commission, a strong national anti-corruption body. It was reported that more than 5,000 Papua New Guineans rallied in Port Moresby to protest against the proposed amendments after they were tabled in Parliament, and submitted a petition of 20,000 signatures against the amendments. The amendments were not passed. In November 2010, the Vanuatu Parliament passed a Bill approving the ratification of the UN Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC). If and when the Executive ratifies UNCAC, Vanuatu will become the fourth Pacific Island country todo so. Significantly, the new UNCAC Review Mechanism commenced in July 2010, and both Fiji and PNG were chosen to be in the first group of countries to complete a self-assessment of their compliance. Internal tension within the media industry in the Pacific resulted in the split of the Pacific Island News Association (PINA) with the formation of a new regional media association called Pasifica Media Association (PasiMA) based in Apia, Samoa and chaired by the Samoa Observer newspaper publisher. Energy and Environment During the Forty-first Pacific Islands Forum in Vanuatu Leaders endorsed the new Framework for Action on Energy Security in the Pacific and reaffirmed their commitment to renewable energy and an energy efficient future based on achievable, practical and voluntary targets. From 1 January 2010 SPC took over from SOPAC as the lead coordinating CROP agency on energy. This includes being the focal point for development partner interaction and coordinating resource mobilisation and allocation for the delivery of regional energy services. The Forum Leaders reiterated that \u2018\u2026climate change remains the greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and well-being of the peoples of the Pacific\u2019 and called for a meaningful legally binding agreement on emissions reduction to be reached urgently and without delay. Furthermore the leaders recognized the importance of effective coordination and implementation of climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts at all levels, and particularly at national level. UNDP PACIFIC CENTRE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 11 Key Highlights from the Crisis Prevention and Recovery Team Strengthening Capacities for Peace and Development (CPAD) The Strengthening Capacities for Peace and Development (CPAD) project has had a highly successful year in opening up and sustaining a dialogue process in Fiji, and supporting a wide range of Pacific civil society organizations to engage more effectively in peacebuilding. The project has gained recognition as a community of peace practitioners. As much of the energy of CPAD has been focused on Fiji, in 2011 it will focus on getting the same level of traction and support in the wider Pacific region. In May this year, over 50 participants from regional CROP agencies, Bougainville, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tonga representing governments, non government organizations, private sector and development partners, attended the 10-day CPAD induction workshop. The Pacific Peace Community of Practice was launched as the main workshop outcome. In Fiji, a workshop on resource-based conflicts was organized by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and the UNDP Pacific Centre. The policy recommendations drawn up by participants from the workshop were presented to the Deputy Secretary Prime Minister\u2019s Office for consideration. Also in Fiji, UNDP convened a meeting between Government and the CSOs that were participants at CPAD regional workshop. This was the first time since the events of December 2006 that senior Government officials and CSOs had met to discuss how best to collaborate on development issues. The workshop provided a neutral space for deep and honest discussion on the current political, economic and security environment.

Its objectives are to strengthen the cadre of peace practitioners from the Pacific through skills building interventions, up-scaled policy interventions, the regional sharing of good practices and effective conflict prevention and peace building mechanisms suited to the Pacific. Some 50 government, civil society representatives and members of the academia from Bougainville, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tonga discussed the root causes of conflict and designed responses to address conflict and strengthen peace during a regional CPAD induction workshop in May 2010, when the project was implemented. Solomon Islander Simon Mannie, a former civil servant turned rebel and now working for a local CSO, Sycamore Foundation, which works on reconciliation, was part of the CPAD workshop. \u201cOne of the key things I learnt through this workshop is the way in which a consultative policy development process can help address the contributing factors of conflict. As highlighted during this workshop, it is important also that the individual, the community and the institutions link together and work for peace building,\u201d said Simon. During the induction workshop, regional and national priority activities were identified, most of which are being implemented. One such example is a workshop addressing resource based conflicts in Fiji that took place in September. The workshop discussed the management and mitigation of resource based conflict and after four days of reviewing the existing challenges, participants made up of government officials, CSO members and the private sector developed a set of policy recommendations. These focused on strengthening the mechanism for implementing the rural integrated framework, empowering Divisional Commissioners to develop development plans and the use of traditional and local knowledge, building the capacity of resource owners to grow their investments and advocating for an enabling environment that will recognize women\u2019s legal inheritance rights. Deputy Secretary Prime Minister\u2019s Office Filimone Kau who has been involved in CPAD since its inception, said at the closing of the workshop that the government looked forward to \u201ccreating stronger partnerships with civil society organisations and private sector to ensure an integrated approach to development\u201d. Associated with CPAD is a small grants mechanism through which CSOs which are part of CPAD are given grants to implement peace building activities. One activity to benefit from such funding is the Sycamore Tree Project which organized a dialogue symposium in Honiara in October 2010 in partnership with the Prison Fellowship Solomon Island and with the support from RAMSI, UNDP and Solomon Islands Government through the Ministry of Peace Unity and Reconciliation. The three day conference, attended by 70 people, raised awareness about the reconciliation processes being carried out by Sycamore Program; reconciling victims and offenders within prisons and community. Several high level government officials participated including the Deputy Prime Minister Hon Manasseh Lelanga, the Attorney General Billiy Titiulu, Commissioner of Police Peter Marshall, Commissioner of Correctional Services of Solomon Islands, Francis Haisoma and the Commandant of Rove Central Prison Ian Brough. CPAD members together form the Pacific Peace Community, a vibrant virtual space on which they share their experiences and consult each other on the peace building challenges they face.

The Pacific Centre worked with FemLINKPACIFIC, Secretariat of Pacific Community (SPC), PIFS and UNDP PNG to secure regional and global mandates to further implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325: Women, Peace and Security in the Pacific region. In June the Forum Regional Security Committee called on UNDP to take the lead on this Security Council Resolution and convene a regional process, with high level backing of the UNDP Administrator. This proposal was also supported in the outcome statement of the 11th Pacific Women\u2019s Triennial Conference convened by SPC in August 2010. In Papua New Guinea the Government, with technical assistance from UNDP and PIFS, organized a planning workshop to consider options for a national security policy. Addressing Gender\u2013Based Violence in Conflict Situations The CPR team developed a partnership with UNDP Papua New Guinea and UN Partners for Prevention: Working With Boys and Men to Prevent Gender-Based Violence to undertake research on engaging men and boys in post-conflict Bougainville to help prevent gender-based violence. Buy-in was secured through a consultative process, and qualitative research protocols developed. South-South Project An inter-regional south-south project was launched in 2010 to share southern solutions in the area of disaster risk management and climate change adaptation among SIDS countries in the Pacific and the Caribbean regions. Full funding for the project was secured from the UNDP\u2019s Special Unit for South- South Cooperation and from the UNDP-Japan Partnership Fund. Highlights to date include an exchange visit by a group of Pacific Islanders and one Maldives representative to four Caribbean countries to view best practices and technologies suited to SIDS, such as a flood early warning system in Jamaica, tsunami modeling undertaken by Barbados\u2019 coastal zone management unit, and a seismic monitoring station in St. Lucia. Gender and DRM An introductory training package on gender, disasters and climate change was developed by a CPR programme specialist and delivered on request in Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and Solomon Islands. This was done in partnership with other UN agencies and national stakeholders, with substantial positive feedback gathered through evaluations. For 2011, follow-up training will be targeted in these same countries, based on aspects identified that require more in-depth focus in each country. Capacity for gender analysis and mainstreaming in disaster risk management at the country level was also strengthened by bringing an expert from the Caribbean for a closed training session with disaster managers from all Pacific islands. Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Management Under the auspices of the Pacific Disaster Risk Management Partnership Network, UNDP continued in 2010 to provide support to SOPAC to mainstream disaster risk management into planning and budgetary processes. The Government of Fiji approved the first DRM Agriculture Strategy for Fiji, and UNDP is currently developing a three year programme to implement the strategy. In partnership with SOPAC and UNDP PNG CO, the programme for mainstreaming DRM at provincial level was developed and approved by the Government of PNG. The programme includes the development of a DRM action plan with a pilot province. Morobe province was selected. UNDP PACIFIC CENTRE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 14 The vast Pacific Ocean, with island countries dotted across it, has many similarities with the Caribbean, where comparable small island countries populate the Caribbean Seas. Their geographical similarity also brings with them similar challenges, especially when it comes to adapting to climate change and preparing to better face natural disasters such as floods, cyclones, earthquakes, and tsunamis. Pacific Islanders and people from the Caribbean have developed their own coping and adaptation methods, but these two regions have had limited exchanges of common experiences. In the past most ideas were exchanged through chance meetings or as a result of someone stumbling across the information. Exchanges between the two regions have started now through the project: \u201cSouth-South Cooperation between Pacific and Caribbean Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) on Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management\u201d. Put simply the project aims to encourage a systematic sharing of knowledge and experiences to strengthen community safety and resilience to a range of natural disasters in both regions. As part of this exchange project, a Caribbean delegation made up of five specialists was in Fiji in August to attend the Pacific Disaster Risk Management Partnership Network meeting from August 12 -13, 2010. The Caribbean delegation\u2019s visit to Fiji had been preceded by an Asia-Pacific delegation\u2019s visit to the Caribbean.

More inter regional exchanges will be facilitated through the project. The south-south project is coordinated by UNDP Pacific Centre, with extensive support from the regional UNDP programme Caribbean Risk Management Initiative (CRMI) and UNDP\u2019s sub-regional Centre in Trinidad and Tobago. Regional partners who are involved in the project\u2019s governance structure and who lead the implementation of various activities include the Caribbean Disaster and Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA), CARICOM Climate Change Centre (CCCCC) and University of the West Indies (UWI) from the Caribbean region. Key partners from the Pacific region include the Pacific Islands Applied Geo-Science Commission (SOPAC), South Pacific Regional Environmental Programme (SPREP), Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) and University of the South Pacific (USP). The project is funded by UNDP\u2019s Special Unit for South-South Cooperation and by the UNDP-Japan Partnership Fund, with in-kind contributions from UNDP Pacific Centre from where it is coordinated. Pacific and Caribbean Team Up to Exchange Knowledge on Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management UNDP PACIFIC CENTRE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 15 Strengthening Transparency and Accountability Building on the key achievement in 2009 when the Pacific Centre was able to help PNG develop its National Anti-Corruption Strategy, the Centre facilitated the participation of Palau, PNG and Solomon Islands in a UNDP Asia-Pacific Anti-Corruption Community of Practice Meeting. It was designed to build a better understanding of the new UNCAC Review Mechanism endorsed by States Parties in November 2010, and the usefulness of gap analysis and self assessments to the process. Since the meeting, Palau has begun an initial gap analysis and has requested technical support from the Centre with its self assessment. In July 2010, the Pacific Centre, with the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime and PIFS, and with the support of AusAID, organized a Pacific Meeting on Ratification and Implementation of the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC). The meeting was attended by senior officials from 10 Pacific Island countries and offered an opportunity for South-South exchange, with officials from Fiji, PNG and Palau \u2013 the only three countries which have already ratified UNCAC. A number of PICs have since taken concrete steps towards UNCAC ratification: \u2022 The Vanuatu Parliament approved a Bill on accession to UNCAC in November 2010; \u2022 The Tuvalu Government\u2019s Departmental Coordinating Committee has endorsed a proposal for ratification with a Cabinet paper now needed to be endorsed before accession; \u2022 Cook Islands re-established its National Anti-Corruption Committee and revised its TORs to focus on UNCAC ratification. The Centre has also supported work at country level to build capacity for social accountability. Using the on-going UNDP/UNCDF project on provincial government strengthening in Solomon Islands as an entry point, the Centre trained provincial officials and civil society representatives on participatory planning and social accountability tools to prepare them for the establishment of Provincial Development Councils (PDCs). PDCs will be established in all nine provinces to serve as the link between the Provincial Governments and local communities. They will be the mechanism for community participation in the identification and implementation of provincial development priorities. A similar approach is being pursued to mainstream social accountability in existing initiatives of UNDP and development partners at country level to strengthen demand for accountability from the ground up. The Centre also continued to work with various development partners in the region to advance freedom of information (FOI) and freedom of expression (FOE) as a human rights issue through a number of initiatives. These include participation in the 2010 Global World Press Freedom Day, celebration of International Right to Know Day with the Media Association of Vanuatu, and technical support for a regional workshop on media freedom and human rights organised by the International Federation of Journalists (Pacific office) in Samoa. These initiatives continued to build awareness with policy-makers, civil society and the media of the value of the right to information, and the need to progress FOI legislation as a priority. Key Highlights from the Democratic Governance Team UNDP PACIFIC CENTRE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 16 Gender was high on the agenda in 2010 in areas ranging from gender capacity building to the inclusion of gender specific elements in national legislations.

Fiji Red Cross Society, SOPAC and OCHA helped to design and deliver the training. All participants had experience in working in disaster risk management or with vulnerable communities. The training included practical exercises, such as those relating to Vulnerability Capacity Assessments (VCAs). VCAs are conducted by a community to identify and assess the potential hazards it faces. They also lead to better disaster preparedness. Later in the year, UNDP staff members in the Samoa Multi Country Office and Solomon Islands Sub Office were separately trained on gender equality concepts and their application to UNDP\u2019s work. The gender workshops were led by the UNDP Pacific Centre Gender Focal Point Karen Bernard, and in the case of Solomon Islands in collaboration with the National Disaster Management Office, local partners, OCHA and UNIFEM . They were conducted in a participatory manner and included role-playing exercises, participatory dynamics and quizzes with token prizes for for the winners . This approach was used to empower and motivate all staff to make constructive contributions to improving gender equality and addressing sources of potential resistance. Speaking about the training in Samoa, Ms. Bernard said: \u201cOne of the workshop\u2019s main objectives was to explore strategies for achieving progress on gender issues in the Samoan context. While strong national cultures as found in Samoa must be treasured, at the same time UNDP\u2019s global Gender Equality Strategy notes that it is of immense importance that UNDP staffare sufficiently aware and self-critical to be able to embrace new values, attitudes, and practices.\u201d The staff trained at these workshop discussed and brainstormed ideas about how to ensure greater gender equality in UNDP\u2019s projects, as well as in the office and in their daily lives. \u201cOne of the insights they gained is the critical role that men can play in breaking with stereotypes and leading the way to a full recognition of women\u2019s contributions to social and economic life. They suggested there should be male facilitators for such workshops in future,\u201d said Ms Bernard. In August, experiences from the Haiti earthquake were shared by UN ECLAC\u2019s Dr Asha Kambon. She was part of a Caribbean delegation visiting Fiji for the project \u201cSouth-South Cooperation between Pacific and Caribbean Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) on Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Putting Gender back on the Agenda UNDP PACIFIC CENTRE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 17 Management\u201d. Dr Kambon, an expert on integrating gender in disaster responsesdescribed the situation in Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake when many women\u2019s small businesses and other livelihoods were destroyed. A significant number of young families were left without females caregivers, shifting the responsibilities to men. In the area of gender equality in political governance, the Pacific Centre was active in supporting national and regional partners. The Pacific has the lowest number of women representatives in national parliaments in the world. Currently, Tuvalu, FSM, Solomon Islands and Nauru have no women at all in their national parliaments, while Vanuatu, PNG and Tonga have only one women MP each. (Tonga\u2019s was appointed to the legislature by the King.) The Pacific Centre has been working with the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS), in collaboration with UNIFEM, to assist countries develop and implement ways of promoting more women candidates and elected representatives. In Papua New Guinea, the Centre continued to provide technical assistance in support of efforts to reserve 22 seats in the national parliament for women. However, this initiative was stalled by political developments there. In 2010, the Centre also supported PIFS to help Smaller Islands States (SIS) develop options for addressing the lack of gender balance in their legislatures. Technical assistance and advice was given for national workshops on promoting women in political governance. The Centre\u2019s Legislative Strengthening Specialist facilitated Tuvalu\u2019s national consultation. At its conclusion, Ms Saini Simona, Director of the Tuvalu Department of Women, indicated that the priorities identified would be progressed by the Department, in collaboration with other government and non-government partners. \u201cWe strongly support introducing reserved seats for women as a short term, temporary measure so that women\u2019s voices are included in national decision-making forums. We are also focused on long- term strategies to ensure that women have the confidence and capacity to successfully run for open parliamentary seats in the future.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66300940-9eeb-4c6c-86e2-cf0ee6c5dd33": {"__data__": {"id_": "66300940-9eeb-4c6c-86e2-cf0ee6c5dd33", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Annual Report 2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c57e8ec81823c04f51fea3df8d197e8f97a2e6d175a4c29f81e5a5c051974257"}, "2": {"node_id": "80addc0f-a0e0-4602-8226-58141ee5bfd8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79d6c949c8d692722344db888d88401a93b40a20e825e9a3f2dc92c9046cc908"}}, "hash": "02fd89d3b7e4a772b611438e4bc2ce26ae54aad6c5f673ba173a6329a48f9609", "text": "We will work with the men and women of our communities to build support for women in decision-making,\u201d Ms Simona said.

UNDP PACIFIC CENTRE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 18 Two Pacific Island countries are taking significant steps towards ratifying the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC). This development occurred after the Pacific Meeting on the Ratification and Implementation of UNCAC, organised in July 2010 by UNDP Pacific Centre and the UN Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC). It was attended by senior government officials from fourteen Pacific Island countries, as well as officials from the World Bank Stolen Assets Recovery Initiative, Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, Commonwealth Pacific Governance Facility, European Union and UNDP Country Offices. Since the meeting, Vanuatu has advised that its Council of Ministers has approved accession to UNCAC, and the Convention will shortly be tabled in the National Parliament for ratification. Following the meeting, Cook Islands has also re-convened the National Anti-Corruption Committee and intends to revise its Terms of Reference to focus on progressing ratification and implementation of UNCAC. The objective of the Meeting was to raise awareness with senior Pacific officials on the usefulness of UNCAC as a guiding framework for strengthening Pacific Island Countries\u2019 national anti-corruption efforts and in so doing, to encourage more PIC\u2019s to sign on to the Convention. To date, only three PIC\u2019s have ratified UNCAC - PNG in July 2007, Fiji in May 2008 and Palau in March 2009. Samoa\u2019s Prime Minister, Hon. Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Sailele Malielegaoi, who officially opened the meeting said \u201cResources lost to corruption are resources lost to the poor. This in turn slows the progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.\u201d \u201cTackling corruption, at all levels of government, is key towards meeting the national development goals that Samoa has set for itself,\u201d he said. The Prime Minister specifically noted that UNCAC is a useful tool that can assist Pacific Island countries to ensure that they comprehensively tackle corruption, in all its forms, in a coordinated way. During the meeting, participants were given an overview of the newly endorsed UNCAC Review Mechanism. This requires approximately 35 States Parties to UNCAC to undertake an UNCAC Self-Assessment each year, using a new computer-based UNCAC Self-Assessment Checklist. Designed by UNODC, the Checklist tracks compliance (eg. legislative gaps, successes and technical assistance requirements). Under this new Review Mechanism, States Parties will then have their UNCAC Self-Assessment reviewed by two Peer Reviewers (ie. randomly selected States Parties). The new Mechanism was finalised in July 2010, so that Pacific participants were the first in the world to receive training from UNODC on the process. The UNCAC Review commenced in August 2010 with a random selection of countries. In 2010/11, both Papua New Guinea and Fiji were selected. UNODC and UNDP will provide support to complete the Review. Notably, UNCAC is a particularly useful Convention for PICs because of its international cooperation provisions. These call on States Parties to share information relating to corruption investigations, as well as allowing for extradition and prosecution of criminals without the need for additional bilateral agreements between countries. UNCAC\u2019s asset recovery provisions are also particularly noteworthy, as they require States Parties not only to confiscate or seize assets resulting from the proceeds of crime, but also to return them to the originating country once reasonable proof of the corrupt money trail is shown. This is a huge benefit for PICs with limited resources. Tim Steele from the Stolen Assets Recovery (STAR) Initiative (a partnership between the World Bank and UNODC) said STAR works with developing countries to investigate complex money laundering cases and can help facilitate the systematic return of stolen assets.

Promoting South-South cooperation, the Pacific Centre facilitated and sponsored an exchange between staff of the Vanuatu and Solomon Islands parliaments to enable staff from Vanuatu to learn from the experience of the Solomon Islands in strengthening the capacity of the parliament. The Pacific Centre also led the development of a partnership arrangement with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association \u2013 Australia Region, to more sustainably support the Parliaments of Kiribati, Tonga and Tuvalu. Over the next 3 years, UNDP and CPA Australia will work together more closely, through an AusAID funding grant, to streamline technical assistance for more sustainable impact in the three Pacific parliaments. This will include strengthening the twinning partnerships between the three Pacific parliaments and the sub-national parliaments of the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia and Victoria. Technical support from the Centre was also provided for the development of the Parliament of Vanuatu Corporate Plan (2011-13) and for the Mid-Term Evaluation of Phase 2 of the Solomon Islands Parliamentary Support Project. The Centre supported a Meeting of Pacific Parliaments organised by the Australian and New Zealand Parliaments and attended by Pacific parliamentary Speakers, staff and Members of Parliament. Participants endorsed the New Zealand Parliament as the parliamentary hub for Pacific Parliaments, and mandated the Australian Parliament and UNDP to work with them to develop a pilot for providing parliamentary information and research services from a regional platform. The new service, called the Pacific Parliaments Information Network is due to be launched in early 2011. Advancing Women\u2019s Role in the Pacific Recognizing the negative development impact of ongoing discrimination against women in the Pacific, the Centre has played a strong and visible role in advancing the role of women through the development of tools and knowledge products to facilitate law reform (e.g. CEDAW indicators, Drafting Instructions for Human Rights-based Legislative Reform), support for Pacific CSOs engagement with international human rights mechanisms, and advocacy in the adoption of temporary special measures for women in the Pacific (e.g. Utilizing TSM to Promote Gender Balance in Pacific Legislature). Building on ongoing initiatives, the Centre, with PIFS and UNIFEM, supported a meeting in November 2010 on Promoting Women in Decision Making in Smaller Island States (SIS). The meeting brought together officials from the seven SIS in the region. A Regional Action Plan was agreed, based on national Action Plans developed during the year, which will be presented to PIFS SIS members for endorsement in 2011. The Centre will provide technical assistance in support of the Regional and National Action Plan over the coming years. In what may well be a leading initiative in response to the request of the Cook Islands Government, the Centre facilitated the formulation of a CEDAW-compliant draft Family Law Bill for Cook Islands that is scheduled to be submitted to the Cook Island Parliament in early 2011. This Bill, which integrates best practice experiences in family law reform highlighted in the Pacific Centre publication on \u2018Advancing the Implementation of CEDAW in the Cook islands: Good Practice Approaches to a Civil Family Law\u2019, is expected to have long-term impact in advancing women\u2019s rights in the Cook Islands and serve as resource for PICs that are planning to introduce amendments in their family law. UNDP PACIFIC CENTRE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 20 Key Highlights from the Poverty Alleviation and Achievement of the MDGs Team MDGs and poverty reduction: A Pacific Conference on the Human Face of the Global Economic Crisis was held in Port Vila, Vanuatu from 10 to 12 February 2010. The Conference was an outcome of the 40th Pacific Islands Forum held in Cairns, Australia, 5-6 August 2009, where leaders endorsed a proposal by the Government of Vanuatu for a conference to develop effective policy measures and practical responses to support Pacific countries in alleviating the adverse effects of the global economic crisis, with the objective of reducing vulnerability and building sustained resilience. The Chair of the United Nations Development Group (UNDG) and Administrator of United Nations Development Programme, Helen Clark delivered the keynote address at the conference. In preparation for the 2010 MDGs summit, the Pacific Centre provided technical support to Pacific Island delegations through updating MDGs scorecards, preparing technical documents, briefs, snapshots and roundtable discussion papers on poverty, employment and gender in collaboration with UN agencies. The Pacific Centre also undertook pro-poor macro policy analyses in countries covered by the Samoa UNDP MCO and supported Samoa in developing its pro-poor policies and accelerating MDGs achievement.

UNDP PACIFIC CENTRE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 21 What are the MDGs? Why are they important? How can journalists help achieve these development goals? These are some questions that were answered during a week-long workshop on development reporting. Twenty journalists from the Pacific region were trained to become strong agents of change for achievement of the development agenda. They included journalists from Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu and final year journalism students from the University of the South Pacific and Fiji National University. The workshop organized by the UN Communications and Partnership Group was delivered in partnership with the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) with support from the Pacific Islands News Association, Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, Pacific Disability Forum and Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission. It took place in Suva from 23-27 August, 2010. It was intended to equip journalists with the skills to find human interest angles on how governments, CSOs, private organizations and communities are working together in trying to achieve the MDGs. The workshop involved hands\u2013on work, with participants developing and presenting stories. The best radio, print and television story entries were awarded prizes. A special prize was made available for the best student story. The workshop was much appreciated by the journalists. Many said that the workshop helped put a human face to MDGs, something which journalists often viewed as just more UN jargon. A follow-up training is planned for 2011.

Innovative Research for Better HIV Response in Fiji UNDP PACIFIC CENTRE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 23 Key Highlights from the Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme Team Financial Competency Building The high level regional advocacy work, led by PFIP, on strengthening the financial competency of all Pacific islanders is now bearing fruit at country level. In the last quarter of 2009, Forum island education ministers, finance and economic ministers and central bank governors committed themselves to achieving the Money Pacific Goals by creating financial systems that serve, protect and empower the majority of low income and rural people by 2020. Significantly, Central Banks are leading the national efforts. PNG, Solomon Islands, Fiji and Samoa have all agreed to conduct a financial literacy survey to support the preparation of a national financial competency building strategy. Work has begun in Solomon Islands and, in partnership with the World Bank, in PNG. This cutting edge work in measuring financial competency baselines in developing economies is drawing global interest. Twenty two trainers from around the region attended a financial literacy trainers workshop organized by the Central Bank of Samoa with support from the Commonwealth Secretariat and PFIP. The Financial Literacy Working Group in Fiji is actively driving the action plan endorsed at the PFIP-Reserve Bank supported national microfinance conference in November 2009. A major undertaking is the integration of financial education into the school curricula from year 1 to year 13. This will see financial literacy delivered to around 200,000 students at both primary and secondary levels. This project is funded by the Australian Aid Programme through PFIP. Exciting work on financial education through savings-based conditional cash transfer is emerging in Fiji and initial results were well received at the Citi-Financial Times Financial Education Summit held in Sydney in December. Knowledge Products PFIP\u2019s knowledge management strategy is to provide demand-driven knowledge and data to facilitate action and investment by its partners to more efficiently extend financial services to the unserved and underserved. Several mediums for knowledge transfer and sharing are employed by PFIP including workshops, informal information exchanges, scholarships and publications. Three publications and a DVD were produced in 2010 (In Search of Sustainability: The Provision of Rural Financial Services in Solomon Islands; Financial Capability, Financial Competence and Wellbeing in Rural Fijian Households; Focus Note: Can Fiji Micro Finance Institutions be Sustainable; and DVD on Reducing Risk: Microinsurance in the Pacific). These studies were used to specifically support policy development and advocacy work. In the case of Solomon Islands, the report was the primary reference document for the Solomon islands Mid-term Financial Inclusion Strategy Conference held in December and the results of the Fiji report were used extensively for regional and country advocacy that led to the adoption of the 2020 Money Pacific Goals. PFIP was also responsible for updating the financial inclusion situation analysis for 6 PICs on behalf of the financial inclusion donor group. These provide a snapshot of the state of pro-poor financial services in each country, including challenges and opportunities. A particularly effective and interactive format being employed by PFIP is the series of IIEs (informal information exchanges) \u2013 normally a 2 to 3 hour interactive session for stakeholders to acquire state of the industry knowledge on new and emerging opportunities followed by brainstorming on how to catalyze action in each country.

UNDP PACIFIC CENTRE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 24 The framework for financial systems is created by the regulatory environment in which they operate. This environment dictates everything from how easy it is to open a bank account, to the speed of development of new products, and the level of protection that consumers have when using financial services. It is therefore essential to ensure that a prudently permissive regulatory environment is developed that both allows for the development of appropriate financial products and also ensures that those products are safe for the client. PFIP has been supporting a myriad of initiatives to accomplish this. Through a partnership with the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI), a working group of representatives from the five Central Banks in the region was formed to discuss and share experiences in relation to financial inclusion. The group has met three times since inception, and each member has created a comprehensive analysis of policy and regulation in their country with regard to financial inclusion, with a focus on areas of improvement. This south-south cooperation works very well, as all of the countries are facing similar issues., especially with the development of banking over mobile phones, which has many different regulatory implications. The product launched in Fiji first, and PFIP ensured that the Governor of the Central Bank was given training on the topic that he then used to issue an e-money directive approving the issue of electronic money. Lessons like these are then shared in this working group as there are plans to expand these products to other member countries. With the diversity of stakeholders involved in building financially inclusive systems, often it is essential to formulate a vision and action plan for a country that coordinates the roles and responsibilities of those involved. In 2009 PFIP worked with the Reserve Bank of Fiji to do exactly this, and the resulting Task Force on financial inclusion was formulated as a public-private sector partnership that monitors progress toward implementing the action plan. PFIP serves as the secretariat for this group. In Solomon Islands, the Central Bank also requested that PFIP help them organize stakeholders to prioritize initiatives for the next five years. Together with the Central Bank, PFIP held a consultative conference on the topic and developed an action plan for the country that includes forming a special unit in the Central Bank to oversee financial inclusion, and creating a task force like the one in Fiji to help monitor progress. Transformational Change in the Financial Sector UNDP PACIFIC CENTRE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 25 Practitioners across the Pacific and abroad now have the opportunity to connect with, share and learn from each other on how to better address development needs. This was made possible through the Pacific Solution Exchange Development Effectiveness Community (PSE_DEC) launched in October. The PSE_DEC is a facilitated knowledge service initiated by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in partnership with the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat (PIFS), Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the University of the South Pacific (USP). The PSE_DEC started with a six-month trial phase based on UNDP\u2019s proven methodology known as Solution Exchange. Members were engaged in e-discussions via email supported by a team of facilitators. The approach is hoped to initially help members to better share their views and opinions. Based on the feedback from the trial, the Community\u2019s services could then be extended to allow members to ask queries and help each other by sharing knowledge and experience around common development challenges. The first discussion on the PSE_DEC was on \u201cAccelerating MDGs Progress in the Pacific.\u201d This was followed by a discussion on \u201cEffective Resourcing to Address Climate Change.\u201d The knowledge service draws together a broad range of stakeholders from government, civil society, private sector, academia, regional organizations and development partners to share experiences and seek their views via a facilitated mail group on development topics specific to the Pacific, like climate change resourcing, addressing the needs of the poor and the vulnerable, and achieving the MDGs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ca56adb-a510-4c38-8d39-25a34ed35519": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ca56adb-a510-4c38-8d39-25a34ed35519", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Annual Report 2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f24e99d99b4fc3562b10f1d22a5a9631b9394b35b0c5ff8d4c9521308f5076f0"}, "2": {"node_id": "235ac61b-15cd-44d2-9292-6605db507953", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6f7d69e59814b78e01afaf28ae3f0e48778b7a6579cdc28118e42d792a140b0"}}, "hash": "ddf967cb34f83b6d4d7f138e70f4aef960d2e9bf33a3dbec98121559b7be06fd", "text": "The establishment of the PSE_DEC follows discussions at the Pacific Regional Aid Effectiveness Workshop and the Pacific Partners (PIC Partners) Meeting held in June 2010 in Nadi, Fiji.

The Centre\u2019s work is reviewed annually by a Management Committee that is chaired by the Deputy Regional Director and includes the Pacific Resident Representatives and a senior representative from the Bureau for Development Policy. Guidance on the work plan for the Centre is also provided by a Projects Steering Committee that includes country and regional organization representatives. Resources are allocated in the annual work plan for the Centre based on this performance review process and in response to emerging priorities as determined by Pacific Island Forum Leaders. Careful attention is paid to ensuring that the Centre\u2019s work is targeted, complements country-based initiatives that are managed by the UNDP Country Offices and reflects the comparative advantage of UNDP. In 2010 there was a mid-term review of the 2008-2011 Asia Pacific Regional Programme that involved an analysis of programme delivery together with the organizational and institutional arrangements that were established in 2008. The review findings, which have yet to be made public, were generally complementary with respect to the programmes delivered in the Pacific. The Management Committee met in Papua New Guinea on 28-29 June 2010. This is an internal UNDP meeting that provides strategic oversight to the Centre, looking at prioritization and sustainability. The Management Committee and the Projects Steering Committee are due to meet again in early 2011. The Pacific Centre continued to receive strong support from Australia and New Zealand in 2010 under agreements signed in 2008 to provide four year funding for the period 2008-2011. For the first time the two donors sat down with the Centre to jointly review the partnership with the meeting focusing on identifying how the Centre can ensure consistency and a focus on results. With both the Australian and New Zealand agreements coming to an end in June 2011, consultations will be held in early 2011 to try and ensure an extension of their support to the Centre until at least December 2013, the new concluding date for the regional programme. Partnerships with Regional Stakeholders Through its support for the Pacific Plan and implementation of its work plan, the Pacific Centre maintains strong partnerships with regional and national stakeholders. The region\u2019s intergovernmental organizations such as the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS) and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) are key Centre partners, as are regional NGOs, private sector organizations and UN agencies. Resources Resource Mobilisation The Pacific Centre\u2019s share of regional programme core resources in 2010 was US$1.6 million. Together with resource commitments from UNCDF for Financial Inclusion (US$500,000) and UNDP\u2019s BCPR (US$195,000) for specific activities in Crisis Prevention and Recovery, they continue to provide a strong foundation for the Centre and a platform for resource mobilization. The Centre continued to enjoy the support of Australia and New Zealand under longer term cost sharing agreements that were signed at the beginning of the current programme cycle and will conclude in mid-2011. Both development partners provide programme resources that are largely untied, allowing the Centre flexibility in annual allocations to implement the agreed work plan. In 2010, AusAID provided Governance, Partnerships and Resources Bringing about Change UNDP PACIFIC CENTRE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 27 almost US$2.4 million for both \u201ccore\u201d support and specific activity funding in selected areas. New Zealand provided US$1.06 million as \u201ccore\u201d support. The specific activity funding provided by AusAID included ongoing funding under the multi-year support for Crisis Prevention and Recovery (US$571,455) and US$203,970 for the promotion of ratification and implementation of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) in the Pacific. US$69,000 was also received from the UNAID\u2019s Acceleration Programme Funds for specific work in HIV and AIDS prevention. Financial Inclusion also received a further US$126,743 from the European Union under an agreement reached in 2008 and AusAID made a total of USD1.3 million available to UNCDF for Financial Inclusion work in the Pacific . The only new partnership in 2010 was secured by the CPR team for work on South-South Cooperation (SSC), with the UNDP South-South Unit ($150,000) and the Japanese Human Security Fund ($163,710) approving funding for this project initiative that allows the Pacific and Caribbean to learn from each other how best to address DRR.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aac24fe5-a7d9-4e05-b16e-20d48c39895b": {"__data__": {"id_": "aac24fe5-a7d9-4e05-b16e-20d48c39895b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Annual Report 2010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "19bd2537c393114cb75314a958dd6bb3cdac69d629d3c166014dda2f374876e5"}, "2": {"node_id": "5580158c-68cf-463e-ab2a-c1e12b93d2fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2010", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5b4b3499e75cb474e3b53797a107d918a2297ef18341b0536eba4a1835920fc"}}, "hash": "313cd35af61ac39b498e4c332b9d29221db2a367286effc90d0bac877e6aa426", "text": "Since its establishment, the Pacific Centre resource mobilization strategy has yielded close to US$21m funding for UNDP implementation with a further US$1.9 million provided to UNCDF for implementation by the Centre under the joint UNDP-UNCDF programme.

Some countries have already exhausted their finite resources and are looking to develop renewables (or harvestables). Others have recently discovered their natural resource wealth and are now looking at options to explore and extract. Yet poor management of natural resources can increase poverty, exacerbate inequalities, induce conflicts, and degrade the environment. Extractive industries provide entry points for addressing sustainable and inclusive growth, poverty reduction, inequalities, conflict prevention and recovery, environmental d accountability, among many development challenges. Therefore, it is topical and timely that the UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre launched the e- discussion to: (a) enhance the understanding of the economic, environmental, and social implications of EI from a human development perspective, and (b) examine ways in which EI can be managed and revenue utilized for sustainable development. The Inclusive Growth and Poverty Reduction unit is responsible for the Asia-Pacific Inclusive Growth and Development Network (AP-IGD Network), a knowledge sharing network that exchanges experiences and good practices on priority issues among a wide audience of development practitioners and other stakeholders (398 members). The virtual moderated discussion on extractive industries, over the course of 7 weeks (6 August-20 September 2012), focused on 3 sub-themes covering issues related to revenue generation; revenue utilization for sustainable development; policy implementation challenges and impact management from extractive industries. The discussion featured 59 posted contributions many (32 percent) of which were received from contributors based in Asia-Pacific. A large number of contributions (20 contributions or 34 percent) were submitted by individual working for agencies of the UN System; of these 10 were shared by UNDP COs (Bhutan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Timor-Leste). Overall, the discussion offered a multiplicity of analytical perspectives on the potential challenges and advantages of EI practices. The synthesis succinctly presents the main highlights which emerged from the discussion. A compilation of contributions for the respective sub-themes is provided in the consolidated reply. 2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Growing demand for non-renewable natural resources, such as oil, gas, and minerals, parallel to their increasingly difficult accessibility, has pushed extractive industries to explore reserves in Asia-Pacific countries. Some countries have already exhausted their finite resources and are looking to develop renewables. In both scenarios poor management of natural resources can increase poverty, exacerbate inequalities, trigger conflicts, and degrade the environment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a5035e6-ccd5-47b0-8091-c0c65a4b96d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a5035e6-ccd5-47b0-8091-c0c65a4b96d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d8d476769e5587187759675137de03471902bdb23275c5f89858c0a6f03caa68"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7eb3faf-b618-42d5-b6a5-e5bec2c7357b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b7019c131f2298e924b20ed5a748b528680a776e86f73ce7a584fb2895a0c077"}}, "hash": "de7ca9a1f10f67416ea27633518539c21c0f2151f9eda9aa96913a8959f653de", "text": "While many countries in the region are rich in resources, they are poor in energy access for their populations, which are also growing at a rapid pace.

Rather, pursuit of greener growth, which could harness mining to play a role to help countries transition to cleaner energy sources, could be a more integrated, sustainable approach to development. To do so, governments would need to strengthen their capacities to develop, manage, regulate, and monitor these industries. Strong and effective institutional and policy frameworks for the extractive sector that include appropriate safeguards and community engagement, could maximize social as well as economic benefits while reduce negative human and environmental impacts. The UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre launched an e-discussion among international development practitioners, government, civil society, and industry counterparts to explore policy solutions regarding extractive industries in light of emerging frameworks on sustainable development. The aim was to: i) enhance the understanding of the economic, environmental, and social implications of extractive industries from a human development perspective, and ii) examine ways in which they can be managed and revenue utilized for sustainable development. The three sub-themes focused on the planning, institutional, and policy measures to generate revenue, possible ways to utilize revenue towards sustainable development initiatives, and comparative examples for managing impacts from extractive industries and overcoming policy implementation challenges. Generating revenue from extractive industries to plan for inclusive growth The requirements for the sound macroeconomic management of extractive industries have come under closer scrutiny as a potential means to generate national wealth. Developing countries in the region face opportunities and risks depending on the policy and institutional frameworks established to manage this newfound, accumulative wealth. Developing countries can take measures to avoid the skills, employment, and technology transfer, which could, in turn, establish steady revenue streams to put into funds for future generations. revenue generated includes strengthening the national, provincial and local capacities to manage and 3 distribute revenue flows, while encouraging reinvestment into long-term capital and social programmes for future generations. A good economic model for resource funds must be further contextualized within the larger economic and political trends within countries. To overcome macroeconomic challenges, such as commodity price volatility, facing hydrocarbon and mineral producers in the Asia-Pacific requires balancing power between negotiating as well as mining-affected stakeholders. This could be accomplished through information sharing about the volume, value, duration, technical and capital requirements for the resources among governments, companies, and affected communities. Furthermore, equalizing the power imbalances also requires that these stakeholders understand the costs of the extractive practices on the environment and biodiversity, and provisions for ensuring inclusive, participatory prior, informed consent, consultations, and dispute resolution processes have been employed. The first sub-theme raised the following key points when considering developing extractive industries to generate national revenue: \uf0b7 Capturing wealth from extractive industry-related revenue through levying and collecting taxes is an immense challenge for resource-rich developing countries, but flexible fiscal tools can help yield benefits. \uf0b7 Flexible fiscal policy, which includes risk management instruments, can offset potential losses from commodity price fluctuations. \uf0b7 Contextualized, prudent investment strategies and regulatory frameworks can help effectively, transparently, and responsibly manage EI-related revenues, while balancing social and environmental concerns. \uf0b7 Legislation may not have traction with safeguarding sustainable practices on the ground frameworks. \uf0b7 Any consideration to explore natural resource wealth must weigh social and environmental impacts from extractive activities, while upholding legal frameworks that address indigenous \uf0b7 Measures to ensure public participation and access to information, environmental sustainability, human capital development, and South-South cooperation should be integrated into inclusive, green growth strategies regarding extractive industries. Using revenue utilization to meet present needs while planning for future sustainable development A large part of development policies have centred on fiscal regimes and ways to stabilize commodity prices yet the public management of generated revenue is interconnected with political processes and power dynamics for control over this wealth. Furthermore, expectations of automatic wealth can lead to over spending in the short-term, which can short change countries when needing to reconcile longer-term environmental, health and social costs. There is a menu of options and policy frameworks for countries to choose how to best prioritize including stabilization funds, to help save and mitigate detrimental impacts of revenue flow volatility, and/or savings funds to save revenue for future generations. Countries can invest revenues in 4 immediate spending initiatives, such as in public services, infrastructure and human capital which would help in pursuing long-term growth. Countries can also distribute cash transfers to citizens or share revenues with sub-national governments (to decentralize fiscal expenditures). By tapping into finite, non-renewable resources, countries must consider options that pivot", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab3785c0-f5d4-40c4-93af-00c433756c84": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab3785c0-f5d4-40c4-93af-00c433756c84", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ff3b22db87c9e25db028eb5fee173fb5d1feeb75e00b3fc20ffdea94b9ba36a"}}, "hash": "8ff3b22db87c9e25db028eb5fee173fb5d1feeb75e00b3fc20ffdea94b9ba36a", "text": "away from dependence on resource-related industries. Rather, building up other forms of capital and sectors, that respect environmental concerns, can generate economic activity and contribute to overall human well-being for future generations to benefit. These efforts might include focusing extraction in order to develop energy needs locally as well as putting revenue towards local community development. Protective measures, such as local content, proactive taxation that favour the host country, and economic diversification policies would require providing incentives to companies. The second sub-theme raised the following key points when considering how to use revenue generated from extractive to meet sustainable development initiatives: \uf0b7 Countries can choose to save, spend, or distribute revenues to align with their national development goals. \uf0b7 When setting up financial and institutional frameworks countries should require good governance of revenues and allocate sufficient compensation for affected peoples. \uf0b7 Transparent and accountable revenue management must give serious attention to economic diversification policies and social/employment programmes that target the most vulnerable and impoverished people, who bear the highest social costs yet receive the fewest benefits. \uf0b7 Social policy plays a role in capturing mineral rents that could be strategically used to recalibrate power imbalances towards societal equalities and environmental sustainability. \uf0b7 Redistribution of revenues at the subnational level cou capacity, but countries should consider the particular challenges at the local levels. \uf0b7 Contracts with extractive industries should have built-in protections and adequate compensation for environmental, social and economic losses attributed to their impacts. \uf0b7 A number of market-based initiatives could help mitigate the inequitable distribution of benefits from resource wealth. Managing impacts from extractive industries and overcoming policy implementation challenges There are key elements for the global governance of natural resources, which must involve integrated, cross-sectoral approaches. The measures to help mitigate negative impacts involve the inclusive participation and representation of affected people, notably the most marginalized, vulnerable and impoverished, in decision-making processes; measures of accountability; and strengthened institutional capacity to ensure empowerment, engagement and adaptability of different stakeholders. These components could help governments, communities, as well as private sector to minimize risks, such as deteriorating peace and stability that can arise. Extractive industries could exacerbate existing inequalities or create new ones if governments and the industry do not adopt inclusive, participatory, consultation, and benefit-sharing processes. Comprehensive impact and risk assessments, disclosure of revenue expenditures at subnational levels, established grievance mechanisms, as well as clearer understandings of cultural contexts and local power dynamics in representation and decision-making could help mitigate the negative consequences from extraction. National policies might require the recognition of local land ownership 5 of natural resources, respecting customary systems of decision-making and administering justice, particularly among indigenous and ethnic minorities, and finding solutions which are better suited to the concepts of nature, land rights, and self-determination within local communities. The final sub-theme raised a number of comparative example and the following key points regarding the management of impacts from extractive industries and overcoming policy implementation challenges: \uf0b7 Natural resources could translate into wealth for developing countries to be utilized towards peace building efforts, but are also major risk factors for conflict. \uf0b7 There are often risks not always considered at the inception of a project and countries can take particular precautions to avoid them. \uf0b7 Legislation that outlines benefit sharing and dispute resolution mechanisms while ensuring the inclusion of local communities in the decision-making and natural resource management processes can help address structural inequalities within the extractive industry sector. \uf0b7 The extractive sector should include community engagement within its corporate social responsibility/accountability policies and participatory consultation processes can prevent the risks and protect fundamental human rights, particularly among indigenous peoples. \uf0b7 Community monitoring of industry compliance to environmental, labour, health, and other laws can be an effective way for communities to access information and share grievances about impacts from extractive activities. \uf0b7 Tools and methods for assessing the impacts should engage communities and examine the gender dimensions of extractive activities. \uf0b7 Innovative policy solutions for transitioning into more sustainable industries that deliver fair and equitable benefits need to be on the immediate agenda to tackle climate change and scarcity of natural resources. The e-discussion has shown the immense complexity of the global extractive industry sector and natural resource management. The industry poses both the opportunities and challenges for developing countries in the region. It is clear that governments and communities require strengthened capacity to understand the sector, its impacts, and to improve strategies for investment, taxation, good governance, environmental protection, community engagement, and informed decision-making at the local levels. 6 SYNTHESIS SUMMARY: SUB-THEME 1 REVENUE GENERATION: PLANNING FOR INCLUSIVE GROWTH Growing demand for non-renewable", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d07fa695-8ae3-40b6-a3ee-0c2c093f73ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "d07fa695-8ae3-40b6-a3ee-0c2c093f73ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09b651fc98b6aa575c60c5ecce5c3ede131ef05c49072dda8f92d8fad0a3b761"}}, "hash": "09b651fc98b6aa575c60c5ecce5c3ede131ef05c49072dda8f92d8fad0a3b761", "text": "natural resources (NR), such as oil, gas, and minerals, parallel to their increasingly difficult accessibility, has pushed extractive industries to explore reserves in Asia- Pacific countries. The requirements for sound macroeconomic management of NR have come under closer scrutiny as a potential means to generate national wealth for countries in the region. Developing countries can take measures through taxes and translating it into other forms of capital, skills, employment, and technology transfer. Capturing wealth from EI-related revenue through levying and collecting taxes is an immense challenge for resource-rich developing countries, but flexible fiscal tools can help yield benefits. -size-fits- Matthew Genasci and Katarina Kuai offer core features. Fiscal tools (e.g. royalty types) should be flexible to changing political and economic realities. These tools can ensure that countries benefit from the value of their resources and provide a baseline of stable revenue flows. The mining sector in the Philippines shows that well- designed fiscal regimes are necessary to improve the capacity of resource-rich countries to collect revenue via taxes. Countries can use standard form agreements and rely -applicable legislation instead of ad hoc contracts to improve tax collection. Mineral exporting countries can also employ a number of mining taxes (e.g. a windfall profits tax implemented by Mongolia, as noted by Yanchun Zhang) to benefit from a commodity price boom and ensure resilience against commodity price volatility (CPV). Flexible fiscal policy, which includes risk management instruments, can offset potential losses from commodity price fluctuations. Yanchun Zhang points to the problems of limited fiscal space, weak taxation policies, and over- dependence on the commodity-producing sectors that make countries more susceptible to CPV. Well- designed and flexible fiscal policy, including using risk management instruments like contracts, futures, and options, can help governments offset potential losses in their commodity export earnings by transferring risk to others. Mexico used put options to offset a drop in oil prices, but Satoru Araki raises concerns about the efficacy or safety of hedging derivative transactions. When considering these transactions, it is important to compare their performance over several years. Yanchun Zhang es had climbed. But, countries can make use of market-based risk management instruments to their benefit, bet in the right direction, and avoid economic disruptions created by CPV. Countries can decide whether passive or active management of transactions will optimize returns for them*. A well-designed fiscal system (with a windfall profits tax as a short- 7 Contextualized, prudent investment strategies and regulatory frameworks can help effectively, transparently, and responsibly manage EI-related revenues, while balancing social and environmental concerns. Timor- Petroleum Fund, as outlined by Rui Gomes, is a type of sovereign wealth fund (SWF) in which investments abroad and state expenditures are subject to checks and balances by the governing bodies with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. The Fund has good features: limits and regulations placed on withdrawals from the state budget account; the Government must specify to Parliament the estimated sustainable income (ESI) and obtain certification by an independent auditor; and the Central Bank and Government must fully disclose the activities of the Fund, which highlights the commitment to transparency of expenditures. However, Carl Bruch raises concerns about the sustainability and oversight of Timor- withdrawals exceeded the ESI and contributed to a ten-fold increase in the national budget, while existing reserves could diminish over the next decade. Rui Gomes offers examples where the Government converted a portion of revenues into other productive assets, such as diversifying into global equities. This prudent measure can build up sufficient liquidity for sustainable spending when revenues decline -- helping to avoid the Dutch disease** and its fall-out effects. Timor- strategy is to balance expenditures in development programmes that value the present as well as future generations, yet it remains to be seen once the natural resources are depleted. In the case of Papua Resources Stabilization Fund, Glenn Banks describes limited capacity in some governments to manage revenue flows. Often governments prioritize funds to pay external debt, exceed fiscal targets, and face problems for guaranteeing transparency and accountability of the revenue management, with adverse environmental and social effects. A revenue oversight at the local and provincial levels. Dorji Choden offers insight on initiatives to nationalize its EI sector, such as in quarrying, in order to prudently extract its limited and non-renewable minerals, help stabilize prices, and meet increasing demand.*** Its Mineral Development Policy looks at ways to put funds into environmental restoration and community development, and the Government mandates Environment Impact Assessments (EIAs) to minimize adverse impacts on forest coverage, agriculture and wildlife.

Ind and mining legislation aim to improve profit-sharing from EI taxes/royalties to the State, and their accountable management. Mining firms would be required to specify local Sustainable Development Plans in each region where they operate. Amandera Das describes the innovative step to redistribute revenue into area development and programmes that meet the needs of the local population. Legislation may not have traction with safeguarding sustainable practices on the ground therefore policies Robert Goodland points to cases in El Salvador and Guatemala, among many, where extractive industries have exerted enormous power and influence in the establishment of mining regulations, indicating the asymmetrical bargaining power among the industry, impacted communities, and developing countries with weak governance structures, political instability or underlying conflicts. To 8 address these risks and ensure compliance with sustainable development frameworks, Kishan Khoday recommends integrating social accountability mechanisms into policy interventions on EI (e.g. those related to regulation and planning; indigenous rights; corporate citizenship; and South- South cooperation) for advancing transparency, accountability, and participatory governance of natural assets. Efforts to reign in the corporate citizenship of multinational and domestic EI companies include: the Ruggie Protect, Respect and Remedy Framework (endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council in 2011), the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment, and the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative, which aim to integrate environmental, social and governance principles into investments. Taimur Khilji also mentions that several legal cases have generally favoured companies at the expense of vulnerable ethnic minorities, workers and biodiversity. To resolve differential bargaining power that results in human rights violations, poorly negotiated contracts, immense corruption, and limited transparency and accountability, a macro-level independent dispute resolution body could protect weaker parties and encourage the fair negotiation of contracts with EI. Revisiting and refining dispute resolution approaches, such as at the WTO or World Bank International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), but that do not favour rich countries and use the overarching objectives of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), could yield more equal exchanges among stakeholders. Any consideration to explore natural resource wealth must weigh social and environmental impacts from EI activities, concerns. Among several Asian examples, Kishan Khoday looks at (2 ) because they attempt to address customary rights of ownership, and use and access to natural resources. However, they have seen serious implementation challenges. To overcome these challenges, other regimes for indigenous empowerment in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile and Peru and the innovative Constitutional provision on the Rights of Nature in Ecuador could offer insight as documented in the Environmental Justice for Inclusive Growth policy brief. Measures to ensure public participation and access to information, environmental sustainability, human capital development, and South-South cooperation should be integrated into inclusive, green growth strategies regarding EI. While countries can examine how their fiscal measures better account for EI revenue and reduce overseas capital flight, it is plausible to integrate myriad measures within sustainable development frameworks: the valuation of the sustainability of ecosystems, as well as policies that increase the . For example, Kishan Khoday indicates that China opted for its Regulation for Public Participation in Environmental Matters to provide a consultative mechanism that includes potentially affected communities in Environmental Impact Assessment processes. EI activities have enormous impacts on water usage, seepage of chemical by-products into groundwater sources that then resurface and are used by nearby residing communities, air pollution, 9 and disruption to other plant and animal life. Although EIAs can calculate and expose many environmental effects, they are not always comprehensive or inclusive of the long-term impacts. Robert Goodland tocks.**** The mining industry as a driver for sustainable development tends to see economic benefits outweighing social and environmental costs and mining revenues reinvested in building sustainable industries and productive capacities. This approach is a substitutable. By not diminishing the overall stock of capital, mining could contribute to sustainable development if it produces long-term benefits that are Social, environmental and all external costs (the net costs) should be subtracted from any benefits accrued from EI activities. South-South cooperation is another angle for coherence with EI to meet sustainable development goals. Kishan Khoday shows that Asia has seen an increase in outward direct investment (ODI) and Official Development Assistance (ODA) into resource-rich but less developed countries. Therefore, countries, with support from UN agencies, notably UNDP, could benefit from analyzing how to integrate inclusive, green growth approaches into ODI flows, as raised by the July 2012 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.

Human capital investment includes prioritizing health, education, training, research and development, as well as building up hospitals, roads, energy, schools, etc. Skill building focused on local community participation and monitoring in the mineral management can help counter illicit mining operations, ensure profit-sharing goes back into community development thereby giving communities a sense of ownership, and offset impacts due to loss of community property/resources and environmental destruction. Bishwa Nath Tiwari promotes a to overcome the challenges of asymmetry of information and bargaining power, and effective, prudent management of revenue earned from extractives. Such a holistic approach that optimizes resilience against CPV, include policy measures that concentrate on discovery and innovation, macroeconomic stability, and prudent fiscal policy. This theme looked at ways to generate revenue from NR to translate into inclusive, green growth and regulatory environments for good governance of the revenue generated. This includes strengthening the national, provincial and local capacity to manage and distribute revenue flows, while encouraging reinvestment into long-term capital and social programmes for future generations. To overcome the macroeconomic challenges facing hydrocarbon and mineral producers in Asia-Pacific developing countries require balancing power among negotiating and mining-affected stakeholders through information sharing, understanding the costs on the environment and its biodiversity, and ensuring inclusive, participatory prior, informed consent, consultation, and dispute resolution processes. What might be a good economic model for resource funds must be further contextualized within the larger economic and political trends within countries. Furthermore, countries opting to exploit natural mineral wealth need to carefully consider how to extract the finite resources as a short-term plan while transitioning into efforts that develop renewable energy sources. 10 SUMMARY: SUB-THEME 2: REVENUE UTILIZATION: PRIORITIZING THE PRESENT OR THE FUTURE? A large part of development policies have centred on fiscal regimes and ways to stabilize commodity prices yet the public management of generated revenue is interconnected with political processes and power dynamics for control over this wealth. Furthermore, expectations of automatic wealth can lead to over spending in the short-term, which can short change countries when needing to reconcile longer-term environmental, health and social costs. There is a menu of options and policy frameworks for countries to choose how to best prioritize Saurabh Sinha looks at three options. To save: countries can establish SWFs, including stabilization funds, to mitigate detrimental impacts of revenue flow volatility, and/or savings funds to save revenue for future generations. To spend: countries can invest revenues in immediate initiatives, such as in public services, infrastructure and human capital which would help in pursuing long-term growth. To distribute: countries can distribute cash transfers to citizens or share revenues with sub-national governments (to decentralize fiscal expenditures). Botswana, Chile, Indonesia, Malaysia and Peru avoided the impacts from revenue mismanagement by adopting one or more of these options. Botswana is notable for reinvesting its diamond revenues in infrastructure and human capital according to its national development plans. Timor-Leste chose to transfer oil revenue to the state budget for immediate use. Rui Gomes warns that huge expenditures in a national electricity programme could be unsustainable due to high costs to maintain the infrastructure. Other investments, such as conditional cash transfers, could be short- term options because they have multiplying effects on the domestic economy when recipients spend on imported goods and services. Rather, measures to diversify the economy and generate sustainable employment could help protect the domestic economy from influx of resource revenues. Kishan Khoday looks at efforts to use its oil revenue to fund 80 percent of all public revenues, which has translated into significant human development gains as well as helped fund Official Development Assistance (ODA) to over 87 countries. Declining oil reserves (due to increasing worldwide demand) has shifted attention to strategies for translating oil wealth into more sustainable development for future generations. The government is planning to reinvest oil revenues for a low- carbon future -- in energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions. In addition, the government is working on forecasting oil reserves to help with economic diversification initatiatives to help address youth unemployment and socially excluded people. Chile also has generated significant revenues from its copper industry by building structural balance in the central government. Katja Hujo explains that, with its Fiscal Responsibility Law, Chile isolated its national budget from cyclical variations of three variables that impact government revenues: the potential gross domestic product (GDP); the copper benchmark price; and the Molybdnum (or by- product of copper extraction) price. The structural balance pursues a surplus target of 1 percent of GDP to maintain future fiscal responsibilities, including pensions. Specific taxes on mining have helped increased contributions to initiatives that help with economic diversification", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b684c5cc-d9d0-4d01-b10d-ca27fe3dbae0": {"__data__": {"id_": "b684c5cc-d9d0-4d01-b10d-ca27fe3dbae0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "385f466030297c2d233d72661942d8794b6da36738ec1fe3ea2a59dc7578239b"}, "3": {"node_id": "624389a7-a41e-432f-b271-cc3bb0c89dd0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "455b8a4a7f45a76820ea6faae2cf880e8dda4f7773d0cd63935e937c72eb9b9c"}}, "hash": "bf5508ecae8da8fec0b2f7279d6d0b4849a9fa9de93de47a0a0c16087713083b", "text": "and expanding social pensions. While the revenue flows can be maintained when copper prices are booming, there could be many challenges for Chile to continue its achievements, such as balancing the increased 11 domestic spending on prices and exchange rates to avoid inflation and currency overvaluation and guaranteeing fair and transparent budget processes for using revenues. Andrew Bauer-Gador practice good performance, absorptive capacity to manage revenues, and social rate of return in domestic investment (e.g. infrastructure, human capital).

Kishan Khoday suggests the IMF Topical Trust Fund on Managing Natural Resource Wealth, as a mechanism to scale up technical assistance to LDCs and lower-middle-income countries for effectively using resource revenues. The Fund supports the EI fiscal regime, EI revenue administration, fiscal policies and public financial management in resource-rich countries, NR-related financial asset and liability management, and statistics for NR. Katarina Kuai and Erica Westenberg Transparency Initiative (EITI), which is growing into an international industry standard to help with issues on national oversight of EI revenue. Among the current 36 EITI-compliant countries there has been closer public scrutiny over discrepancies between revenue shared between EI and governments. Yet there are challenges for citizens to become better informed about how the revenue is used, particularly between the central and sub-national governments. Jean Chapman observes the centralized management of EI exploration licenses as way of earning revenue. It is not yet compliant with EITI, therefore, it is not clear how revenue from EI will be used to diversify the economy or invest in programmes according to the National Strategic Development Plan. Rather, civil society groups such as Cambodians for Resource Revenue Transparency (CRRT) have played the role of monitoring transparency and accountability in the EI sector. The NGO holds public hearings and advocates for inclusive participation in the EI management and expenditure. Liberia has taken notable steps against corruption in the EI sector, by granting public access to data on revenue management; discrepancies are publicly discussed among diverse stakeholders and the failure to report revenues is subject to criminal proceedings. There are a few innovations in the EITI reporting among other countries are: tracking these flows (e.g. Mongolia); monitoring funding activities through CSR or company donations (e.g. Liberia, Mongolia, Peru); and documenting state investments as an equity partner in EI operations (e.g. Democratic Republic of Congo (DCR), Nigeria, Tanzania). Mongolia has reviewed ways to use EITI to monitor its Development Bank and Human Development Fund, financed by EI revenues. Rui Gomes describes Timor- revenue. In its EITI reports a special fiscal instrument documents the amounts channeled to 12 infrastructure projects, education or inter-generational savings, which permits the public to compare what the fund received vis-\u00e0-vis its rules on expenditures towards these projects. UNDP has provided technical assistance in establishing transparency and accountability mechanisms relating to the EI sector, particularly strengthening parliamentary, judiciary and civil services institutions. However, enhanced transparency of the Petroleum Fund has not automatically resulted in economic governance. UNDP can contribute in areas such as local governance, right to information, strengthening capacities in auditing and oversight agencies, as well as support to the Anti-Corruption Commission (CAC). Strengthening the governance and legal framework around the EI sector would require multi-stakeholder partnerships and contextualized initiatives. Transparent and accountable revenue management must give serious attention to economic diversification policies and social/employment programmes that target the most vulnerable and impoverished people, who bear the highest social costs yet receive the fewest benefits. Among many initiatives, Dr. Eugene H. Shannon suggests reinvesting revenue into women and youth empowerment programmes, small to medium scale enterprises (SMEs) development, as well as improvement in social services could help post-conflict countries maintain peace and security. It is important that EI revenue catalyze other sectors, including agriculture, forestry, fisheries, tourism, and sustainable, renewable energy sources (aimed at zero or low carbon emission as defined in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)) which can create employment and generate additional revenue.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "624389a7-a41e-432f-b271-cc3bb0c89dd0": {"__data__": {"id_": "624389a7-a41e-432f-b271-cc3bb0c89dd0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "385f466030297c2d233d72661942d8794b6da36738ec1fe3ea2a59dc7578239b"}, "2": {"node_id": "b684c5cc-d9d0-4d01-b10d-ca27fe3dbae0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf5508ecae8da8fec0b2f7279d6d0b4849a9fa9de93de47a0a0c16087713083b"}}, "hash": "455b8a4a7f45a76820ea6faae2cf880e8dda4f7773d0cd63935e937c72eb9b9c", "text": "The development of a skilled workforce and continuity between resource-rich communities and EI can help countries overcome some institutional challenges for diversifying their economies (as raised by Jean Chapman).

In LDCs there may be limited skilled, higher-educated workers and expertise in geology/minerals. To overcome these limitations, the Royal Government in Cambodia has plans to fund short-term training in the country, scholarships for higher education abroad, and reopen the school for geology/minerals. Social policy plays a role in capturing mineral rents that could be strategically used to recalibrate power imbalances towards societal equalities and environmental sustainability. Katja Hujo details that some social policies have shown positive impacts on growth, employment, social cohesion and political legitimacy because they are not as financially constrained. When governments have the capacity to capture the mineral rents, social programmes can be more sustainably funded. Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela have successfully redistributed their mineral rents into social policies, such as child benefits, social pensions or social assistance. Mongolia has adopted sound fiscal policies to help manage revenues sustainably and translate into sustainable human development, including: - creating a Development Bank to finance large infrastructure projects (e.g. railways, energy sector); - -national levels, as part of a fiscal decentralization plan; 13 - redistributing revenue through citizen cash transfers (first a targeted programme for children in poor households but discontinued due to downturn of copper prices in 2007-08, then a universal, monthly cash handout to all citizens until election period in 2012). Direct cash transfers have been seen as effective in reducing poverty in some cases. Nienke Raap introduces Permanent Fund Dividend, which receives 25 percent of its revenue from the case has prompted the exploration of contextualized, universal cash transfers in other resource-rich countries (under the oil-to-cash initiative). It is argued that taxing the generated income will create a strong public demand for the government to be more transparent and accountable, creating overall benefits in the long-term. However, for resource-rich developing countries, donors are supporting citizen cash transfer initiatives that are poverty-targeted. Indonesia distributes part of its resource rents through targeted cash transfers to vulnerable and poor households, including the Bantuan Langsung Tunai (BLT) and Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH) programmes. The Indonesian Government aimed to create a more equitable distribution of resources. The BLT programme involves unconditional cash transfers to impoverished citizens (covering about 19 million households) to help them cope with the adverse effects of fuel price hikes due to reduced fuel subsidies. The PKH programme has conditions to encourage provide a safety net for some of the poorest citizens, often there are difficulties mapping the poverty trends in countries without comparable surveys and efforts to prevent leakages could improve. Australia has established a complex taxation and royalty system, involving both federal and state governments. During boom times, the Australian government has chosen to directly reinvest revenue in several large, forward- - Kieren Moffat highlights its reinvestment into programmes to benefit marginalized peoples, including aged pensioners and rural/remote communities. The Royalties for Regions scheme shares state-based mining with regional communities whereby local governments build infrastructure (e.g. roads, parks) and services (e.g. health programmes, subsidized fuel cards for the elderly). Large-scale regional infrastructure projects (e.g. increasing irrigation areas to support agriculture growth) and building new cities also have been developed to support local industry workforces. -managed resource wealth. Like many developing countries, it tackles challenges of transparency. Challenges for capturing and utilizing the resource revenue for social programmes in global South countries could relate to their stage of development and stability of revenue flows. Saurabh Sinha notes two possible factors: (i) highly uncertain estimates of the volume and values of proven and potential resource reserves (linking to future prices; cost of and rates of return on exploration); and (ii) balancing of fiscal priorities (e.g. how to smooth public expenditure from commodity price fluctuations; how to ensure inter-generational equity; whether and how much to allocate for investing in improving public services). 14 but countries should consider the particular challenges at the local levels. Peru redistributes to the sub-national level the 50 percent royalties it receives from mining companies which pay to exploit silver, gold, zinc, and tin.

Moreover, Francesca Viliani raises concerns that there are often no mechanisms to track the distribution of revenue from central governments to the local level. Clear legislative frameworks, strengthened monitoring capacities, broad participation by communities, and transparency of revenue management could ensure revenue is used to benefit communities and compensate people affected by the mining activities. Contracts with EI should have built-in protections and adequate compensation for environmental, social and economic losses attributed to their impacts. Amarendra Das asserts that aside from physical infrastructure and social services, revenues should be channeled into community initiatives to mitigate losses caused by deforestation, death of a number of flora and fauna or loss of biodiversity, and thus disproportionately negatively affect indigenous communities, who are often forcibly relocated and dependent on their surroundings for sustaining their traditional livelihoods. The Indian government has made efforts in this way by proposing to create a Mineral Development Fund in every district, by collecting additional revenue from the mining firms. Yet so far it is not clearly defined how revenue collected through royalties can be transferred to local communities affected by the mining projects. Sharmistha Bose and Lucy Dubochet Minerals (Development and Regulation) Bill of 2 cent share of net profit for coal and lignite industries, and an amount equivalent to the annual royalty for all other major The mining industry has opposed the Indian bill, claiming that it threatened foreign direct similar norms for compensating local communities already exist in Australia, Canada, Papua New Guinea, and South Africa. A number of market-based initiatives could help mitigate the inequitable distribution of benefits from resource wealth. The Mining, Minerals, and Sustainable Development (MMSD) initiative led to developments to link CSR in the mining industry with and sustainable development. Due to consumer pressure and new regulations (such as Dodd-Frank in the U.S.) over sources of minerals and metals, there are some EI 15 voluntarily taking steps to reduce risks of harmful working environments along the supply chain. Jennifer Horning points out initiatives (e.g. by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Gold Council, the London Bullion Market Association, and the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI)) to help buyers better understand the risks. The Fairtrade and Fairmined standard (FTFM) has become an opportunity for people in the informal economy, such as artisanal and small-scale miners, in developing countries to formalize their operations and adopt social and environmental safeguards. The fairtrade premium received by the mining association must be reinvested in community development, such as water access or schooling. This market-based approach empowers the miners themselves to reinvest EI revenues into their own communities as they best see fit. This practice is generally applied to precious metals and gems, but worth exploring for other sectors. A number of private companies have partnered with government authorities to help provide social services, such as healthcare facilities. Bryn Gay questions the sustainability of mining provisions of social services, particularly when non-renewable resources are depleted. Katja Hujo also mentions cases, such as in Zambia, when public mining companies closed or privatized the governments could not expand or afford to maintain the services. Francesca Viliani points out that - term planning for the social services they provide. For the sustainability of interventions to occur, EI must identify, avoid and minimize all negative impacts. A comprehensive impact assessment of the mining operations that include the environmental, social, and health consequences would ensure negative impacts are appropriately managed and compensated and positive impacts optimized. By tapping into finite, non-renewable resources, countries must consider options that pivot away from dependence on resource-related industries. Rather, building up other forms of capital and sectors, that are respectful of environmental concerns, can generate economic activity and contribute to overall human well-being for future generations to benefit. SUMMARY: SUB-THEME 3: IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES AND IMPACT MANAGEMENT There are key elements for the global governance of natural resources, which must go beyond the establishment of legislation and monitoring efforts in compartmentalized sectors. The human and environmental dimensions are too great and linking development goals with natural resource management must involve integrated, cross-sectoral approaches. The measures to ensure good natural resource management to mitigate negative impacts that surfaced in the discussion involve: the inclusive participation and representation of affected people, notably the most marginalized, vulnerable and impoverished, in decision-making processes; measures of accountability; and strengthened institutional capacity to ensure empowerment, engagement and adaptability of different stakeholders. These components could help governments, communities, as well as private sector to minimize", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61890466-8f45-46f2-9f2f-eedff61416a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "61890466-8f45-46f2-9f2f-eedff61416a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe1caffa1c299366985e39782d2b66f6c65acc08a35437b5241113a838fb07ec"}}, "hash": "fe1caffa1c299366985e39782d2b66f6c65acc08a35437b5241113a838fb07ec", "text": "risks, such as deteriorating peace and stability that can arise. Natural resources could translate into wealth for developing countries to be utilized towards peace building efforts, but are also major risk factors for conflict. High-valued NR could contribute to countries relapse into conflict, depending on decisions on security, provisions to meet basic needs, rebuilding livelihoods, and implementation of sound economic policies. Tensions rise over the commodification and privatization of these resources and 16 how this affects local livelihoods and food security, often escalating to conflicts over land rights, forests, minerals, and water. Cambodia has seen numerous conflicts with local communities over their forestry and fisheries despite its extensive legal framework for supporting community-based NRM. Some reforms to address tensions have targeted efforts to decentralize and balance authority among the government, private sector, and civil society regarding NRM decision-making. Post-conflict countries can minimize risks of destabilizing their peace and prosperity by putting in place measures to encourage transparency and CSR of extractive industries in their operating licenses and concessions, review of pre-war contracts, legitimization and strengthening of transitional governments, and effective governance of revenues generated and shared. P\u00e4ivi Lujala and Carl Bruch examine NR-related contracts in post-conflict countries, noting the risks of huge revenues that can exacerbate corruption and encourage the hasty approval of concessions. This rush to grant exploration or exploitation rights at cheaper rents -- can cause overexploitation and irreversible environmental damages. Moreover, transition governments in post-conflict contexts may not have established accountable mechanisms until elections take place, and NR revenues could be used to finance political parties or build political power for the elections. In its post-conflict period, Liberia imposed a temporary moratorium on new contracts and concessions until appropriate institutions, legislation, and oversight were in place. National regulatory bodies, with third-party support, conducted the review of previous contracts with EI by both Liberia and DRC. Countries may need to review and strengthen their NRM legal framework to monitor and enforce contractual requirements, which could benefit from appropriate financial assistance and training of local law enforcement officials or judicial authorities. Bryn Gay looks at the recent issuing of Private Use Permits in Liberia and asks whether these kinds of - is key for governments and investors in post- and integrate human rights approaches into contracts when considering EI operations. Catherine Coumans asserts that to avoid further social conflicts, local governments or communities should have decisions to place mining moratoria (such as in the Philippines case when Executive Order 79 removed local powers in this regard). There are often risks not always considered at the inception of a project and countries can take particular precautions to avoid them. In the experienced Canadian mining sector, Dave Sawyer and Catherine Coumans raise a couple prominent risks. The costs of closing a mine have been under-estimated in risk assessments; one recommendation for governments in the Asia-Pacific is to demand realizable bonds that are set at the full estimated costs for restoration to the environment. Lengthy tax holidays, concessions (e.g. breaks on import and export duties), and transfer pricing provisions (i.e. resulting in outward flowing revenues to tax havens) can reduce revenue for the host government which may be necessary for social programmes, maintaining infrastructure, and repairing environmental damages after the finite resource is depleted. sector contributes to increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, forecasted to rise 50 percent by 2020 over the 2005 levels, posing significant challenges for 17 reducing emissions at the current rate of production. This has massive implications for countering climate change; countries can balance economic and environmental outcomes with innovative and flexible climate policies. However, Amarendra Das states that the weak enforcement of mining laws in India is a massive challenge for mitigating environmental impacts. Understaffing, lack of resources (e.g. vehicles), inconsistent inspections of mine sites, and the influence of powerful people have attributed to the lenient approaches and non-compliance with environmental laws. Hence, providing additional training and staff, more stringent regulation by authorities, and more severe penalties could avoid the risks of further environmental degradation by EI. Legislation that outlines benefit sharing and dispute resolution mechanisms while ensuring the inclusion of local communities in the decision-making and NRM processes can help address structural inequalities within the EI sector. Benefit sharing needs to go beyond financial remuneration. Leisa Perch shows that among several Asia-Pacific countries, China, India, Indonesia, and Mongolia have made legal reforms to improve transparency, share resource revenues, and tackle pollution, which bring benefits to wider segments of the population. In Chad and Zimbabwe a portion of resource revenues have been assigned for poverty reduction and community development initiatives.

When local communities participate in the management of natural resources, such as local sustainable forest management in Cameroon, they can ensure that benefits like local infrastructure and schools accumulate to them. Varsha Venugopal expands on sharing of revenues between central and local governments through a transparent national and subnational regulatory framework, which helps minimize mismanagement or wasteful spending. When citizens and civil society organizations have access to expenditure data they know whether revenues from companies and the national governments deliver to meet local needs and can make claims for the benefits to which they are entitled. Given that the exposure of revenue expenditures may create grievances and conflicts among stakeholders, a system for resolving disputes must be established with the EI sector. Daniel Franks mentions a number of company initiatives, including a grievance handling process and community strategic planning processes (in collaboration with the local government) to mitigate disputes. The EI sector should include community engagement within its CSR policies and participatory consultation processes can prevent the risks and protect fundamental human rights, particularly among indigenous peoples. Among good standards for the mining industry are EITI, International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards, and the Natural Resources Charter. Abbi Buxton points out that implementing these standards has difficulties and limitations, especially concerning the community dimensions. Engaging with communities should include information sharing about the impacts and benefits among multiple stakeholders, but too often groups are excluded at the local levels. 18 Leah S. Horowitz provides evidence from New Caledonia, in which CSR policies (which may contain safeguards) are dependent on and may exacerbate power inequalities within a community in order to obtain consent for a project. An indigenous Kanak group, Rh\u00e9\u00e9b\u00f9 N\u00f9\u00f9, entered into an Impact and Benefit Agreement (IBA) with a nickel mining company, but the power and negotiating asymmetries were quite apparent. Divisions arose within the community whether or not to accept the project. The company recognized and entered into the agreement with the group more favourable to the project. Meanwhile, community members (mostly women and youth) less favourable to mining activities -- due to their pollution on the mangroves and marine life -- were excluded from the negotiations. Their exclusion, while a social norm within customary laws, raises issues of perpetuating structural violence against more marginalized members. These members were not present to negotiate benefits or compensation therefore they may not realize any gains, such as employment, measures to protect cultural heritage, compensation for damages to water sources and their livelihoods from the mining activities. Representation of all community sectors and balanced power dynamics among communities, government, and companies may yield greater and more sustainable benefits. The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) noted several successful participatory consultation processes, such as between the Bolivian Ministry of Hydrocarbons and Energy and the Guarani Peoples Assembly, which documented community consent prior to the initiation of exploitation activities. J.E. notes that when communities themselves (including women, youth, and elders) are involved in determining the process for consultation they can ensure there are adequate spaces for addressing grievances, which can help raise awareness among non-indigenous actors about indigenous needs, cultural contexts, and unique histories with colonialism. For fairer or more equitable consultations to take place, an indigenous extractive projects in their territory at any time during the consultation and decision-making processes, and have their standpoint upheld. Fiorella Arenas, Catherine Coumans, J.E., Robert Goodland, Arturo Requesens, and Juan Pablo Soler Villamizar elaborate on free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) as an obligation under the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, mandatory for International Financial Cooperation (IFC) projects, and also could be seen as a safeguard with other potential mining-affected mine, it could build FPIC into its CSR policies. This would involve comprehensive documentation and d meaningful participation in environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) processes, including when the project is first proposed, how the community consents and accepts it, as well as during exploration, operation, closure and restoration. There are very specific considerations for respecting the rights of indigenous peoples when negotiating for EI projects. Consultation processes -- established through national and localized mechanisms -- with indigenous peoples must respect their practices, customs, methods, and decision- making procedures, and exchange information in indigenous languages. For engaging with non- indigenous actors and determining FPIC, indigenous peoples may require increased strengthening of capacity for understanding their rights under international/national legislation, how proposed projects will affect their self-determination, the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1aa6ae18-59ef-46ba-8fac-f8185e05280a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1aa6ae18-59ef-46ba-8fac-f8185e05280a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a725740489d0bb1452767be7df8a350eb43263d5a97c9d9c405bd558b776af79"}, "3": {"node_id": "b150a80b-734d-4f9b-9571-0108f0761121", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "06964a8971d6a9888839e87dce9cbcc87188170f9ad525b1db69f823c9b7b06f"}}, "hash": "6687a0244793ec23611febef6af347175f34154c283b22471cde06f34a2dc632", "text": "guarantees, benefits and compensations proposed to address impacts, and comprehensive evaluation of the social and environmental impacts on the surrounding biodiversity, water sources, and their livelihoods. Once indigenous communities understand these aspects it is more likely that they will effectively participate in EI-related negotiation processes; their inclusion can help minimize conflicts. While FPIC, participatory consultations and 19 other mechanisms can better benefit groups it is possible that these mechanisms become only a formality for the industry and governments to expedite their extractive activities. The Lubicon Lake Cree (Neheyiwak) Nation in Canada maintains this claim that their input did not substantively affect government and industry plans. Community monitoring of compliance can be an effective way for communities to access information and share grievances about impacts from EI activities. In Pakistan, Gul Najam Jamy inclusion of environmental groups, scientists, government counterparts, the media, other public interest groups, and citizens in ongoing dialogues regarding studies about the potential impacts of oil exploration highlighted good representation across sectors and uniting for a common cause, which eventually led to pressuring the EI to abandon the project in the eco-sensitive park. An initiative by the Affiliated Network for Social Accountability in East Asia and the Pacific (ANSA EAP) has enabled community rights during the various stages of the mining operations. Emy Perez compiled examples from the voluntary use of community scorecards among stakeholders to evaluate performance of the companies according to community-defined indicators in the sectors that they most value. In the Philippines, communities learned the mining company in the area complied with royalty payments to the indigenous peoples, invested funds in a social development programme, and published information publicly; the findings provided a space for communities to recommend relevant laws and policies regarding the benefits due to them, participatory budget planning, and impacts of the projects. However, these efforts raise further questions of whether it is just a way for communities, and whether there is adequate compensation. Tools and methods for assessing the impacts should engage communities and examine the gender dimensions of EI activities. Robert Goodland feasibility of the projects, often the costs and impacts are under-reported. Therefore, independent third-party monitoring organizations, which are neutral, objective, and lack bias, could be effective for conducting IAs as well as for ensuring the inclusive participation of communities. Arturo Requesens and Fiorella Arenas further highlight a UNPFII report (Para 85) for recommending social, cultural and human right impact assessments with indigenous peoples during the different stages of extractive projects. To account for the environmental impacts, the report (Para 89, 94) recommends that countries enforce higher standards of environmental protection and establish stricter penalties for extractive companies that violate environmental laws. Emma Wilson introduces the Sakhalin-2 project in the Russian Far East regarding its use of IAs and The Sakhalin-2 project online library stakeholder engagement and analysis of potential impacts and stakeholder concerns: a social impact evelopment plan, and a company-community grievance mechanism. The company had conducted an ethno-cultural impact 20 Akwe: Kon guidelines). Yumiko Yamamoto highlights a Toolkit for Human Development Impact Assessment of Trade Policy. Using a human rights based approach the toolkit could be applicable in analyzing the impacts of EI-related policies, notably the gender dimensions of mining which include disproportionate job creation for men in the higher-paid, formal labour market, with women left to work in lower-paid, informal services such as care givers, food stalls, lodges, and sex work. Glenn Banks due to its impacts on the already established communities, environmental resources (e.g. water, land) and the increases of sex work activity, alcoholism, violence and risks of sexually transmitted diseases like HIV. In Papua New Guinea, an Inward Migration Plan, based on the IFC Handbook for Addressing Project-induced Migration, helped develop comprehensive strategies to reduce and mitigate the effects of migrant flows on local indigenous communities. Brian Kohler emphasizes the participation of local communities, civil society, and workers, including trade unions, and setting industry norms according to ILO Conventions and the ILO Decent Work Agenda when understanding the social impacts. It is important to look at the sustainability dimensions using indicators, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines, and validating the findings via multi-stakeholder consultations in facilitated, consensus-based decision-making processes.

Innovative policy solutions for transitioning into more sustainable industries that deliver fair and equitable benefits need to be on the immediate agenda to tackle climate change and scarcity of natural resources. Saleem H. Ali raises ecological economics as a way to value natural systems provided by ecosystems. The economy is seen as a subset of the ecosystem and projects; Project and the Gund Institute for Ecological Economics at the University of Vermont are developing systems to measure the linkages between the economy and ecology. This emerging discipline could be one way to encourage countries to integrate environmental conservation into EI operations. For example, Ecuador questioned the environmental costs of extracting its oil reserves in the Yasuni National Park, estimating the value of its forest conservation to be much greater. Ecuador has proposed to international donors to raise half the value of oil extraction (about US$ 3 billion) by 2024 (or the life of the proposed EI project). Blake Ratner of just role in sustainable development might look at how all these features could benefit developing 21 -pool re off resource rights for commercial mega-resource projects. In order to understand whether EI can contribute to sustainable development, Robert Goodland posits that benefits must outweigh social and environmental costs. Policy-makers and the industry must make clear efforts for investing in more sustainable industries and other productive capacities. Perhaps moving towards sustainable development requires reimagining the way we live to become more harmonious with our environment, which is already well practiced among a number of indigenous communities. In this way, J.E. highlights a number of concepts that could gain stronger influence in policy circles, including Universal Rights of Mother Earth buen vivir Gross National Happiness (BNH), or the Iroquois\u00b4 Seven Generations. In sum, EI could exacerbate existing inequalities or create new ones if governments and EI do not adopt inclusive, participatory, consensus-building, and benefit-sharing processes. Comprehensive impact and risk assessments, disclosure of revenue expenditures at subnational levels, established grievance mechanisms, as well as clearer understandings of cultural contexts and local power dynamics in representation and decision-making could help mitigate the negative consequences from extraction. Note: (*) Passive investing seeks to mimic the returns of a market, whereas active investing aims to pick winners and losers and buy more or less of certain companies. (**) A phenomenon in which the state uncovers large NR reserves and shifts its economic focus towards EI due its high valued resources. This, in turn, pushes skilled workers from other sectors to transfer to the resource sector. Exchange rate appreciation makes the national currency less competitive, and other industries cannot compete, resulting in decline.

(****) Environmental Sustainability is defined as not decreasing natural capital, keeping this capital 22 Launch Message Rathin Roy, UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre, Bangkok Non-renewable natural resource-based industries present complex issues for development. The extraction of non-renewable natural resources represents an enormous opportunity for countries in Asia and the Pacific to support economic growth and expand the fiscal space required to finance social programmes that advance human development. Yet poor management of extractive industries can undermine the sustainability of growth, and can lead to increased poverty, devastating conflicts and environmental degradation. Making growth more inclusive and ensuring sustainable development in the Asia-Pacific region calls for policies that allocate revenues from EI to address inequalities, mitigate grievances associated with land rights and displacement, reduce the risk of conflicts, and improve ecosystem conservation efforts. The growing demand for energy and mineral resources has led a number of countries in Asia and the Pacific to open up their natural resource wealth to extraction and to develop extractive industries. Countries in the region are, therefore, increasingly looking at UNDP for policy advice and programme support to address the issues associated with the management of such industries, and to turn mineral resource extraction into a means to help advance human development. Against this backdrop, we are launching this e-discussion today to: i) enhance the understanding of the economic, environmental, and social implications of EI from a human development perspective, and ii) examine ways in which EI can be managed and revenue utilized for sustainable development.

Contributions on Revenue Generation: Planning for Inclusive Growth Timor- Rui Gomes, UNDP Timor-Leste The successful experience of Timor-Leste a small, young and poor country may offer some valuable lessons as to whether to spend the income today or to save for future generations. Timor-Leste is today the second most petroleum-export-revenue-dependent nation in the world, spending its non-renewable oil and gas wealth to pay for around 95 percent of annual state expenditures. Timor- -2005, is based on the basic principle that all petroleum revenues go into the Fund. At least 90 percent of the Fund is invested in U.S. dollar-denominated government bonds, and up to 10 percent is invested in bonds in other currencies or in equities. Withdrawals from the Fund can only be used to finance expenditure of the state budget and are guided by consideration of long-term sustainability. The Petroleum Fund was established to ensure three principal aims. First, all petroleum revenues to be properly accounted for; second, the government budget to remain the primary vehicle for public policy, and third, the petroleum wealth is preserved for future generations. The Fund functions as a repository for the - which debits can be made to finance the state budget. Key features underlying the Petroleum Fund are as follow: Management - The Fund is managed prudently in accordance with the principle of good governance for the benefit of current and future generations. The Government is responsible for the overall management and the Central Bank is responsible for the operational management. Income - All Timor- retains all investment income (net of management expenses). Investment - All assets are invested abroad in established financial markets, with at least 90 percent in U.S. Dollar denominated fixed income instruments. Currently, according to the management agreement between the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, the Fund is restricted to holding U.S. government securities in order to track the benchmark Merrill Lynch 0-5 year bond index. Withdrawals - Transfers from the Fund can only be made to the single state budget account. The amount transferred in any fiscal year can only take place after the publication of the budget law and cannot exceed the appropriation specified therein. Transfers are also contingent on the Government providing Parliament with a report specifying the estimated sustainable income (ESI) and a certification of that amount by an independent auditor (see Box 1 below). Savings policy - Fund are guided by the concept of sustainable income. For each year, ESI is calculated as 3 percent of the sum of the Fund balance and the present value of expected future petroleum receipts. Withdrawing more than ESI requires the Government to provide Parliament with a detailed 24 explanation of why it is in the long-term interests of the country, and also a report estimating the impact on future ESI that is certified by the independent auditor. Reporting - The Central Bank publishes quarterly reports on the performance and activities of the Fund. The Government submits an annual report to Parliament with an audited financial statement. Details on revenue receipts and composition of the investment portfolio are fully disclosed. Oversight - An Investment Advisory Board advises the Minister of Finance on the overall investment strategy and management of the Fund. An independent Consultative Council advises Parliament on the performance and operation of the Fund and also on budget appropriations", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb689884-758f-4f9d-9c64-23879353460f": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb689884-758f-4f9d-9c64-23879353460f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c75bb81026f45c7638f447d0b7684191471c4d6b90d357314feb676c6b041376"}}, "hash": "c75bb81026f45c7638f447d0b7684191471c4d6b90d357314feb676c6b041376", "text": "and whether these are being used effectively to the benefit of current and future generations.

Calculation of Estimated Sustainable Income The estimated sustainable income (ESI) for a given fiscal year is defined as the maximum amount that can be appropriated and transferred from the Petroleum Fund to the budget while retaining sufficient resources to appropriate an equal amount in all subsequent years. ESI for a given fiscal year is calculated according to the following formula: where r = 3 percent is the specified real rate of return, V is the balance of the Fund at the start of the fiscal year, Rt is the budget projection for petroleum revenue in year t, n is the last year of projected receipts, and i is the discount factor specified as the nominal yield on U.S. government securities averaged over years 0 to n. The Petroleum Fund Law states that all assumptions upon which this calculation is based shall be 25 prudent, reflect international best practice, and be based on internationally recognized standards. Moreover, the resulting calculation shall be certified by an independent auditor. Source: Timor- What are the lessons from a prudent management of the Petroleum Fund? 1. Continued political will to guarantee inter-generational equity so that the government does not spend all of the money as it came into the Fund or when oil prices are high. 2. The Petroleum Fund Law clearly establishes several measures for transparency and requires quarterly performance reports, annual reports, and audits to be made public. 3. The PF Law defines the roles and responsibilities of public institutions like parliament, government, the central bank, and civil society organizations. The success lies essentially on continued prudence in the management of the revenues from extraction of hydrocarbons, effective utilization of the revenues to diversify the domestic economy, design and implementation of meaningful programmes and projects for poverty alleviation and improvement of human welfare in the country. Question on checks and balances of Petroleum Fund withdrawals Carl Bruch, Environmental Law Institute, Washington D.C. The experience of Timor-Leste's Petroleum Fund is very interesting. I wonder whether you or other members might be able to comment further on Lesson 1: - generational equity so that the government does not spend all of the money as it came into the Fund Last September, I was conducting research in Timor-Leste, and there was considerable concern among people I interviewed that the withdrawals were exceeding the estimated sustainable income (ESI), with the government budget growing more than ten-fold in a decade. This concern was compounded by the fact that existing proven reserves are expected to be exhausted in a little more than a decade (although additional reserves may extend the income). Do the checks and balances mentioned work? Checks and balances are not a guarantee Rui Gomes, UNDP Timor-Leste The Timor- reach more than US$10 billion , owing to high international oil prices and concerted efforts to maximize revenues from this extractive industry. For example, the Petroleum Fund Law was amended on 28 September 2011 to allow higher investment in equities (up to 50 percent of the Fund), and for remainder of 2011, the Fund to be used to secure government borrowing (up to 10 percent of the Fund). This was not the first diversification.

Its non-oil tax revenue is less than 6 percent of non-oil GDP and less than 10 percent the extraction and selling of hydrocarbons mainly from the Bayu-Undan oil fields, which provide more than a billion dollars every year today, will be used up in less than two decades. Over the last four years, spending from the Petroleum Fund has indeed exceeded the estimated sustainable income (ESI) of around 6 percent or more an issue that has recently become contentious. For example, the proposed 2012 Budget envisaged another scaling up of capital spending, so total government spending had risen to US$1.7 billion an increase of about 45 percent over 2011 spending and more than twice the level of the ESI of US$0.7 billion.

To achieve this goal, it plans to scale up public investment to development. In this way, the government is focusing on electricity, roads, and the rural housing programme (or, the MDG Suco Programme), which envisages the construction of pre-fabricated houses for each Suco (villages). The government is also investing in infrastructure on the South Coast to attract investment in the downstream petroleum sector with the view of bringing in the pipeline on-shore from the Greater Sunrise oil reserves. These projects are mainly financed by withdrawals from the Petroleum Fund, as well as borrowing. For example, capital expenditure has increased sharply with total government spending estimated to rise to US$1.2 billion (in 2011) from US$0.8 billion (in 2010), to improve poor infrastructure (**). For the next two decades, the infrastructure-oriented plan envisages excess withdrawals, which would bring down the ESI and the wealth in the Petroleum Fund by about 40 percent (or US$0.4 billion) by 2030 (***). Timor-Leste has clearly made a wise decision to accumulate assets abroad and adopted an ethical framework, showing that it wants to value the present as much as the future generations. Given the fact that the economy is underdeveloped and poverty affects more than half of the population, this makes a good case for spending the revenues from its hydrocarbons on consumption and investment beyond the ESI. However, despite expenditures increasing sharply, there is fairly slow progress in the economy and social indicators. We are yet to see the traction that such ambitious spending plans will have in the future to compensate for the loss of natural resources, even before the economic resilience is achieved. It is, therefore, important that the country strikes the right balance between what is being taken from the Fund and diversifying and strengthening economic resilience away from its hydrocarbons dependence.

The development concerns are well documented and the narrative well-rehearsed. What is missing is leadership at the multilateral level to put in place mechanisms that protect the weaker parties (governments and/or affected vulnerable populations) and encourage fairness in terms of negotiations of contracts. A dispute resolution body, similar to the one within the World Trade Organization (WTO) (for trade disputes), can help amiably resolve disputes and ensure a more open and transparent process. Revenue generation from extraction of natural resources would seem to be intimately tied to the level of transparency and openness of the contractual process. Secret contracts, financial incentives offered to politicians, and the fairly extensive off-shore banking network aid and abet an anti-development outlook. The more secretive the contractual process, the more likely that the revenue generated from extraction is channeled to personal and private ends. Making contracts public would help encourage greater transparency between the stakeholders involved, including the general public, and, as a consequence, the financial proceeds generated through such a process are more likely to be used for public benefit (i.e. development). Some of the questions listed above are likely to dissolve if there is greater transparency in this area. Also, it would be useful if the multi-lateral system moves towards articulating an overarching objective similar in spirit to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and/or a dispute resolution mechanism that allows for equal (or relatively more equal) exchange between the various stakeholders (governments, the public, multinationals, etc.). Presently, it is not clear what the larger multilateral objective is beyond advocacy and creating general awareness in this area. While such efforts alongside technical support offered to countries to better channel revenue generated (for example, Timor-Leste) are expected to yield favorable outcomes, a more sustained effort is needed to put in place mechanisms that ensure transparency, quick dispute resolution, and greater public involvement. 29 Revenue stabilization, regulatory frameworks and capacity: Some observations of the Papua New Guinea case Glenn Banks, Massey University Some comments from a long-term academic observer of the minerals sector in Papua New Guinea in In economic terms, there clearly are models for deriving significant stable revenue streams from the extractives sector: the Timor-Leste example captures many of the best elements of existing models. In the case of Papua New Guinea, a Mineral Resources Stabilization Fund (MRSF) was one of the innovations of mineral policy at Independence in 1975. However this had limited success in stabilizing revenue inflows to the government, and by the 1990s it was increasingly subject to the vagaries of ballooning public debt, and mineral revenues now flow through the shell of the MRSF into consolidated government revenues. Recent policy has sought to utilize an array of small Trust Funds to carry forward mineral-derived revenues in excess of fiscal targets, but this has also proved problematic in terms of transparency and accountability. The general thrust of this policy has been to use revenues in excess of a set proportion of GDP in two ways to pay down external debt and bring forward priority development expenditures. The key lesson that can be drawn from this very brief history and particularly the MRSF is somehow detached from broader trends within individual countries. In terms of planning and regulatory frameworks in Papua New Guinea, a revenue generation focus continues to predominate, while considerations related to the environmental and social issues (in this order) are always secondary. This is largely because of the continuing focus on resources as the driver of broad-based growth (or at least revenue generation and economic growth), allied with the (contested) status of mineral ownership as being vested with the State. There is also typically pressure from local stakeholders to focus on the distribution of economic gains, sometimes even at the expense of environmental costs, and within the regulatory framework a normative adherence to environmental and social impact assessment as a means to manage/ mitigate/ compensate the social and environmental costs. Experience shows that the latter belief is frequently (and sometimes massively) misplaced. A central issue here is less with national capacity (although the chronic under-resourcing of the regulatory bodies involved in the sector is a major concern) and more with a virtually absent capacity at the Provincial and Local-levels of government to negotiate and particularly manage the revenue s ago identified Provincial Government revenues as those with potentially the most direct developmental potential, but", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3aa98a91-ec14-43d6-9af8-df6ca4b1c371": {"__data__": {"id_": "3aa98a91-ec14-43d6-9af8-df6ca4b1c371", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "107b7b7224aa7e817db7c3ff37bfe3406db86f6b4948be8102f5a30d9aa0c3a0"}}, "hash": "107b7b7224aa7e817db7c3ff37bfe3406db86f6b4948be8102f5a30d9aa0c3a0", "text": "also were at the time the least transparent and accountable [see Department of Mining (2003) Sustainable Development Policy and Sustainability Planning Framework for the Mining Sector in Papua New Guinea: Green Paper].

The commodity booms that the global economy recently experienced have brought in large revenues, creating important economic opportunities for inclusive growth and development. This trend has encouraged many developing countries to intensify their natural resource exploration and to increase commodity production. A necessary precondition for a country to avail of its natural resource endowment is a clear, smooth and effective collection of revenu fiscal instruments at their disposal to collect revenues from extractive industries. In fact, many resource-rich countries levy a combination of taxes (e.g., royalties, corporate income tax) and charges (e.g., concession charges, license fees) to generate revenues from the extraction of resources. However, many resource-rich developing countries do not collect revenues effectively this might be due to the complexity of the extractive sector itself that often receives a special tax treatment, or to capacities, a narrow tax base and insufficient accountability and transparency. The challenges of natural resource revenue collection are exacerbated by increasing commodity price volatility (CPV), which has increased over the last decade, and tax receipts in resource-rich countries have followed this volatile trend. A comparison between the development of tax revenues in resource-rich and non-resource countries (Figure 1) shows that volatility of tax receipts is much higher in resource-rich countries. While the increase in tax revenues is generally a positive development, the high volatility certainly creates challenges. 31 Figure 1: Tax Revenue Developments in Resource-Rich and Other Countries, 1980 2009 (in percent of GDP) Source: IMF (2011). Revenue Mobilization in Developing Countries. Figure 4, p. 14. Last accessed on 10 August 2012. The unique challenges posed by increasing CPV in natural resource revenue collection are mainly two- fold. First, strengthening the fiscal system is challenging for many developing countries; designing the system to be responsive to changing circumstances such as volatile commodity price movements is even more challenging. It is well documented that limitation in fiscal capacity and over-dependence on volatile commodity producing sectors actually compound one another in many resource-rich developing countries. Loose tax and regulatory systems make it even more difficult to build volatility- smoothing fiscal mechanisms in a more systematic manner and thus expose resource-dependent developing countries more to CPV. often limited and weak fiscal systems (e.g., tax base, administrative capacities, lack of accountability and transparency), which will make effective and efficient taxation very difficult. Resource- illicit financial flows. Six of the top ten countries ranked by size of illicit capital outflows have net commodity exports accounting for more than 50 percent of their total exports (Angola, Chad, Myanmar, Uganda, Yemen and Zambia [see IMF (2012). World Economic Outlook database. April]. Additionally, the reliance upon volatile tariff revenues from commodity exports has been found to reinforce the risk of smuggling. There are two broad groups of options that governments can adopt to help collect natural resource revenues when facing an increasing CPV: a) fiscal arrangements and b) market-based risks management instruments. Fiscal arrangements structured to adapt to fluctuations in commodity prices can serve governments well in raising revenues more effectively while also enabling them to 32 benefit from the resource windfalls. Market-based risk management instruments, like contracts, futures and options can help countries hedge their commodity export earnings. For instance, many mineral exporting countries have implemented (and experimented with) a number of different types of (the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1062c257-c7d2-4c74-9b98-7a90ee65aeeb": {"__data__": {"id_": "1062c257-c7d2-4c74-9b98-7a90ee65aeeb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2af8fd0f33397dc6e7c48787fda331083f875250d1dcab523d6be19983b19c1"}}, "hash": "b2af8fd0f33397dc6e7c48787fda331083f875250d1dcab523d6be19983b19c1", "text": "royalty, the corporate income tax, the windfall profits tax, and others).

Successes and Failures in Natural Resource Extraction. Basingstoke and New York: Palgrave Macmillan]. By making use of market-based commodity price risk management instruments such as forward contracts, futures, options, or complex combinations, commodity producing countries or companies can transfer their risk to others. Therefore, these instruments allow producers to better forecast their earnings in the short run as well as to gain better access to credit due to the lower risk of default.

In conclusion, a well-designed fiscal system structured to respond to CPV has served some countries well, and some fiscal arrangements like windfall profits tax prove to be useful in the short term to capture the resource windfalls. However, none of the windfall profits taxes were sustainable, suggesting that an adequate and well-structured tax system is needed. In addition, governments can use market-based commodity price risk management instruments to smooth their revenue flows -- and Mexico showcased it. How to Satoru Araki, Asian Development Bank, Manila Thank you very much for your interesting article. For the example of Mexico, where hedging by derivative transactions was successful for FY 2009, I think it may be more sensible to look at several For FY 2009, the Mexican government bought put options equivalent to 1.5 billion US dollars (by no means a peanut amount), this amount could have been a loss if oil prices had gone upwards as the bought put options were not exercisable. 33 Follow up on using market-based risk management instruments to hedge against price swings Yanchun Zhang, UNDP Bureau for Development Policy Thank for your comment. I agree with you that purchase of oil derivatives could have wound up as a loss if oil prices in 2009 had stayed at an average of US$70 or above a barrel. In our paper, we did collect multi-year information to showcase the positive role and potential risks that market-based put options for year 2010 and 2011 did end up with losses (red bars in Figure 1). 2011 (US$ per Barrel) Note: Texas Intermediate (WTI) 40 API, Midland Texas, US$ per barrel as a proxy.

The government paid in 2008 to gain the right to sell its oil for US$70 a barrel - dropped dramatically in 2009. For the whole of the fiscal year 2009, the Mexican Federal Government received US$5.1 billion as a result of the oil hedge programme which more than compensated for the US$1.5 billion it invested in the hedge. Had Mexico not hedged, it would have had to sell at a much lower price (Figure 1). For 2010, Mexico hedged less oil at a lower price of US$57 per barrel on average. For 2011, Mexico again hedged oil at an average price of US$63 per barrel and for 2012 at an average 34 price of US$85 per barrel. Figure 1 also sh 2011 did not pay off as oil prices stayed at elevated levels. We do not have information on how many barrels of oil Mexico hedged for 2010 and 2011 and could not calculate the amounts that Mexico lost on these put option purchases (Secretar\u00eda de Hacienda y Cr\u00e9dito P\u00fablico de M\u00e9xico 2009; Blas 2009; El Economista 2010; Gould 2010; Rodriguez 2012).

Investment in human capital and community participation in monitoring mining activities Amarendra Das, Utkal University I would like to share my thoughts on the management of revenue from minerals. 1. Investment in human capital The revenues from non-renewable resources are temporary in nature. Therefore, it should be used in the areas which develops the capacity (human capital) of the nation to produce substitutes for the non-renewables. The thrust should be given on the investment in health and education of the country. Focus also should be given on the research and development activities for developing substitutes for the exhaustible resources. Although I appreciate the idea presented by Rui Gomes in the context of Timor- Fund, I have some reservations on such investment plans. Instead of investing the fund in the Dollar denominated bonds, the funds should be utilized for building up infrastructure (road, ports, hospitals, energy. schools so on), education, training and research. The formation of capital can generate sustainable income sources for the natives. 2. Community participation in monitoring Many of the developing countries are facing severe challenges of illegal extraction of minerals. This causes severe loss of revenue to the public exchequer. The illegal mining activities transfers the revenue to a very few powerful people of the nation. For minimizing the illegal mining activities, India is planning for more digitalization and application of satellite imaging services. On the other hand for the development of the mining region, Government of India is proposing to create a Mineral Development Fund in every district, in which profit and royalty shared by miners will be deposited and spent on the local population and area development. As per the new proposal coal mining companies will have to share 26 percent of the profits from their mines with people impacted 35 by projects. In the case of non-coal miners, the new law will provide for payment of an amount equivalent to royalty paid to the state government to project-affected persons. The profit sharing idea has not been well accepted by the mining firms. Moreover, if this is implemented, the mining firms will not hesitate to manipulate their balance-sheet for showing zero profit or minimum profit. This is well anticipated from the fact that there are many instances of underreporting of the quantity of mineral extracted and the actual market price of minerals while paying the royalty to the government. In such a circumstance the involvement of local community in the management of minerals will give them a sense of ownership and enable them to get a part of the profit to offset the loss caused due to loss of common property resources and environmental damages. Strong regulation and enforcement mechanisms to maximize environmental sustainability and social benefit Dorji Choden, UNDP Bhutan This e-discussion comes at a time when a debate is ongoing in Bhutan on whether the extractive industries, which include mining, should be nationalized. I was prompted to share what I know about the subject in Bhutan's context. and quarries (stone and sand) is small, relatively underdeveloped and insignificant to its economy. But the sector is expanding, as indicated by the increased production statistics, increasing number of leases issued and revenue generated, which are attributable to (i) the growing exports of minerals, (ii) increasing domestic consumption by industries as raw materials, and (iii) the construction boom, especially in the fast growing urban centers. It was reported that mining companies topped the list of taxpayers in the country during the financial year 2009-2010 to the national revenue from the private Mines tops taxpayer list accrued from the mining sector compared to other benefits is the large number of jobs created. When the Environment is among four pillars of the country's development philosophy of Gross National Happiness and the Constitution requiring the country to maintain 70 percent forest coverage for all times to come, the extractive (mining) industry does not spell well. It comes as serious challenges not only to the environment but also to other aspects of social well-being, particularly on health. While the country takes pride on its environmentally friendly policies, there were incidences of people complaining about damages to agriculture and wildlife, dust-related respiratory problems, and claims about the destruction of forests and hills affecting the area's microclimate. The Environment Impact Assessment is mandatory for extractive industry and administered by the National Environment Secretariat.

The excellent policy instruments on paper are often mismatched at the time of operation on the ground. Some of the challenges, and often the bigger questions, are: 36 1. Are the good regulatory instruments that are in place enforced effectively and uniformly to curb malpractices? 2. How does the benefit reach to the poor who are most often affected? 3. The process of public consultation and negotiation - how competent is the public to know the long- term adversity? 4. Are social and community concerns addressed adequately? Given that the Economic Development Policy of Bhutan (www.gnhc.gov.bt/) envisages mining to play an important role in supplying raw materials for industries, construction materials for infrastructure in development projects, important initiatives have been taken to exploit prudently the limited and non- renewable resources: (1) Nationalization of quarrying (stone and sand) to meet the increasing demand from mega projects and to stabilize the price. Recently there was a national debate with online voting on whether percent (128 votes) of the voters responded affirmatively. (2) Drafting of the Mineral Development Policy aimed at bringing changes in the allocation of mines/quarries and having a properly planned, efficiently regulated and professionally managed mineral industry. It is also aimed to incorporate greater social and environmental responsibilities (for example, an environmental restoration bond as a guarantee to ensure reclamation and restoration; at least 10 percent of the share, if any, for the affected community; to establish a community development fund). Does improvement on legal and regulatory mechanisms on paper, necessarily translate into sustainable operations on the ground? Social accountability pivotal to achieving inclusive, green growth in the extractive sector Kishan Khoday, UNDP Saudi Arabia Social accountability mechanisms will be pivotal to achieving inclusive, green growth in the extractive sector. Recent years have seen a surge of social movements in Asia and elsewhere focused on the extractive sector; posing questions about the nature of wealth and power in society, and calling for more transparent, accountable and participatory governance of natural assets. In this regard, the recently published UNDP-IPC Working Paper No.91 Development from Below: Social Accountability in Natural Resource Management may be of interest. A few key points from the paper follow. As governments and corporations scramble to secure resources, investments into natural assets have surged 5000 percent, from $6 billion in 2000 to $350 billion by 2010 (UNCTAD 2001) while corporate revenues have hit record highs, crossing the $400 billion mark for the first time. But as we also see from experience on the ground, amidst record prices and profits, the gap is growing between industrialists and speculators on the one hand, and rural communities who live on this treasure of natural assets but are excluded from benefit-sharing, while also suffering the social and ecological impacts of extractive sector growth. 37 Asian examples include a surge of community protests across the Tibetan plateau in recent years, communities in early 2012 forcing closure of a polluting mine at the sacred Mount Kawagebo, major issues remain in various parts of the plateau. And the concerns are not limited to the mining phase of extractive industry but to other parts of the minerals life cycle. For example this year also saw mass protests over pollution concerns in Shifang district in neighboring Sichuan, leading to cancellation of India, community protests es of minerals. In too, long-standing issues around copper/gold and natural gas reserves have re-surfaced with a series of protests and confrontations in recent times against abuse of power by the State and social and environmental impacts from extractive industry. These and numerous other cases in Asia and beyond show the rise of social accountability movements in which citizens confront the State regarding impacts of the commodity boom on their social and ecological well-being. As countries respond to these drivers of change, four key areas of focus are proposed in the Working Paper for consideration. 1) Regulatory and planning frameworks: Extractive sector laws and policies are being amended across Asia and elsewhere to adapt to social movements around the extractive sector. Global platforms like the Natural Resource Charter can serve as a common reference for enhancing planning and regulatory frameworks. One local example is in India, where an extractive sector Sustainable Development agenda for change and address the convergence of economic, social and environmental sustainability in the extractive sector.

The revisions also call for mining firms to design local Sustainable Development Plans to achieve inclusive, sustainable growth. Examples of innovative legal regimes in other regions can also provide valuable comparative insights, with examples from West Africa and Latin America also touched on in the Working Paper. In parallel to enhancing extractive regulations and planning, regimes for Social and Environmental Impact Assessment are also in need of strengthening, as are mechanisms for citizen access to justice. Examples in China include a Strategic Environmental Assessment Law which has sought to mainstream social and environmental issues into upstream planning of sector wide investments, while a Regulation for Public Participation in Environmental Matters has sought to engage potentially affected communities in Environmental Impact Assessment processes. This has been coupled with emergence of more than 47 local environmental tribunals across the country in recent years, albeit facing implementation challenges. Regulatory reform and planning measures can help achieve greater transparency, accountability and participation in resource governance. How are such measures helping to consolidate civil society calls for change and institutions that increase social accountability and checks and balances on the State and corporations? How are legal regimes being tailored to the goal of social accountability across different categories of resources? Within these emerging processes of reform, opportunities arise to support new fiscal measures to better account for extractive-sector revenue and reduce overseas 38 capital flight, institutional frameworks that secure long-term values of ecosystems, and increased citizen access to information, participation and justice. 2) Indigenous rights: Indigenous/tribal autonomy regimes are being engaged in countries around the world. Examples in Asia include Tribal Forest Dwellers Rights Act (2007) and Special Autonomy Act for Papua (2001), both of which have seen serious implementation challenges. Examples from Latin America are of particular comparative value, including regimes for indigenous empowerment in Brazil, Bolivia, Chile and Peru and innovative Constitutional provision on the Rights of Nature in Ecuador. As noted in a recent Policy Brief on Environmental Justice for Inclusive Growth, there is a need to prioritize the use of legal frameworks specially-tailored to recognize the unique history of indigenous and tribal peoples, their customary rights of ownership, use and access to resources. Further it is important to ensure that indigenous peoples make free and informed choices about the development of their lands and resources. Are rights-based models emerging that yield tangible results for goals of social inclusion and ecological sustainability? Beyond mere participation, how far do they go towards recognizing historic injustices to indigenous communities, legitimizing indigenous constructs of nature and society, and customary law related to access to and use of natural resources? 3) Corporate citizenship: Many multinational and local businesses are trying to engage inclusive, green growth in their operations, and scope exists to scale up clean technology solutions for less resource- intensive and toxic growth. The recent Rio+20 Corporate Sustainability Forum highlighted various examples in this regard, while examples from Asia were highlighted in this World Economic Forum report. What prospects exist for scaling up and replicating these efforts in the extractive sector and linking them to social accountability frameworks such as the Ruggie Protect, Respect and Remedy Framework endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council in 2011, the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment that seek to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles into investments, or the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative? 4) South-south cooperation: The quest for resource security is a core feature of the rise of the South, with emerging economies now a driving force in the global dynamics of commodity supply and demand. Many emerging economies, particularly those in Asia, have seen a surge of outward direct investment (ODI) and Official Development Assistance (ODA) into resource-rich but less developed countries. Chinese ODI for example has grown from $1 billion/year in 2000 to over $5 billion/year today with cumulative stock of over $300 billion (Ministry of Commerce 2010, Statistical Bulletin of ). As noted in a report on Africa-China Cooperation for Sustainability issued in the lead up to the July 2012 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), attention also now turns to benefits of integrating inclusive, green growth approaches into ODI flows. How can such proposals being catalyzed into action to prevent social and environmental impacts in commodity source countries? What role exists for UN/UNDP to help analyze evolving ODI/ODA flows, catalyze inclusive green growth approaches into ODI/ODA, and build on our universal presence to shape policies in both commodity supply and demand regions across the South? 39 The sustainability issue in EI Robert Goodland, Environmental scientist working in developing countries I find the topic of this discussion very", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a66ebc1-c173-4e3b-a1c9-9c40b5063a5d": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a66ebc1-c173-4e3b-a1c9-9c40b5063a5d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2783d1bd5970e87230566b0d541c4f916718a7a71b0bc154d288b21278d60d8a"}}, "hash": "2783d1bd5970e87230566b0d541c4f916718a7a71b0bc154d288b21278d60d8a", "text": "interesting and relevant to my work - I have assisted Indonesian Minister, HE Emil Salim, with the 2001- Industry portfolio. The biophysically rigorous concept of Environmental Sustainability (ES) is defined as non-declining natural capital or maintaining the source and sink capacities of the ecosystem. Environmental sustainability is therefore closely related to three of the top over-riding issues: (a) fewer impacts, (b) internalizing external costs, and (c) using full cost pricing. From this perspective, mining can never be fully sustainable as it inherently depletes a stock resource. Metal recycling and efficiency can postpone exhaustion, but cannot make mining sustainable. Utilizing the concept of - [see Salah El Serafy's excellent work in this regard (1996) In defence of . Environmental Values 5: 75-81] mining can be considered broadly to contribute to sustainable development only if economic benefits outweigh social and environmental costs, and if mining revenues are invested in building sustainable industries, enterprises and productive capacities. The principle, however, posits that different forms of capital (natural, human, and physical) are substitutable. Yet, the substitutability between various forms of capital is limited. diminished and preferably augmented. This broader definition suggests that mining can contribute to sustainable development -term net benefits (environmental, social or economic) A Rich Vein? Mining and the Pursuit of Sustainability). The is important as the social and environmental costs and all the external costs must be subtracted from the benefits. - benefits accrued by the recipients of most royalties, profits, taxes etc. may eventually trickle down to the impacted people is an aspiration at best. Impacts or costs of mining are likely to soar once the ore is depleted, when the major costs of restoration and very lengthy treatment of wastes (acid rock drainage, etc.) start to be tackled. Once the ore is depleted mining proponents tend to lose interest, especially in mine closure and restoration. My interest in EI, and specifically in metal mining, is that it can lead to social injustice as the more accessible ores are depleted and mining moves to remote areas often inhabited by indigenous peoples and forest (and its biodiversity). As extractive industry activities can generate effects that infringe upon indigenous needs to be mandatory in such cases. 40 especially concerned because mining proponents often wield power over legislative processes and legislatures. For example, this recent lawsuit in El Salvador at World Bank Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) ruled in favour of a mining company that sued the country for not issuing an to mine for gold. Guatemala reduced royalties to 1 percent with tax holidays while a major gold mining company was developing projects in the Western Highlands. Making mining codes more \"industry friendly\" at the expense of vulnerable ethnic minorities, workers and biodiversity is problematic. The power of mining proponents is often excessive, especially in countries with weak governance or simmering conflict. As Stiglitz (2012) puts it: \"Those with power use it to insulate themselves from competitive forces by winning favorable tax treatment, government-protected market share and other forms of rent-seeking\" (see The price of inequality. NY, Norton, pp. 414). Do you think that such asymmetric power relationships between mining proponents and impacted stakeholders, such as Indigenous peoples, lead to less development, less efficiency and more inequality? Poverty reduction at Porgera mining site, Papua New Guinea Glenn Banks, Massey University Many of the trends identified in the previous contribution by Robert are also at work in Papua New Guinea's extractives sector: the rights of communities to protest the social and environmental effects of proposed or actual mines were curtailed through changes to legislation last year. I specifically want to comment on your final question concerning the asymmetries of power between corporations and communities. In the Papua New Guinea context, while abuses certainly do happen, local communities have demonstrated a range of ways of redressing at least some of these imbalances, often in the absence of strong state support. There are upfront negotiations required (the 'Development Forum'), codified expectations of shares of various revenue streams, and perhaps most importantly an understanding that if the communities affected become too dissatisfied with the mining operation, they are able to significantly obstruct or even close the operation down (usually temporarily, but the memory of the forced closure of Bougainville in the late 1980s still pervades the public and the corporation imagination). How does this affect development, efficiency and inequality? In part, it depends on your definitions of each of these. In terms of the last of these, work I did some time ago (published in Focaal: the European Journal of Anthropology in 2005) showed that at the Porgera gold mine, the mine development had", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80e77bff-a432-4291-abcb-870cc3173d49": {"__data__": {"id_": "80e77bff-a432-4291-abcb-870cc3173d49", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff4860f9442ea16b399e19ac887f2fd81cb1826ea0056aa37f1f3cafb9997027"}}, "hash": "ff4860f9442ea16b399e19ac887f2fd81cb1826ea0056aa37f1f3cafb9997027", "text": "significantly reduced absolute poverty, but introduced new axes of inequality (over top of some of the pre-existing forms of hierarchy and inequality within the community).

It would be great if your web discussion could tell us of more examples and how they can be replicated. presumably beyond the temporary employment and local procurement at the mine, which ends soon after mine closure. That too is rare in my non-PNG experience. Often, poverty is increased by a mine because the impacted people are forced to get out of the way of the mine (through involuntary resettlement) and suffer other impacts such as loss of forest resources, loss of agriculture, less fish from riverine tailings disposal and pollution, and violence from security forces. The Porgera example must be unique because the very conservative and prudent Norwegian Government decided its track record was so lamentable that they ceased all their investments in Porgera. Perhaps, Glenn can provide additional information on how Porgera has improved their social and environmental track record since then in the next round of discussions. Revenue generation from natural resource extraction for development Bishwa Nath Tiwari, UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre, Bangkok There are contrasting evidences about the effects of natural resource wealth on economic growth and income inequality. While a number of resource-rich countries have not befitted, there are some which have furthered their development from natural resource extraction such as Chile, Indonesia, Malaysia and Norway, among others. The negative relation between natural resource and economic extraction, including: deterioration of terms of trade of primary commodities against manufacturing goods; revenue volatility from extraction; the enclave nature of mineral-based industries hardly benefitting local communities; Dutch disease effects through exchange rate appreciation; unwanted resources depends on how issues associated with extraction, as pointed above, are managed. These involve decisions revolving around political, social and economic spheres which are not easy in the presence of diverse interest groups and actors. Two arguments are advanced here about extraction revenues. The first argument is that mineral revenues are volatile because of unstable market prices and fluctuating trade volume of minerals which in turn creates macro-economic instability in a resource-dependent country. The instability is further aggravated by a pro-cyclical fiscal policy of such countries which incur higher expenditure during boom and low expenditure during slump period. The second argument is that amount of 42 royalty or resource rent (in real terms) decreases in long run. Therefore, unless economic policy of mineral-rich countries addresses the two issues, they cannot develop in long run. A number of factors affect price of minerals including discovery, technological innovation, and demand of products s rule that prices of exhaustible resources grow at the rate of interest, there is tendency of decrease in real amount of revenues from extractive industries (*). This is plausible given the fact that amount of resource rents depends on cost of extraction and world price of minerals. As lower unit cost mineral is explored first, it is likely that the resource rent that government can generate from extraction decreases over time. However, this holds only if government has already extracted all surplus revenues over and above the cost of extraction. Therefore, this leaves the possibility of increasing resource rent or revenue from minerals. are characterized by imperfect competition with a number of market failures including those resulting from asymmetry of information between the government which is the resource owner and the extractive industry. Generally, extractive company holds much more information than the government about the discovery and revenue and cost of extraction.

This market failure can be addressed through increased research and development (R&D) investment by government and serving as the sole leader in the discovery of minerals. This will help government increase its bargaining power with private companies to argue for increased royalty. Few countries have promoted a prime national company, a nodal agency approach, guiding others including foreign companies. However, information about cost and price of minerals and its ore deposit is only one aspect of revenue maximization. Policy measures on natural resource extraction require a holistic approach, dealing with discovery and innovation, macroeconomic stability, expenditure management through prudent fiscal policy, which in turn depend on economic status, political system and governance structure of the country. Note (*) The first path-breaking paper published on exhaustible resources is by Harold Hoteling in 1931 which has come with a number of propositions under certain assumptions. These propositions later have stimulated interest in the field; a number of studies have been carried out especially after the Designing fiscal policy to ensure resilience against political and economic volatility Matthew Genasci and Katarina Kuai, Revenue Watch Institute, New York In the majority of the countries in which Revenue Watch Institute (RWI) works, rents appear to be significantly under-taxed relative to potential or optimal tax levels. of data from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) highlights how little some resource- rich countries, especially countries dependent on mining, have managed to collect. In at least one reporting year for which EITI reports have been produced (*), mining revenues totalled less than US$30 million in each of the following countries: Burkina Faso, Ghana, Liberia, Mauritania, Niger, 43 and Sierra Leone. In the Philippines, the Finance Secretary recently revealed that the mining sector paid a mere US$47 million in taxes in 2011, or 0.17 percent of total tax collections. Official statistics indicate a mineral export value for 2011 of US$2.66 billion (**). Fiscal regime design. -size-fits- country, fiscal regime design should generally have certain core features in order to generate revenue, facilitate revenue collection, and strengthen resilience against commodity price fluctuations. Some of the core characteristics that could help to generate/maximize revenue are: \uf0b7 Ensuring a balance between windfall profits and a steady revenue stream. Gross income-based, royalty-type fiscal tools ensure that states directly share in the value of their resource endowments and provide a baseline level of revenues throughout production. However, all systems should have some mechanism for capturing a share of rents given windfall profits, relative to the olerance for risk and resource dependency. While the influx of revenues associated with windfall revenues will no doubt test weak macro-fiscal management systems, a failure to integrate these boons makes a tax system vulnerable to excessive renegotiation and other damaging disruptions that discourage investment. \uf0b7 . Flexible fiscal tools that are robust to changing political and economic circumstances over the life of the project enable states to share in windfalls, and are more credible than overly rigid, contractually stabilized, fiscal regimes. At the time of negotiation, governments facing immediate-term time pressures to deliver results (especially in impoverished countries, young democracies and fragile states) have high political discount rates and rely more heavily on fiscal instruments that deliver returns quickly. It is crucial government avoid sacrificing too much in the future in favour of revenues today. \uf0b7 Alternatives to traditional tax-and-spend theories of public finance. RWI encourages international technical assistance providers to help governments analyze the value of fiscal packages that include direct provision of infrastructure or payments made by companies directly to communities. Benefits and costs need to be evaluated objectively while remaining responsive to citizen demands for visible benefits. Fiscal regimes enshrined in generally applicable legislation facilitate implementation. Apart from the typical variations in tax and royalty rates commonly found in negotiated agreements, ad hoc fiscal regime design in the context of negotiated agreements often results in sub-par legal and fiscal regimes while exacerbating administration challenges. That is to say, agreements which deviate substantively from basic legislative and regulatory rules in the calculation of income (e.g., utilizing different bases and value measurements for assessing royalties; providing entirely different thin capitalization rules or loss carry forward rules for different projects; allowing one company special exceptions to ring-fencing rules; establishing complicated multi-phase rate escalations for various charges, etc.) could put tax administrators and other regulatory bodies at a significant disadvantage. Greater use of standardized form agreements and reliance on legislated fiscal terms create efficiencies in the use of limited human and technological resources for under-capacitated tax administrators.

Legislated fiscal regimes may also have positive impacts on investor perception of risk, as contract- based fiscal regimes raise the likelihood of discriminatory treatment of different investors. These 44 arguments in favour of relying on generally-applicable legislation over ad hoc contracts, where key interests are at stake, apply equally to environmental and social considerations. The proper balancing of social and environmental costs vis-\u00e0-vis revenue generation considerations is best done in the context of the development of broadly applicable legislations. Where significant trade-offs are made in the course of particular negotiations, the likelihood of mistakes rises and the regulatory task can be made much more difficult. Transparency of bidding procedures, bids, contracts and beneficial ownership. Well-designed and transparent competitive processes can support greater rent capture by the state. This includes rigorous pre-qualification procedures for companies to disclose their financial and technical capabilities to develop the concession. For example, lessons can be taken from Nigeria where in the mid-2000s, companies won ostensibly competitive bids only to either fail to make the payments due, In addition: \uf0b7 bidding criteria and timeframes need to be clearly explained and widely disseminated \uf0b7 the content of winning and losing bids should be disclosed wherever possible \uf0b7 the contracts resulting from the processes should be published \uf0b7 ultimate beneficial ownership of licensees should be disclosed. Without transparency, the likelihood that competition will, on its own, produce better fiscal terms and especially that it will produce more effective enforcement of those tools is greatly reduced. Transparency also enables monitoring and accountability by a wider constituency of citizens, civil society, local and elected officials, and the media among others who can support over-burdened administrative and regulatory agencies. Notes (*) The research covered reporting years 1999-2009. The reports themselves were published between 2002 and 2011.

During the first two weeks (6-17 August, 2012) we received 16 responses focusing on generating revenue for inclusive growth. The enriching conversation drew on contributions from development practitioners in UNDP Country Offices, the Asia-Pacific Regional Centre in Bangkok, the Bureau for Development Policy in NY, academia, and research institutes. Contributions drew upon examples from the Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Pacific regions. Under sub-theme 1 of the e-discussion, we examined policy options and strategies available for countries to improve revenue collection, in spite of commodity price volatility. To respond to the need of promoting inclusive growth and sustainable development, we looked at approaches and themes that could weigh social and environmental concerns. In addition, our responses raised a number of institutional challenges for designing effective fiscal policies and legislations while indicating good practices in which the challenges had been averted. A complete summary of the first sub-theme will be provided in the following days. You can access the contributions to sub-theme 1 on our Teamworks space: https://undp.unteamworks.org/node/264352 If you would like to join our Teamworks space, please contact ap-igd@groups.undp.org Your active participation has been a valuable resource and we hope to continue the momentum!

How can countries manage revenues from their extractive industries, balancing between the need to address immediate development issues through short-term interventions (e.g. cash transfers, employment schemes, other social safety nets, etc.), and the need to accumulate capital for future generations (e.g. through investments in public health and education)?

As in many mining jurisdictions around the world, the Australian government has sought to maximize the value of its mineral endowment. In 2010, the then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd sought to introduce a Resource Super Profits Tax (RSPT) sparking a major dispute between the government and the mining industry. Central to this conflict was a dispute about the amount and appropriateness of taxes already paid by the industry, as well as the multi-layered and complex taxation and royalty regime in Australia that involves both the Federal and state governments. (The RSPT was eventually replaced by what was called the Mineral Resource Rent Tax (MRRT), as was the Prime Minister by one of his colleagues). This episode was followed by a decision to trial the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in Australia to develop an agreed understanding of the revenues generated by the industry and Government has also committed to AUD (Australian Dollar) 12 million to support EITI advocacy internationally through the Mining for Development initiative. The increase in revenues from th sheet has remained relatively healthy throughout the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and arguably allowed the Government some flexibility to stimulate the economy at its height in 2008 and 2009. - projects and initiatives which are very much focused on prioritizing the future. These include an AUD 30.4 billion investment in high speed broadband to all Australian premises through the National Broadband Network (NBN). The government has also increased the compulsory superannuation guarantee rate (i.e. the proportion of annual wage compulsorily set aside for retirement income) for all Australians from 9 percent to 12 percent by 2019. Workplace Relations Minister Bill Shorten explicitly tied the increase to mining revenues, stating that \"We know the mining boom is great news for the mining industry and the country - but we want to make sure those digging up Australian minerals are sharing their profits with average Australians.\" have employed a royalty distribution scheme to share state-based mining revenues with regional -09 and -12 alone this amounts to planned investment of AUD1.2 billion of funds. The scheme has a stated focus on building communities in regional areas through three funds. These fund investment by local governments to provide and renew infrastructure (e.g. roads, bridges, parks, and footpaths), regional community services (e.g. supporting the Royal Flying Doctor Service, health initiatives, and subsidizing fuel cards for aged pensioners), and large-scale regional infrastructure projects (e.g. increasing irrigation areas to s 48 program, announced in March 2012, will invest AUD$170 million over four years, growing to an annual AUD$100 million a year fund according to government statements. Social infrastructure, health services and roads will feature as funding priorities under this scheme. Australia has a long history with mining and sophisticated legislative frameworks for managing the exploitation of its resource endowment. Yet the challenges experienced in developing mineral economies regarding transparency and agreements on revenues generated by mining to flow to the government similarly exists in Australia. The Federal Government-funded EITI trial, in partnership with the MCA, represents a proactive step to inform future discussions about the nature and ributions to government revenues.

The initiatives described above represent a recent response to societal pressure and expectation that a national mineral endowment should generate greater benefits for all Australian citizens and particularly for those living in regional and remote Australia from which most mineral value is extracted. The challenge for Australia is to translate this endowment into long-term benefits for all of its citizens. Leveraging the power of the market to encourage better development and sharing of resources with the most vulnerable people impacted by mining Jennifer Horning, Solidaridad Netherlands EI revenues do not always need to be directly managed by governments alone to lead to inclusive and sustainable economic growth. There is potential to turn the growing attention to value chain transparency for metals into a mechanism for encouraging broader re-investment of EI revenues by miners themselves. I would like to introduce some ideas for doing that. When you ask most mining company executives about their value chains, they tell you about the inputs they need to run their operations, like cyanide and truck tires. Rarely do they mention what happens once the mined mineral leaves the mine. In fact, they may not have to think too much about of companies at the other end of the value chain, the question of where their metals come from and how they were mined is quickly growing in importance. This is due to several factors. Some leading companies in the jewellery and electronics industries have voluntarily taken steps to better understand their value chains as a way to connect with their customers, improve their market positioning, and reduce their risk in a difficult global market. However, one of the biggest drivers across the market for greater transparency is the concern over conflict minerals in Africa and new regulatory requirements, such as Dodd-Frank in the US (similar legislation may be introduced soon in Europe). Buyers are facing pressure to answer questions not just about their own practices, but those of their upstream suppliers as well. 49 Several initiatives have emerged recently to help buyers better understand the risks in their chains, led by organizations such as Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Gold Council, the London Bullion Market Association, and the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI). Stakeholders must make sure that these risk reduction initiatives are matched with development opportunities. This will help to ensure that the people in the informal economy, such as artisanal and small-scale miners (ASM), are not further marginalized because they are not able to provide assurances that buyers increasingly need. In my work for the Gold Programme at non-profit organization Solidaridad, I focus on enabling the most vulnerable people in the gold value chain ASM communities and people who are impacted by industrial mining in the Global South to build better livelihoods. Since 2009 we have provided training and other support to ASM gold miners in Latin America and Africa so that they can meet the new Fairtrade and Fairmined standard (FTFM) standard and pass external audits. There is significant development potential in the ASM sector if mining is done in a responsible way. Over 20 million people worldwide are directly employed in the ASM sector and over 100 million indirectly rely on its income (over 90 percent of the employment is ASM in the mining sector). We believe in enabling those who depend on this sector to reinvest their mining revenue in their own livelihood development. Miners who are candidates for FTFM certification must agree to formalize and legalize their operations and adopt environmental and social safeguards. In return, the standard requires that buyers pay the miners at least 95 percent of the market price for the gold they produce. Plus, the mining association earns a 10 to 15 percent premium that must be reinvested for community benefits, such as better access to water or schooling, or income diversification projects.

While the focus of our work is at the mine level in the Global South, we always work with gold buyers, primarily in the North (*) for three main reasons: 1. To provide market access for responsible producers, especially smallholders, who may need to find buyers willing to pay a premium or otherwise invest in building a new supply chain; 2. To leverage the growing demand for responsible, traceable gold among these buyers to encourage better practices; and 3. To foster closer long-term relationships between producer and buyer so that there is greater accountability and incentive for continuous improvement over time. 50 Though the Gold Programme is still new and we have yet to measure the full benefits, the expectation is that through wider use of market-based approaches, we can encourage broader sharing of mineral wealth in developing countries (*). The answers to the following points could help to identify how governments and other stakeholders in the Asia-Pacific region can support re-investment of EI revenues using market-based tools: \uf0b7 Are mining companies (or refiners) experiencing greater pressure from business partners, such as the buyers of gold and mining project investors, to adopt better practices and provide assurances that they are meeting those practices? \uf0b7 What can local/national governments and donors do to encourage the use of market-based tools by the private sector and civil society? \uf0b7 How can governments balance regulation with market-based tools for effective EI revenue investment? \uf0b7 What is the potential for larger mining companies to support more formal, responsible ASM nearby as a way to ensure sustainable livelihoods in areas where ASM is already occurring? Which are the specific cases where it has/has not been successful? Note (*) In the Asia-Pacific, Solidaridad has not started work on gold. However, we are working with jewellers in Europe who source their products from Asian manufacturers. Partnership central to sustainable development with focus on service provision Francesca Viliani, International SOS and International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA) Historical development Private companies, including the extractive industry ones, are already contributing to poverty reduction and development. One might question their effectiveness (see Pegg 2003), as others questioned the effectiveness of development aid (see Moyo 2009), but the private sector is a key partner in the sustainable development quest (as highlighted during the Rio+20 Corporate Sustainability Forum), and the extractive industry is at the forefront of this attempt (Hilson 2012). The year 2012 marked the tenth anniversary of the Mining, Minerals, and Sustainable Development (MMSD) initiative which is a milestone for the mining sector and lead to the development of ICMM Sustainable Development Framework. The World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 put Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) on the international policy agenda and generated growing interest on the link between CSR and development and it officially launched the Extractive Industry Transparent Initiative (EITI). Simultaneously national governments adapted their approach to international development and, for example, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) is partnering with mining companies to co-finance community development projects around the world as well as advising developing countries on how to manage their natural resources. The World Bank Group has played and still plays a key role in financing extractive projects but also in developing regulations and best practices. Some international Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) raise fundamental questions about the development benefits of mining investments and their role as watchdog is of the outmost importance. 51 The extractive industry sector is therefore working within a very dynamic environment and addressing the needs and development aspirations of the local communities is central for obtaining the social licence to operate. However, no sustainable development is possible without an active and real partnership among all actors involved in development: communities, local and national institutions, private companies, civil society organizations, and other development actors (see Viliani 2009). I Health example these factors determinants of health - are under the direct control of the health sector. For example, water is important for our wellbeing, however, quality and availability of potable water is usually not a responsibility of the Ministry of Health but it depends from other departments and national bodies. Furthermore, planned and existing projects and human activities such as agriculture, transport, and mining among others, alter both quantity and quality of water and might generate serious health problems which", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aec2def0-27cb-4d34-bbfb-4e4316dec6d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "aec2def0-27cb-4d34-bbfb-4e4316dec6d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eec55a19ddd5c6d86b09a1b440334fd5bb0cf5c203b760c48433121b56ad4270"}, "3": {"node_id": "80f487ad-1c7d-41c3-818b-82fdd8486186", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59cc7a61ca28aff46a951a7ff32993c12f82a1d955370888efbfa50ffbe922b8"}}, "hash": "23bb664dc4e057508b564cccc79a122ffc194a698c49bcb9acfff17c017404c6", "text": "pose a burden to the local health system and hamper local development. Therefore, the health sector in most countries should be one of the key partners but not the sole responsible of community health and wellbeing: prevention, protection, and promotion are all more cost effective options than treatment. In Tanzania, for example, the private sector has been seen as an effective partner in workplace health interventions by providing HIV prevention and care to 1500 mining workers and 12000 community members. However, this raises questions of sustainability. How revenues can improve social service delivery The central government is always in charge and responsible for the macroeconomic policy, the transformation of natural resources wealth in human and social capital, and it should enable a context where other operators can contribute to infrastructure constructions and the provision of social services, respecting human rights and protecting the vulnerable or disadvantaged groups. Private companies should not substitute the government in the provision of health and social services (*), but they should partner with the existing authorities and other providers to strengthen their delivery capacity (**). This happens in different ways: 1. By ensuring that the project is not negatively impacting the existing context and undermining the service delivery capacity of the existing public sector; 2. By adopting international good practices in Safety, Health and Working Conditions; 3. A percentage of the taxes and royalties paid by the operation to the central Government is allocated by the national code/law to the administrative area where the resource is located and it should be reinvested locally to ameliorate social and health services; 4. The CSR investments of the private company support health and social projects that are consistent and aligned with national and local plans; 5. Foundations, Development Fund, or other revenue-sharing mechanisms agreed among the private company, communities, and local authorities finance health and social activities. 6. Creation of Stabilization Funds/Non-renewable Resource Funds which save money for future generations and for the management of emergencies or unexpected events. Unfortunately, in most countries there are no mechanisms to track the distribution of revenues from central government to the communities and, therefore, is if often challenging to track these 52 investments. For this reason quite often companies allocate a big portion of their CSR investment to projects aiming at improving socio-economic conditions as well as improving the quality and availability of services. Regrettably, CSR-funded activities are exercised in a wholly discretionary manner and not all the companies follow national polices and plans. Furthermore, pressure on existing services is not always fully addressed in the impact assessment process. Option 5 should be characterized by broader participation and transparency as communities manage their share of the profits, however, Foundations are not free from conflicts because communities are not uniform and homogenous groups. Conclusions In the absence of a functional state with a clear legislative framework and monitoring capacities, the extraction of resources cannot generate sustainable development as the majority of people will not benefit from it, the wealth generated might further contribute to inequities, and the associated impacts are not fully assessed and managed. To ensure that the revenue generated by the extraction of mineral resources is used for the benefit of the existing communities and in respect of the development needs of the future generation transparent partnership among all actors is essential.

What are criteria to determine this success? Is this a strategy to consider or bolster within Asia-Pacific countries engaging or about to engage in EI? As mentioned throughout the discussion, there is concern that government share of earned revenue could be better applied to improve infrastructure (e.g., physical) to immediately attract other investments, put into establishing or improving social programmes that could turn into medium or longer term benefits (e.g., education and health systems), or put towards developing other types of industries away from resource dependence. Yet when there is insufficient capacity to absorb revenue, and transparency/accountability of government to prioritize and spend wisely, I can see the urge to look to other actors, such as private sector or NGOs, to help fill in the gaps of basic services. Francesca Viliani and Glenn Banks mention a couple examples in Tanzania and PNG, respectively, where the mining company put some of its revenue into social services, such as clinics and schools, plan? What are the consultation, coordination and monitoring processes with the government on the quality of services? What is the protocol for ensuring those services do not undermine what the government is able to offer? Have you seen certain features in contracts/licenses that companies have to operate in a part of the country that looks at service provision after the departure of the company due to resource exhaustion? Also linking to the sustainability issue, the mining companies in Tanzania had provided some HIV -social-migration dimensions which might contribute to new infections at the mining sites). But if companies are looking to sustain profits and leave due to economic/political instability, exorbitant costs for operation, or resource depletion, this could have disas service provisions. Further, if other actors (namely Ministries of Health) cannot fill the gap from a treatments? A public-private partnership with extractive companies to fulfill these services also might increase user fees (in cases where developing countries rely on them to sustain the health sector) creating additional impediments to healthcare access. 54 Perhaps our Network knows about additional examples where revenue from mining companies went into meeting community needs -- in meaningful and long-lasting ways -- that did not shift the health/education services coming from a flight risk industry? Thoughts on sustainability of the interventions Francesca Viliani, International SOS and International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA) Thank you for your questions and further inputs in these aspects and I am indeed keen in getting comments and views from the other network members. I would like to add a few considerations based on my working experience in this sector regarding the points you raise on sustainability of the interventions. EI projects can have a different life span, but big projects (which are, on one side, the ones with potentially the biggest impacts, but at the same time generating the highest revenues) have a long life cycle. Therefore, these projects are operating in a given area much longer than any NGO or donor; they cannot simply pack their bags and leave as the natural resource is there. From this point of view, EI projects need to have a much longer term planning and vision than any other development actors, as a 5-year strategy is not good enough. They might have a 5-year implementation plan, but the strategy has to be much longer or they will encounter troubles during the way. Concluding, if the project is committed to pay for HIV treatment (anti-retroviral treatment (ART) and opportunistic infections) they will need to consider their long- term presence in the area and they might support these drugs for a longer period than the Global Fund itself. I am working in some public-private partnerships (PPP) and, in several cases, the international donor has decided to fund the programme, because the mining/oil company was already present in the location and, therefore, they could provide on-going support at a very local and remote level. In one instance, in the DRC the PPP should assist the health system to deliver HIV services that the health facilities should already provide as per national regulation. Unfortunately, they lack the funds, human resources, equipment and training to do it. So, in this instance, the PPP is not increasing the user fees but it is increasing the services portfolio. For me, the focus on PPP is important, but it not the most essential one in the debate. These projects the ones financed as PPP -- are the easy ones to follow and monitor (as development donors have a system in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6be90a5c-e0d8-43ba-92c8-ad33853ec00d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6be90a5c-e0d8-43ba-92c8-ad33853ec00d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d21ed0a50fb9c7b42272d18a1c46cb5e5737862dd976d1dece957bb277ffa693"}}, "hash": "d21ed0a50fb9c7b42272d18a1c46cb5e5737862dd976d1dece957bb277ffa693", "text": "place for doing it). Furthermore, PPP need to follow the national health plans and - The priority number one should be for an EI project to identify and avoid or minimize all negative impacts. From the health point of view, for example, it means not increasing the burden of disease, not (re)introducing diseases, but also avoiding the transfer of health costs from the project to the health system. Unfortunately, quite often project proponents and national authorities tend to focus on the physical aspects of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) and the human health consequences become a marginal topic. If: Negative impacts are included and properly managed, Residual impacts adequately compensated; 55 Positive impacts enhanced; then EI projects would be already more sustainable and the communities better off. Unfortunately, this is not necessarily the case and quite often health issues are either not included or only considered marginally. Once the boom is gone and the jobs and the revenues are gone, what people might find is that their health status is not what it was before the project started. In this instance, any lifelong health conditions will be treated and paid for by the national health system, which has not necessarily received any of the revenue generated by the exploitation of the natural resource. Expectations of wealth often lead to an overestimation of the possible short-term economic gains and to an underestimation of the long-term environmental, health and societal costs. However, the situation is slowly changing and the industry is realizing that assessing the impacts that they might have on health, safety and security of workers and communities is essential for the long-term strategy of their operations. At the same time, national governments are getting better at assessing the overall impacts of natural resources exploitation. Utilizing extractive industry revenues for sustained economic development Saurabh Sinha, UNDP Mongolia After the initial euphoria over the discovery of hydrocarbon and mineral deposits (*), governments in newly resource-rich countries (**) face difficult policy choices at various stages between extraction and preservation of exhaustible resources at the beginning; and how best to spend the revenues and These policy challenges stem from primarily two factors: (i) highly uncertain and inter-related estimates of the extent and values of proven and potential reserves, future prices, and cost of, and rates of return on, exploration; and (ii) countries need to balance various priorities such as how to smooth public expenditure from commodity price fluctuations; how to ensure inter-generational equity; whether and how much to allocate for investing in improving public services. A review of international experience (summarized in the accompanying table attached) reveals that governments often adopt one or more of the following three broad policy options for utilizing revenues from extractive industries: Save This includes placing the revenues in either a (i) stabilization fund designed to mitigate the detrimental impact of volatility of revenue flows, and/or a (ii) savings fund which saves the funds for future generations or for use when the non-renewable resource has been depleted. These funds are together known as Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) and some countries use both. Spend In utilizing this option, governments use natural resource revenues to (iii) invest in better public services, infrastructure, and human capital investments necessary for long-term growth. Distribute Revenues can be distributed either as (iv) cash transfers to citizens, or (v) shared with sub- national governments as part of fiscal decentralization. 56 These options are not mutually exclusive. Countries such as Botswana, Chile, Indonesia and Peru have used one or more of these options to turn their resource wealth into effective and sustained economic development. Botswana, in particular, has consistently reinvested mineral revenues in infrastructure and is widely considered an example of successful resource management. Others, such as Chad and Nigeria, have squandered their resources and are ranked near the bottom of the Human Development Index (HDI) ranking. While there is a clear and present danger that mineral wealth can turn into a curse through economic not automatically entail negative outcomes. Botswana, Chile, Indonesia and Malaysia have avoided the detrimental effects of the resource curse (Rosser, 2006) and benefitted enormously from their mineral wealth. Other countries with similar natural resource endowments have experienced different harmful effects. f copper and the largest coal deposits, has a real opportunity to convert its mineral wealth into a blessing by adopting sound fiscal policies. Its commitment to use mineral wealth to transform its development prospects is quite remarkable and its policy responses, at various times, have covered the entire range of options mentioned above.

IMF Topical Trust Fund on managing natural resource wealth Kishan Khoday, UNDP Saudi Arabia In terms of examples of international support to address effective use of resource revenues, one important reference could be the new IMF Topical Trust Fund on Managing Natural Resource Wealth.

Shannon, Former Minister of Lands, Mines and Energy - Republic of Liberia; Natural Resources Development Corporation, Inc. The Extractive Industry (EI) can be employed to increase the wealth of a nation and should be associated with accelerated growth and development. However, their production can in some instances generate social and economic upheavals. For example, if on one hand, the discovery of oil and natural gas must be considered as an avenue of success and not a roadway to distress, on the other hand, the production of oil and natural gas can bring about new inequalities and expand the The trend wherein natural resources become a means of increasing the wealth of the already wealthy and impoverishing the already impoverished must not be allowed to happen in the emerging producing countries.

Finally, let me conclude by saying that the misuse of revenue accrued from the production of essential minerals of the EI can have far reaching implications for peace and security, especially in countries where unemployment is high and poverty severe. Using mineral rents to finance social policies Katja Hujo, UNRISD One important aspect of mineral-led development is the management of revenue flows from extractive industries. This question comprises issues of revenue generation, as well as revenue distribution and allocation, going beyond technical issues related to public management as it concerns political processes and power constellations. While many studies concentrate on fiscal regimes and stabilization policies related to mineral rents, the role that social policy has played and could play in harnessing the use of these rents for development has been mostly ignored. This might change given the importance of EI and the dynamic developments that are taking place in different regions. To give an example: 93 percent of the Latin American population (including Mexico) live in countries that are net commodity exporters and most countries are heavily dependent on natural resources in terms of exports, national income and fiscal revenues (De la Torre 2011). Several governments in Latin America ruled by the so-called 59 revenues from mineral and agricultural production into redistributive social policies such as child benefits, social pensions or social assistance. A recent edited volume published by UNRISD (2012) is framed around a broader analytical framework that aims to disentangle the economic, social and political dimensions of a development path that is based on the extraction of natural resources. As UNRISD research has demonstrated over the past decade (e.g. UNRISD 2010, 2006), social policy is a crucial instrument with regard to a strategic management of development, especially for mineral-rich developing countries (MDCs). Social policy addresses many of the problems resource-rich countries face, as it can exert a positive impact on growth, employment, social cohesion and political legitimacy, whereas one of the main constraints for social policy, the financing question, is relatively less binding than, for example, in resource-poor low- income countries, the latter of course depending on the capacity of governments to capture parts of the rents generated. industries have not only laid the foundations for broad-based industrialization, but they have been pioneers in institutionalizing social insurance programmes for workers and employees in the sector with subsequent extension to other strategic sectors and finally universalization of social insurance coverage for the whole economy. Unfortunately, this progressive path of upgrading of programmes and extension of benefits from privileged sectors to the general population has rarely been observed in the developing world. During the last decades and years, many public mining or oil companies, which had provided extensive social services such as schools, hospitals and social security to their workers and to mining communities, have been closed down or privatized, and governments have often been unable to expand or even maintain the existing social infrastructure (the case of Zambia is illustrative in this regard, see Garrone 2010). The UNRISD volume (Hujo 2012) contains several case studies with examples for sustainable and transparent revenue management and the use of revenues for diversification of the economy and investments in social policy. One interesting example is the case of Chile (Guajardo Beltr\u00e1n 2012). The country has gone through a long and, at times, painful historical learning process with regard to what was considered excessive dependence on mineral resources (nitrate) in the past. Although today the copper industry is dominated by private enterprises, the public copper corporation CODELCO (Corporaci\u00f3n Nacional del Cobre de Chile) generates important fiscal revenues and functions as a benchmark institution in the sector. Over the last decade, the government has introduced several reforms that contribute positively in terms of macroeconomic stability and fiscal revenues. Since 2001, the country fiscal policy has been built on the concept of a central government structural balance (Dab\u00e1n 2011). In practice, this means that the budget is isolated from the cyclical variations of three variables that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37bab27b-003d-40a5-8394-57047354da8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "37bab27b-003d-40a5-8394-57047354da8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "455c4def6e9fa4be3ccaf39827a3f57ddf38c1049a2ee8498504fced55713ebc"}, "3": {"node_id": "5ef11dcf-d9d0-4b0d-a808-4fa30608cfb1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a00ab46beba16d344f4e9f42cf3b30bed885aeba2e4ce73e11fad2fa348d6d51"}}, "hash": "1c1358e40708c042a694667eb2a88ac69833417520dc35cd9d89d808f9233332", "text": "impact on government revenues: the potential GDP growth rate, the copper benchmark price and the Molybdnum (by- product of copper extraction) price.

And finally, the specific tax on mining (called Royalty 2) was implemented in 2005 in order to increase the tax contribution of private copper producers, with the purpose to finance innovation for diversifying the economy (Guajardo Beltr\u00e1n 2012). The establishment of a Pension Reserve Fund (part of the Fiscal Responsibility Law) and booming copper prices have contributed to some recent social policy reforms, such as the expansion of social pensions to 60 percent of the Chilean population in 2008 (Rofman, Fajnzylber and Herrera 2008). Challenges remain, even for the more successful cases such as Chile, a country characterized by democratic politics and remarkable achievements in human development and economic growth: \uf0b7 Governments have to grapple with the effect of increases in domestic spending on prices and exchange rates in a context that is already characterized by the Dutch disease (a tendency towards inflation and currency overvaluation). \uf0b7 They have to overcome the contradiction between volatile revenues from mineral rents and the fiscal requirements for stable long-term social spending. \uf0b7 They have to manage environmental issues, conflict and social mobilization around mining projects, especially with regard to indigenous peoples. \uf0b7 They also have to forge a consensus on the use of funds for economic and social development and to guarantee a fair and transparent budget process. \uf0b7 And last but not least, policies are needed that give incentives for economic diversification, as EI are time bound and tend to generate few opportunities in terms of productive employment.

Along the same line, it would be important to distinguish the difference between MC and the Mining to the Government for the exploitation of the natural resource with a particular calculation (**). Eleven years after the creation of the MC, communities still doubt about the direct benefits that mining activities can bring to their lives. This is also due to the fact that in some cases a large share (even 50 percent infrastructure projects. Fortunately, people have access to information regarding these transfers. Thanks to the Law of Transparency and Access to the Public Information (***) every citizen has the right to request to any public entity information without needing to express the purpose of the request. Thus, this mechanism allows people to monitor the resources that have been transferred to regional and local governments. Nowadays, there are also on-line mechanisms to access to the public expenditure and be informed. Yet, challenges remain as these tools have not been properly disseminated within the communities, which are primarily poor and, in some cases, illiterate. Poor people often do not have a clear idea about how they can participate in the approval of the investment projects and their rights in general. There is a lack of information, technology and communication, and, unfortunately, a weak participatory mechanism to engage the communities in the decision-making process. In 2004, Peru took an important and positive decision to be part of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) The same year, the Government discovered that some companies -- under stabilization contracts -- were paying less taxes as agreed upon. As a result, regions such as Ancash and Arequipa stopped receiving ten of millions of dollars from the MC. Peru's EITI group was 63 officially established in 2006; after a long process, in February 2012, Peru was designated as EITI compliant (http://eiti.org/Peru). Although mechanisms to access information are in place, it is important to highlight that information to foster transparency and accountability must be done at the regional and local level, especially in consultation with the local communities.

But some estimate that over the past decade the Kingdom has been second only to China in the growth of energy intensity (Economist 2012), with some forecasting that by 2030 local energy demands could soar from 3 mbpd to over 7 mbpd. This scenario has created concerns for the future of the oil-export based development model. With record public revenues owing to high global oil prices, the Government now plans to re-invest this into creation of a lower-carbon future through energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions. This would reduce the rate of energy intensity growth, and ensure future oil export earnings by the next generation. Actions includes among other things, launch of a Saudi Energy Efficiency Centre through a UNDP technical assistance programme that also helps promote energy intensity reductions in industry sectors such power, petrochemicals, buildings and company by size of reserve, and the King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy. The latter is goal of 20 percent of energy mix from renewables by 2030, with US$100 billion of new investments expected. 2) Combating Social Exclusion through Economic Diversification: Another key strategic priority of the Government is to translate record oil revenues into a more diversified, employment generating economy that can sustain future development beyond oil. UNDP provides support to the Ministry of Economy and Planning for new macroeconomic modelling and oil revenue forecasting systems, and NDP and related policies, oil revenues are expected to be re-invested in a way that supports a shift from an oil-export based social welfare state to a more diversified, market-based development model.

A need also exists for regional diversification of development benefits and non-oil growth. Tensions have mounted in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, home to more equitable use of revenues and local benefits from development. 65 3) Investing in Global Public Goods: Saudi Arabia has also effectively channelled significant amounts of its revenues into global humanitarian and development initiatives. Since the start of the last oil boom in the 1970s, the Kingdom has provided over US$100billion of Official Development Assistance (ODA) to over 87 countries around the world. With approximately US$3billion annual ODA allocations in recent years, it stands as one of the largest Southern providers of ODA alongside Brazil, China and India. ODA is provided mainly through the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD), which has energy investments into LDCs as a key focus. Other channels include the Saudi-based Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) and the OPEC Fund for International Development. The IsDB Energy Strategy seeks to support low-carbon developments in Asia and Africa, while OFID sustainable energy initiatives have become part of its core focus, include a recent Rio+20 commitment of US$1billion for Sustainable Energy for All. A new post-2015 development framework is emerging beyond traditional North-South modes of cooperation, with Saudi Arabia and other resource-rich economies set to play an increasingly important role in global affairs. Benefits of the Petroleum Fund to the state budget Rui Gomes, UNDP Timor-Leste Timor-Leste is facing significant challenges that include the legitimization of the democratically elected leadership, valorization of those who fought for independence, the construction of the set of laws and rules, provision of infrastructure, and investment in human capital that, in conjunction, will help to improve the living conditions of the population and create economic resilience. To achieve all these objectives, there is need for policy design and interventions aiming to provide sources of income to the inhabitants, whilst at the same time, restore and strengthen social cohesion as a strategy to promote and foster the sense of citizenship. These call for the need to put human development and all its constituting dimensions at the centre of policy making. The scaling up of public spending since 2007 has been mainly funded by the withdrawals from the Petroleum Fund, which one has to applaud cautiously. Much progress has indeed been made. For example, the largest capital investment in the country of US$900 million for the national electrification programme is already providing", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c518b8ef-ef7b-4358-bc92-e5358fd466a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "c518b8ef-ef7b-4358-bc92-e5358fd466a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a01cbe9f4a797bed8e186020a38e3fc7f1f371030268a2f71079f8770960fd07"}}, "hash": "a01cbe9f4a797bed8e186020a38e3fc7f1f371030268a2f71079f8770960fd07", "text": "24-hour electricity to Dili and eight other districts. Construction of the second new power station on the south coast is due for completion at the end of 2012. Although this electrification programme will quickly narrow the gap and constraint to development that is posed by shortages in electricity, the challenge lies on the capacity issue in terms of both financial and permanent institutional setups to maintain such a mega-infrastructure, which could rob the value of what has been invested. The government also designed several main social protection programmes, including the universalized pension programme to both older persons and persons with disabilities, conditional cash transfers (known as Bolsa da M\u00e3e), and pension to the National Liberation Combatants and relatives of the Martyrs. All social protection programmes commenced implementation in 2008, benefiting some 120,000 recipients. In addition, the government launched what is called the MDG Suco Programme, with the objective of freely providing five decent houses per aldeia (hamlet), equipped with electricity, water and sanitation facilities. Besides these mega-infrastructure projects, salaries have increased by 15 percent in 2011 due to the regularization of temporary civil servants into fixed-term positions. 66 The continued expansion of the fiscal envelope will remain in the coming years. Public expenditure has affected the rate of economic growth. A strong relationship exists between the non-oil GDP growth and the fiscal sector, whose correlation approaches 1 (*), between the growth rates of both variables. The correlation indicates that fiscal expenditure plays a major role in the overall growth of the non-oil GDP, without which the non-oil GDP would be almost stagnated. It could be said that the GDP growth of the economy is led by the contribution of the public sector, while the private one accompanies, mainly fulfilling the demand for better goods and services that the economy makes, led by the increased incomes of the population. This development ought to be closely monitored because - for consumption that may be beneficial in the short run, but may have limits in the medium run due to the high propensity-to-import induced by higher incomes. Looking at a disaggregated budget by category, it is clear that the capital development, due to its strong impact on the domestic economy, and its multiplying effects, has the biggest share of contribution. The linkages between the money devoted to current expenditures, (mainly salaries and wages), and the GDP growth, are also positively correlated. This is because state employees consume all their incomes domestically, and that has some multiplying effects. Whilst public expenditure on infrastructure serves to indispensable in order to guarantee effectiveness and efficiency in the use of the resources. It is critical to consider how the fiscal interventions affect the rate of growth, the sectoral balance of the economic growth, and the impact on employment generation. In addition, how the size of the fiscal envelope impacts prices, imports dependency, and the overall balance of payments of the country are key factors to weigh. The challenge is to maintain the pro-cyclicality of this fiscal policy through better reprioritization and efficiency, in order to accelerate the pace of achieving better social and economic indicators, by taking advantage of the large infrastructure investment for the people (**). Finally, the important question remains whether or not the transfers made from the Petroleum Fund into the state budget can really protect the domestic economy from petroleum revenues, and create opportunities that enable citizens to generate productive livelihoods. Notes (*) Based on an econometric exercise conducted by author to identify the correlation.

EITI as an international standard for transparency in EI sector Katarina Kuai and Erica Westenberg, Revenue Watch Institute The topics covered under sub-theme 2 are broad enough to merit more than one response. In this contribution we consider the role of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) as an international standard for transparency in the sector. 67 While no two states share the same prescription for the management of natural resource wealth, principles of transparency and accountability along the decision-making chain reduce corruption and facilitate informed policy discourse on how revenues should be deployed for sustainable development purposes. The EITI (*) is a voluntary global standard to promote revenue transparency in EI. It is currently being implemented in 36 countries (**) and has documented more than half a trillion dollars in revenues in over 130 EITI reports.

The second Tanzanian EITI reports confirms that the government received more than US$300 million from the mining sector in 2010, a revenue increase of almost three times what was reported for the previous year. In Liberia, the findings of the 2008 EITI report revealed an income tax discrepancy that led to a fraud investigation and legal action against the company. In building an international standard around payment disclosure, EITI has enabled unprecedented public scrutiny of resource revenues. Can it do more to inform citizens about how such revenues are utilized? In several EITI countries the success of the revenue transparency movement has spurred innovations in EITI implementation, including: 1. Advances in the monitoring of revenue flows to sub-national government and natural resource funds; 2. Tracking of development funding through CSR activities or company donations; and 3. Monitoring of state investments as an equity partner in extraction projects. The following are examples of EITI reports that have taken such innovative approaches: \uf0b7 In Mongolia, Ghana, Nigeria, Peru, and Sierra Leone, data on revenue sharing with sub- national governments is included in the reports. This allows citizens to see how revenues are laces where revenues may be lost or diverted. This is important not only because such funds can directly contribute to local development, but because these transfers may not otherwise subject to scrutiny if they are made outside the budgetary process. Even though Indonesia has not yet produced its first EITI report, RWI has been working with civil society in promoting similar innovative measures, such as subnational data collection in the Blora and Bojonegoro districts. \uf0b7 In Burkina Faso, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Mongolia, Peru, the Republic of Congo, Togo, Yemen and Zambia, the EITI reports also track the amount and purpose of donations made by companies for various aspects of local development. Disclosing this information helps the public and policymakers to assess the full benefits against the costs of mining. Meanwhile, companies can highlight the contributions they make to development, which can encourage CSR. Local authorities can also be held accountable for effectively using the social payments they receive and linking donations to local development planning. 68 \uf0b7 In Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Kyrgyzstan, Mali, Mauritania, Mongolia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Norway, the Republic of Congo, Tanzania, Togo, and Zambia, EITI reports also contain information on revenues the state earns as a partner or shareholder in extractive companies, which helps to ensure that the government is making decisions in the public interest when investing in and negotiating with extractive companies. Numerous complexities can arise from situations where the state is both a shareholder and a tax collector; citizens should be able to assess whether the benefits of equity participation outweigh the risks as compared to traditional tax and royalty systems. As mentioned previously in the e-discussion, Timor-Leste reports on payments to its development fund a special fiscal instrument dedicated to infrastructure projects, education, or inter-generational savings which is entirely resourced through EI revenues. This information enables monitoring of development fund receipts against fund rules on infrastructure and community investment. Mongolia is also assessing the possibility of using EITI to monitor institutions such as the development bank and human development fund both relatively new institutions that are funded exclusively through resource revenues. Ci endorse transparency and accountability in managing EI resources, including by adopting a joint policy at the ASEAN level endorsing the commitment to EITI by resource-rich member countries. Given harmonize their mineral policies through the endorsement of EITI is ripe. In sum, if EITI is to remain at the forefront of the extractive sector transparency movement, it will need to shape its strategic direction accordingly. The Revenue Watch Institute recommends a progressive approach for EITI, including a robust set of reporting requirements that are reflective of the numerous innovations that countries are already undertaking. Notes (*) The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is an international voluntary standard that seeks to improve natural resource revenue transparency. In countries participating in EITI, oil, gas and mining companies are required to publish what they pay to governments and governments are required to publish what they receive from companies.

However, the ASEAN member states of Myanmar and the Philippines have recently expressed their intention to join the EITI. (***) Though our contribution focuses on EITI as an international standard, we would note that EITI is adapted and owned by each implementing country, often alongside other domestic oversight entities, for example, the Public Interest and Accountability Committee (PIAC) in Ghana. The PIAC was created as a part of Ghana's 2011 Petroleum Revenue Management Law and is comprised of 69 and religious groups. With RWI technical support, and funding from Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), the Committee has been able to put together a first report, set up a website, and organize dissemination though public consultations in several key regions. PIAC in Ghana crit e.g. identifying ways in which the reality diverged from saving and spending regulations, and the lack of accountability with regard to public funds diverged to the national oil company GNPC, among other criticisms. EI revenues should adequately compensate local losses Amarendra Das, Utkal University Minerals are mostly endowed in the hinterlands of countries where indigenous communities depend on forests for their food and shelter. The extraction of minerals causes deforestation, death of a number of flora and fauna or loss of biodiversity, and thus negatively affects indigenous communities. In India, most of the mining areas are in the regions where indigenous tribes reside in forested lands. In many cases government has forcibly acquired the land without adequate compensation and rehabilitation (Bhusan and Hazra 2008: 67). Due to loss of forest and other common property resources adivasi people suffer multiple deprivations. The infrastructure and environment of the mining regions need to be enhanced. The revenue generated from EI has been often diverted from the public interest, and has not been invested to alleviate the environmental, economic and social losses borne by people. At least a part of the revenue generated from EI needs to be invested for the development of physical infrastructure (e.g. good roads, water supply, electricity) and social infrastructure (e.g. health and education) and building capacity of the people in the mining region. It is heartening to note that the governments of Western Australia (WA) and Queensland (QLD) have undertaken initiatives in this regard by transferring 25 percent of the royalties collected (as discussed by Dr. Kieren Moffat in the e-discussion) roads, bridges, parks, and footpaths), regional community services (e.g. supporting the Royal Flying Doctor Service, health initiatives, and subsidizing fuel cards for aged pensioners), and large-scale regional infrastructure projects (e.g. increasing irrigation areas to support agriculture growth, and Usually, all sources of revenue of a country are channelized to the consolidated fund of the nation and spent for all sections of the society. However, the revenue from EI is associated with environmental, economic and social costs which negatively impact people of the mining region. Therefore, a large part of the revenue from EI should be earmarked for compensating the losses of the people of mining region. In India, neither the central government, which retains the regulatory authority over minerals, nor the state governments, which own the mineral resources, have undertaken any such policy measures. Although recently, the Indian government has proposed to create a Mineral Development Fund in every district, by collecting additional revenue from the mining firms, so far it has not envisaged transferring a part of the revenue collected through royalty and other sources to the local communities affected by the mining projects. 70 Therefore, along with asking the mining firms to share a part of profit for the development of mining region, in my view state governments should invest at least half of the revenues generated from minerals for the physical and social development of the mining regions.

The first draft Bill included a noteworthy pro-poor provision: People directly affected by mining operations were to be awarded 26 percent , in addition to employment opportunities and infrastructural development in resettlement sites. However, faced with intense opposition by the corporate sector the government chose to dilute the provision before introducing the revised Bill in Parliament in December 2011. Leading business associations had successfully argued that the provision is a disincentive to the sector, and threat to foreign direct investments (FDI). Yet, examples of progressive norms for compensating local communities in countries such as Australia, Canada, Papua New Guinea, and South Africa question the real strength of this argument. The revised draft Bill mentions a 26 percent share of net profit for coal and lignite industries, and an amount equivalent to the annual royalty for all other major minerals. This provision itself is not winning favours with the private sector, which would rather provide fair settlement and a share of royalties. Problems of poverty, weak governance, and violence in mining areas back the call for a 26 percent share of equity with at least two arguments: \uf0b7 Rampant illegal mining precludes profit sharing. In 2010, state governments across India reported 82,000 cases of illegal mining; in contrast, the number of mines registered with the Ministry of Mines amounts to a mere 9398 (*). \uf0b7 Genuine power in the hands of the most vulnerable and a share of the economic benefits would have fostered sustainable mining and growth in a country that faces massive unrest due to forceful land acquisitions under the eminent domain exercised by the government and Maoist insurgency that affects 83 districts commonly known as the red corridor. The fact that argument. The Scheduled Tribes and other forest dependent communities, who live in some -bearing regions, are particularly vulnerable to displacement and dispossession. 71 Some of the states that have high tribal populations show very poor HDI indicators: Chhattisgarh, for example, has the second highest incidence of poverty among all Indian states (48.7) after Bihar. Levels of poverty in the state have stagnated, with a decrease of only 1.3 percent over the last five years, against a national average of 7.4 percent Jharkhand and Orissa (with respectively 39 and 37 percent of the poor), also fare worse than the national average (30 percent) (**). These indicators clearly show that benefits from extensive mining do not trickle down to the affected communities. foreign investments, discontent among the negatively affected communities needs to be addressed. Pro-poor provisions in a number of positive new laws which are at a critical juncture of being passed will help in balancing economic growth and redress the historic exclusion of these communities. Beyond these arguments, the debates around a 26 percent share of equity raise a number of questions which relate to the redistribution of EI-related revenue. The views and experiences of other participants of this forum on some of the questions raised by the debate above would be most welcomed. In particular: \uf0b7 What are successful examples of profit sharing from mining activities across Asia? \uf0b7 How should institutional processes of profit sharing be established and criteria for determining who qualifies as affected persons?

Revenue distribution through cash transfers Nienke Raap, University of Groningen As a Master student in International Political Economy, I have followed the e-discussion with great interest and would like to draw your attention to a topic that has not been touched upon, but which I believe is very relevant to the third question in this sub-theme: How the resources generated from Extractive Industries are used to support social policies (e.g. health insurance, education grants, cash transfers, employment) and ensure resilient local communities? Governments with windfall revenues from extractives find themselves well positioned to channel s to those that should take the ownership of it, but it is also a policy option that has proven to be effective in poverty reduction in many cases. The examples of Alaska and Indonesia can illustrate how countries have used their resource revenues in either conditional or unconditional cash transfers in different schemes. 72 Alaska (universal cash transfer programme) basic income guarantee to its citizens. The Permanent Fund receives at least 25 percent of all revenues gained by the state government from mineral extraction in Alaska.

Although there is no research relating the dividend to poverty rates in the state, in 2007 Alaska had the joint second lowest poverty rate (with Hawaii) of all the states of the United States, behind only New Hampshire, despite having only the 19th highest per capita personal income. Taking the Alaskan case as an example, the Center for Global Development has been exploring the viability of universal cash transfers in other resource-rich countries under the oil-to-cash initiative. The initiative holds that an even distribution system can create several benefits by arguing that taxing the generated income will create a strong public demand for the government to be more transparent and accountable. Beyond serving as a fair distribution mechanism, cash transfers may mitigate the corrosive effect natural resource revenue often has on governance. Some research warns that in the implementation of these schemes, success will depend on context-sensitive design and sufficient political support (Gillies 2010). Indonesia (conditional cash transfer programme) In the case of Indonesia, a different policy option was implemented by distributing part of the rents through targeted cash transfers to vulnerable and poor households. More than providing its citizens with their fair share of the rents, the Indonesian Government aimed to create a more equal distribution of resources within society so that all have access to social services (Ascher 2011). Indonesia is not only one of the countries said to have escaped the resource curse (Rosser 2006), but has also made notable progress in reducing severe poverty in the last decades. After Indonesia started the implementation of a far-going fiscal decentralization in 2001, direct cash transfers became a central feature of their safety net policy. The Bantuan Langsung Tunai (BLT) and Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH) programme are examples of cash transfer programmes for the main part funded by oil rents. The BLT programme was announced in 2005 as a program of unconditional cash transfers to poor and near-poor citizens to help them overcome the adverse effects of fuel price hikes caused by a massive reduction in subsidies. The program the largest of its kind in the world, covering some 19 million households was reintroduced in 2008 following another round of fuel , conditions were attached to provide an economic incentive for poverty-struck families to invest in the health and schooling of their children. Although the transfers have been praised to reduce poverty by replacing inefficient social protection programmes, there is room for improvement in the area of targeting and preventing leakages (World Bank 2011). These two examples raise several relevant questions, which I open up for Network members to respond, including to which extent have these programmes led to a more equitable and fair distribution of revenues? What are the pitfalls or advantages of a universal scheme versus a targeted and/or conditional cash transfer, specifically for low-income countries? What are the downsides of 73 cash transfers and what are challenges in their implementation? Lacking the insights to answer to all of these issues, I would like to invite others to share their views and experiences on cash transfers fuelled by resource revenues. Beyond best practice models Andrew Bauer-Gador, Revenue Watch Institute Norway and Timor-Leste are both commonly discussed as models of good oil revenue management following similar principles. However, the realities are so different in these countries that policies would be better determined as a function of domestic indicators and institutions. Indeed in the course of this e-discussion, Timor- ement of the Fund (Timor-Leste fiscal rule includes an important exception in the savings provision and has recently shifted its foreign investment strategy) one key difference between Timor-Leste and Norway is in their respective capital stocks. Timor-Leste lacks the infrastructure and human capital that enables self- sustaining growth in developed countries. Thus, the social rate of return to domestic investment in infrastructure, health, education, government and the financial sector is much higher in Timor-Leste than in economies like Norway. More importantly, the social rate of return on domestic public investment can be much higher than the rate of return on foreign investments. Though the rate of return on the Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund investments last year was nearly 3 percent, a World Bank study found that the social rates of return to investing in electricity-generating capacity was around 100 percent in Bolivia, Indonesia and Kenya. In these countries, and possibly in Timor-Leste as well, it may not make sense to invest the vast majority of oil revenues in foreign assets when the domestic returns are so much higher.

This raises a very relevant question about absorptive capacity differences from country-to-country. There is therefore a justification for government time to develop the capacity to manage large revenues and citizens time to adjust to a new environment (see, for example, Baunsgaard et al. 2012; Heuty and Aristi 2011; Sturm et al. 2009). Arguably, this builds a convincing case for resource revenues to be invested in complementary infrastructure or government capacity to manage infrastructure provision rather than saving revenues for future generations. Saving petroleum revenues and investing them in assets outside the country is not a development strategy. At best, this can be seen as helping to smooth expenditures over time and prevent wasteful over-spending. At worst, where capital is scarce and infrastructure and training identified objective guidelines to help policymakers determine appropriate savings-investment- consumption ratios. For example, governments with significant capacity to manage large revenue inflows or with the potential to learn how to manage these revenues should be given the fiscal space to invest these resources, particularly if public debt is high or the country is capital-scarce. On the other hand, if the return on foreign investment is high or there is a risk of environmental, economic or social crises, then the government may want to save more for precautionary purposes and shift the saving-spending ratio in favour of foreign assets. That said, in most cases resource-dependent countries should benefit from saving some revenue for stabilization purposes. There is significant 74 evidence that short- and medium-term macroeconomic volatility (e.g. price and exchange rate volatility), financial sector volatility, and government budget volatility lead to significant output volatility, which in turn leads to lower growth and poor investment decisions by both the public and private sectors. In many coun - prices has led to spending on extravagant projects like monuments, hotels and redundant machinery when prices are high. When prices decline, the result is often painful cuts, resulting in lack of maintenance and dilapidated infrastructure. In fact, Pallage and Robe (2003) found that eliminating output volatility in Sub-Saharan Africa would likely increase GDP growth by 1 percent per year. suggested that clarity in laws or regulations defining fiscal rules, disclosure requirements and oversight mechanisms can help promote revenue management in the public interest. They can also help governments adhere to long-term plans that are so important for development in countries reliant on exhaustible resource revenues. In contrast, countries that rely on discretional policies for saving and spending, like Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Libya, have higher volatility and, as a result, more wasteful spending than countries with fixed, widely-accepted rules. In recognition of this, Alaska, Chile, Ghana, Mexico, Nigeria (in 2011), Norway, Timor-Leste and Trinidad & Tobago have legislated fiscal rules to manage their resource revenues, including deposit, withdrawal and investment rules. Most of these countries also have strong transparency requirements, e.g. the regular publication of audited financial statements by the sovereign wealth fund. Ghana and Timor-Leste are particularly notable for establishing oversight committees consisting of government and civil society members to ensure adherence to rules, following the Chadian model (**). The Public Interest and Accountability Committee (PIAC) in Ghana just released its first report, which should be required reading for all those keen on improving resource revenue management globally (see also Tayou 2012). Beyond international best practice models, these countries are also drawing on transparent and inclusive domestic consensus-building processes to ensure that the policies are appropriate for the country and implemented with public integrity.

As a young nation Timor-Leste with no prior experience in governance has considerably relied on international expertise, and UNDP is the leading agency providing support in this area. UNDP initially supported the creation of essential systems and processes needed for the functioning of the national parliament, and has subsequently helped to develop national capacities in key areas such as drafting of legislation, provision of technical advice to parliamentarians in exercising oversight functions, communications and outreach for democratic participation, and gender mainstreaming. The legal technical support facilitated by UNDP was important in enabling the functioning of the Members of Parliament, the Parliament Standing Committees (*) and the Office of the President. There is considerable acknowledgement of the improvement in parliamentary accountability. One of the examples quoted by government representatives was the Parliament holding government accountable in the electricity sector and the power outage cases. As a result of the debate, Parliament approved a resolution to conduct an external independent audit of the electricity sector the largest capital investment ever since the restoration of independence in May 2002. Other relevant institutions that UNDP supports are the Civil Service Commission, which enforces discipline in the civil service, and the Provedoria (Ombudsman) for Human Rights, which also has a mandate on good governance. There is indeed evidence of enhanced transparency in the country when it comes to management of its Petroleum Fund (**). Notwithstanding, this does not automatically result in better (economic) governance (***). 76 The future demand for assistance in (economic) governance is likely to grow with the increased financial assets in the Petroleum Fund, expansion of the public administration and the creation of local governance structures Development Plan. Today, the demands for more inclusive growth and development characterized the Petroleum Fund, social justice, and protection of people from rising food prices have become even greater and require expanded response that goes beyond the usual business. To that end, UNDP is actively exploring other possible areas of contribution in governance that include public administration, right to information, e-governance, local governance (through strengthening access to quality service delivery), rule of law (through continued support in justice sector, enforcement and neutrality), strengthening of capacities within the audit and autonomous oversight agencies, such as support to the Anti-Corruption Commission (CAC), the Office of the Inspector General, and share best practices, as well as facilitate effective political dialogue, highlighting key issues and offering policy options for more investment in human development and economic resilience through its national human development reports (HDRs) and seminars. These initiatives are unavoidable progression in the programming for UNDP. One important message to end this note is that in developing the right strategic interventions in the area of governance would entail not only effective multi-stakeholder partnerships, but also an collaborative effort is delicately molded. In all these the issue of ownership of the processes and syste transparency and accountability. The successful initiatives in Timor-Leste may not be compatible with the challenges facing other post-conflict, resource-rich countries. In other words, pasting similar successful initiatives onto countries whose governance structure are absent and where there is lack of comprehensive legal framework around the extractive sector, compounded by the inexistence of monitoring systems would be simply unsustainable and politically counter-productive. Notes (*) An example of this is the technical support provided to the Standing Committee on Economy, Finance and Anti-Corruption in the national budget analysis, and to the Members of Parliament in the revision and analysis of the budget execution reports. (**) For example, Timor-Leste was classified as an EITI compliant country, which meets all the requirements in the EITI standard. See http://eiti.org/TimorLeste.

Prior to 2009, policy frameworks were in place to produce industrial minerals such as sand and gravel, crushed stone for the domestic construction industry, and limestone for cement production. The exploration of mineral resources has since expanded and policies and programmes are in place authored by the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy. Within this ministry, the Council for the Development of Cambodia, created in 2008, organizes investment in Cambodia. It grants exploration and mining licenses to investors, and will eventually set industry standards. To date, 160 exploration licenses have been granted. Three mining licenses were granted in 2011 for a total investment of US$31.3 million. The area under exploration is 13.6 percent of total landmass. Local and foreign, publicly listed companies and other investors have arrived from a number of countries in the region, for example, Australia, China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Concessions are issued for minerals, such as bauxite, gold, silver, lead, copper, perhaps rare earth, among many more (Fong-Sam 2009; Fong-Sam 2010), as well as drilling for petroleum and natural gas. Additionally, the Council has created 21 Special Economic Zones around the country with investment capital in excess of US$1 billion. Contracts are the legal agreements between the government as legal right holder to subsurface non-renewable natural resources and private EI companies. Companies are given the ability to explore and produce resources in a given location, for a limited time, in exchange for specified payments in cash or kind. In the petroleum industry the two main types of contracts are (i) production sharing, and (ii) concessions (CRRT 2009). Transparency The Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) must create mechanisms for monitoring revenue flows that, in the case of petroleum and natural gas, will begin between 2013 and 2015. While the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) has been established in other resource-rich developing countries, the RGC has not yet become an EITI member. Civil society has taken on the issue of -- launched in June 2009. It issues a Newsletter, holds public hearings, and advocates inclusive participation in EI revenue management and expenditure. 78 Revenue generation from EI Revenues generated from EI take the form of income tax (30 percent for mining companies), gross revenue royalties (2.5 percent), government share of production sharing agreements, bonuses, surface rental, dividends of national oil companies, customs duties, fines, penalties, and other contributions in cash (UNCTAD 2003; CRRT 2009). Revenues from the EI at the present time are predominantly exploration licences (CRRT 2009). It is not clear how the revenue or the resources generated from EI will be utilized to diversify the economy for sustainable economic growth over and above the National Strategic Development Plan which puts together a comprehensive reform and development agenda for five years to provide basic services (Royal Government of Cambodia 2009) and to create a conducive environment for the private sector which the RGC sees as the main engine of economic growth. Challenges to economic growth Obstacles that could impinge on future growth are a haphazard financial landscape and corruption (RGC 2009: 103). Further, Cambodia has limited higher-educated, well-trained, English-speaking workers and limited expertise in geology/minerals. To overcome these limitations, the RGC will fund short-term training in the country, scholarships for higher education abroad, and reopen the school for geology/minerals -- closed since 1999 (Suy 2010). Domestic protocols for its three mineral assay laboratories are yet to be standardized using one measurement system. Infrastructural development by the private sector for a rail network, a 1,800-megawatt coal-fired power plant, a water treatment plant, roads, and agri-business have had a number of poorly conducted surveys, contractor disputes, delays, and cost overruns (Invest in Cambodia 2012 sections on 'transport,' 'tourism,' 'banking,' 'investing'). The RGC is considering building its first nuclear power plant and says it is aware of the challenges which it identifies as the lack of technology, trained personnel, financing and the acquisition of materials (Fong-Sam 2010:1-2).

The solution may include their legalization and limit their operations to designated areas with low mining potential and as defined by the Director General on Mines and their organization into small scale mining De-legitimizing small-scale artisans and ghettoizing them into low-producing mines is to forge a link between EI and resource-rich communities that was severed when the RGC publicly stated that small- scale artisanal operations are, until further notice, illegal. The RGC might be successful in making policy without tapping into local knowledge found in resource-rich communities, it might exclude 79 small-scale artisanal entrepreneurs as stakeholders in the EI, but this could undermine the success of policy implementation if indigenous knowledge is rendered illegal. Exploitation of local resources is best understood by its female and male practitioners. They are the link between EI and resource-rich communities, and can be a viable model for development. Secondly, it is feasible for the RGC to institutionalize transparency of EI revenue flows and resources. It is a bold step which has been seen elsewhere. Liberia, for example, became a member in EITI in July 2009. EITI helps countries address information asymmetry through consultations, town hall meetings, radio programmes, newspaper articles, and posting data on resource wealth in public places. Transparency is making a difference to millions of people who have access to reliable revenue data of wealth generated from EI. The first EITI report contained information on taxes and contributions paid to the government, and corresponding revenues the government received from the companies on a company-by-company basis. Discrepancies were discussed openly among local residents, government officials, non-government representatives, environmental groups and mining companies. The failure to report on revenues is subject to criminal proceedings. In sum, the Liberian EI narrative has useful lessons for the emerging Khmer EI sector.

In this round we received 19 contributions which have focused on managing the EI revenue sustainably and have highlighted existing efforts to ensure accountability and transparency. Country examples from Australia, Cambodia, Chile, India, Indonesia, Mongolia, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Tanzania and Timor-Leste, have considered how extractive industry-related funds have generated enormous wealth but with serious development challenges to manage. A number of recent mining legislation has been introduced to address issues related to the management of revenue flows in open, accountable, and transparent manner, and the compensation of losses to local communities. Further, there have been efforts aimed to promote economic diversification. Although the reinvestments and distribution of revenues have not always benefitted the people whose lives have been affected the most, schemes that prioritize the future have started to be introduced.

While responding to the topic, Impact Management and Implementation Challenges, we request members to address the following questions: \uf0b7 What strategies can countries pursue to minimize risks pertaining to environmental degradation, conflicts, and macro-economic shocks? \uf0b7 How have countries addressed issues of land rights and benefit sharing over natural resources? What are the examples of successful participatory consultation and dispute resolution processes? \uf0b7 What type of impact assessments has been undertaken (social, environmental, etc.) prior to and after extracting resources? \uf0b7 What are good measures undertaken by national/provincial governments, local authorities and extractive companies to mitigate the impact of their activities on the environment and local communities? What specific measures are taken to include local communities, particularly disadvantaged populations, into decision-making processes? Extractive industries and the governance of common pool resources Blake Ratner, WorldFish Center and International Food Policy Research Institute A large proportion of the poorest rural households in Asia, Africa, and Latin America depend critically on common-pool resources such as forests, fisheries, and rangelands for their food and livelihood. For many of these households, access to these resources means the difference between an adequate diet and malnutrition; for others it represents the chance for a growing income, a means to invest in verty. One of the most significant trends undermining poor -pool resources is the transfer of resource use rights for large-scale commercial exploitation, through international or domestic private-sector investment. The tension between private-sector development and local livelihoods is expressed most forcefully in many regions as a conflict over access to land, forests, and water. 82 Cambodia represents all of these trends in sharp relief. On the one hand, the government has transferred resource exploitation rights through concessions previously for forestry and now increasingly for agribusiness and mining that have spurred widespread conflicts with local communities. On the other hand, it has set in place a policy and legal framework that supports community-based forest and fisheries management. These sectoral reforms primarily concern the distribution of authority among state, private-sector, and civil society actors with regards to decision- making over natural resource allocation and management. Yet, improving natural resource governance requires much more than getting sectoral policies and regulations right. It depends critically on the effective functioning of state agencies, alongside the private sector and civil society, to help translate policy goals into practice. In particular, beyond distribution of authority, effective governance reform requires measures to ensure: \uf0b7 inclusive representation of affected groups, particularly the poor and vulnerable, in policy formulation and development planning at all levels; \uf0b7 robust mechanisms of accountability to ensure that individuals and groups granted decision- making authority are held responsible for the public consequences of their choices and do not abuse their authority; and \uf0b7 institutional capacity to enable public, private, and civil society actors to fulfill their roles effectively; to adapt to changing circumstances; and to negotiate implementation challenges as they emerge. Strengthening institutions to manage the commons is not simply a matter of removing state interference and letting local communities get by as they see fit. In Cambodia as almost anywhere in the competition is far too great for local institutions to manage alone. It does not imply a rejection of market forces, as equitable access to market opportunities is an essential requirement for the success of community- based management. The effectiveness of state institutions is essential for just administration and dispute resolution for individual, corporate, and community-based tenure arrangements alike. Progress in governance does, however, require a willingness to look beyond written policy, law, and regulation, to critically examine how power is exercised in practice.

We examined many of these issues in the book High-Value Natural Resources and Post-Conflict Peacebuilding (*), which is part of a series of six edited volumes on peacebuilding and natural resource management. Following are a few of our findings, focusing particularly on oil, gas, and minerals. In the chaotic post-conflict environment, managing both existing and new contracts and concessions can be difficult and subject to oversight by government agencies, international organizations, and businesses. However, the failure to adequately address processes related to exploration, exploitation rights, and contracts and concessions can deprive the state of a considerable amount of revenues, fuel all of which can undermine post-war economic recovery and general peacebuilding. Monitoring revenue generation in extractive industries through contracts and concessions is essential to ensure that governments receive fair share of revenues and that revenues are properly accounted for. concessions until processes that secure negotiations, award, revenue sharing, and follow-up are in place. Experiences in Liberia (see Atman et al. 2012: 337) and elsewhere illustrate the utility of such temporary moratoria. To cope with the odious contracts and concessions, the government needs to review existing contracts and concessions, as well as the process for granting future contracts and concessions. The review should be based on an agreed-upon set of criteria (e.g., legality, conditions, benefits to the country, etc.). Non-compliant contracts and concessions should be cancelled or renegotiated. One way of dealing with existing resource contracts and concessions is to require auditing to ensure legality, profit sharing, and taxation. These can be done on a case-by-case basis or via concession and contract reviews. In the case of Liberia and Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the reviews were undertaken by the regulatory authority, with third-party support. Several post-conflict governments have reviewed, reassessed, and renegotiated resource contracts and concessions, with varying degree of success. One of the most complex set of reassessments took place in the DRC in 2004 and 2007, but failed to bring the desired results as the president took limited action on recommendations (Le Billon 2012; Atman et al. 2012). On a more positive note, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia cancelled all timber concessions in 2006 when a review revealed that not a single concession met the minimum standards for legality (see Atman et al. 2012). President Johnson Sirleaf was also able to renegotiate and significantly improve an iron-ore mining contract that had been signed by the transition government (see Le Billon 2012: 69). Unfortunately, contract reviews and reappraisals have proved to be slow and contentious processes, as in the case of the DRC. The meager outcomes of contract reviews can be partly explained by limited 84 expertise and capacity. Other constraints on contract review include asymmetric information, political fragility, and outright corruption. ithout it, the process of pulling through renegotiations to the benefit of the whole nation is very difficult. So, among the first tasks when contract review is planned is to ensure that the recommendations from the review committee will be implemented. Parallel to contract review, it may need to be necessary to review and strengthen the legal framework for natural resource management and mechanisms to monitor and enforce contractual requirements. This may include training of local law enforcement officials or judicial authorities. To encourage and support contract reviews, donors should provide review committees with technical and financial assistance. Donors should also support domestic NGOs who often play a direct role in monitoring contract negotiation processes and monitoring company operations once contracts have been granted. Another strategy for supporting contract review could be for donors to help to make up for potential revenue losses during review and reform periods. In the case of Liberia, sanctions can help to motivate countries to conduct a review. In this case, sanctions on all timber exports imposed by the UN Security Council drove concession review and forest reform. President Johnson Sirleaf, recognizing the economic importance of timber, used her first Executive Order to cancel all exciting timber concessions after the review and then supported the development of a new forestry law, contributing to the lifting of the sanctions. While most attention is paid to extracting the resources and to sharing revenues, it is increasingly clear that post-conflict governments need to consider and address the long-term environmental and social impacts of extraction.

London: Earthscan. Considerations for NRM in post-conflict settings? Bryn Gay, UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Policy considerations for the management of natural resources in post-conflict settings have been contribution how Cambodia established legal frameworks to support community management in its fisheries and forestry sectors, relying on partnerships among government, private sector and civil society to decentralize power in some of the NR decisions. In the article from Paivi Lujala and Carl Bruch, we see examples from Liberia in how it placed temporary moratoria on contracts and concessions in the timber sector, which had been used to finance its conflict. As well, they highlight how important it is to strengthen existing frameworks on NRM or validate what had been signed under a transition government as a country moves towards peace. In this way, what options and finances are available for countries emerging from conflict to employ (independent?) third-party legal reviewers or auditors to help take stock of regulatory frameworks? Furthermore, control over resources and authority to make decisions, such as issuing permits or contracts to exploit resources, is a key issue. For example, we came across this recent article [http://allafrica.com/stories/201209040671.html] about Private Use Permits in the timber industry in Liberia. These permits a laws, as well as forest- investigating the granting of these permits and trying to tackle the illegal logging issue. It would be interesting to hear from other Network Members who have experience in natural resource management in post-conflict countries, to understand what measures have been seen as exemplary to protecting their resources? To avoid regressing into conflict? Or ways that foreign companies or investors in the NR sectors -- be it timber, iron, gems, oil, etc resolution frameworks and integrate human rights/human development considerations in the contracts to operate? The Mining, Minerals and Sustainable Development (MMSD) agenda: 10 years on Abbi Buxton, International Institute for Environment and Development The Mining, Minerals and Sustainable Development initiative, completed in 2002, laid out an agenda for sustainable development in mining that was adopted by the mining company chief executive officers (CEOs) of the day. At the time, MMSD was ground-breaking in its breadth of coverage and combination of corporate buy in and independent research. After 10 years, it is important to take stock of what has been achieved, and identify the successes as well as the ongoing challenges. 86 Thus, IIED has reviewed 10 years of progress against the MMSD agenda this year. We spoke to nearly 40 key stakeholders across the sector and published a discussion paper that looks at progress and ongoing challenges across issues of the environment, communities, supply chains, economic development and more. One of the primary findings, which many of those spoken to agreed on, was that during the last 10 years standards have been set; during the next decade efforts should relate to the implementation of these standards. Best practice standards and international initiatives have proliferated over the last 10 years. The International Council of Mining and Metals (which received its mandate largely from MMSD) has produced a raft of good practice guidance that has served to fill many of the gaps identified by MMSD. And the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, International Finance Corporation Performance Standards and the Natural Resources Charter, amongst others, which were not in place 10 years ago, now serve to set a standard of what is expected of the sector for sustainable development of resources.

However, many of the issues continue to be framed in black and white terms that prevent proper engagement with the issue. An example of this is Free, Prior and Informed Consent, which many companies view as having no pragmatic entry point. However, communities are now more aware of their rights and have greater awareness of the benefits that mining can or cannot bring. This is seen in an increasing number of social movements reacting to mining developments across the world. Similarly, one of the drivers for the current wav stake in mining companies, may be a response to increasing pressure on mining companies to deliver benefits to local communities. Although many companies feel threatened by this trend, is there an opportunity to reshape the social contract for mining in a way that sees stronger partnerships between governments, communities and companies? If so, what capacity is needed to deliver this change? How quickly can that capacity be built? The MMSD+10 review spoke to a range of stakeholders across the mineral sector. However, it did not we would not have had baseline data against which to compare these results. As the greatest question is one of implementation, more research is needed to understand these issues and to share knowledge and -IGD online community has additional information on approaches to overcome the implementation challenges of these standards. For example: 87 \uf0b7 How do we ensure all the good practice guidance that has been produced since MMSD has traction at the ground level? \uf0b7 How do we monitor the impacts of international standards and initiatives to ensure they produce information that holds governments and companies to account on issues that are important at the local level? \uf0b7 How should industry respond to the new international agenda on human rights and Free, Prior and Informed Consent both in the right spirit and tangibly and increased community expectations around mineral developments? \uf0b7 Although understanding of sustainable development in the mining and minerals sector has improved, how do we move this beyond industry leaders and company policy? \uf0b7 And what should be the response to the latest wave of resource nationalism to ensure partnerships deliver tangible benefits from mining? These and other issues need to shape the agenda for the next 10 years an agenda which recognizes the progress that has been made and builds on it to ensure that good practice is consistently achieved in implementation of improved standards. Benefits allocation and FPIC Robert Goodland, Environmental scientist working in developing countries Allocation of Benefits As mentioned in my earlier contribution, extractive industries activities could contribute broadly to sustainable development if two essential elements are guaranteed: (a) the benefits outweigh the social and environmental costs, and (b) the revenues are invested in building sustainable industries, h weak governance, risks of conflict and corruption (*). - therefore, the social and royalties, benefits, etc., accruing to the corporation or government, minus the environmental and social impacts accruing mainly to the impacted communities. Companies should publish what they pay to governments in royalties, taxes and fees. The Extract the easy part. How to enhance payments from the mining corporation to the government and how to prevent corruption are more difficult. (Please refer to Revenue Although it is true that social and environmental costs are more difficult to estimate than the costs of bulldozers, diesel, cement, and steel, it must be attempted and corroborated by independent third parties. The Environment Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) process, paralleling the Feasibility Study, is the main way to clarify social and environmental impacts and their costs. For example, in the case of acid rock drainage (**) to be controlled in perpetuity, the cost for hundreds of millions of dollars. Full cost allocation means that all the internal and external costs and benefits, including social and ecological, of alternative decisions concerning the use of natural and social capital should be identified and allocated. 88 Countries need robust governance if they are to verify data on the volume, composition and value of resources being extracted and exported. The mining proponent has powerful incentives to under- report the richness of the ore or whatever is being exported. To monitor how much ore is exported is time consuming, expensive in terms of monitors constantly measuring tonnages being loaded for export, and sensitive to corruption. In some countries, where there are weak governance mechanisms, independent monitors are often used for such work, especially at ports. An increasing number of organizations are capable of undertaking independent third-party monitoring, conformity assessment and certification (***), including Global Witness, the Environmental Investigation Agency,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb70fe1f-7dea-43f7-9d65-f28c1115bbf6": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb70fe1f-7dea-43f7-9d65-f28c1115bbf6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "056637f707d167fb21371aee1e8352e016fdd06e4445f73134b4faacbc7d2911"}, "3": {"node_id": "76148bdf-71f4-4246-8a81-d701d28067d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e9f88b9756f8c13318f5518dc467470c3adf88bb33bda2c92e812f6abe9c8df"}}, "hash": "fd8427a9cf945175aa83ae36640144ac20c4862dc54774384f9ff5174b5fe97c", "text": "the Environmental Law Institute, SGS (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance) of Geneva, and Bureau Veritas. This does not preclude participatory monitoring by impacted communities, which can be very effective. Yet, finding an organization that is truly independent is challenging. Independent does not it also means neutrality, objectivity, and lack of bias. Estimating social and environmental costs is difficult but unavoidable. If the impacted people find that social and environmental costs are significantly underestimated, or that the compensation of residual impacts is too low, the project is best halted until an agreement can be reached. Free Prior Informed Consent Fr (****), is the best practice. FPIC means the days when exchanging beads, blankets or footballs to Indigenous People for the rights to mine on their territory are over. FPIC is mandatory for International Finance Corporation (IFC) projects and aims to empower potentially impacted communities, give them a formal role in the decision process. Projects should not be imposed on indigenous -- or any other peoples. As mentioned, involuntary anything (as in involuntary resettlement) can no longer be the standard as it was in the colonial era. project is not being run on economic lines. Involuntary resettlement is the most common example of the use of force to foster development. FPIC is the main way to ensure that force is not used against on by the agents proposing the project. The proponent of the extractive project has to fully inform the potentially impacted people of the social and environmental impacts from the start. The best way is to involve the potentially impacted people in the ES - process, so that people fully understand the impacts, how to reduce them and what to do about any residual impacts. The Impact-Compensation Contract (ICC) or Impact-Benefit Agreement (IBA) (*****) is designed to compensate for adverse impacts of mining on local communities and their livelihoods, and to ensure that potentially impacted people receive compensation from a mine impacting their lands. ICCs should be transparently negotiated in good faith in the public domain between the mining corporation and the impacted people, preferably with government approval as a formal legal contract. The contract should be justiciable and is usually based on the last section of the ESIA, often called the management plan or mitigation plan. If and when the impacted communities sign the contract -- that is taken as evidence that FPIC has been achieved. The contract is re-negotiated or amended if there are any changes in the mine project. 89 One of the main goals of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is the social license to operate (SLO) an emerging concept within the hard-rock mining community and acceptance of the definition and application is broadening. SLO is a comprehensive and thoroughly documented process in which local stakeholders identify their values and beliefs as they participate meaningfully throughout the environmental and social impact assessment process of the proposed project, from scoping through mine closure and restoration. Social license must be earned and then maintained. It is dynamic and nonpermanent because beliefs, opinions, and perceptions are subject to change as new information is acquired. Notes (*) See United Nations Interagency Framework Team for Preventive Action. 2010. Extractive Industries and Conflict: Guidance Note for Practitioners. (**) Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) occurs when sulphide-bearing minerals in rock are exposed to air and water, converting sulphide to sulphuric acid. It can devastate aquatic habitats; it is difficult and very expensive to treat and, once started, can continue for centuries. Roman mines in Great Britain and Spain continue to generate acid drainage more than 2000 years after mining ceased. In many mine sites water treatment costs exceed hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars, yet the contamination problems persist (e.g., Summitville, Leadville, Eagle Mine, Crested Butte, Colorado; Clark Fork and Zortman-Landusky, Montana; Bingham Canyon-Kennecott, Utah). Acid rock drainage can develop throughout the mining process. (***) Third-party monitoring, conformity assessment and certification are becoming the standards. Third-party is to prevent bias and maximize objectivity. Conformity assessment is where an organization determines if the requirements of an agreed-on standard are being met. Accreditation is a third-party attestation related to a conformity assessment body conveying formal demonstration of its competence to carry out specific conformity assessment tasks.

Last accessed on 3 September 2012. Arturo Requesens and Fiorella Arenas, UN Secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues Indigenous peoples live in close relation to their lands and territories, as these constitute the basis of the spiritual, social and cultural aspects of their lives. Therefore represent a major concern of indigenous peoples all over the world, as they are often implemented in indigenous territories without appropriate guarantees and without the involvement of the people concerned. In many cases, the activities of extractive industries have had a catastrophic impact on indigenous peoples, creating numerous conflicts. In order to minimize conflicts, the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues has recommended that states fully recognize the need for effective participation of indigenous peoples in all negotiation processes related to extractive industries. Further, it has called on countries to adopt legislation according to international standards to guarantee the right to consultation and free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples (Articles 19, 32) for extractive projects that might have a substantial impact on indigenous territories; as well as to ensure the establishment of national mechanisms to facilitate these processes (Para 82, 84, 87). In addition, the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues recommends that states undertake social, cultural and human right impact assessments during the different stages of extractive projects (Para 85). In order to minimize environmental degradation, the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues recommends that countries enforce higher standards of environmental protection, to regulate in an effective way the operations of extractive companies and to establish penalties for environmental violations (Para 89, 94). 91 Benefit sharing over natural resources and participatory consultation: successful examples Some countries have adopted legislative measures that have helped to address issues of land rights and of benefit sharing over natural resources. In Australia, in accordance with the Aboriginal Land Rights Act of 1976, Aboriginal land councils must give priority to the protection of the interests of traditional Aboriginal owners and promote effective consultation with them. In addition, it is regulated that a mining interest may not be granted in respect of Aboriginal land unless an agreement has been reached between the Aboriginal land council and the intending miner. There are examples of successful participatory consultation processes, such as the one undertaken in 2010 by the Bolivian Ministry of Hydrocarbons and Energy to the Guarani. The process related to a proposed hydrocarbon exploration project in the indigenous territory of of Charagua Norte and Isoso in the Santa Cruz region in Bolivia. Successful agreements between the Government and the Guarani Peoples Assembly of Charagua Norte and Isoso were undertaken, documenting community consent prior to the initiation of exploitation activities. Addressing environmental, social and cultural impact on indigenous peoples The Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues has recommended undertaking social, cultural and human rights assessments prior, during and on the completion of all the project activities. In Canada, the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement (JBNQA) provides the first piece of legislation in the country to identify specific environmental and social impact assessment process within the Eeyou Istchee Cree territory. In order to comply with the JBNQA, an environmental and social impact assessment study of the Matoush Uranium Exploration Ramp Access project was prepared by Strateco Resources Inc. and the public was invited to review the assessment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a2b32db-929c-4c64-970b-5747fc86bc6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a2b32db-929c-4c64-970b-5747fc86bc6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3df84cf25146fc17d4c1f8876125f32d73037b4f305ef2a3dd4f80de68113b74"}, "2": {"node_id": "8edd0073-88e4-44d2-ab5a-148bce2fa9c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a1efb39f1a46257ab7d96ccec3b24732ed24619a40e1b6aa4e21b8b480b1ec1"}}, "hash": "758e6068e73cc9fa2a16712124844f581cef558057b410920f568073733ab72c", "text": "and the public was invited to review the assessment.

Dave Sawyer, International Institute for Sustainable Development Canada is experiencing a boom in oil and gas activity with no end in sight. With 175 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and another 63 trillion cubic feet of cubic feet (EIA 2010), billions of dollars are being spent on accelerating resource extraction. One recent estimate places total incremental investment in the oil sands sector, which accounts for 99 percent of proven oil reserves, could total Canadian Dollar (CAD) 100 billion by 2020. With all this investment in increasing oil and gas activity, on top of a sector that has expanded rapidly in the last 10 years, economic impacts have soared. he province of Alberta, where the vast majority of oil sands are located, the potential value (or rent defined as revenue minus costs) of the oil sands reserves is about CAD1 million per resident. The Government of Alberta currently receives about one third of its tax revenue from the oil and gas development. However, oil sands royalties are likely to climb 2.7 times between now and 2015 - from CAD 3.7 billion in 2011 and 93 CAD 10 billion in 2015. According to the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI), Alberta could expect oil sands royalties of about CAD184 billion over the next 25 years. Government spending on social services is therefore tightly tied to oil sands success. The generation of revenue from oil sands, however, poses environmental challenges. Notably, the oil forecasting a 50 percent increase by 2020 over the 2005 levels. This will mean that in 2020, 25 percent are likely to come from the oil and gas sector. This rising trajectory of to achieve its Copenhagen GHG target of -17 percent below 2005 levels, or 605 mega tonnes (Mt). Simply the rapid growth in emissions against a fixed 2005 baseline means that an increasing level of effort is required to achieve its GHG target.

(Forthcoming). 94 Ecological economics as a planning tool for extractive industry projects Saleem H. Ali, University of Queensland All too often developing countries consider environmental regulations as ancillary to the core sustainable development is only possible with a consideration of environmental criteria, there remains a reluctance to consider environmental mitigation strategies seriously. The most promising way to convince governments in developing countries regarding the importance of environmental conservation in relation to extractive industries projects is to use the paradigm of ecological economics. This is an emerging discipline that is gaining traction among mainstream economists as well. It attempts to consider the economy as a subset of the ecological system and to develop metrics which consider the connections between ecology and economics in a systems-oriented way. Although for many years mainstream economists disparaged ecological economists, and still many economists at development banks dismiss any attempts to value natural services provided by ecosystems, the tide is changing. A promising sign in this regard has been the willingness of scholars such as Pavan Sukhdev to engage with environmental organizations while working at major financial institutions. The techniques for valuing services, provided through research efforts at initiatives such University of Vermont, should be given more importance in extractive industries planning. Another interesting approach which has been put forward by Ecuador is to value nature conversely by considering the value of resources that would not be extracted due to forest conservation. The estimated value of oil extraction from Yasuni National Park was valued at about US$7.5 billion and the half of that amount by 2024 the projected life of the oil extraction project. A poll in December 2011, percent of Ecuadorians supported the scheme which is now managed as a fund administered by the United Nations. Although this approach can only be confined to areas of exceptional conservation value where no - in congruence with development goals is worth considering. For practical purposes the way extractive industries development could employ ecological economics approaches in planning would be during the environmental and social impact assessment process. There could be scenarios developed for pollution mitigation strategies and the costs in terms of ecosystem services lost or alternative development paths that could be compromised by a particular extraction technique. The temporal dimension of how long the project will last, and the mitigation cost and recovery time of ecological systems, to allow for new activities to proceed once the extractive project closes, can also be more adequately measured through such metrics. It is high time that ecological economics are not considered a threat by development donors and extractive industry developers. Rather it should be considered a tool for risk management that can lead to more appropriate development paths and pacing of extractive industry projects. 95 projects (*) J.E., indigenous rights and anti-extractive industries activist based in Huila, Colombia Mechanisms, such as prior consultations, negotiations, and compensation with indigenous peoples living in resource-rich regions, are not perfect. To work self-determination, these mechanisms must define and support participatory and consultative decision-making processes that involve: the private sector companies engaged in resource extraction (EI), affected communities and governments. These mechanisms must be used from the very beginning, when EI and governments approach local communities prior to initiating extractive activities. It would also help if autonomous independent indigenous organizations working on these issues could advise indigenous communities during free, prior and informed consent (FPIC), negotiation or benefit-sharing processes. This is urgently required as self-determination is usually not respected.

The ability to come into a community with the arrogance of thinking that an extractive project would be better for the local population than the way arrogant and paternalist. Populations whose subsistence comes directly from the Earth are too often being portrayed as inferior to populations that rely on industries, which can destroy the possibilities of self-reliance for the purpose of creating profits and purchasing what was once produced locally, from elsewhere. This model sold as upward mobility, progress, development, ultimately leads people in communities to develop self-depreciation of endemic values, leading to the loss of subsistence methods and worldviews that are actually more ecologically sustainable and socially just, than the ones being imposed on them. Considering this point, I think that the structure of the current e-discussion could be more inclusive of current construct appears more limited to the industri self-reliant and subsistent communities, as it focuses on revenue generation, revenue utilization and implementation challenges and impact management. Recognizing self-determination would allow the community to define what and who their nation is. Once this is established and upheld, then we can talk about the self-determination to decide how we will live in our territory. Based on my work with indigenous communities, I have observed that in practice most countries do not fully respect the self-determination of its inhabitants, despite signing onto the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples or ILO Convention 169. In many cases, if a government wants an extractive project to go ahead, it will do so without consulting the local communities, regardless of what they want and need. For example, coal mining in the Guajira Peninsula in Colombia, is within the territory of the Way\u00fau People, and has visibly scarred the territory and the people who continue to projects in their territory and have negotiation power. At the same time, governments must respect the self-determination and autonomous, collective decision-making of communities, including the rights for communities to have their own prior, private, internal consultation processes without participation from the government of private sectors. 96 rights to have prior consultations, negotiations, and compensations, have become stepping-stones in a forced pathway to extractive projects. These mechanisms have not protected communities, as well as what they define as their territories, and, really, all life, not just human or biotic forms. In many cases, these mechanisms have turned into the methods that the industry and governments can use to oblige extraction projects on communities. Only using these mechanisms as tokens for accessing sites for mining does not respect and protect the rights of the communities nor protect their territories. This can result in a colonial denigration of local worldviews, needs, and traditional land uses, and lead to forced displacement. For example, there are an estimated 41,000 indigenous internally displaced peoples in Colombia. However, indigenous displacement often goes unregistered due to the remoteness of indigenous territory, lack of access to state services and cultural barriers. Undermining indigenous rights through forced displacement can exacerbate cultural assimilation, loss of identity, and breaking of social ties in the community that deepen local divisions and may trigger conflicts. One such example of obliging extraction projects on communities without meaningful, prior consultation is in the Embera territory; the Darien-Colombian Pacific Coast is one of the world\u00b4s wettest and most biologically diverse regions. The Embera peoples of Colombia and Panama are still considered one of the more sensitive status as Indigenous Peoples because their territory has been widely destroyed for the creation of oil palm agro fuel plantations, gold mining belonging to companies, the Urra I & II Hydroelectric Projects in Cordoba Department, among many. The initial interactions between the mining companies and Embera peoples characterize many prior consultations during which a mine or mega-development project is pre-determined. Companies will generally offer local communities a certain financial amount or alternative to move elsewhere. If a member of the community stands up for their rights companies offer a higher amount to get the group to back down. But there is another element to be considered: Most communities have never had to negotiate with an EI company. Most local communities do not have prior experience in negotiations, do not know how to demand their rights, or do not have access to all the information available to show legally that the procedure or implementation was not conducted respectfully. In this way, autonomous independent indigenous organizations working on these issues could advise these communities during FPIC, negotiation or benefit-sharing processes.

Communities, not politics? : Corporate Social Responsibility and the micropolitics of recognition Thanks very much for the opportunity to contribute to this exciting discussion. I would like to provide a critical perspective on Corporate Social Responsibility through a detailed case study from my field site, New Caledonia. New Caledonia is a Melanesian archipelago (population 246,000), estimated to possess nearly 25 percent reserves (Mining Journal 1999). I have conducted fieldwork in New Caledonia since 1998, and began to study this project in 2006. In 2002, an indigenous Kanak group called Rh\u00e9\u00e9b\u00f9 N\u00f9\u00f9 began protesting against a multinational mining company constructing a nickel refinery in New Caledonia. In 2008, Rh\u00e9\u00e9b\u00f9 N\u00f9\u00f9 leaders, practice and benchmark in the relationship between resource companies and aboriginal engineering this agreement, using what I call the micropolitics of recognition, which builds on the (Honneth 2004). Further, I use this case study to argue that Corporate Social Responsibility may mask, yet depend upon and exacerbate, intra-community power inequalities. Customary authority is highly respected by Kanak and forms a crucial part of their cultural and political identity. From the beginning, both the mining company, and the protest group that opposed it, At first, Rh\u00e9\u00e9b\u00f9 N\u00f9\u00f9 was successful in reinforcing its legitimacy through association with customary authority (Horowitz 2009). The ide who had accepted the mining project for the local employment opportunities but aimed to organize the community to remain vigilant as to environmental impacts. They forged a broader base of legitimacy by involving as large a number of customary authorities as possible. 98 The person chosen to lead Rh\u00e9\u00e9b\u00f9 N\u00f9\u00f9 was from a clan low on the customary hierarchy. However, when both of the chiefs who had initiated the protest group died in 2004, Rh\u00e9\u00e9b\u00f9 N\u00f9\u00f9 continued to define its identity as representing customary authorities. At first, customary authorities gave Rh\u00e9\u00e9b\u00f9 N\u00f9\u00f9 their support. However, by mid-2006 they began to have mixed feelings about the protest group. Without the chiefs as figurehead customary authority became less obvious, and customary authorities began to complain that it no longer respected them. The company, meanwhile, was doing its best to position Rh\u00e9\u00e9b\u00f9 N\u00f9\u00f9 as a fringe element that represented neither the chieftainships, nor the population as a whole (Horowitz 2012). As I will argue, they ultimately achieved this positioning through the micropolitics of recognition. The talks between the company and Rh\u00e9\u00e9b\u00f9 N\u00f9\u00f9 persisted throughout 2006 but did not bring the parties to a resolution. In early 2008, the company began laying the pipeline that would dump effluent into the marine environment, sparking fresh protests and a blockade of the installation (ABC Online 2008). In the midst of this turmoil, Rh\u00e9\u00e9b\u00f9 N\u00f9\u00f9 was swept into office at the municipal level.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae89e169-d146-4a05-aa10-ef917408ef87": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae89e169-d146-4a05-aa10-ef917408ef87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e0cd6f530f5e5c70a18a83bc39570f8f4fba5ef6112fce994c722f68bfbf7a3f"}, "2": {"node_id": "0cd86e5a-d3d9-4fa3-8d35-99b2bca8e084", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a978068618e20f7964ae5c5e6da8f3cdee67da818662902a96950b6149f8807"}}, "hash": "a02ea92c53d0a01bf004e1d0c4b161fbb1679d501657a991b3f42cf2a3b16daf", "text": "At this point, the company flew one of their legal specialists from headquarters as the new lead negotiation and not just a marginal element thereof.

Contractual violence: Corporate Social Responsibility, environmental harm, and the manipulation of power inequalities in New Caledonia University Thanks for another opportunity to contribute. I would like to follow up on my last contribution with a closer examination, from the same case study, of the power dynamics of company-community 100 negotiations. As mentioned in my previous contribution, I have conducted fieldwork in New Caledonia since 1998, and began to study this project in 2006. Within Corporate Social Responsibility, an important tool is the Impact and Benefit Agreement (IBA), a company-community contract that formally documents putative community acceptance of a project in exchange for various types of benefits that may include, inter alia, financial payments, employment quotas, support for local business development, environmental management, and cultural heritage preservation communities reduces the physical violence committed both in opposition to, and in support of, industrial activities. However, this begs the question of whether IBAs eliminate violence, or whether they may perpetuate other forms of violence. To address this question, this contribution examines an IBA between a multinational mining corporation and an indigenous community in New Caledonia. This agreement effectively ended a protest movement that had included the burning of company equipment and confrontations with armed police (see Horowitz 2012). However, I argue that although this IBA eliminated the physical violence associated with the mining project, it furthered both ecolo Corporate environmental violence may involve direct harm to ecosystems but, like social violence, it is often indirect. Another form of indirect violence is cultural violence, belief systems that can be used to embodies often masks coercion by concealing the negotiation process, its social context, and the res In Kanak (New Caledonian Melanesian) societies, women are expected to defer to men, who hold all customary positions of power.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16fcf894-d7b1-4981-a91f-65dcfa06e817": {"__data__": {"id_": "16fcf894-d7b1-4981-a91f-65dcfa06e817", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Advancing Sustainable Development: The Case of Extractive Industries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "791e723c68f8afcbb2d9b3a87db990381914c96af2789192377598e3ce20d94c"}, "2": {"node_id": "d595b15d-e8f8-4b35-929a-99396e08dc37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/advancing-sustainable-development-case-extractive-industries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e797ed765f5816865aae2467eb45489e7a965f222e29b8b594d9f41f693e016b"}}, "hash": "ce54e4137333f5a7a63c4a59ef2707c5042fc92a5f7339ca5eb1dfc7442a7384", "text": "However, women are increasingly achieving respect, autonomy, and even political power.

In fact, there was a lesser chance that the company would alter these procedures, as there was now a lesser risk of public exposure. In summary, the Pact performed cultural violence against women, reinforcing power inequalities between the sexes through reference to outdated cultural norms. It also directly performed structural violence, directing powers away from the government and communities and toward itself. as physical violence, they can be very harmful to local communities.

In other words, they should transfer power away from, example of corporate violence in this case, contractual violence. References Gibson, G. and C. O'Faircheallaigh (2010).

Challenges and impact management in EI sector in East Asia and the Pacific Emy Perez, Affiliated Network for Social Accountability in East Asia and the Pacific (ANSA EAP) Communities tend to be in the fringes of decision-making in the extractive industry this is too often an unfortunate reality. Although there may be national policies and laws that address community participation disappointment on not being heard and not having adequate and timely information necessary for them to effectively participate. Participation in Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), though calibrated, are provided in many national laws and in Global Standards adopted by extractive 102 companies, such as the Equator Principles (*). However, community participation and access to information is a rarity rather than a standard practice. The current concentration on revenue and benefit-sharing from the extractives, even at the onset of the project, distracts people from the less-discussed concern of participation. Information on potential payments, royalties, taxes, and benefits that may be derived or gained from the project, as part of the consent- -cash based NGOs across the region. Protecting community rights and promoting community welfare can happen with purposive processes and mechanisms for engagement in various phases of the mining cycle. The Affiliated Network for Social Accountability in East Asia and the Pacific (ANSA EAP) embarked on a partnership initiative with a few NGOs in the region, to experiment the use of Community Scorecards (CSC) as a tool for constructive engagement among three stakeholder groups: Communities, Local Governments, and companies. The NGO partners facilitated the CSC processes by generating the community indicators, scoring indicators according to the 3 stakeholder groups, facilitating discussions in the Interface Meetings, where consensus- Community Scorecards (CSC) are both a research methodology and a tool for community empowerment as respondent communities are encouraged to assess the performance of government and companies and hold them accountable (WaterAid 2004). It has been used in the sectors of education, health, water services where communities assessed the performance of government as service providers. Its use in the extractive sector was on a pilot scale, and involved companies in the activities. CSC consists of a series of processes which are inseparable and connect to each other. In general, CSC process consists of several phases: \uf0b7 Phase 1: Preparatory groundwork and research.

In this contribution we would like to share some insights from the CSC initiative in Indonesia. This example highlights the importance of sharing more information with communities, and of taking into The Voice from Ring-1 (PATTIRO and Bojonegoro Institute, Indonesia) Two organizations in Indonesia collaborated in piloting the use of CSCs in villages where on-shore oil extraction operates: Pusat Telaah and Informasi Regional (PATTIRO) and Bojonegoro Institute, both are NGOs dedicated to promoting good governance and social justice, particularly at the local level. Impacted communities are given compensation, including health projects, according to their distance from the operations. Ring-1 is defined as 7-km radius from the oilfield or oil operations. PATTIRO and Bojonegoro Institute in East Java, Indonesia brought people from 3 villages (Sambiroto, Ngampel and Campurejo) located in Ring-1 to the discussion table with local government officials and representatives of the oil company working in that area. The aim was to discuss the company's performance in implementing Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) and community development projects. The CSC initiative revealed that access to information and community participation were crucial issues. Issues that concerned communities related to the standards on noise, health hazards, and kick gas or gas flaring time that are observed by the company. Gas flaring is the practice of burning natural gas that is extracted from the ground through tall pipes that disperse pollutants over wide areas (***). operations. Early warning instituted by the company to alert residents of the gas flare incidents included setting up wind directional flags, sounding sirens, ringing school bells, and distributing face masks via the village leaders. However, these measures were deemed inadequate by the communities as they continued to manifest adverse impacts in terms of higher incidences of respiratory ailments, anxiety, and other health-related complaints. Emergency plans and procedures for evacuation during 104 lack this information, and there are insufficient emergency/evacuation drills or simulations conducted to prepare communities for such eventualities.

Stakeholders came out with recommendations to address the issues during the subsequent Interface Meeting. Beyond observing proper distance between the flare stacks and residential areas, communities recommended to better compensate people impacted by intermittent kick gas, and to provide emergency responses such as evacuation routes. The company agreed to improve dissemination of information on these concerns. Both the EI company and local government also committed to enhance collaboration and coordination in project implementation and service provision to communities affected by the extractive activities.

In the village of Mabadeno, Ailieu District in Timor-Leste, community residents who participated in the CSC initiative facilitated by the NGO, Luta Hamutuk, realized the importance of participating in the entire cycle of community development. This approach goes beyond being mere recipients of projects that had been identified and implemented by companies. When communicating this message during 105 the Interface Meeting, government and company stakeholders agreed to actively involve communities in the planning, implementing, and monitoring of local content projects. In another context, Community Volunteer Missioners, an NGO whose members are indigenous peoples in the Cordillera region in northern Philippines, facilitated the CSC process in two indigenous communities that have hosted a 50-year mining operation. Activities for the CSC were modified to nitially communicate their opinions and evaluations of projects and policies in private. At the Interface Meeting where responses to the CSC interviews and focus group discussions were presented as consolidated data (without pinpointing the names of respon royalties paid by the mining company to indigenous peoples amounting to PhP144 million (about US$3.5 million); procedures for the selection and funding of Social Development Management Projects that are required by the law; and the need for clarity in budget sources for community projects (e.g., delineating funds from mining company and government funds). Some more details on the initiatives in Timor-Leste and the Philippines are presented below. -Leste) Timor-Leste was the first Asian country to become compliant with Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) on July 1, 2010. Luta Hamutuk Institute for Research, Advocacy and Campaign, an NGO based in Timor-Leste, focuses on monitoring the revenue from oil and monitoring the national budget. It sits in the Multi-stakeholder Group, representing several civil society organizations (CSOs). The CSC exercise helped to improve transparency of payments from EI companies on one hand, information on funds devoted to local content projects was shared; on the other hand, communities and local governments started to get involved in decision-making processes related to such projects. During the training seminar on Social Accountability (to help prepare for the CSC process), held in February 2012 in Dili, Timor- readiness and eagerness to undertake CSC with Luta Hamutuk. Community leaders and focal points from the Ailieu district, CSO representatives, students and local government officials attended the seminar. The CSC facilitated the community assessment of one of the major oil companies in the country, particularly its performance in the provision of local content to the village of Madabeno, Laulara Sub-district, District of Ailieu, Timor-Leste. The assessment posed the question: How transparent, accountable, and participatory were the processes undertaken by the EI company related to provision of water, health clinics, and library supplies at the Madabeno Primary School? local content provisions. Information on budget allocation for the projects and the process of planning which projects to fund then to implement would help communities to understand what they would contribute to make the project more valuable to them either in terms of skills, labour, or local construction materials. Analyzing such information could transform communities from being mere beneficiaries of local content projects towards being more active actors in EI governance and local development. Discussion on the scores and analysis during the Interface Meeting (the culmination activity) allowed stakeholders to hear each other out, and look at community issues from a shared framework. 106 from the communities as they agreed to provide more information on local content and explore ways of involving community members more in the planning, implementing, and monitoring of different projects.

The CSC initiative confirmed that the mining company had complied with the requirements of the Mining Act: by providing funds for social development programmes, paying royalties to the indigenous peoples, and publishing this information on its website -- although there is room for improvement. For example, residents near the roadside generally have their projects prioritized for funding. Communities advocate to review how programmes and funds are planned and implemented so that they can reach members of the community who need the services most: i.e., people not in the immediate radius of the mining company but who are often marginalized from services and programmes. Risks that contribute to mining related development deficits Catherine Coumans, MiningWatch Canada Countries that host large scale mining face considerable risks related to, among others, environmental degradation, conflicts, and macro-economic decline. The following brief notes provide some considerations of these risks and their possible mitigation. There are some lessons that can be learnt from developed countries (such as Canada) where serious long-term impacts from mining are now acknowledged, and governments are being tasked to deal with these impacts. For example, it is now recognized that mining impacts post-closure have potential potential long-term impacts are particularly severe in projects that mine below the water table and in ore bodies that contain sulphides commonly leading to the need to control acid mine drainage and 107 now conservatively estimated to cost federal and provincial taxpayers well over CAD 5 billion dollars (*). In Canada this awareness has calls for regulatory reform to deal with the clean-up and reports have been commissioned to consider funding options for the cleanup of legacy sites. In order to avoid expensive liability post mining, Asian-Pacific governments must demand realizable bonds at the inception of mining that are set at the full estimated costs of remediation. Governments can seek guidance on how high a bond should be set from independent experts. Bonds should be re- evaluated every 3-5 years to take into consideration ongoing risk assessments and any significant change of the original plans. Just because costly this issue is now acknowledged in Canada, host country governments should not expect Canadian companies automatically to post adequate realizable bonds when they operate overseas. A Canadian mining company has estimated the closure costs of its mine in Guatemala at US$ 17 million. An independent study, however, reviewed publicly available sources and estimated the closure costs at US$ 49 million. The company has posted a bond of US$ 1 million, as of April 2012. Increasingly, social conflict is a significant risk for mining companies and host governments, but even more so for communities that feel compelled to oppose a project they consider to be harmful to them. allow local government units, or communities, the right to reject a mining project (**). Consultations and seeking a social license to operate can only be meaningful if the right to reject a mining project is recognized. Philippines. There have been at least 42 mining moratoriums declared by provincial and municipal governments in the Philippines in recent years (**) under the Constitution and Republic Act 7160 (Local Government Code). These moratoriums reflect decisions made by elected local government officials in response to demands by their constituents. The texts that accompany these declarations usually detail the justification for this decision. These moratoriums should be seen as a clear sign to attainable. Rather than recognizing that the power of local government units to make such decisions in the Philippines provides clarity to the industry, the industry, through its own associations, as well as President to remove the local powers under Executive Order 79. Governments that seek to avoid local-level conflicts and ensure that mining is welcome must support any existing legislation that allows local governments and communities to make decisions related to mining on behalf of non-indigenous constituents. Where such legislation does not exist, governments that the legislation exists (as it does in the Philippines). It has to be ensured that the legislation, which rigorously enforced. This is currently a failure in the Philippines. In countries where such legislation does not currently exist, it must be created in alignment with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 108 The well- developing country governments that there is not an automatic correlation between resource development and macro-economic progress.

These conditions often include lengthy tax holidays and lengthy holidays from import and export duties. Additionally, so-called transfer pricing provisions are particularly pernicious in mining contracts because transfer pricing can be a primary vehicle of capital flight out of a country. Transfer pricing can result in potential revenues for a country leaving for any number of global tax havens amounting to tax evasion (***). The three issues discussed point to the broader need for governments to do full costs accounting when considering resource extraction. The costs that must be taken into consideration do not only include the three discussed above long-term closure costs, costs of conflict, and capital flight -- but many others, including lost development opportunity costs and the rarely accounted for but very substantial institutional costs associated with properly regulating the mining industry (****).

Need to strengthen enforcement of environmental laws in India Amarendra Das, Utkal University In India, a plethora of rules govern the mining activities. As per the rules in India any mining project exceeding the land area of 5 hectares of land shall have to submit an environmental impact assessment plan, a mining operation plan, and a mining closure plan before getting the license to extract minerals. As per the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification of 2006 issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forest all the proposed mining projects owners have to do a public In India mining activities are primarily regulated by three state agencies State Pollution Control Board, State Forest Department, State Director of Mines and three central agencies Ministry of Environment and Forest, Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) and Ministry of Mines. It is unfortunate that to date environmental performance of mining firms has been far from satisfactory. This is also due to weak enforcement of mining related laws.

Similarly, in some cases, mines are owned directly by politicians or other influential people (see, for example, an article in the Times of India 2012). In such cases, the regulatory authorities adopt lenient approaches. Another factor behind the weak enforcement of rules is the lack of coordination among different agencies. In case of violation of rules, regulatory authorities do not have enough power to take stringent action against the mining firms. The maximum action usually taken is cancellation of the lease or closure of the mines without any criminal proceedings or cash fines. Therefore, in order to improve the environmental compliance of mining firms in India enforcement mechanisms need to be strengthened. Strengthening the regulatory authorities with additional staff, vehicles and other modern equipment (such as tracing through GPS) as well as rendering power to take stringent action against the incompliant firms can improve environmental outcomes. While giving the options to mining firms to comply with the existing rules, provisions should also include severe penalties in case there is a breach of rules. 110 Policy innovation for better governance of the social impacts of mining Daniel Franks, University of Queensland Mining and energy developments bring change.

Change is experienced very differently by different people depending on a multitude of factors including, values, history, livelihoods, demographics and, of course, the distribution of the costs and benefits of a project. The process of how change is managed can have a big influence on the outcomes. It is sometimes argued that to attract extractive resource developments developing country governments should reduce business costs and put in place policies and laws that expedite or prioritize mineral and energy resource development. Such an approach, however, can be a disincentive for investment by experienced and responsible resource developers not only because it can increase business risks and jeopardize the prospects for long-term success of developments, but also because weak governance environments tend to attract inexperienced companies. Significant costs can be experienced by companies in conflict with communities due to delays, shutdowns, and the closure of projects (see Davis and Franks 2011). When stakeholders have an opportunity to actively participate in the decision-making of resource developments and ensure that the project is consistent with their values and livelihoods, their experience of those developments tends to be more positive and their attitudes toward projects more supportive (though this is not exclusively so). Public participation may take the form of local community consultation (and increasingly consent), opportunities for civil society involvement in impact assessment processes, or more active participation such as involvement in ongoing community consultative committees, the negotiation of community development agreements, opportunities for dispute resolution, or participatory environmental and social monitoring initiatives. In the state of Queensland, Australia, social impact assessment and multi-stakeholder governance processes were strengthened through the Sustainable Resource Communities Policy. The policy also introduced Social Impact Management Plans as an ongoing process across the life-cycle of projects (see Franks 2012). In the Philippines and Sierra Leone public access to mining lease information is provided through online repositories. In Peru local communities have been involved in participatory water monitoring projects. There are also examples of policy innovation within companies to better address the social impacts of resource development. A South African-founded company has developed the Socio-Economic Assessment Toolbox as a requirement at their mines. An international company based in Switzerland requires sites to develop a complaints and grievance handling process. A British-Australian multinational requires sites to develop community plans (sometimes undertaken as a community strategic planning processes in collaboration with local government). International institutions, such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC), have also developed performance frameworks for environmental and social issues. 111 These initiatives point to greater flexibility for governments to implement policies that mandate better social and environmental performance for all companies operating within their jurisdiction. A policy framework that encourages responsible mineral resource development and greater public and civil society involvement in decision-making can improve outcomes for communities while still maintaining a reasonable investment climate. Extractive industries and sustainable development Brian Kohler, IndustriAll Global Union Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising as per the Brundtland Commission (1987). Sustainability addresses three broad areas of needs that are not easily separated from each other: social, economic, and environmental. Social sustainability begins with respect for human rights, cultures and communities, and values such as fairness, equity, and justice. Economic sustainability refers globally to the smooth functioning of the economic system for the benefit of all peoples (including opportunities for growth of the economy of less-developed nations), and locally to the continued financial viability of communities and enterprises and their ability to provide decent work. Environmental sustainability results from a commitment to minimize environmental impacts and -to- Without the preservation of the natural environment, neither social nor economic sustainability is possible. A necessary pre-requisite in the journey to sustainability is to create and implement good industrial policy. Cleaner and more sustainable industries can benefit both workers (and the families and communities that depend on them) and the environment. The economy also benefits as a significant number of decent jobs could be created. Dependency on the extraction or harvesting of natural resources is a common situation in developing countries, notably in small communities and remote areas where there are few other economic opportunities. The social impacts of resource industries are very important: The fate of entire communities may hang from a single industry. While acknowledging that natural resource extraction or harvesting is essential to the economy of many regions, such land uses may compete with traditional, agricultural, recreational, and cultural needs. Indigenous peoples tend to be most dependent on their lands for survival.

For example, misguided agricultural subsidies can encourage the conversion of forest lands to unsustainable forms of agriculture that will, in a few years, leave the region with neither forests nor agriculture. Communities and cultures must be respected when their needs come into conflict with commercial interests. In general, there is nothing that compels investor or management decision-making to take the slightest notice of long-term sustainability issues. The general consensus in most business schools is that they should emphasize short-term gains. Therefore, good national and global governance of the financial markets, including judicious use of instruments such as taxes and subsidies, is one of the 112 prerequisites for sustainability. Globally, a financial transactions tax would not only provide significant funds for sustainable development, but would help stabilize the global economy and discourage predatory speculation, as has been explained by Nobel Laureate James Tobin and others. Governments should continue to value the role for the public sector in resource development; and for crucial resources such as water, the public sector must be preferred because they are essential public goods. Governments also must acknowledge the crucial role that civil society can play in policy decisions. In particular, trade unions have significant capacity to comment on the social dimension of sustainability. They have demonstrated this capacity at all of the World Summits on Sustainable Development, at all of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conferences Of the Parties (COPs), and at many other international and national consultations. While it is fashionable for governments to talk of partnering with business, all of the social partners must be equal participants in the discussions for good decisions to result. An effective process of consensus decision-making facilitated by honest brokers has succeeded in balancing, for example, the land claims of indigenous groups with the need for resource development. Such processes require effort, time, understanding, and above all respect for the peoples affected, including civil society, trade unions, local communities, and in particular disadvantaged populations. Their inclusion may require education, training and funding; but in the end inclusive processes almost always result in better decisions. For more on this subject, including International institutions and instruments, for example, the UN Declaration on Human Rights, ILO Conventions, and the ILO Decent Work Agenda point out how development should take place. The participation of the local communities as workers, partners, operators and owners ensures that some of the benefits of resource exploitation accrue to the inhabitants of the land. Education and training opportunities - sometimes in non-traditional formats - can play an important role. Impact assessments (in the cases in which they are conducted) frequently examine only impacts on the natural environment. Sustainability demands the examination of the complex interaction of environmental, economic, and social impacts. There has been quite a lot of work done on useful indicators for all of the dimensions of sustainability, for example, see the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines. Unfortunately, some indicators, particularly those examining the social dimension, tend to be qualitative rather than quantitative, but this does not make them any less important. The best approach to doing an impact assessment as well as risk assessments is through multi-stakeholder consultations in a facilitated, consensus decision-making process. Risk assessments tend to differ depending upon whether one is doing the assessment or facing the risk. The future for any government of any country depends on decisive action to build a sustainable future. Leaving the problem of sustainable development for our children to deal with cannot be an option, since the window of opportunity to effectively act may close before they get their chance. Yes, we have a responsibility to worry about jobs and the economy, but there are no jobs on a dead planet. 113 Pakistan case study on gas exploration in Kirthar National Park Gul Najam Jamy, UNDP Pakistan Introduction Pakistan is a strategically located country in South Asia with a population of over 177 million.

However, there were some provincial laws related to protection of forests and wildlife. This led to conflict between the oil and gas sector and key stakeholders. Kirthar National Park This case study relates to oil exploration in the Kirthar National Park, which was included in the UN World List on National Parks in 1973. The park is situated in the south-western part of Sindh province, stretching from north-east of Karachi district to Dadu/Larkana districts. The total area of the park is more than 308,000 hectares. The park belongs to International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Category II Protected Area, designated mainly for ecosystem preservation. It is home to several rare and threatened animal species like the Sindh Ibex, Urial sheep and the Chinkara gazelle (***). Exploration in the Kirthar National Park and Pro-environment Protests In July 1997, Government of Pakistan invited a British oil company to search for natural gas believed to be trapped in the porous rock beneath the park. In 1998, two oil companies set up a joint-venture for prospecting in the park. However, after a series of protests by pro-environment groups, led by IUCN Pakistan, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and local advocacy NGOs, the Government ordered a This forced the two companies to suspend the EIA of the park which had already begun. This was the first victory for the environmentalists who were of the opinion that an EIA by the oil companies in 114 IA amounted to being the first step toward exploration. However, they supported a baseline study of the park efforts were made to gather enough scientific data on the ecological status of the park to help determine whether or not there could be any commercial activity within the park. The environmental lobby launched a media campaign in the national press against the project and started collecting signatures in support of its protest. This was in contrast to the stance of the provincial government which considered that the - benefits that would transform the extremely poor area. The scientific debate around the proposed exploration activity and the public protests fi of this activity under the pretext of any extraction being uneconomical, though they did undertake some drilling despite all protests. Conclusion Pakistan may not have an enviable record of public interest groups coming together for a common cause. However, this was an important case, related to the extractive industry, where NGOs, public interest groups, media and common citizens joined hands. The key factors were an exact interpretation of hitherto seldom applied local conservation laws, national environmental law, EIA Guidelines, and public pressure which forced an activity - that could threaten a major eco-system - to be abandoned. Notes (*) See chapter 14 of the Pakistan Economic Survey 2011-12. (**) Oil and gas exploration and extraction has been going on since the early 1950s, but it gained Guidelines for Oil and Gas Sector were also produced in late 1997.

This wild goat is gregarious, and if undisturbed will congregate in fairly large herds. The urial (Ovis orientalis vignei), also known as the arkars or shapo, is a subspecies group of the wild sheep Ovis orientalis.

The impact assessment and stakeholder engagement documentation is available in an electronic library and can be used as reference for social issues management on similar projects. The Sakhalin-2 project started up in the 1990s, producing its first oil in 1999 (**). The project has come under considerable international scrutiny due to the presence of multinational corporations in the t more information is made available to the public and consequently attracted more interest. The project also sought project finance from international financial institutions, notably the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The EBRD provided a loan for Phase I of the project, and then carried out a rigorous due diligence process including an analysis of the environmental and social risks of the investment before ultimately deciding not to provide a loan to Phase II (due to environmental considerations). The Sakhalin-2 project online library includes a range of documents that reveal the extent of the concerns. This documentation includes a social impact assessment (SIA), a resettlement action plan, an -community grievance mechanism. The SIA was completed in 2003, as part of an international-style environmental, social and health impact assessment (ESHIA), as required by the project lenders. The international-style impact assessment is carried out according to international good practice standards (generally these are aligned with the performance standards of the International Finance Corporation), which are often higher than national impact assessment requirements, and generally cover a broader range of topics. An addendum was completed in 2005 to address outstanding concerns of lenders and stakeholders. Since then the implementation of the related management plans has been closely monitored, with reports published online. In 2005 the indigenous peoples and local environmental activists protested against the apparent lack of attention to project impacts on traditional livelihoods. They demanded that Sakhalin Energy complete an ethno-cultural impact assessment, referring to the Akwe: Kon guidelines on cultural impact assessment (produced by the Convention on Biological Diversity)and the Russian form of anthropological expert review of industrial projects, known as etnologicheskaya expertiza (***). With no methodological guidelines in Russian law for the etnologicheskaya expertiza, the Sakhalin-2 project commissioned a review of the existing social impact documentation. This formed the basis of between the company and indigenous representatives (*****). Phase I was from 2006-2010 and Phase II (2011-2015) was approved in 2011. The Sakhalin-2 project has pioneered many approaches. For example, the company-community grievance mechanism was assessed by the Harvard Kennedy School for the UN Special Representative on Business and Human Rights and has informed the development of principles relating to grievance mechanisms (Rees 2011). The Sakhalin-2 project is the first in Russia to apply the principle of free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) to its activities, albeit in a very limited way. During development of Phase II of the SIMDP, the plan itself was developed in collaboration with the indigenous peoples, and the company went through a process of eliciting their approval of the plan before it was finalised (******). The Sakhalin-2 project has also made efforts to train its contractors in social performance management including engagement with communities; identifying and understanding social issues 116 (from labour issues to road safety to indigenous peoples land rights); and social issues reporting. The company provides assistance in preparing a social performance management plan; training on key aspects of social performance, such as the Code of Conduct and social issues reporting; and contractors must have their own community liaison officers or social focal points (Wilson and Kuszewski 2011, pp. 42-43). It is worth noting that Sakhalin-2 is atypical for Russian projects, and there is a lot of other interesting and diverse experience of company engagement with indigenous and local communities, by Russian and foreign companies alike (*******). However, Sakhalin-2 does provide rich learning material and importantly this experience can be seen as very accessible.

Even at the state level, consultation on trade policy and coordination of trade and development goals among different ministries and between ministries and parliament has not been institutionalized in many countries. Multi-stakeholder consultation (**) is embedded into the process of the Human Development Impact Assessment (HDIA) of Trade Policy since the HDIA is not merely an analytical tool; rather, the process of conducting the HDIA is itself a form of capacity development of stakeholders to understand the linkages between trade and human development. I would like to introduce the concept of the HDIA since the tool can be applicable for the assessment of existing or future extractive projects given the fact that the majority of (foreign direct) investment in mining is export-oriented. Human development has two perspectives. One is the formulation of human capabilities, which reflects the combination of functioning being and doing in which one sees as value and has reasons to value. The other is the real opportunity to accomplish what one values by using these acquired capabilities. The HDIA, therefore, needs not only to assess whether people are the beneficiaries of economic growth (led by investment in and exports of mines, in this case) but also whether such trade reform ensures that people have equitable access to human opportunities so that the analyzed through four essential pillars of human development namely, productivity, equality, sustainability, and empowerment. Investors say extraction of natural resources will create jobs and bring large revenues to the country. Healthy people with relevant education and skills can obtain jobs in mines (productivity). But who are likely to benefit most? Do all people have equal access to new job opportunities (equity)? (***) Other aspects of equity and of sustainab
