As part of its efforts to utilize ICT to help it better manage its environment and activities, the Park has developed several software applications that are run over a network connecting the main islands. This project, which is part of the Gal\u00e1pagos Environmental Management Programme, utilizes FOSS and FOSS development tools to develop the applications. FOSS was chosen because the tools and development environment associated with it are versatile, easy to use and maintain, and are available for use without licensing fees. The developed applications increased the ability of the Park to collect, store and retrieve useful, timely and accurate data and information on the key activities of the Park, as well as provide useful information towards the management of land resources. One key innovative feature of the applications is the ability for park wardens to visualize global positioning system (GPS) points on a map of the Archipelago where suspicious fishery activities or illegal tourism visits have taken place. This project has been completed and the FOSS applications and databases are in use throughout the year on a 24-hour basis. They have proven to be very stable as there have not been any maintenance or updates required since the first application was launched in 2004. Background of Organization The Gal\u00e1pagos National Park is in charge of the protection and conservation of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, an archipelago made up of 13 main volcanic islands and many more smaller ones. The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands are a part of the territory of the Republic of Ecuador and they are located in the Pacific Ocean on the Equator, approximately 960 kilometres from continental Ecuador. The Gal\u00e1pagos National Park has its main office on the island of Santa Cruz and three branches on the islands of Isabela, San Cristobal and Floreana. About 250 people work for the Park, with approximately 60 percent of the work being carried out in the protected area outdoors. The Park consists of most of the islands\u2019 land mass (8,000 sq km) as well as the surrounding Marine Reserve which covers an area of 45.000 sq km. The Gal\u00e1pagos National Park is home to one of the most diverse and unusual flora and fauna in the world. Objectives of Project This project is part of the Gal\u00e1pagos Environmental Management Programme of the Ecuador government executed through the Ministry of Environment and funded by the Inter-American Development Bank (Project 1274 OC/EC). The principal objective of this programme is to stop and reverse the environmental degradation process within the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. The programme uses ICT as a tool to facilitate processes and support decisions about environmental management. Under the project, the Park is provided with software applications that are used as tools for the implementation of a fishery registry within the Park, as well as the development of software applications to complement and support environmental management activities within the Park. Managing the Environment Gal\u00e1pagos, Ecuador A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 89 Breaking Barriers The primary target groups of the project are the members of the different units of the Park who are involved with managing the marine resources, tourism activities, legal issues, terrestrial areas protection and monitoring of animals (giant tortoises, land iguanas, and birds).

A WAN connects the main offices in Puerto Ayora \u2013 Santa Cruz Island, and other islands: Isabela, San Cristobal, and Floreana. The applications are accessible using a web browser. Choice of FOSS The principal reasons for implementing a solution based on FOSS development tools and applications are: \u25cf Lower initial cost \u2013 there was no initial investment on software tools such as PHP, MySQL and the special class libraries. They were available for free from the Internet; \u25cf Vendor independence \u2013 no specific vendors are required; \u25cf Information available on the Internet \u2013 a high volume of technical information about FOSS applications is available through websites, forums and communities; and \u25cf Security \u2013 the network administrator can set up security parameters on PHP applications, Apache and MySQL according to the in- house policies. In summary, the Information Technology Unit of the Park selected the FOSS applications as they are versatile, available for use without licensing fees, and easy to use and maintain. Development and Implementation The applications were built based on a three- layer model: \u25cf Presentation layer \u2013 Cascade Style Sheet, JavaScript, PHP layout for generating forms on-the-fly; \u25cf Business layer \u2013 classes and objects for dispatching user requests; and \u25cf Data layer \u2013 classes for connecting to the back-end MySQL database. The development environment was set up quickly. The principal resources invested were time and knowledge. The use of PHP provided quick and easy implementation and the first prototype of the application was presented to the users two months after the project started. Deployment Five software applications and a database for monitoring were built. They are used on a daily basis by the members of the different units of the Park over the WAN that connects the main offices in Santa Cruz Island to the islands of Isabela, San Cristobal, and Floreana. The applications built were: \u25cf The Gal\u00e1pagos Marine Reserve management system; The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 90 \u25cf The Tourism Management system; \u25cf Application for managing extraction of natural resources; \u25cf Legal process database; \u25cf Application for Giant Tortoise Breeding Centres; and \u25cf Monitoring database for visitor\u2019s sites (this is a module of the Tourism Management system that evaluates the status of the sites based on indicators). As a result of the common interface used for all applications, users from a unit were able to utilize applications from another unit without trouble as everything was very familiar to them. Impact With this project, useful, timely and accurate data and information on the key activities of fisheries, tourism, and the management of land resources can be collected and made available to the relevant people. The applications provide support for planning tasks and surveillance within the Gal\u00e1pagos Archipelago. External users from other institutions/bodies have also benefited from the information offered by these applications. The project has resulted in the judicious and efficient use of ICT resources. Although the first application was launched in 2004, there has not been any expenditure needed for maintenance and updates. Lessons Learned The key lessons learned from this project have been: \u25cf Analyse ICT technologies according to users and institutional needs, not according to the technical desires of the developers; \u25cf Avoid looking at the latest and most expensive technology; \u25cf Keep things simple and functional for the software design and programming; \u25cf Define clear and reasonable objectives; \u25cf Always ask the users for feedback and treat them as co-developers; and \u25cf Re-use software modules and components as much as possible. Current Status of Project The project is considered complete with the deployment of the five software applications and the monitoring database. Benefits and Challenges The applications developed brought a 180- degree change within the operation of the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park. The usage of databases for the acquisition and storage of data is one of the most important achievements as it allows data to be stored and accessed efficiently and easily. The time devoted to gather data and prepare reports has been significantly reduced and requests can be satisfied in situ. The applications can be accessed by properly authorized personnel any time of the day and throughout the year. The Gal\u00e1pagos Marine Reserve management system contains an innovative feature that allows park wardens to visualize GPS points. With this feature they are able to mark points and visualize them on a map of the Archipelago where either suspicious fishery activities or illegal tourism visits have taken place The main advantages of using FOSS are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d19e31a-df45-4833-b1c1-5b0d6c3a5d68": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d19e31a-df45-4833-b1c1-5b0d6c3a5d68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Breaking Barriers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c261c49da254f1ec10a3d530a7e8d722ef74d79364aa184bc971141e33f7b6b"}}, "hash": "1c261c49da254f1ec10a3d530a7e8d722ef74d79364aa184bc971141e33f7b6b", "text": "low costs and vendor independence while the main disadvantage is that few libraries are available for usage within PHP for working with graphics and PDF formatted documents. The biggest challenge encountered in the project was the conversion of users\u2019 expectations (from management to operative levels) into a functional software application. A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 91 Breaking Barriers Other Information Other projects and activities related to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands make use of FOSS. These include the Charles Darwin Foundation (an organization dedicated to doing research for Gal\u00e1pagos conservation) and the project that is also a part of the Gal\u00e1pagos Environmental Management Programme \u2013 the Tourism Diving Research Project within the Marine Reserve of Gal\u00e1pagos. Conclusion The Gal\u00e1pagos National Park has successfully utilized FOSS to develop applications to help in the management of the environment of the Archipelago. These FOSS-based applications have resulted in the ability of the Park to collect data and manage information with regard to the activities of fisheries, tourism and the management of land resources and this will provide support for planning tasks and surveillance within the Gal\u00e1pagos Archipelago. The operation of the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park has benefited greatly from the deployment of ICT in general and the FOSS applications in particular. The usage of FOSS to develop the applications has resulted in low development costs and encouraged vendor independence. The five applications developed as well as the FOSS database are in use on a daily basis throughout the year bearing testimony to the robustness of FOSS.

Apart from the objective of providing subject materials for teachers in the preparation of their work, this project also aims to contribute towards increasing the Portuguese content of the Internet as these materials will be published in Portuguese. The application software that provides the environment and facilitates the collaboration and creation of the content is the Ambiente Pedag\u00f3gico Colaborativo (APC) system. This system was developed using FOSS development tools and it is released as FOSS itself. The portal through the APC system, allows the distribution of curriculum content created by public school teachers in Paran\u00e1. The published materials may be worked on collaboratively by registered users of the portal. Through this project, the government of the state of Paran\u00e1 has taken the initiative to develop information system solutions suited to its needs and making them available to other teaching institutions, both public and private. The usage of FOSS in the project has enabled it to be deployed at low costs and the software solution can be made available for free to other interested states and governments. A culture of collaboration and sharing had to be established first among the teachers before the project could take off, and for this to happen the teachers themselves had to be convinced of the importance of the project. The teachers had to be trained in areas of basic computing as well as understand the pedagogical concept of the system. Currently, the project has resulted in the publication of over 300 course materials covering both primary and secondary education by the public school staff. The Ministry of Education is considering implementing the APC system as a public education policy in Brazil and the Venezuelan government has shown interest in introducing this system into their public education system. Background of Organization This project was carried out by the Education Secretariat of the state of Paran\u00e1, Brazil, as part of its responsibility to ensure universal access to education and to offer complete basic education to its population. The Secretariat is entrusted with raising the level of performance in schools and encouraging improvement among the teaching, technical and administrative staff in the education sector. It is also the Secretariat\u2019s responsibility to guide, control and monitor the performance of pre- school, primary and secondary teaching establishments, both regular and supplementary, and special education in the public and private sectors.

The portal offers teachers a reliable, free and Enabling Public Schools Paran\u00e1, Brazil A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 93 Breaking Barriers effective environment to interact and work together thereby encouraging them to collaborate on content production. In this way their knowledge and experience can be passed on to educators and other users of the system. The project has its own identity that is a result of the collective work of the local teachers at various levels and can be viewed as part of the social benefits of ICT to the country. As the portal is in Portuguese, it also contributes to the Portuguese content of the Internet. The main target groups of the project are the teaching staff in basic education in public and private schools all over Brazil and in Portuguese-speaking countries. The main partners in the project are the government of the state of Paran\u00e1, the Companhia Paranaense de Inform\u00e1tica (CELEPAR \u2013 the Paran\u00e1 Computing Company) and UNDP. FOSS Application Description The interactive education portal is designed to provide information and content collaboration and sharing to the educators and the community. It is designed such that it enables the user to explore resources that are of interest to him or her and contribute new information at any time. Basic FOSS software used in the development of the portal include the Apache web server, PHP web scripting language, PostgreSQL database, OpenOffice.org office application suite and Firefox web browser. The application software that provides the environment and facilitates the collaboration and creation of the content is the APC system. This has three main modules: \u25cf Publications/Collaboration \u2013 interactive system between users (teachers) to collaborate on content production; \u25cf Validation/Correction of Language \u2013 interactive system between teachers validating and correcting content to ensure the quality of content being made available; and \u25cf Administration \u2013 administration system for system managers including sending out reports, updating tables, authorizing users, etc. The APC system is distributed as FOSS and is licensed under the LPG-AP (Licen\u00e7a P\u00fablica Geral da Administra\u00e7\u00e3o P\u00fablica \u2013 General Public Licence for Public Administration).33 Choice of FOSS The choice of FOSS is based on reasons of cost and quality. The usage of commercial proprietary software will incur high licensing costs. Another important factor in using FOSS is that it will be possible for the owners/ developers of the project to have complete knowledge and understanding of the software used as the source code is available. Development and Implementation The portal application is recommended to run on a GNU/Linux platform with Apache, PHP and PostgreSQL. To access the portal, the user only needs a web browser and Internet connection. Even with low-speed connections, the portal may be accessed satisfactorily. Several other states/municipalities have started to implement this system, thereby increasing collaboration on content production and helping to increase the share of Portuguese language content on the Internet. 33 A free software license based on the FOSS license, GPLv2, created by the government of Paran\u00e1. The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 94 The developers and implementers of the software have found that by using FOSS they can count on a huge community to help them solve problems that may appear and that the support response time from the FOSS community is faster than that from the commercial companies. There has been a significant increase in productivity in developing the solution using free technologies. One of the advantages is the ability to re-use other free solutions found within the community. The developers are able to re-use codes from other applications in different parts of the world, a situation that has led to the creation of a network of technical cooperation to find solutions and to share knowledge generally. Deployment The usage of FOSS in the project has enabled the project to be deployed at low costs and the software solution can be made available for free to other interested parties. The staff of public schools has participated in the publication of materials and this has resulted in the widespread distribution of curriculum content created by these public school teachers in Paran\u00e1. Before publication, to ensure the quality of the information published, these materials are checked by a team of teacher-guides. After publication, these materials may be worked on collaboratively by any user registered with the Day-to-Day Education portal. These registered users can add on to the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae50af05-768f-498c-93f9-2789e7b0a708": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae50af05-768f-498c-93f9-2789e7b0a708", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Breaking Barriers", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/breaking-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71ae2703ed4342ca733c86ef045bf890c87ec05430888596043388789c9ef016"}}, "hash": "71ae2703ed4342ca733c86ef045bf890c87ec05430888596043388789c9ef016", "text": "information published on the APC system. This has generated much technical cooperation between different public and private institutions. Impact The system allows teachers in public schools to produce content from within their schools. This content is based on knowledge that teachers have created and gathered from their classroom experience. This initiative aims to encourage the publication of more web pages in Portuguese and Spanish languages. By means of this initiative, the government of the state of Paran\u00e1 has become a provider of information systems in the area of education. The state has also become a developer of solutions fitted to its needs and made available to other teaching institutions, both public and private. The system aims to arm educators with information about the content of the various subject areas and other resources that help in their teaching tasks, making it an official repository of curriculum content. In this way it has an impact on the education community as it can play the role of a communication vehicle in which the value of the intellectual production of public school teachers is recognized and it can offer services relevant to all those working in basic education, thereby encouraging the creation of virtual learning communities and stimulating continuing education. Lessons Learned To develop the initial content for the Day-to- Day Education portal, training was given to 1,257 teachers working in the 17 subject areas of basic education and representing the 32 Regional Educational Nuclei. From this exercise, it was found that it was a mistake to: \u25cf Provide temporary contracts to ICT university teachers to validate content; \u25cf Have prior definition of content to be developed; and \u25cf Certify teachers for starting production of the content but not for publishing it. From this initial exercise, it was also found that the content validation process should be an activity within the functions of basic education teachers because it requires both A Compilation of Case Studies from Across the World 95 Breaking Barriers domain knowledge as well as experience in the classroom. Another important point learned was to allow teachers to define the content on which they would work rather decide for them beforehand. Current Status of Project The APC system has published over 300 course materials for collaborative learning, all drawn up by teachers in public basic education schools in Paran\u00e1. Of the over 22,200 registered users, some 16,000 are public school teachers. The content in the system can be used by teachers in public and private schools throughout Brazil to prepare their lessons. It is hoped that if the system can be spread to other states in the country, a large collaborative network of knowledge related to basic education can be created. Discussions are under way with the Brazilian Ministry of Education on implementing the APC system as a public education policy. An offline version of the system has been launched. This version is meant to serve users with slow dial-up connections or without Internet access. Benefits and Challenges The general benefits experienced in using FOSS in this project include the opportunity to engage in cooperative development, independence from suppliers, low cost, security, portability and the good support provided by the FOSS community. High training cost was cited for this project but it was also noted that this cost would probably be the same or higher if proprietary software was utilized instead of FOSS. The biggest challenge for this project was to develop the culture of collaboration among the teachers. For this to happen, the teachers themselves had to be convinced of the importance of the project i.e. to build a database of curriculum content by collaboratively working together. Another challenge was the training of teachers within the public basic education system of Paran\u00e1. This training involves mastering knowledge of basic computing as well as understanding the pedagogical concept of the system. The State Secretariat of Education\u2019s policy is to distribute the content material without charge to the other states of Brazil. Discussions are under way on how to integrate the different databases so as to enable users to find specific curriculum content. Making the computers available to teachers at their schools presents a significant challenge. This was addressed by the Paran\u00e1 Digital Project, described below. The Paran\u00e1 Digital Project School teachers had access to the APC system through Paran\u00e1 Digital (PRD), a project that consisted of the installation of 40,000 working terminals placed in academic laboratories spread all over Paran\u00e1 state, together with remote management to grant quality services and security.

This ability to make available, manage and maintain the computer laboratory systems is the greatest difference when the PRD project (which makes the access to the APC environment possible) is compared to other similar initiatives. It is important to note that it is the appropriate combination of the two projects (education portal and PRD) that leads to the high quality of the final product (content and infrastructure). The Potential of Free and Open Source Software for Sustainable Human Development 96 Other Information The system has been demonstrated to the Ministers of Education and Science and Technology of Venezuela, who have expressed interest in introducing it into their public education system. Free distribution of the source code of the APC system, including the databases and specifications, will be given to all governments who show interest in this project. Conclusion The project has shown that with the proper tools, training and environment it is possible to get teachers and educators to interact and collaborate to produce useful course content. The published materials can be used by teachers in schools throughout Brazil to prepare their lessons and it is important that these materials are available for all to share and make use of. This will further add on to the pool of materials available so that teachers in other states or countries can build on this. The Paran\u00e1 Digital project, which provided the necessary infrastructure for the APC initiative, is innovative because it is the first of its kind to attend to such a large number of schools and to maintain the operation of its systems by remote management. This project clearly shows the importance of adopting certain strategies, among which are effective remote laboratory management, good local access infrastructure and use of a multi-terminal model. The Paran\u00e1 Digital project is strategic because not only has it accomplished its initial goal of providing the teachers access to the education portal, it also demonstrates the feasibility of providing continuous services and the development of products. The use of FOSS for software development, and the release of the APC system and the PRD tools under a FOSS license, is very appropriate as it will facilitate sharing and make it affordable for other groups to implement the solution.

To address this, UNDP\u2019s Regional Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Programme (RIPP) conducted analytical studies on indigenous natural resource management systems and their interface with national laws and policies in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Malaysia and Th ailand. Consultations carried out with indigenous communities, governments, NGOs and academics have enriched and informed the studies and enabled the inclusion of a wide range of perspectives. Th e regional synthesis paper draws on the country assessments to identify gaps in policy and practice, and compiles key recommendations for further work on this issue. Th e series provided substantive input at the 8th Conference of the Parties (COP8) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in Curitiba, Brazil in March 2006. Th ey also inspired the Regional Dialogue between government and indigenous representatives on Natural Resource Management in November 2007 in Chiang Mai, Th ailand. Th rough these processes, UNDP-RIPP aims to strengthen regional cooperation and dialogue to assist indigenous peoples and governments in adopting more inclusive and participatory approaches to natural resource management. Several individuals, organizations and bodies have played a key role in realizing this Natural Resource Management series. We acknowledge and are grateful for the support provided by the UNDP Country O\ufb03 ces involved, particularly in Bangladesh and Cambodia, and for the generous sharing of information, knowledge and experiences by indigenous communities and governments. We would like to express our appreciation to PACOS Trust and COAC, Malaysia; IMPECT, Th ailand; ICSO and NGO Forum, Cambodia; and Taungya, Bangladesh for their cooperation in this endeavour. iv PREFACE v Special thanks also goes to all the NRM teams who have made the country studies possible and enabled wide consultations among communities and governments, and to Helen Leake for editing the reports. AIPP is both an organization and network of indigenous peoples groups in Asia, with a secretariat based in Chiang Mai, Th ailand. It has several activities to advocate for indigenous resource management including coordinating participation of indigenous representatives in international fora such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues; active engagement by indigenous peoples with national governments; and promotion on indigenous systems.

In the country studies, there are various terms used to refer to indigenous peoples. For example, in Th ailand the term used is \u201cindigenous hill peoples\u201d, while in Malaysia they are referred to as \u201cindigenous peoples\u201d generally and \u201cOrang Asli\u201d speci\ufb01 cally for the indigenous groups in Peninsular Malaysia. With the exception of Bangladesh, each country study dedicates a chapter to explain the term(s) used in each country and brief backgrounds and histories of the indigenous peoples. In this synthesis paper, the term \u201cindigenous peoples\u201d is used. 2. Indigenous Peoples and Natural Resource Management 2.1 Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Status With the exception of Malaysia, a common feature mentioned in all studies is the non- recognition by the state of indigenous peoples as distinct groups with their own distinct systems. Nevertheless, this does not indicate the absence of a concept of \u201cindigenous peoples\u201d, and the constitutions and laws of some of the countries do refer to, or have special provisions for, indigenous peoples. 3 Chewong in their forest hamlet, Krau, Pahang Photo: Colin Nicholas 4 Bridging The Gap Table1: References to indigenous peoples in Constitutions and relevant laws References in the Constitution References in various Laws Cambodia No special provisions Land Law 2001 (indigenous communities) Forestry Law of 2002 (local communities) Malaysia \u201cNatives\u201d of Sabah and Sarawak \u201cOrang Asli\u201d of Peninsular Malaysia Various laws in Sabah, including: Land Ordinance 1930; Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Enactment 2003; Forest Enactment 1968 (\u201cNatives\u201d or \u201cAnak Negeri\u201d); Aboriginal Peoples Act 1954 (\u201cAborigine\u201d or \u201cOrang Asli\u201d) Thailand \u201cOriginal\u201d or \u201clocal\u201d communities \u201cThailand National Forest Policy 1985 (\u201cHill Tribe Minorities\u201d) Bangladesh \u201cBackward Section of Citizens\u201d includes indigenous peoples HADC Act 1989 (\u201ctribe\u201d or \u201ctribal\u201d); Act 12 of 1995 (\u201cPrimitive Hill Dwellers\u201d) A common feature in all of the countries studied, even where the status of indigenous peoples is recognized, is the experience of discrimination and exclusion by indigenous peoples in regards to land ownership and natural resource management. Even when there is historical evidence showing indigenous peoples are rights-holders of particular resources, governments have still ignored these and continued to alienate land to companies and government agencies, and to resettle outsiders on indigenous peoples\u2019 lands. In a landmark court case brought by the Orang Asli in Peninsular Malaysia, the judges decided that the government had failed in its \ufb01 duciary duties to the Orang Asli. In Th ailand, the enforcement of the Citizenship Act and the fact that most indigenous people could not speak Th ai at the time of the nationality surveys made it di\ufb03 cult to prove their origin even if they had been living in Th ailand for hundreds of years. In Bangladesh, the government\u2019s population transfer programme of the 1980s into plain lands and gently sloping lands, already occupied and owned by indigenous peoples on the basis of formal private titles or customary law, resulted in violent land-grabbing in which state security forces have been directly implicated. As a result, large numbers of indigenous peoples were forced to seek shelter in the remoter hill and forest areas, putting pressure on existing inhabitants of those areas and depleting the available resources. 5 Regional Synthesis 2.2 Indigenous Resource Management Systems Th e studies note that natural resources of indigenous peoples include land, forest, agricultural areas, and rivers and coastal areas, in which land is central and often understood to encompass all natural resources collectively. Traditional communities have a close relationship to land and resources and see themselves as part of the whole ecosystem. Natural resources are signi\ufb01 cant not only as a means of production, but also as part of indigenous peoples\u2019 spiritual and cultural traditions, central to their identity as peoples. Indigenous knowledge, innovations and practices on natural resource management are little understood by outsiders yet are highly complex systems, closely interlinked with other indigenous systems. Th ey incorporate a keen awareness of the environment, an appreciation for conservation and continuity, encourage sustainable innovation, and place the long-term well-being of the community as the focus of all activities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff6aa631-9cf4-48f1-9481-6da05aff98ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff6aa631-9cf4-48f1-9481-6da05aff98ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "111eedadbe4419fdb4f2f4b15ec86c77ac22e242b85f7d46180969911012bb7f"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb351ca7-c5d5-406e-8504-b2ac0601b4f5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2aa808e25f88f6a0ac823063c935637a81bb1f0c02a5f2d79166503959f89c0"}}, "hash": "5253e9cde515a1fdbf12214f9713074450c55fc080b11992ac69ad9c8592026d", "text": "Natural resource management involves both the physical and spiritual realms and is easily embraced by every indigenous person in their daily activities, such that it has become a way of life for the community.

Natural resource management laws in Bangladesh and Malaysia appear to have common provisions and underlying concepts, perhaps derived from the laws of colonial Britain. For example, forest laws and policies tend to reject community management of forests in favor of management through government bodies \u2014 usually, the Forest Department \u2014 which integrates policing and administrative functions. Land laws incorporate customary laws but these are limited and often have inaccurate concepts of land ownership and management, undermining the limited recognition provided. 3.1 Institutional Framework on Natural Resource Management Management of natural resources in the four countries studied is administered by the following: i. Government Departments or Agencies Natural resources are compartmentalized and placed under the jurisdiction of speci\ufb01 c government departments. Malaysia, as a federation of 13 states, has placed land and forest matters under state control. Th e Federal Constitution accords them substantial powers over land use and natural resource management. Also, as every state is independent under the constitution, federal legislation in most cases is not binding on the states, so the government departments managing natural resources are directly under the purview of state law. In the other countries, these departments are centralized and under the direct control of the central government. ii. District/Provincial Council/Body and Sub-District Council/Body Th e implementation and monitoring of natural resource management laws is decentralized to councils/bodies at the district or provincial level, and subsequently to the sub-district 9 Regional Synthesis Box 1 \u2013 Tambon (Sub-District) Administration In Th ailand, the Constitution of 1997 heralded a signi\ufb01 cant benchmark towards a more inclusive participatory approach. Moreover, the Tambon Council, Tambon Authority Act and Decentralization Act\u2014if implemented e\ufb00 ectively and sincerely\u2014have the potential not only to overhaul the bureaucratic set-up of natural resource management, but also the whole administrative structure. In Tambons, such as the Ban Luang Tambon Administrative Organisation, where there is a strong representation of indigenous communities, there are already signs of the local administration being more receptive to resource management initiatives of indigenous peoples. Although community forests do not have a legal basis, authorities have informally started recognizing them, indicating a more open interpretation of laws. Note, at the time of publication the Constitution of 1997 had been overturned by the coup of 2006, with a new constitution in the process of being drafted. It is not clear which provisions for local participation will be retained in the new constitution. level. For the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) in Bangladesh, the Hill District Council is rather pluralistic in that it includes traditional, bureaucratic and elected regional authorities with separate, and sometimes concurrent, responsibilities. It is at the district or sub-district level that indigenous peoples are more likely to in\ufb02 uence decisions on natural resources. 3.2 Summary of Laws and Policies on Natural Resource Management Th e laws and policies on natural resource management identi\ufb01 ed in the country studies are summarized in Table 3, with a brief outline of the gaps in the provisions that relate to indigenous peoples. Gaps not related to the implementation of the laws and policies are outlined later in this chapter. \u2022 Inter-Departmental Coordination As a way to manage natural resources, all the countries involved in the study have compartmentalized natural resources, with laws governing the use and management of 10 Bridging The Gap Box 2 \u2013 Sabah Wildlife and Sabah Foundation Th e Sabah Wildlife Department Pilot Project (See pages 210 -211) highlights inter-departmental coordination as one of the major constraints in making sustainable resource management in collaboration with local communities successful. It also highlights the hurdle for communities in exercising their rights to participate in natural resource management as stipulated in various enactments and policies such as the Forest Enactment and the Sustainable Forest Management System. In this case the Sabah Foundation, which was granted a 100-year term to manage a forest area sustainably, is not willing to recognize the Community Hunting Area identi\ufb01 ed by the Murut community in Inarad. Th e Sabah Foundation plans to allow logging at this site. Community Hunting Areas are recognised under the Sabah Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997. Th ere is ongoing dialogue between the Sabah Wildlife Department, communities and relevant government agencies to make Sabah Foundation comply with their obligations under the Sustainable Forest Management System, and for them to recognize the importance of involving local communities in natural resource management. these resources. While this may provide focus for the speci\ufb01 c department or unit charged with a certain resource, it could also prove to be a setback.

In Th ailand, for example, Article 46 of the Constitution states that: \u201cIndividuals who form traditional, local communities have rights to preserve and revive their customs, local knowledge, arts or culture at the local and national levels; and to participate in the more balanced and sustainable management, maintenance, and utilization of natural resources and the environment. Th is must be in accordance with the enacted law.\u201d Yet Th ailand\u2019s laws on natural resource management do not provide for indigenous peoples to participate e\ufb00 ectively in natural resource management; nor are there provisions 11 Regional Synthesis which respect indigenous peoples\u2019 culture, particularly culture related to natural resource management. As a further example, in Malaysia, the judge in a landmark case brought by the Orang Asli (Sagong Tasi v Kerajaan Negeri Selangor) ruled that relevant portions of the Aboriginal Peoples Act 1954 \u201chad to be brought into conformity with the Constitution\u201d. \u2022 Negative Perceptions on Indigenous Peoples Th e Bangladesh study notes that historically, indigenous peoples have been systematically denied access to lands that were required by the empires, kingdoms or colonizers. Th e legacies of these past policies have continued in di\ufb00 erent forms up to the present day, particularly with regard to lands categorized as \u201cforests\u201d or required for state forestry. In Th ailand, indigenous peoples were initially excluded from getting titles over land on the basis that they were not Th ai citizens when the Land Code came into being. More recently, exclusion from ownership rights has been based on the watershed classi\ufb01 cation that designates most highland areas as o\ufb00 limits for any human activity. In Cambodia, challenges in developing partnerships and mutual learning are enormous as this goes against the history of relationships between indigenous peoples and outsiders. For indigenous groups, particularly in Northeast Cambodia, the slave trade, which continued over such a long period and with such intensity, was cultural rape. Th e disharmony continued with the relocation of Brao and Kavet people to lowland villages adjacent to the Sekong and Se San Rivers in the early 1960s, in order to \u201ceducate\u201d and \u201cKhmerise\u201d them; then with the draconian policies of the Khmer Rouge to make wet rice paddy rice cultivators out of swidden agriculture farmers; and \ufb01 nally, with the policies of the Cambodian government to keep the people in the lowlands. Box 3: Th ailand National Forestry Policy 1985 Th ailand\u2019s National Forestry Policy (TNFP) contains discriminatory attitudes towards indigenous peoples. Th is is most evident in the key aims of the Policy: \u201cto formulate guidelines to deal with forest degradation problems e.g. shifting agriculture, forest \ufb01 res, forest clearing by the hill tribe minorities etc; incentive for reforestation by the private sector; and rural settlement planning to conform with national natural resources management and conservation plans\u201d (emphasis added). 12 Bridging The Gap \u2022 Poor Implementation of Laws More progressive natural resource management laws have emerged in the last few years in Sabah, Malaysia, and Cambodia, while the fate of the Community Forestry Bill in Th ailand remains unclear. However, for other laws which have been in existence for quite a while, the common complaint has been the poor implementation of laws that support the rights of indigenous peoples. In Bangladesh, for example, the study found that most of the land reform laws have hardly been implemented due in large part to structural prejudices deeply ingrained in the society, and re\ufb02 ected through all sorts of bad governance, vested interests, existing power structures and corruption, among other factors. \u2022 Contentions over Sub-surface Resources Although not discussed in the country reports, contention over sub-surface resources found in indigenous territories continues to be an issue.

Interface between Indigenous & State Processes in Natural Resource Management 4.1 Indigenous Peoples and State Legal and Policy Framework on Natural Resource Management \u2022 State Natural Resource Management Framework With the exception of Th ailand, legal provisions recognizing the ownership rights of indigenous peoples over their natural resources do exist, and there are many instances where customary processes are incorporated into national and state laws. However, attempts to incorporate customary processes into legal provisions have shown a sad lack of understanding by government sta\ufb00 . In law enforcement, it has also become apparent that there is a stark di\ufb00 erence between indigenous and non-indigenous insights. Th e study in Sabah, Malaysia notes the attempt to incorporate indigenous peoples\u2019 customary law on land ownership into section 15 of the Native Customary Rights (NCR) Land of the Sabah Land Ordinance 1930. Th e attempt shows a lack of understanding of indigenous peoples\u2019 concept of land and natural resource management, and has resulted in misrepresentation of customary law. Th is has in turn resulted in gaps within the process of land delineation. Experiences in the titling of indigenous peoples\u2019 lands have also shown that the failure of the authorities to recognize indigenous resource management such as fallow periods in swidden agriculture cycle has delegitimized customary land ownership. In all country studies, it was found that use rights in many cases may be granted but the right is not consistent and is often complicated by gaps in the law. Communities candidly refer to this as the \u201cclose one eye\u201d policy, indicating the fact that it is not an o\ufb03 cial policy of the government.

In Th ailand, indigenous peoples\u2019 rights over natural resources have a long way to go. \u2022 Traditional Administrative System Recognition by the Cambodian Land Law 2001 of traditional indigenous authority and customary law as a legal process in the determination of legal claims is very important. However, with the introduction of the commune councils and the Commune Council Law, coupled with tendencies by most governments to recognize leaders who are literate or support regulations that are in line with state laws and policies, it can be very easy to replace traditional authorities and customary laws. If this happens, it would pave the way for illegal land acquisition, land concentration and over-exploitation of resources that 25 Regional Synthesis Illustration 4 : Land Tenure and Use Rights in Th ailand Much of the insecurity over land tenure, and the consequent impact this has on natural resource management, is centered on the manner in which the government has approached and viewed natural resources as the legitimate domain and subject of state policy-making, without considering other rights holders. Th e Th ai government has been extremely inconsistent vis-\u00e0-vis its policies for natural resource management. Policies have been modi\ufb01 ed or changed radically to suit economic or political interests, especially when such policies intersect with indigenous peoples. For instance, while laws and policies on National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries do not allow settlements or use of resources within their borders\u2014which has resulted in relocation of indigenous peoples\u2014tourism is widely promoted and infrastructure and private construction for tourism allowed. Use-rights of resources within national reserve areas and wildlife sanctuaries are ambiguous, and give authorities vast leverage to use the law at their convenience. Only when there is a strong collective community initiative are indigenous communities able to negotiate use rights with the local authorities. could result in serious con\ufb02 icts within the community and with authorities. In Bangladesh, areas outside the reserved forests (\u201cmauza-circle\u201d lands) are administered by \u201ccircle chiefs\u201d or rajas, and below them, the mauza headmen (mauza chiefs or heads). Th e headmen are responsible for resource management, land and revenue administration, maintenance of law and order, and administration of \u201ctribal\u201d justice. \u2022 Con\ufb02 ict in Development Paradigms As far as the state is concerned, natural resources seem to be mainly for acquisition and exploitation for infrastructure development and other expenditures of the state. Th ere is no regard for indigenous peoples\u2019 own concepts of development, which are often considered unproductive, and therefore indigenous peoples\u2019 customary use of natural resources is not encouraged or developed. Policies on large-scale development through exploitation of natural resource management have resulted in either social exclusion or discrimination against indigenous peoples, or loss of culture and way of life. Th e majority of indigenous peoples still live in rural areas, but increasingly they are migrating \u2013 either temporarily or permanently \u2013 to urban areas as livelihoods deteriorate due to natural resource exploitation and insecure land tenure. 26 Bridging The Gap Indigenous peoples are increasingly joining, or being forced to accept, mainstream development and commercialization. Th is poses a challenge to natural resource management especially in and around sensitive areas. Parks and other protected areas have also become important factors that have led to unresolved con\ufb02 icts between the state and indigenous communities, due to loss of access to or restricted use of resources within these areas. In Th ailand, the study concluded that laws drafted before the last decade expressly exclude the utilization of resources within national forest reserves and other protected areas. Th ey criminalize the activities of indigenous communities which they have traditionally carried out for their sustenance. Although there are thousands of communities managing and protecting their local forests successfully, their activities are deemed illegal. Current laws and regulations prioritize the private sector and/or state activities in these lands. In Bangladesh and Cambodia, partnerships between government and foreign companies to exploit mineral and gas resources in indigenous lands occur without obtaining the free, prior and informed consent of a\ufb00 ected communities, and raises serious questions about environment destruction and threats to people\u2019s health.. 4.2 Harnessing Indigenous Natural Resource Management - Incorporation vs Recognition of Customary Law and Processes Th e Bangladesh and Malaysia country studies note that recognition of indigenous resource management combines aspects of the traditional management system with state/ national laws. However, such a strategy may not necessarily capture indigenous resource management concepts adequately. It also does not recognise customary law per se. In Cambodia, while the Land Law 2001", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4107db62-b62b-4465-9419-fd3f1fec227e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4107db62-b62b-4465-9419-fd3f1fec227e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26ea0e9b4ca82691b00507c64c7311b6d987f37a933f73025450c7586d9ec1a1"}}, "hash": "26ea0e9b4ca82691b00507c64c7311b6d987f37a933f73025450c7586d9ec1a1", "text": "recognises customary law, it remains unclear how this will be put into practice. Since customary law in general, and on natural resource management in particular, is not well-understood or documented, there is often a fear of recognizing it on the part of government. Unfortunately, past e\ufb00 orts by governments to recognize customary law has often meant codi\ufb01 cation, which goes against the diverse customary laws of communities. Th e other weakness is the tendency to form committees to manage resources, taking away the control that was traditionally held by the community. Although such committees may in fact allow more participation, particularly from women and youth, it nevertheless means that already weakened traditional structures are further sidelined. In the long run, it will further dis-empower indigenous communities in their aspirations for self-determination and a pluralistic society. Perhaps rather than adapting indigenous institutions to a rigid 27 Regional Synthesis structure with codi\ufb01 ed rules and regulations, statutory provisions should be \ufb02 exible enough to accommodate the malleable nature of indigenous institutions. 4.3 Engaging Institutions - Cooperation between Donors, Government, NGOs and Community Organisations Th e studies show varying experiences and degrees of success in engaging institutions in the di\ufb00 erent countries. Generally, NGOs that have good relations with government have facilitated engagement between communities and the relevant government departments, while the capacity of communities to engage directly with governments and donors is growing. Th e most positive example is the case of Sabah, Malaysia, where indigenous organizations have been able to directly contribute to the implementation of laws or introduction of new laws through close cooperation between donors, government, NGOs and the media. In Cambodia, donors and NGOs have been especially crucial in supporting indigenous peoples not only to link with government but also in the process of building community organizations, since indigenous peoples are still unable to e\ufb00 ectively engage with government, local and international NGOs and UN agencies alone. Due to the unique political history of Cambodia over the past two decades, donors and UN agencies have played a very important role in shaping the laws and policies on natural resource management in that country. Chewong harvesting the oily perah fruit, Teris River, Pahang Photo: Colin Nicholas 28 Bridging The Gap NGOs in Th ailand have been instrumental in positively or negatively shaping policies on natural resource management, depending on their perspective as illustrated in the development of \u201cLight Green\u201d and \u201cDark Green\u201d NGOs (see chapter 6). Donors have been instrumental in in\ufb02 uencing the government to undertake programs and projects for highland development, with most projects having a strong component focus on a decentralized natural resource management model that seeks to ensure livelihood and socio-economic needs of a\ufb00 ected groups. Community organizations have been active in negotiating with di\ufb00 erent players within the natural resource management setting in developing a people-centric approach to natural resource management. Th ey have been able to create cultural spaces to express indigenous traditional knowledge, concepts, and beliefs in the use and management of natural resources. Most importantly, they have been able to put into place self-governing rules on natural resource management within communities. In the CHT, Bangladesh, pro-people NGO interventions are especially pertinent because of the disadvantaged situation of the region\u2019s population with regard to access to social extension services of the government. Organizations working to facilitate the spread of formal education, functional literacy, vocational skills improvement, accelerating women\u2019s access to education and training opportunities, among other initiatives, are still very limited in the CHT. Th e Bangladesh study viewed the strong role NGOs play in natural resource management positively but stresses the importance of maintaining the requisite balance between inaction and overly active interventions that weaken local self-dependent e\ufb00 orts. However, national NGOs\u2014as in the case of government agencies\u2014need to be sensitized prior to starting operations in indigenous-inhabited areas. 4.4 Mechanisms and Issues on Participation of Indigenous Peoples in Natural Resource Management In many instances, talk of indigenous participation pays mere-lip service to the concept to pacify communities, with input on natural resource management often ignored. Participation processes through institutional reforms and capacity-raising initiatives noted in the Bangladesh study are similar to the processes in other countries. Th e process often \ufb01 rst involves the representation of indigenous peoples\u2014both men and women\u2014in decision-making, policy reviews and reforms, and in legal and programme implementation. An adaptive approach is then taken to incorporate the positive aspects of indigenous knowledge systems related to natural resource management. Another important mechanism is information dissemination, which has to address 29 Regional Synthesis language and cultural barriers. A major challenge is encouraging government sta\ufb00 to spend more", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ea86df4-7aa7-4737-9003-c2977b4033aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ea86df4-7aa7-4737-9003-c2977b4033aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f54fdc7ccfc176f79f9912eb8863261259c75d4f520c9ad2da45ed13d536bb2e"}}, "hash": "f54fdc7ccfc176f79f9912eb8863261259c75d4f520c9ad2da45ed13d536bb2e", "text": "time in villages, to learn from local people and increase interactions with key elders in the communities. Submission of written comments on natural resource management by communities is yet another mechanism for participation. Participation would of course be enriched if decision-making occurred with the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples throughout the process. 5. Gender and Natural Resource Management In most countries, and particularly in Bangladesh, laws and constitutions prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, although this is not re\ufb02 ected in governments\u2019 natural resource management policies. Women\u2019s primary responsibilities, such as cooking, fetching water and gathering \ufb01 rewood, are directly related to the use and management of natural resources. Although generally women are part of the work allocation and labor responsibilities in cultivation, the ability of women in plant and seed conservation and experimentation means they play a crucial role in preserving the diversity of traditional medicines and food sources and natural resource management in general. Women su\ufb00 er numerous hardships when ecological degradation occurs in forests and other common pool resources, making it di\ufb03 cult for them to go about their traditional activities, such as the preparation of food, medicines and handcrafts. Women also feel more burdened with the responsibility of looking for scarce income-generating alternatives, especially if they are denied access to natural resources for food, water and \ufb01 rewood. Th e degradation of natural forests results not only in the extinction of many plants\u2014 adversely impacting the economic well-being and health of the family and society\u2014but also negatively a\ufb00 ects indigenous women\u2019s knowledge systems. Gender roles within indigenous communities are changing continually as a result of state policies. Th us, it is necessary that any policy formulation on natural resource management takes gender equations into account. Th ere is a need to acknowledge the speci\ufb01 c needs, perspectives, and roles of women in natural resource management. 30 Bridging The Gap Box 5: Indigenous Women in Bangladesh Indigenous women in Bangladesh are traditionally regarded as occupying a lower social standing than men. Th e indigenous women\u2019s status is low in terms of the right to inheritance, legal and political rights, decision-making powers, as well as other spheres. One of the most acute problems faced by indigenous women is the denial of access to customary owned land. Th is is added to the gender-based discrimination faced by them in other ways. Land scarcity among indigenous communities generally a\ufb00 ects women more adversely than indigenous men. Th e inheritance laws of most indigenous peoples, including the most numerous groups such as the Chakma and the Santal, tend to discriminate against women. Th e notable exceptions are the Khasi in greater Sylhet, the Mandi or Garo in the plains, and to a lesser extent the Marma in the southern Chittagong Hill Tracts. Apart from these exceptions, the common trend in indigenous communities is for sons to inherit landed property. Th e denial of indigenous women\u2019s substantive participation in the political spheres further reinforces their low status in society and they remain substantively invisible in the eyes of the policy makers. 6. Challenges and Drawbacks Th e country studies cite very speci\ufb01 c challenges and drawbacks relating to the promotion and recognition of indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and participation in natural resource management. A summary of these challenges and drawbacks is set out below, with a brief explanation on some points. a. Citizenship Rights Denial of citizenship to a high number of indigenous peoples in Th ailand has compounded land tenure insecurity and has directly a\ufb00 ected natural resource management. Possession of citizenship documents is essential to accessing any facilities or services and to prove rights over land and natural resources. b. Donors\u2019 Policy on Indigenous Peoples It is important to ensure that in bilateral aid, donors adhere to their policy on 31 Regional Synthesis indigenous peoples based on accepted international human rights standards, and apply this policy to help raise awareness of the departments being aided. c. Obtaining Free, Prior Informed Consent Su\ufb03 cient time must be set aside to ensure indigenous communities understand the issues at hand and that NGOs working with indigenous peoples are able to provide su\ufb03 cient information for the communities to make informed decisions. Free, prior and informed consent also means that communities have the right to say no to a proposed development initiative. d. Competing Discourse on Natural Resource Management In Th ailand, the con\ufb02 ict in ideological discourse between di\ufb00 erent NGO camps\u2014the Dark Green and Light Green camps\u2014also impacts on indigenous peoples and natural resource management.

Th e opposing discourses are not as simple as a disagreement in approach to natural resource management: it also involves power relations, class equations and social structuring. Th ese need to be taken into account while addressing this challenge. e. Misused/Misinterpreted Community Consultations When hiring consultants, especially those dealing with communities, careful consideration should be given to ensure that the consultant is willing to listen to other perspectives, especially community perspectives. Consultation and meaningful participation are often viewed as interchangeable by governments and donors, yet they are two very di\ufb00 erent processes. Th is needs to be clearly acknowledged, and meaningful participation should be the goal for all communities in an area of in\ufb02 uence of a given development initiative. f. Enhancing Capacity of Indigenous Communities Th e Cambodia study explicitly mentions the need to enhance the capacity of indigenous institutions and other support institutions for indigenous peoples.

It also includes recommendations from the author with the aim of making these recommendations more coherent. 7.1.1 Comprehensive Legal or Policy Review 7.1.1.1 Legal and Policy Review and Reforms Th e studies recommend a comprehensive review of laws and policies regarding lands and other natural resource management. Th ey also identify the reforms needed. Although the research and consultations identi\ufb01 ed the laws and policies that relate to indigenous peoples and pointed out gaps, they could not delve into the necessary level of detail. Th is would have to be conducted in each country in a manner where indigenous peoples and other actors, including human right workers, development planners and social scientists, can contribute e\ufb00 ectively. Legal and policy reforms should then follow a comprehensive review. In any such reforms, the importance of indigenous resource management processes needs to be acknowledged 33 Regional Synthesis as far they are appropriate to the socio-economic and cultural needs of indigenous peoples today. Policy reforms also need to be cautious to incorporate representation on the basis of ethnicity, class and gender. 7.1.1.2 Natural Resource Management Laws and Policies to be brought into conformity with the Constitution Where recognition and protection of indigenous peoples\u2019 rights are provided in the Constitution, the highest authority in any country, natural resource management laws and policies that are contrary should be brought into conformity with the Constitution. 7.1.1.3 Enactment of Laws on Natural Resource Management Where necessary laws on natural resource management do not yet exist, but where the needs are expressed by indigenous peoples, enactment of new laws is needed. Th ese laws should be in line with existing and emerging international instruments that recognise the rights of indigenous peoples. 7.1.1.4 Implementing Policies Th e Bangladesh study provides some clear recommendations on implementation of policies that may be applied to other countries. Recommendations include the development of detailed administrative guidelines, particularly in situations where government o\ufb03 cials lack knowledge on indigenous culture, and where discriminotory attitudes exist among non-indigenous o\ufb03 cials in government positions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd119a14-9115-4282-8df8-1bed272a3328": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd119a14-9115-4282-8df8-1bed272a3328", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39c46351e301c926db7e101e8cf1d27ea65628f09b1e5b6bb7e77e43fc004a8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "bfa95fbd-a3ec-47a1-a628-8669ad88e9c4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7832c3112413692a5bd73c991f4f653dbcbd588ae3f8a93ece7bce7921c91fc8"}}, "hash": "feb1f68d16d510df744b64cdebb16d98434db937332bb1e79bba3da9fc1bd680", "text": "Th ese could include: a.

As illustrated in the Sabah Land Ordinance, however, the interpretation of rightful occupation does not necessarily coincide with indigenous peoples\u2019 concept and customary law on land ownership. Th is also implies the recognition of collective customary resource rights for indigenous peoples to preserve collective identity. Collective customary resource rights would include a community\u2019s access to, and control over, lands and resources, and also ensure participation in, and control over, decision-making. Th e study in Bangladesh, in recommending acknowledgement of customary resource rights, noted that this provision could be far more equitable to indigenous communities\u2014and far more likely to result in successful promotion of state- indigenous forestry\u2014than the over-centralized and bureaucratized system currently practiced by the Forest Department. 35 Regional Synthesis 7.1.2.2 Recognition of Traditional Administration In Cambodia, where traditional authority is recognized in land claims, measures should be taken to ensure they are implemented. In other countries, like Sabah, Malaysia and Bangladesh, even though this is not provided for in the law, it has been conventional practice to involve traditional headmen in validating land claims. Newer village administrative institutions, like the Commune Councils in Cambodia and the JKKK in Malaysia, should not replace the traditional authority. In fact, e\ufb00 orts to assist traditional authorities such as keeping ethnographic records and resource maps should be provided by the state. Traditional authorities can also be given training to help resolve natural resource con\ufb02 icts. 7.1.2.3 Revitalisation of Indigenous Resource Management System Natural resources are viewed by some indigenous communities as individual property rather than collective resources, creating competition that leads to unsustainable resource utilization. Th e challenge of re-establishing communal responsibility, and to revitalize indigenous resource management systems so that resources can be utilised in a sustainable manner for the wellbeing of the community, \ufb01 rst need to be realized. Moreover, e\ufb00 orts towards this end by the communities themselves need to be supported by donors, governments and NGOs. Recognition and revitalisation of traditional governance and administrative systems, and indigenous development concepts will go hand-in-hand with these e\ufb00 orts. In many communities, and at the regional level through regional organisation such as the Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact Foundation, ongoing community re\ufb02 ections and exchanges to revitalise indigenous resource management and an indigenous development concept have already started. 7.1.2.4 Harnessing Indigenous Natural Resource Management If poverty reduction is to be e\ufb00 ective, indigenous peoples\u2019 customary use of natural resources in their territories needs to be harnessed along with conservation strategies. Th e challenge is to use a combination of e\ufb00 ective joint management strategies and recognition of the rights of communities over their resources. Strengthening indigenous management systems is also the best way to reduce tension between state and customary systems, and to create synergy. A management plan that outlines bene\ufb01 ts and responsibilities for both government and indigenous peoples will help ensure indigenous culture is protected, sustainable incomes from 36 Bridging The Gap the natural resources is assured, and wildlife and biodiversity is conserved.

Active engagement with communities themselves in these e\ufb00 orts needs to be taken. 7.1.3 Participation of Indigenous Peoples in Legal and Policy Formulation Participation of indigenous peoples in legal and policy formulation may already be accepted practice, and is often mentioned by policy makers themselves, but perceptions on the process may di\ufb00 er. E\ufb00 ective participation implies not only accepting opinions of indigenous peoples, but also involving them in decision-making throughout the whole process of legal and policy formulation. Th is also implies empowerment of indigenous organizations and communities. 7.1.4 Provisions and Mechanism for Obtaining Consent Free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) was quoted by all of the studies as a prerequisite for sustainable and acceptable natural resource management. As such, legal and policy provisions for FPIC need to be ensured, and the mechanism for obtaining such consent needs to be developed. At the international level, guidelines and principles for FPIC already exist: these can be used to develop such provisions and mechanism. 7.1.5 Removing Discriminatory Attitudes Discrimination against indigenous peoples is noted in all of the studies. Recommendations to eliminate discrimination include acknowledging indigenous peoples\u2019 contributions to the country\u2019s political, social, economic and cultural integrity, as well as its development process. Th is includes acknowledgment in the o\ufb03 cial versions of the national histories and in other national discourses and public information systems; providing exposure 37 Regional Synthesis to indigenous culture, history, life style, etc, especially for government functionaries with major responsibilities for indigenous issues; and to use state-sponsored media and encourage private media to help dispel these attitudes. 7.1.6 Promoting Gender and Equity in Natural Resource Management As pointed out earlier, there is a need to acknowledge the speci\ufb01 c needs, perspectives, and roles of women in natural resource management. Women\u2019s active participation in decision-making, and the equitable sharing of bene\ufb01 ts between men and women is crucial to ensure the long term sustainability of natural resource management. Th e recommendations elaborated in the Bangladesh report are also relevant for the other countries. Bringing about gender equity in natural resource management requires committed support from all actors in all countries\u2014including political, social and community leaders, and local and international NGOs. Due to longstanding gender- insensitive practices ingrained in customary beliefs, religious and social conservatism, etc, this is a matter that requires consistent and urgent attention. Policies that are generally aimed at addressing discrimination faced by non-indigenous women may not be appropriate: it is important to ensure that laws and policies are relevant to preventing discrimination against indigenous women. Other important interventions include addressing the human rights issues of indigenous women who are under-represented in political bodies and local government units; the lack of funds available to mobilize women; and the need to raise awareness about the negatively discriminatory inheritance laws. 7.1.7 Enhancing Capacities of Indigenous Peoples, Traditional Leaders , NGOs Th ere is a crucial need to support indigenous initiatives\u2014such as those aimed at organizing communities or implementing leader training programmes\u2014in which indigenous organizations and traditional leaders engage in their own capacity building exercises. However, where NGOs are willing to assist in building the capacity of indigenous communities, there is a need to provide resources and support in a manner that is sensitive to the communities. Capacity enhancement aimed at building community organizations should also recognise that for such an initiative to be e\ufb00 ective it requires much e\ufb00 ort, resources and long-term partnership. 7.1.8 Research and Information Dissemination 38 Bridging The Gap Th ere are also many institutions that involve government, local and international NGOs and UN agencies in developing tools and models for participatory action on natural resource management. Th ere are several good examples in Cambodia of research conducted with indigenous communities that can be used as models elsewhere in the region. Th e challenge of inaccessibility and remoteness of some indigenous communities needs to be taken into account in the dissemination of information. A further challenge is producing information that is easily understood. In Cambodia, there are many indigenous peoples who have not had access to formal education, thus using creative and adaptable ways to convey information is important. Use of popular media such as radio and audio- visuals are good examples. 7.1.9 Advocacy at National and International Level Where serious con\ufb02 icts over land and natural resource management exist, the studies recommend the development of e\ufb00 ective strategies and tools for advocacy at both the national and international levels.

Strengthening the capacity of both informal institutions (traditional leaders and other community level organizations) and formal institutions on customary laws and practices would enhance advocacy goals. International advocacy should aim to make e\ufb00 ective use of the international inter- governmental processes, including the mechanisms of the UN human rights treaty bodies, the Human Rights Council, and the o\ufb03 ces of Special UN Rapporteurs. In particular, these should refer to international customary laws and international treaties rati\ufb01 ed by governments. Strengthening existing national, regional and international networks, while creating further networks, would further enhance progress in this area. Given the situation of extreme political, social and economic disadvantage su\ufb00 ered by most indigenous peoples, this needs to be an integral strategy perspective for quite some time in the foreseeable future. 39 Regional Synthesis 7.2 Speci\ufb01 c Recommendations Some speci\ufb01 c recommendations made in each country studies are: a. Inter-Ministerial Committee (Malaysia) In Malaysia, a national consultation process recommended the formation of an Inter- Ministerial Committee: a body with su\ufb03 cient authority at the state and national level to review the various policies and laws on natural resource management and indigenous peoples, with the view to streamline such laws and policies to protect indigenous peoples\u2019 rights. Such a Committee would also be expected to identify laws and policies that should be amended, and the obstacles to the implementation of such laws and policies. b. Policy for Highland Peoples\u2019 Development (Cambodia) In Cambodia, the adoption of the Policy for Highland Peoples\u2019 Development was speci\ufb01 cally mentioned. c. Implementation of the CHT Accord of 1997 (Bangladesh) In Bangladesh the CHT Regional Council Act 1998 obliges the government to consult the CHT Regional Council prior to the passage of any new laws on the CHT region. d. Democratization and Decentralization (Th ailand) Democratization and decentralization, with emphasis on indigenous peoples\u2019 participation, are identi\ufb01 ed as key processes in Th ailand. Th e Th ailand study notes that a lack of indigenous participation in natural resource management in the country has stymied most of the policies and laws before they were implemented. Involvement of indigenous peoples as rights holders would therefore ensure a sense of ownership and successful implementation of laws and policies. e. Land Demarcation (Cambodia) Th e lands of indigenous peoples, as a vital part of their lives and cultures, must be clearly demarcated. Some speci\ufb01 c issues on the process in Cambodia are noted in the box below. Cambodia: Considerations on Land Demarcation Th ere are some serious issues in the policy process and sequencing that need to be considered. 1. De\ufb01 nition, identi\ufb01 cation and agreement on what constitutes state public property: this requires a set of subsidiary processes to clarify what can sit within this overall category. 2. De\ufb01 nition and identi\ufb01 cation of lands of indigenous communities. 3. De\ufb01 nition and identi\ufb01 cation of core forest areas that should be retained under a protected area system and areas of high environmental service function (such as watersheds). 4. De\ufb01 nition and identi\ufb01 cation of those areas of forest that could be managed under some form of production. Actual institutional arrangements would need to be determined, but may involve groups such as communities or communes, small-scale \u201cindustrial\u201d forests, concessions, direct management by the public sector, etc. 5. De\ufb01 nition and identi\ufb01 cation of those areas that are available for agriculture. Actual institutional arrangements would need to be determined, but may involve family farms, small scale \u201cindustrial\u201d farms, large-scale concession agriculture, etc.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8903b8d-9b1f-40eb-9fc3-d0417eb6575e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8903b8d-9b1f-40eb-9fc3-d0417eb6575e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d97e5eb3b9f50806d8a8b4963981b8cee732264bc4ba7dfc61ddb6a37f1eedc"}, "2": {"node_id": "e9aab95e-ec15-4a80-92e9-474581344cb1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f303e5359b7c004e5b0e72e0fdeefb3b981c4995a2febf26ea9b83788fb60f09"}}, "hash": "7c7b159545e612818629409aef534d1afb510a9690fd283a367076b6100865ac", "text": "40 Bridging The Gap Bangladesh The Interface of Customary and State Laws in the Chittagong Hill Tracts Sadeka Halim (Ph.D) (Team Leader) Barrister Raja Devasish Roy (Adviser) Advocate Susmita Chakma (Junior Consultant) Sudatta Bikash Tanchangya (Research Associate) Photo: Devasish Roy Bridging The Gap Policies and Practices on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Natural Resource Management in Asia Bangladesh The Interface of Customary and State Laws in the Chittagong Hill Tracts Glossary 45 1.

Introduction 1.1 Context Since the 1860s, when the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) region was annexed to the British province of Bengal, policy makers\u2019 approaches to the region have been marked by a desire to make the natural resources of the region pro\ufb01 table to successive administrations. Bangladesh, with an area of a little more than 130,000 square kilometers, is a small country roughly the size of England, but with a staggering population of 130 million. Th e south-eastern Chittagong Hill Tracts region covers about a tenth of the country but the region\u2019s population accounts for barely 1% of the national population. Th ere are signi\ufb01 cant natural resources in CHT including land, forest, \ufb01 sheries, and water bodies.

Further, the government\u2019s policy to bring thousands of Bengali settlers into the region, with the help of military and other security forces, created (and continues to create) more pressure on the use of natural resources. In 1979, as part of the anti-insurgency measures, the Government of Bangladesh (1979-1985) re-settled between 200,000 and 450,000 Bengali-speaking migrants from various parts of Bangladesh into all three hill districts of the CHT.1 Reportedly, there are still instances of further resettlement through covert government encouragement; however this phenomena requires further investigation. Th is is re\ufb02 ected in the issuing of commercial leases over CHT lands to outsiders in the 1980s and 1990s. One of the e\ufb00 ects of these policies was to heighten the political unrest that began in the early 1970s. Th e CHT Accord of 1997, which brought to an end an insurgency, has attempted to address many of the vital issues of the region including land disputes, devolution of land administration authority to the hill district councils, land grants to landless hill people and cancellation of non-resident leases. However, there has been little or no implementation of the terms of the CHT Accord in the ten years since it was signed. Communications infrastructure in the CHT is rudimentary, and it does not have any industries that can provide alternative employment to agriculture. Th erefore, a 49 Bangladesh very large part of the population of the region is dependent upon its natural resources for their sustenance or secondary and tertiary sources of livelihood. Despite the signi\ufb01 cant negative impacts of past and present policy approaches and decisions, there are also positive developments. Civil society, including local NGO leaders in the CHT, has become increasingly conscious about land rights, resource con\ufb02 ict, and existing standards for the protection of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms. Vocal representatives of civil society and development practitioners have, in various local, national and international fora, demanded larger roles in the development process for indigenous and rural communities and further democratization of the CHT polity to allow more equitable representation for the less numerous indigenous peoples and for women. It is against this context that the report examines the interface between indigenous systems of natural resource management and the formal government laws and policies applicable in the CHT. 1.2 Process Documentation Th e research location is the Chittagong Hill Tracts region in south-eastern Bangladesh, encompassing the three hill districts of Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachari. Th e case study attempts to understand existing patterns of natural resource management (NRM). Th e researchers observe that, in the case of NRM, the major causes of natural resource depletion are policy decisions historically originating from outside the Hill Tracts. Among these are the British colonial policies in the 19th century, and the forest and land policies of the post-colonial nation states of Pakistan and subsequently Bangladesh. Th e term \u2018natural resources\u2019, according to the indigenous respondents in this research, refers to all types of resources that originate in nature, including soils, hills, forests, rivers and other water bodies \u2013 both discovered and latent. Shrubs, herbs and trees grown on lowlands or in the hills, and cattle, animals, insects, reptiles, \ufb01 sh and minerals are all included in the term \u2018natural resources\u2019. In order to secure a livelihood, the indigenous peoples of the Chittagong Hill Tracts have been using and preserving many of these natural resources for hundreds of years. Th e limited availability of natural resources was already approaching crisis proportions by the 1950s, prior to the construction of the Kaptai Dam in 1960 (Sopher, 1963).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "583d70c8-15d8-44bf-a339-f56af456c89b": {"__data__": {"id_": "583d70c8-15d8-44bf-a339-f56af456c89b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e8b7f25c7dc7796be5e17b5aa38b8a1d55b19067dce8473a2f2076015db59281"}, "2": {"node_id": "2086630b-a0f2-42c8-ae28-e59884154683", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32a8edd9e313504265cb7e49e7db72d30696638bedf99cb886755eba12523750"}}, "hash": "3370b899382443a6a7b3df48a8d67396e91f245dc50bb5d0d503ae0f26a339a2", "text": "A direct consequence of the construction of the Kaptai Dam and the Karnaphuli reservoir it created was the (so far) permanent inundation of two-\ufb01 fths of the entire plough lands of 50 Bridging The Gap the Hill Tracts and a large part of the Rangamati Reserve and other small reserved forests, further limiting the available resources in the Hill Tracts.

Th e other indigenous peoples of the CHT are the Bawm, Chak, Khumi, Khyang, Lushai and Pankhua. Th e total indigenous population of the CHT, according to the 1991 Census, was 501,144. Th e Census carried out in 2001 is not ethnically disaggregated and thus fails to project the total indigenous population in CHT. Th is study acknowledges that both internal socio-economic changes within the CHT and a variety of government-sponsored programmes have led to the erosion of customary resource rights. Th ese include a growing number of applications for, and issue of, private titles among indigenous peoples; land occupation by Bengali settlers with the complicity of the security forces, and the subsequent conversion of common forest, swidden and grazing lands into private landholdings.

Primary sources of data collection are based on \ufb01 eld visits in three hill districts, observation, interaction through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and informal interviews with local leaders, Headmen, karbari, development workers, and women participants.

Major Natural Resources in the CHT Th e most important categories of land in the CHT include government managed forests, community managed forests, swidden (jum), grazing and grassland commons, water bodies, and privately owned lands. Apart from forest produce and these land types, important natural resources include minerals and gas. 2.1 Government Managed Forests Th e reserved forests (RFs) constitute the most important category of government-owned forest areas in the CHT, covering about a quarter of the region. In the CHT, they are also the only category of land directly administered by the Forest Department. Another category of government-managed forests in Bangladesh is protected forests. However, the area of protected forests \u2013 whose resources are protected through speci\ufb01 c restrictions \u2013 is negligible in the CHT. Reserve forest areas are divided into a few large areas, and several smaller ones. Th e smaller RFs together cover only 15,018 acres (24 square miles). (Webb & Roberts, 1976: 2).

In the creation of both of the above types of plantations, there has been a net loss of biological diversity, and denial of access of indigenous communities. From a regional CHT perspective, one can see di\ufb00 ering situations in di\ufb00 erent parts of the forest areas. Very large parts of the RFs \u2013 particularly the central Reingkgyong RF \u2013 have been denuded of large tree cover, most signi\ufb01 cantly since the 1970s (Webb & Roberts). Th e situation in the northern Kassalong RF and Sangu RF has worsened too, both on account of logging of the remaining natural forests accelerated by connecting the road depot at Baghaihat Bazar in Kassalong RF and Alikwadang (\u2018Alikadam\u2019), near Sangu RF, to the national highway network, and the increase in settlements of con\ufb02 ict-a\ufb00 ected internally displaced people (Roy & Gain, 1999: 22; Roy, 2002: 27). Th e DOF manages these forests, although the DOF does not appear to have any direct control over the more remote areas. Regional institutions and district and sub-district administrations have little Chakma river bank farming Photo: Chris Erni 53 Bangladesh or no role in the a\ufb00 airs of these areas. By default the communities residing in the remoter parts of these areas are left to manage their own a\ufb00 airs. Most depend upon swidden or jum cultivation for their major source of livelihood, supplemented with limited cash income from the sale of spices, dried chili peppers, and cattle (including the semi-wild bison or bos frontalis). 2.2 Community Managed Forests Th e most important category of community-managed forests is the mauza forest commons or village common forests (VCFs). Th ese are mostly small (average 50-300 acres), consisting of naturally grown or regenerated vegetation, and are traditionally managed, protected and utilized by village communities under the leadership of the mauza Headmen and village karbaries (traditional elders). Th e existence of these forests is acknowledged in the CHT Regulation of 1900 (at Rule 41A), the main legal instrument for the administration of the region. A number of ancillary executive orders of the district administrations were passed during the British period (circa 1930s) and in the Pakistan period (circa 1960s), but have otherwise su\ufb00 ered from policy neglect since then (Roy & Halim, 2001b; Roy, 2004 b). Although the law does recognize the existence of VCFs, it does not recognize the full ownership rights of the community concerned, or provide express safeguards against alienation and privatization. Th is responsibility would appear to rest upon the mauza headman without whose advise land grants are generally not made in the CHT, although there are some notable exceptions.2 2.3 Swidden Grazing & Other Commons Apart from the DOF-administered RFs, traditional commons used for swidden cultivation, grazing, gathering of thatch and other grasses, as cremation grounds and graveyards are situated within the mauza boundaries. Most are not registered as a separate category of lands in the land registers. Th e indigenous communities and their headmen and karbaries possess knowledge about them as handed down through the generations. Communities regard these commons as their \u2018property\u2019 to manage or use as the community collectively decides, or in some cases, as the in\ufb02 uential headmen and karbaries suggest. In the eyes of most plains o\ufb03 cials of the district and sub-district administrations, these are \u2018khas\u2019 lands belonging to the state. Th e same lands are regarded by DOF o\ufb03 cials as \u2018unclassed state forests\u2019 as they are concerned with \u2018forests\u2019, and all lands in the CHT belong to one or other category of \u2018forest\u2019 (Halim & Roy, 2004).

In other words, the land management responsibilities of the headmen need to be strengthened while at the same time providing checks and balances to the headmen\u2019s authority by subjecting it to the scrutiny and consultative prerogatives of the general public of the mauzas. 2.4 Water Bodies As in the case of forest and other commons mentioned in sections 2.2 and 2.3 above, customary law treats all water bodies as common property, although this is not re\ufb02 ected in the land registry documents, as government o\ufb03 cials prefer to regard such resources as state property. Some parts of the Karnaphuli reservoir have been leased out for \ufb01 sheries, but so far privatization of water bodies is not a major issue of contention in the CHT. Th is can of course change. Due to massive deforestation of the government-managed reserved forests \u2013 including several headwater reserves (such as the Maini, Th ega, Subalong and others) \u2013 river-bank erosion and siltation of the river and reservoir beds is a major problem in the CHT. Ultimately, one cannot but hold the colonialist pattern of RF management responsible for this. Th e stark contrast in the case of the mauza reserves illustrates the point: streams and other aquifers situated within the community-managed mauza reserve forests are generally well protected from bank erosion and siltation. Had indigenous communities been involved in RF management and ownership, the overall situation of the RFs in the CHT today might have been quite di\ufb00 erent. Th us, the examples of the RFs suggest that the right of the indigenous communities over these water bodies \u2013 as owners and managers \u2013 needs to be recognized. 55 Bangladesh 2.5 Privately Owned Tree Plantations Th ere are two major categories of privately owned tree plantations in the CHT. Th ere are those that belong to non-resident lessees based in major cities outside the CHT, and there are the smaller tree plantations of indigenous farmers and town-dwellers. Although the exact area of these lands is not known, the extent of indigenous peoples\u2019 plantations is much larger than that of the absentee lessees. Teak and gmelina \u2013 a valuable timber species \u2013 are the favorite species for plantations, with kori and other local species predominating. Th e system of plantation generally involves the taungya method, an innovated form of agro- forestry based upon the swidden or jum method, whereby a swidden farm includes tree planting along with the usual crops. Th us, after the \ufb01 rst or subsequent harvest of upland rice and other crops, the canopy of the planted teak and other trees \u2013 along with that of the naturally regenerated Kori \u2013 spreads and converts the land into a plantation in a few years. Th is technology has also been used for the government reserves, but o\ufb03 cial sources seldom acknowledge the indigenous roots of this innovated technology, in contravention of the Convention on Biological Diversity (Roy, 2004). Th e biggest problem surrounding privately owned tree plantations is the cumbersome and corrupt permit process. According to one estimate, about 50 percent of the harvest sales value is spent in obtaining permission to bring this same harvest to market (ADB: 38), as a timber extraction and export permit is mandatory. Despite this problem, tree plantations are on the rise, since the timber is a good source of wealth for otherwise impoverished farmers. Simpli\ufb01 cation of the permit process and government assistance through land grants and credit facilities would greatly enhance tree and bamboo production. Indigenous farmers\u2019 plantations are generally far better maintained and protected than the government-owned ones. Again, this is another area where the indigenous communities have demonstrated their superior knowledge and management skills, largely unnoticed by policymakers in Dhaka and elsewhere. 2.6 Other Privately Owned Lands Other relevant types of privately owned lands, excluding market and urban centers, are the orchards and fruit gardens.

In recent years the government has conducted seismic surveys in the CHT in partnership with international gas and oil companies. Th is has been cause of concern to some people in the CHT because mining may pose a threat to the local environment, and threaten the rights of the jum cultivators. Th e demand of the indigenous leaders is that, if mining is to be conducted in the CHT, it should only be done with the prior and informed consent of the peoples of the region. Further, if such consent is provided, mining should be done in such a way as to avoid any dislocation, and to ensure that the hill district council get their share of royalties, as provided for in the CHT Accord of 1997 and the Hill District Council Acts of 1989 (Roy, 2004: 2). Examples of mineral extraction in other parts of Bangladesh do not bode well for further development of this industry in the CHT. In greater Dinajpur, in four upazilla where approximately 50,000 indigenous people are living (in nine unions and sixty-seven villages), the Asia Energy Corporation (Bangladesh) Pty Ltd under a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) was planning to establish Phulbari coalmine project. To stop the proposed open- pit extraction of coal, civil society, the National Adivasi Parishad (greater North Bengal), the National Committee for the Protection of Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Energy and Port, Citizens Committee for the Protection of Gas, Oil and Coal, under the auspices of the Economic Association, had organized several protest meetings, rallies and seminars. Indigenous activists are arguing that the proposed coal mine is in violation of ILO 107. On 26 August 2006 at least seven people were killed and 300 injured as BDR (Bangladesh Ri\ufb02 es) opened \ufb01 re on a demonstration while it was advancing towards the o\ufb03 ce of Asia Energy in Dinajpur. Th ousands of demonstrators, mainly farmers and indigenous peoples including women armed with bows and arrows and sticks, joined the protest against the massive eviction and loss of farmland that was expected as a result of the Phulbari coalmine project (Star, August 27, 2006). Th is has become a serious concern for indigenous peoples, because coal extraction is going to displace them from the ancestral land like their fellow indigenous peoples in CHT, when Kaptai Dam was built in 1960. Most of the indigenous peoples living in the \ufb02 ood zone of the Kaptai Dam had recorded documents for the land; however the government 57 Bangladesh is disregarding it and has now o\ufb00 ered compensation. Th e government, after negotiating with the protesters, announced that it had agreed to say \u2018no\u2019 to Asia Energy and instructed them to wrap up their operations in Bangladesh. No open-pit mineral mining will be allowed in the country (Star, August 31, 2006). However, Asia Energy in a statement said it has not received any communication from the government that it is canceling agreements with the company (Star, September 1, 2006). Th e agreement to withdraw is yet to be implemented by the government. Th e people from Phulbari are saying that the government has betrayed them. Th e risk of permanent eviction from drilling sites cannot be ruled out. If these matters are not negotiated in an equitable manner it will adversely a\ufb00 ect the indigenous peoples and other Bangladeshis living within the project area, potentially leading to dislocation and further unrest.3 3. Law and Policy 3.1 National Forest Policy Th e Government of Bangladesh has several policy documents on forestry. Th ese include the National Forestry Policy (1979 amended in 1994) and the Forestry Master Plan (1994-2013). In addition, the government\u2019s policy can also be observed from its various programmes and projects. Th e First National Forest Policy for Bangladesh of July 8, 1979 was not signi\ufb01 cantly di\ufb00 erent from comparable policies of the pre-independence period. It emphasized the need for preservation and \u2018scienti\ufb01 c management\u2019 of forests and the optimal extraction of forest produce for economic development and ecological balance. No attention was given to \u2018peoples\u2019 participation\u2019 in the management of forest resources in the country (Halim, 1999: 86). Th e current forest policy was adopted in 1994 and o\ufb03 cially announced on 31 May, 1995 (Bangladesh Gazette, July 6, 1995: 241-244).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62b44d69-5eb5-4add-a60b-f3bfee40fcea": {"__data__": {"id_": "62b44d69-5eb5-4add-a60b-f3bfee40fcea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa6507cee6c1692bf460f414a2b2fe586de3c9a187ec2a97cdd1884a83a9a174"}, "2": {"node_id": "cc7a9f03-4dc1-40cf-9506-daa9eea47f45", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40552c3352b4533169ca0c36125c569857fe8d1dd382355a40a5172e3ddd562d"}}, "hash": "613a88f754d49747139178a1863b8d1e248ba6085b1e13a44da8d14ce6f2d6cc", "text": "Th e policy initiated a 20-year Forestry Master Plan (FMP).

Th ese agendas are in tune with the Forest Principles, which were adopted along with Agenda 21 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at Rio, Brazil in 1992 (Mustafa, 2002: 118). In addition to these framework policies, the most important forestry related law of Bangladesh is the Forest Act of 1927 (amended in 2000), from the British period, and which continues to apply \u2013 in amended form \u2013 in India as well. 58 Bridging The Gap Statistics on the extent of forests in Bangladesh tend to vary considerably from one source to another. Th e Forestry Sector Master Plan (FSMP) is considered the key reference source, with its statistics cited widely. According to the FSMP, forested land accounts for 2.56 million hectares or 17.8 percent of the total land area of Bangladesh. Th is includes classi\ufb01 ed forestland (1.49 m ha), unclassi\ufb01 ed forestland (0.73 m ha), state forestland (2.22 m ha), village forestland or home gardens (0.27 m ha), and tea estates and rubber gardens (0.07 m ha) (GoB, 1993). Th e Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS1999) estimates that the total forestland in the country is about 2.25 million hectares, about 14 percent of the total land area of Bangladesh. Th e World Bank (1997) reported that Bangladesh had forest cover of about 1.47 million hectares, or 11 percent of the total land area, and that 6 percent of forestlands had tree cover of at least 20 percent. However, the striking reality is that much of the country\u2019s designated \u2018forestland\u2019 is devoid of trees (Khan, et al, 2004: 17). (See Appendix I for stock of forest). Th e forest laws and policies of the British period rejected recognition of community management of forests in favor of management through a government agency, the Forestry Department. Th is department was given two key functions, policing (or enforcement) and administration. It has been observed that the evolution of public forest policy and practice in post-colonial nation-states in South Asia (including Bangladesh) manifest two interrelated trends: (i) state-sponsored commercialization of forestry; and (ii) the progressive alienation of forest based communities from forest use and management (Khan, 2001). Th e depletion of forest resources begun under colonial administrations continues unabated. Th e Government of Bangladesh has responded to the problem of deforestation in many ways, including by undertaking \u2018social forestry\u2019 projects in degraded forest areas, imposing stricter penalties for theft of forest produce, declaration of moratoria on the extraction and sale of certain forest produce, among others. In 2000, the government passed the Forest (Amendment) Act 2000 (the \u20182000 Act\u2019), which amended certain provisions of the Forest Act of 1927 and formally introduced the concept of social forestry. Th is law has however been severely criticized as being \u2018anti-environment\u2019 and \u2018anti-people\u2019 (Roy & Halim 2001; Halim & Roy; 2006: 5; RIPP). Th e Social Forestry Rules of 2004 were passed in accordance with the newly introduced sections 28(4) and 28(5) of the 1927 Act. Th ese rules contain detailed provisions for social forestry projects, and ethnic minorities (including those groups legally classi\ufb01 ed as indigenous, tribal or aboriginal) are among those to be given priority in selection as bene\ufb01 ciaries of the project along with landless people and destitute women (Roy, 2006). 59 Bangladesh Th e 1927 Act provided limited scope for recognition of common user rights of the forest dwelling communities. Common lands became revenue lands and government acquired complete control over vast territories. Th is marked the beginning of \u2018scienti\ufb01 c management\u2019 of forests that led to the erosion of traditional rights of the people and the erosion of the rich tradition of forest conservation in the subcontinent. Although the underlying aim of the 1927 Act was said to be for the protection of forests, the over\u2013arching aim of raising revenue and meeting industrial needs completely subverted conservationist approaches to forest management (Roy & Halim, 2001a: 9).

Yet, on the ground, the situation continues to spiral in a negative direction, with some very limited exceptions, including the strip plantation project that involved the raising of trees on roads, embankment and dam strips. It was in the strip plantation programme that direct participation from indigenous peoples, mostly women, was ensured and regarded as more participatory (Halim, 1999). 3.1.1 Management of Forestry Forests in Bangladesh can broadly be classi\ufb01 ed into the following categories: \u2022 Hill forests \u2022 Un-classi\ufb01 ed state forests \u2022 Plain land state forests \u2022 Mangrove forests \u2022 Coastal forests \u2022 Home gardens 60 Bridging The Gap Classi\ufb01 ed government forestlands, including reserved, acquired and vested forests, are managed by the Forestry Department (FD). Privately owned plantations, tea estates, home gardens, etc, are under private ownership. Between these two categories are what the Forestry Department refers to as \u2018un-classed state forests\u2019 (USF), which are under the control of the Ministry of Land. Th e land administration authorities generally regard these areas as khas (state-owned) lands while at the same time these lands are regarded by resident indigenous peoples as their traditional commons. Th ese di\ufb00 ering perspectives on the ownership and management of these lands, coupled with lack of interagency coordination, especially between the Forest and Land Revenue departments, makes the management of these lands complex. Th ere has been a 17 percent decline in the resource base of these forested lands in Bangladesh over the last 25 years (Bhuiyan, 1994; cited in Khan, et al, 2004: 20). In comparison, home gardens have been far better managed. In addition, in the CHT there are the community-managed mauza reserves or village common forests and the small plantations discussed above. 3.2 National Land Policy After independence Bangladesh reformed the land laws of the country in the Land Reform Policy of 1972. Th e major characteristics of this policy are: \u2022 Th e ceiling of maximum land ownership, which was \ufb01 xed earlier at 125 acres or 375 bighas, was reduced to 33.33 acres or 100 bighas. \u2022 Th e surplus land acquired by the government was distributed among the peasants. \u2022 Th e new diluvial as well as accelerated land would be acquired by the government and regarded as khas land. \u2022 Land owners holding less than 25 bighas or 4.33 acres were exempted from paying land revenue. \u2022 A law relating to usufructory mortgage was adopted for a period of 7 years. Further changes were introduced in 1984 with an amended Land Reform Policy which brought about the following changes: \u2022 Reduction of the maximum land ceiling from 100 bighas to 62 bighas. \u2022 Introduction of an ordinance prohibiting benami transactions\u2014the purchase or transfer of land in the name of another person to conceal the actual possession of land holding. 61 Bangladesh \u2022 Prohibition of eviction of people from a paternal homestead. \u2022 Introduction of an ordinance recognizing the rights of bargdari or share croppers whereby the landowner would get one third of the produce and the share cropper one third for their labor. Th e remaining third would be distributed according to the proportion of the cost of cultivation borne by each. In 1997, the government created an additional policy for distribution of khas land, identifying the following applicable groups for land distribution: \u2022 Landless families without a homestead and dependent on agriculture \u2022 Landless families with homesteads and dependent on agriculture It can been seen from these policies and laws that the government has introduced a number of e\ufb00 orts aimed at alleviating poverty and addressing issues of landlessness and mis-management. However, the majority of the above described laws remain largely unimplemented. Th e reasons for such intractable non-implementation of policies over decades are deep seated. Barkat points to issues of inept and corrupt governance, alliances between wealthy and in\ufb02 uential people to side-step national law, the innate power structures and the class system in Bangladesh, widespread corruption and powerful market forces, among others.

Another recently passed set of rules, the Social Forestry Rules of 2004, which were developed through consultation over some years beforehand, have also been heavily criticized by indigenous peoples and environmentalists for being contrary to human rights (Roy & Halim, 2001a: 6). Th e SF Rules provide for social forestry programmes involving the Forest Department, NGOs and landless rural residents (Ibid). Th e indigenous peoples of the CHT began to lose control over and access to many of their forests under the British colonial government, which took over the direct administration of the region. Th e trend of extending state control continued during the Pakistan- administered period (1947-1971) and has been reinforced by the successive Bangladeshi governments from 1971 to this day, barring a few exceptions that brought in somewhat more participatory approaches to forest management. Foresters today recognize four kinds of forestland in the CHT. Th ese are as follows: \u2022 Reserved forests (RF) covering about a quarter of the CHT; administered by the FD. \u2022 Protected forests (PF), which covered about 1% of the CHT, but most of which have recently been re-categorized as RF; administered by the District Collectorate; forest resources are controlled and managed by the FD. \u2022 Private forests, most of which are owned by small-scale indigenous farmers, except for a few plantations owned by non-resident individuals and companies based in cities outside the CHT (their extent is unknown). 63 Bangladesh \u2022 Un-classed state forest (USF) covering the rest of the CHT. USFs are a residual category of partly forested land under the control of the District Collectorate and District Councils, in conjunction with mauza headmen, which the indigenous peoples consider as their own forest and swidden commons. (Source: Roy, 2002a: 16-17) Section 28(1) of the 1927 Forest Act empowers the government to assign to any community the right to own and/or manage any land that has been declared a reserved forest. Since signi\ufb01 cant numbers of indigenous peoples live within reserved forest areas, in the CHT and in other parts of Bangladesh (such as north-eastern Sylhet division, in the north-central greater Mymensingh, and within Chittagong and Cox\u2019s Bazaar districts of Chittagong division), this provision has important implications for their rights. Section 5.1 of this report discusses the situation of reserved forest communities of indigenous peoples in the CHT and elsewhere. In practice, however, this law has been invoked in a limited manner only in Sylhet division. Th is means that indigenous communities living in the reserved forests in the CHT, Cox\u2019s Bazaar and elsewhere, continue to have no formally recognized right over the lands in which they live (Roy & Halim 2001a: 21; Roy, 2006: 9). Apart from the provisions for social forestry, the major part of the 2000 Act deals with activities that are prohibited within reserved forests (RFs) and protected forests (PFs) under sanction of imprisonment. Many RF and PF residents cultivate wet-rice and upland rice in RFs and PFs in the CHT (Roy & Halim, 2001a: 13). Th us these types of sanctions have major implications for their rights and livelihoods. With a narrow interpretation of the 1927 Forest Act, the ownership rights over reserved forests are vested in the state alone, all other minor rights, if any, of RF residents, are regarded at best as \u2018concessions\u2019 (Roy & Halim 2001a: 9). Th e British Indian Forest Department used to consider the categorization of forestlands into \u2018reserved forests\u2019 as the most e\ufb03 cient way to manage and protect forests, yet much of these lands were cleared of their natural stands and converted into industry-oriented plantations. Th is policy is essentially being followed until today by both the successor Pakistani and Bangladeshi Departments of Forest. Th e Pakistani government (1947-1971) started a number of \u2018softwood\u2019 plantations of pulpwood species to feed pulp and paper factories, and this practice of maintaining similar plantations still persists.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0db61348-c9bc-47b7-9a43-93a2e719670f": {"__data__": {"id_": "0db61348-c9bc-47b7-9a43-93a2e719670f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "763b9ae77c3c0d58e5970dbcef6706cdb445dd71a7f62c00cd024eacc94694e8"}, "2": {"node_id": "61ba56d5-415e-4ec6-9210-ef038fa4fbb0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "75210b8bcea3cae45d68138ba51875756f56dd304fda0162b1ddd65af8d7b46c"}}, "hash": "eeea66b7cf1b7ca40c816ac14729529a8bd2ae7c728c23a1c60a62ad60c98e8a", "text": "Similarly, the Government of Bangladesh declared a large part of Kukkacchari mouza of Rajasthali sub-district of Rangamati district (which includes the lands of the Khyang 64 Bridging The Gap people),4 as a reserve forest in 1984-85, and trees such as Acacia, Gamar, Kadam (mostly used as pulp wood) were planted.

According to PCGSS, the government has now undertaken a programme to acquire a further 218,000 acres of land, 72,000 of which fall under direct control of the Bandarban district (Skinner, 2005). From the 1990s up to the \ufb01 rst few years of the new millennium, the government has continued to expand its area of reserved forests within the CHT, a process that has been vehemently resisted by indigenous farmers who rallied around a mass organization known as the Movement for the Protection of Forest and Land Rights in the CHT (CK Roy, 2000: 178-180). Th e last major forests of heterogeneous stands are con\ufb01 ned to small parts of the Kassalong and Sangu reserves. Th e USF lands are regarded as state owned, but they also contain the common lands of hill peoples, including those that are used for their homesteads, swidden cultivation, grazing lands, village common forests, and other needs (Adnan, 2004: 120). Th e USFs have been subjected to heavy illicit commercial exploitation. In addition to this, private forests have been built up by a number of hill peoples, involving \u2018tree farming\u2019 on lands under their possession. Th e largest section of the USFs that still contain large trees, bamboo brakes or other dense vegetation and wildlife include the mauza reserves or village forest commons that are managed by indigenous village communities. By law, the mauza headmen are formally charged with the management and administration of these forests, but there seems to be clear policy neglect concerning the protection of these forests on the part of the government (Halim & Roy, 2006; Roy & Halim, 2001b). 3.4 Land Laws of CHT Unlike in the case of the forest-related laws, policies on the ownership and use of non- forest CHT lands underwent signi\ufb01 cant shifts, starting from the British period through the Pakistani period and post-independence Bangladesh. Private leases for plough lands started to be recognized in the \ufb01 rst quarter of the 19th century. Private ownership of hillside lands, however, has only been recognized since the 1950s (Roy, 2002a; Roy 2002b). However, a more drastic change, at least in the eyes of the indigenous peoples, was to come with the opening up of land ownership within the CHT to non-resident individual and corporate 65 Bangladesh bodies. An amendment to Rule 34 of the CHT Regulation of 1900 in 1971, and then again in 1979 (the 1979 law is almost a verbatim copy of the 1971 law), reduced the area of unclaimed public land that could be settled or leased out to local farmers from 25 acres to 5-10 acres (Roy, 2002: 19-20; Roy & Halim, 2003). At the same time, the new law allowed non-residents to acquire land rights within the CHT for homesteads, commercial plantations and industrial plants. In the case of the latter, leases for hundreds of acres could now be obtained (by non-residents) without the knowledge and consent of the Chiefs and headmen, which was hitherto nearly impossible. Th is was contrary to the letter and spirit of the CHT Regulation, which regarded the CHT primarily as a homeland for its indigenous peoples, and whose primacy with regard to land and resource rights was guaranteed as against outsiders. Th e main land laws for the CHT are contained in the CHT Regulation of 1900 (Act I of 1900) and in the Hill District Council Acts of 1989. With a narrow interpretation of the forest and land laws of the CHT, as is usually given by land administration and Forest and Fisheries Department o\ufb03 cials, it is the state which is the absolute owner of these resources. However, when we try to interpret the land and forest laws from a more pluralistic perspective, it is apparent that the state cannot totally exclude the local inhabitants\u2019 rights over their common resources, as the people are the owners of all state property according to the national constitution (Roy, 2002: 20, 21). Th is is also supported by the customary laws of the indigenous peoples as recognized by the CHT Regulation of 1900 and the Forest Act of 1927. 3.5 Customary Land and Forest Laws Some of the customary laws of the indigenous peoples concerning rights over natural resources are recognized through formal legislation, such as in the CHT Regulation of 1900, and the Hill District Council Acts of 1989, while others are regulated by customs that have never been clearly de\ufb01 ned by law.

Other important sources include customary law and the executive orders of the deputy commissioners (who are vested with powers of the Collectorate at the district level). Some of the customary rights of the hill people have been directly acknowledged by formal legislation. Th ese include the right to \u2018occupy\u2019 homestead land (Rule 50, CHT Regulation) and the right to use timber, bamboo and other \u2018minor forest resources\u2019 for domestic purposes (Rule 41A, CHT Regulation, CHT Forest Transit Rules, 1973) (See Appendix II). Some customary 66 Bridging The Gap rights are indirectly acknowledged by the CHT Regulation, such as the right to engage in jum cultivation (Rule 41), and to use forest resources for domestic purposes (Rule 41A) without actually de\ufb01 ning such land use as a \u2018right\u2019. Rule 41A of the CHT Regulation directly protects forest produce gathering rights.

Both of these laws were passed in accordance with the provisions of the CHT Accord of 1997. 3.6 Th e CHT Accord of 1997 Despite its various shortcomings, the CHT Accord of 1997 provides a reasonable basis upon which some of the aforesaid issues can be reasonably addressed, if not redressed in whole. Apart from recognizing the legislative prerogative of the CHT councils, the Accord and subsequent legislation provide two important safeguards for indigenous peoples and other residents of the CHT, although they are yet to be acted upon. One of these is the devolution of land administration to the hill district councils, without whose consent no lands are to be settled, leased out, mortgaged, transferred or compulsorily acquired (section 64, Hill District Council Acts, 1989). Th e other is the resolution of land related disputes by a Commission on Land that is required to adjudicate in accordance with the \u2018laws, practices and usages of the CHT\u2019 (CHT Land Commission Act, 2000) (Roy and Halim, 2003). Th e implementation of the CHT Accord has, however, run into severe di\ufb03 culties (Roy, 2000a; Larma, 2003). Land administration is yet to be devolved to the hill district councils as stipulated in the 1997 Accord and the Hill District Council (Amendment) Act of 1998.

Other than for the administration of civil and criminal justice, the CHT self-government system has no role in the administration of these areas. 4.4 Th e Hill District Councils Th e administration of the CHT is pluralistic in that it includes traditional, bureaucratic and elective regional authorities with speci\ufb01 c and sometimes concurrent responsibilities (Roy, 2000). Th e district councils \u2013 called \u2018hill district councils\u2019 (HDCs) \u2013 administer various \u2018transferred\u2019 subjects at the district level, like primary education, health and public health engineering, \ufb01 sheries and livestock, small and cottage industries, etc. In accordance with the Hill District Council Acts of 1989 (as amended in 1998), the HDCs are to exercise the most important land administration powers in the CHT, including on settlements and leases, transfers and compulsory acquisitions. No such parallels exist in the plains. However, in reality, administration of land, forests (other than reserved forests), law and order, secondary education, etc, are yet to be formally and fully transferred to the HDCs. Th e CHT Regional Council (RC) supervises the work of the HDCs, general administration and local government institutions. Th e vast majority of these o\ufb03 ces are held by indigenous people, who are predominantly male. 4.5 Th e District & Sub-District Administrations Th is administrative set-up includes the institutions of the deputy commissioners (DCs), in charge of the administrative districts, and their subordinate sta\ufb00 , including the Upazilla Nirbahi O\ufb03 cers (UNOs). 4.6 Th e Traditional Administration Th e areas outside the reserved forests are generally known, administratively, as the \u2018mauza-circle\u2019 lands, as they are sub-divided into geographical units known as \u2018circles\u2019 under circle chiefs or rajas, and below them, \u2018mauzas\u2019, under the mauza headmen (mauza chiefs or heads).8 Th e headmen are responsible for resource management, land and revenue administration, maintenance of law and order, and administration of traditional justice. Th e headmen in turn are assisted by karbaries or village heads, particularly in maintaining law and order and dispensing traditional justice.

It has been observed by the researchers that those forest areas which are in physically remote locations, the FD for whatever reason has limited interference and the formal management is extremely weak.

Since these inhabitants have no ownership over the trees, these RFs are being denuded quickly. Th e researchers further observed that the tendency to grow trees (re-vegetate) is low. Th e FD has appointed Forest Headmen (not to be confused with the more in\ufb02 uential mauza headman in the mauza circle areas) to hold the in\ufb02 uential leadership positions in the reserve forest areas, apart from the elected chairpersons and the members of the small union council areas (where the union council system has extended). Neither the elected representatives nor the Forest Headmen can exert e\ufb00 ective power to take measures for the communities. Th is is largely because these Forest Headman have to depend upon the FD to retain their o\ufb03 ces, and moreover, even they cannot call their homesteads their own land. For instance, petitions were sent to the government to de-reserve a small area to enable the community to get state subsidies for their school; however, such subsidies could not be applied for in accordance with the Education Department rules which required school land to be formally registered as the property of the school managing committee, illegal in a reserved forest area (Roy, 2004; Mexico). Th e reserved forest communities are technically squatters on their own lands, and cannot take any strong initiatives to lobby for their land rights and other facilities. Th ey constantly 71 Bangladesh live under the shadow of quit notices and prosecution as illegal squatters on state land, despite having lived in the areas for decades, or centuries. Th eoretically, their situation is, in some respects, worse than that of the indigenous inhabitants of the mauza circle areas. In the words of a Taunchangya leader, for the purpose of easy patrolling of the military in Reinghkhyong Reserve, many trees have been felled. In this regard the Forest Department could not play any role to stop such felling in terms of the question of providing security in the aforesaid area. Moreover, he pointed out that in Reinghkhyong area approximately 600 acres of forestland is under plough cultivation. Th e forest-based communities demand the freeing up of cultivable forest land and villages from the RF administration, and declare them as mauza forest or provide leases against the families living within the RF.

Th e election of an indigenous union council member in remote Reinkhyngkine Lake area in 2003 for the \ufb01 rst time shows that these communities are eager to engage government and development agencies regarding their rights and welfare.

In the words of ex\u2013Upazilla Chairman Daowlian Bawm (70 years old), when the population size was small and land was abundant, then they would have boundaries determining their community lands. Within the community land they would have jum \ufb01 elds, homesteads and land to be used for other purposes. According to Daowlian this arrangement for the use of natural resources was managed in consultation with the families living within the community. For example, \ufb01 shing was allowed according to set rules, and anyone found to be killing \ufb01 sh through natural poison would have been \ufb01 ned. He also mentioned that now the government has laws to punish those who still indulge in this activity, although these laws are not implemented. Currently most of the Bawm communities preserve some 20-25 acres of land surrounding their villages. Th ey usually term this \u2018community forest\u2019. No forest produce collected from the community forest is sold. Only the villagers have access to forest resources for their own consumption. Usually the karbari, and sometimes the village Headman if necessary, will consult with the villagers for all matters relating to NRM. Usually 7-8 persons in a group will get involved to work in the jum \ufb01 elds. Old couples, women without partners, and children were exempted from this work. Th ere was a system of \u2018exchange labor,\u2019 locally known in Bawn community as \u2018bala\u2019 (which is still being practiced in other communities under di\ufb00 erent names) through which families who did not have able bodied labor could exchange other goods, usually food, for the labor of other people in the community. Daowlian mentioned another practice relating to jum cultivation: while a jum \ufb01 eld is being cleared a \ufb01 ring line is prepared collectively and in one day the villagers would set and complete the \ufb01 ring of that \ufb01 eld. He pointed out that besides jum they produce vegetables, chilies, and paddy, and their main purchased items were salt, matches, scissors and kerosene from the local market. Th e usual commodities that the communities would sell were mustard seeds and karpas cloth. Women in the communities wove their own cloths for use and for sale.

Among the major natural resources of the area are its hills, natural forests and water bodies, including the upstream lake locally known as Matai Pukhiri or \u2018a pond on the top of hills\u2019. Th e lake is located at an altitude of 1,200 feet above sea level. Lake Matai Pukhiri contains stones brought down by the stream that \ufb02 ows into it. Th e village\u2019s water supply is met by this \ufb02 ow from Matai Pukhiri. Villagers sell the stones to traders and earn a little additional income. However, the number of outsiders participating in stone collection is increasing. Th e removal of stone is leading to soil erosion and deforestation. Locals believe this will negatively a\ufb00 ect the existence of what they believe is the lake god, and consequently, the people. Lake Matai Pukhiri has been regarded as one of the most valuable natural resources of this area.

Ethnicity, gender, class and natural resource management In order to obtain an in-depth understanding of the role of indigenous peoples in natural resource management in the CHT, it is important to analyze its ethnic, class and gender dimensions. 6.1 Ethnicity & Indigenous Resource Management Article 28 of the Constitution of Bangladesh outlaws discrimination based on \u2018religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth\u2019 and further requires the state to make \u2018special provisions\u2019 to protect \u2018backward sections of citizens\u2019. However, such a policy of equality and non-discrimination is not re\ufb02 ected in the government\u2019s land and forest management policies. Such policies actually tend to be both \u2018gender blind\u2019 and \u2018ethnicity blind\u2019 (in a negative sense). On the contrary, the implementation of such a non-discrimination clause leads to refusal to recognize the customary resource rights of indigenous peoples, both in the plains regions, such as in the Madhupur \u2018eco\u2019 park, the Maulvibazar \u2018national park\u2019, and in the CHT, including through the denial of rights in the existing and new reserved forests areas. In the special administrative system of the CHT (including the karbaries, headmen, chiefs, district and regional councils), indigenous people have a substantive level of participation in resource management in mauza circles or \u2018USF\u2019 areas, but indigenous representation in the aforesaid institutions is not uniform. Many of the smaller ethnic groups have complained of non-representation or inadequate representation in the CHT governance system although their actual and positive role in natural resource management is quite substantive. Given the structure of the CHT institutions, and the structure of the interim district councils (some ethnic groups excluded), such under-representation cannot be denied. Given the rich store of knowledge, innovations and practices that the smaller indigenous groups are custodians of, it is unjust and unwise to exclude the small groups from their due participation in policy decision-making processes. Th is goes for both the state system and the special regional institutions 6.2 Indigenous Resource Management & Class Dimensions As in the case of smaller ethnic groups, the poorer sections of the CHT population are generally excluded from policy-making processes. However it is the poor, and particularly the rural poor, who not only su\ufb00 er disproportionately from environmental degradation, but who are also the major custodians of the country\u2019s natural forests and water bodies.

Researchers have pointed out that in developing countries it is women who are the most dependent upon forests for their sustenance (Shiva,1989; Agarwal,1989; Halim, 1999). Promoting and strengthening equitable practices on gender and class (in the sense of socio-economic backgrounds) was regarded as a cross-cutting strategic issue as well as a speci\ufb01 c goal of NRM by the workshop participants and other respondents. Increased participation of women in the affairs of NRM remains a continuing challenge for the indigenous communities. Th e most glaringly negative feature that was perceived in the NRM workshop is the gender-blindness of the people who are concerned with forming committees having NRM functions. Th e other troubling feature that was revealed in the workshops was the reluctance of forest-based and other communities to open up the group to new members. In this context, the role of local NGOs like Taungya is perhaps even bigger than thought, and related challenges in the long term include how to bring changes in the perceptions of men to help them realize that women have as much capacity as men to make rational and intelligent decisions related to development, resource management and their family concerns. Members of Taungya staff working in remote areas have pointed out that management committees running local community forests (VCFs) have become more gender-sensitive than before. Th e number of general members of VCF committees has increased, and women have become full members 77 Bangladesh for the very \ufb01 rst time. Th ese instances of positive impact of the project interventions might go beyond forest management to actually encouraging greater gender equity practices in CHT rural society in a general way. Th is would of course depend upon the extent that VCF community practices are emulated by CHT communities outside of the small project area of Taungya (Halim and Roy, 2006). In this context, the impact of the gender equity components in ongoing development projects \u2013 including those funded by the Asian Development Bank and the Hill Tracts Facility managed by the UNDP \u2013 need to be studied. 6.3.1 Customary Land Rights: Gender Based Discrimination Th e traditional division of labor in developing societies has allocated hazardous tasks as well as tasks requiring physical strength to men, and work that requires sustained e\ufb00 ort and endurance to women. Th e division is strengthened by taboos and beliefs. Like Bengali women in the plains, the indigenous women of Bangladesh are also traditionally regarded as occupying a lower social standing than the men. Indigenous women\u2019s status is low in terms of the right to inheritance, legal and political rights, decision-making powers and other spheres. One of the most acute problems faced by indigenous women is the denial of their access to customary owned land. Land scarcity among indigenous communities generally a\ufb00 ects women more adversely than indigenous men. Th e inheritance laws of most indigenous peoples, including the most numerous groups such as the Chakma and the Santal, tend to discriminate against women. Th e notable exceptions are in the case of the Khasi in greater Sylhet and the Mandi or Garo in the plains, and to a lesser extent, the Marma in the southern Chittagong Hill Tracts. Apart from the above exceptions, the common trend of the indigenous communities is that only sons inherit landed property. Some Garo9 women respondents pointed to a new trend in their communities, whereby sons are allowed a share of the landed property. According to these women, this is largely on account of poverty and unemployment among their male youths. Another possible cause, which was not discussed formally, was the fear of land passing on to outsider Bengalis through the marriage of Bengali men with Garo women (the same also applied to Khasi women). Th us, this too shows an instance of discrimination due to gender, albeit in an indirect manner. A combination of patriarchal tendencies among both Mandi/Khasi and Bengali males marrying Mandi/Khasi women may have contributed to such phenomena and perceptions. Although the Government of Bangladesh has rati\ufb01 ed the ILO Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Populations (Convention No. 107, 1957), which recognizes the customary land 78 Bridging The Gap rights of indigenous/tribal population groups, it has done little or nothing to protect the land rights of the Mandi/Garo and other indigenous peoples. Although the Constitution of Bangladesh formally recognizes equality irrespective of sex, race, caste or place of birth, in practice such provisions do not seem to have led to equal opportunity and safety for women in formal and informal sectors of work.

It has been reported by indigenous Garo women from other research areas, such as the greater Mymensingh, that they play a primary role in production, especially in subsistence- oriented agricultural communities. Despite their contribution to production, these women are not in a position to utilize loans - where they can access loans - to buy land. Th ese women reported that sometimes they use their loans to recover mortgaged land, which in most cases is in the names of their male family members. Th ese women also pointed out that if given the chance to buy land, they would do so, and have the same recorded jointly with their husbands. Further, some women respondents stated that they utilize part of the credit to start court cases to recover their alienated lands from Bengali land grabbers. Some even managed to obtain decrees in their favour. However, most were still unable to recover possession of dispossessed lands on account of \ufb01 nancial and procedural di\ufb03 culties. Another important area of concern is personal law dealing with family matters. Family laws deal with \ufb01 ve areas of family life, including issues relating to (i) marriage, (ii) dissolution of marriage, (iii) custody of children (iv) guardianship of children and the (v) conjugal rights, which are also considered part of citizens \u2018religious personal\u2019 lives. In all other areas such as inheritance or adoption, religious laws are applied, although indigenous and tribal peoples are excluded from such laws (both in the CHT and in other parts of the country). Only since 1995 have Family Courts been made available to non-Muslim citizens, applying non-Islamic laws, as a forum for adjudication (Halim, 2003a). However, Family courts are not operating in CHT. In most cases the Headman and karbari of the village in CHT resolve disputes caused by a severed marriage, desertion by the husband, and other conjugal disturbances. If the Headman or karbari\u2019s decision is disputed by one of the parities, the cases usually come to the respective circle chief. Indigenous women in CHT, if required, seeks justice from their traditional courts administered by three circle chiefs in three respective districts. It is observed that despite indigenous women\u2019s marginal presence in the power structures, these customary structures may actually be more sympathetic 79 Bangladesh towards disadvantaged women than comparable shalish1 in the plains. For instance, in the rural areas of the plains, Bengali women have no voice in the local shalish, except NGO modi\ufb01 ed shalish, and in most cases the verdict goes against them. On the contrary, in the traditional courts administered by Headmen and circle chiefs in CHT, it seems that the judicial o\ufb03 cers or bodies do make strong e\ufb00 orts to ensure that indigenous women\u2019s rights are treated with respect. Th is is quite rare in the plains (Halim, et al, 2005b: 16-20; Halim, 2006). Matters that concern family generally fall under the jurisdiction of the Family Court (again with the exception of the CHT). Mainstream women leaders are demanding the adoption of uniform family laws covering all aspects of family life, including in the CHT, a demand not hitherto prominent in the women\u2019s rights movement. Given the presence of negatively discriminatory provisions against women among most Bangladeshi peoples\u2019 inheritance laws, including those of the Muslims, Hindus and most of the indigenous or adivasi peoples (the Garo and the Khasi being notable exceptions), a gender-equitable Uniform Family Code that would apply to all peoples in all parts of the country may well be a desirable development. However, consideration ought to be given as to whether that would be the only way to bring forth a more gender-equitable system in the case of some, such as Garo or Khasi women, if not all of the indigenous or adivasi peoples of the country (Halim, 2003a). 1 Shalish is an informal system of justice which has no legal form.

Women from the most underprivileged sections of society are most a\ufb00 ected by the depletion of natural resources since they have little or no access to private lands and are therefore highly dependent upon forests for their livelihoods. However, rural women from the middle and higher income classes are also dependent to a large extent upon forest resources where the economy is at least partially subsistence-oriented and where wage labor is scarce both for economic, social and cultural reasons (hill people are traditionally averse to doing domestic labor for others). Th us the problems faced by rural women, both poor and higher income, and including indigenous women, are closely related to environmental problems. Th e state-sponsored development programmes in the CHT region remain largely welfare- oriented, and sometimes implemented at the costs of basic rights. Th ey seem to have done little to bring about any favourable changes in indigenous women\u2019s lives. Th ese welfare programmes have generally ignored indigenous women\u2019s productive role in the economy. Indigenous women, through their traditional role as de facto managers of the rural household, have the most intricate knowledge about forest food items, their nutritional value and herbal medicinal plants. Th e degradation of natural forests results not only in the extinction of many plants, but also in loss of indigenous women\u2019s knowledge of their natural resources, along with the increased burden of having to fetch water and gather food items from places that are farther and farther removed from their homes. Th us the impact of deforestation on indigenous women is not only upon their knowledge systems, economic well-being and health, but on their status in society (Halim, 2002). Unfortunately, women\u2019s issues and natural resource issues are viewed as separate problems. From the environmental perspective sustainable development emphasizes the prevention of pollution and environmental degradation, with a concern to contain economic and environmental costs. From the gender point of view, making people and their well being the objective requires that women be both agents and bene\ufb01 ciaries of the development process and social change (Roy and Halim, 2001a: 29). Observation in the CHT reveals that women have a crucial role in natural resource management. However, it is rare for women to be considered full participants in natural resource regeneration and protection programmes, with some local NGOs such as Taungya providing the only exceptions to this. Th e other important matter of concern is that the social and cultural contexts of the various indigenous communities are very di\ufb00 erent, and many of the laws and policies on 81 Bangladesh resource management and other related spheres are not adequate to prevent discrimination against indigenous women. It is usually non-indigenous women\u2019s organizations and other development organizations that take up development issues like health issues related to reproductive health, violence against women, educational programmes, natural resource management programmes and land rights. Non-indigenous organizations and policy makers incorporate all these issues without a speci\ufb01 c approach to the issues confronting indigenous women, who often face triple discrimination as women, as indigenous and often as the poor as well. For instance, CEDAW (the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women) is a powerful tool, but fails to mention the right of self-determination for indigenous women. While CEDAW identi\ufb01 es unequal access to education, discriminatory wages, health, violence, and human rights violations as among the key threats to women, it does not re\ufb02 ect the fact that national policies drawing upon the provisions of CEDAW (for instance SF programmes where women are only taken as bene\ufb01 ciaries) may on occasion perpetuate the discrimination against indigenous peoples. Th ese policies are employed not only as a means of erasing their existence as indigenous peoples but also to dispossess them of their rich ancestral land \u2013 the basis of their culture and survival. 6.3.3 Denial of Political Voice Th e denial of indigenous women\u2019s substantive participation in political spheres further reinforces their low status in society.

Various roles played by indigenous women during the con\ufb02 ict in the CHT were neither nationally awarded, recognized, nor received any formal recognition from their own communities. Th e struggle of indigenous women for autonomy and peace has thus remained invisible next to the struggle of men, as in so many other spheres of women\u2019s lives and roles (Halim, 2003: 97; Halim et al, 2005b). Blind spots such as these have led some to refer to the CHT Accord of 1997 as a \u2018gendered\u2019 agreement (Mohsin, 2003: 53). Th e Accord makes no reference to the human rights violations committed against women in the CHT. Th ere are no provisions for providing compensation to the women a\ufb00 ected by violence, and no any mention of rehabilitation, compensation or counseling for victims of sexual violence. Th is contravenes Bangladesh\u2019s responsibilities as a signatory 82 Bridging The Gap to the International Criminal Court (ICC) convention that considers rape as a crime against humanity. Women from indigenous communities are facing many di\ufb00 erent types of human rights violations. Th e various forms of abuse by Bengali settlers are on the increase. Th is may be because the settlers, who were mostly con\ufb01 ned in military-protected \u2018cluster villages\u2019 before, are now far more mobile because of the end of the guerilla war. Militarization, which still continues in the CHT in the name of keeping peace in the region, is resulting in much misery for innocent people, both men and women. Although the 1997 Accord provides for the dismantling of military camps (except for some speci\ufb01 ed large garrisons), this provision is still to be implemented in substance by the Government of Bangladesh (Halim, 2005a; Halim et al, 2005b). In both indigenous and state political structures, indigenous women are often excluded from roles of political leadership. In the CHT, under the largely hereditary traditional system of governance, it is almost always men who hold key positions, such as mauza headmen, and even more so in the case of village karbaries. Apart from two notable exceptions of acting or de facto female chiefs \u2013 in the case of in the Chakma Circle in the 19th century, and in the Mong Circle in the 1980s \u2013 the position of chiefs is also generally restricted to male heirs, to eldest sons of former chiefs in the case of the Chakma and Mong Circles, and to the \ufb01 ttest and eldest males of the royal family in the case of the Bohmong Circle. Th is patriarchal tendency is further re\ufb02 ected in the structure of interim regional and district councils in the CHT. In the case of the regional council, only 3 out of 22 members are women, and their voice in decision-making is yet to be heard or otherwise felt. In the case of the interim hill district councils, the situation is even worse, as none of the 6 members from each district council is a woman, excepting the chairperson of the Bandarban Council (Halim, 2002: 137-138). Th e aforesaid shortcomings with regard to women\u2019s representation in the political and administrative institutions need to be addressed. Th e national forest, land and environment policies also need to be revised from a de-gendered perspective. E\ufb00 orts of NGOs such as Taungya to enhance women\u2019s representation at village-level forest management need to be supported by government and developmental institutions, and mirrored at higher levels of natural resource management practices in particular, and in leadership structures in general. 83 Bangladesh 7. Th e interface between indigenous and state processes of NRM 7.1 Indigenous Peoples and Policy-Making It is generally seen that the state\u2019s natural resources policies, like its development policies, are yet to directly and substantively acknowledge indigenous peoples as legitimate rights- holders and stakeholders.11 Historically, indigenous people have been systematically denied access to lands that were required by the empires, kingdoms or colonizers. Th e legacies of these past policies have continued in di\ufb00 erent forms up to the present day, particularly with regard to lands categorized as \u2018forests\u2019 or required for state forestry.

Th is project continued until 1967 or so. Th e Deputy Commissioner was supposed to provide land settlement titles to these farmers but that happened only in a very limited number of cases. Th ese same people are now threatened with eviction by the Forest Department as their lands were under process since the 1990s to be part of new reserved forests.12 While the fruit plantation project of the 1960s was solely funded and managed by government agencies (the Forest Department in particular), as was the trend of those days, policy formulation and project interventions on natural resource management in Bangladesh has in recent years been substantively in\ufb02 uenced by priorities and perspectives of external donor and lending agencies. Sometimes the interests of these agencies are seen to enter into unhappy alliances with lobbies of vested interest groups within the country. One of the best examples of this dichotomy is the Forest (Amendment) Act of 2000. On the one hand, this Act formally introduces the concept of \u2018social forestry\u2019, while on the other hand, it strengthens policing powers and provides immunity to Forest Department o\ufb03 cials from prosecution. It has been said that there is little of \u2018social\u2019 or \u2018forestry\u2019 dimensions in the model prescribed under this Act, as the major decision- making powers are retained by the Forest Department, and the proposed programmes 84 Bridging The Gap are oriented towards plantation programmes, rather than forestry (which would include natural regeneration and protection) (Halim, 1999; Roy & Halim, 2001a; Roy, 2002). Th ere are two further points that are noteworthy with regard to ownership and use rights over lands to be taken up for the SF (Social Forestry) Programs. First, the de\ufb01 nition of \u2018SF program\u2019 as provided in the new section 28A of 2000 Forest Act stipulates that the SF programme will be carried out on only two categories of lands, the \ufb01 rst of which includes land \u2018assigned\u2019 to the government. Secondly, the 2000 Act authorizes the government to assign rights to others over land involved in the SF programmes, but the assigned rights are limited to user rights only. It seems that the possibility of assigning ownership rights over SF lands has not been considered. Th e \u2018social\u2019 element of the proposed forestry programmes were weakened by providing some responsibility to the proposed participants of social forestry programmes, while keeping the major decision-making powers in the hands of the Forest Department o\ufb03 cials (Roy & Halim, 2001). Th e National Poverty Strategy Paper (PRSP) published in October 2005 refers to inadequate representation of adivasis/ethnic minorities at various levels of government and policy process, limiting their opportunities to in\ufb02 uence policy decisions that a\ufb00 ect their lives. Among actions recommended by the PRSP are the full implementation of the CHT Accord, activation of the CHT Land Commission and the Task Force on Refugees, resolution of land and forest related problems in the plains (particularly the Eco park) (Roy, 2006). Mru village Photo: Chris Erni 85 Bangladesh 7.2 Ownership versus User Regimes As mentioned in 3.5 above, some of the customary resource rights of indigenous people of the CHT have been partially recognized in the CHT Regulation of 1900. Th e Forest Act of 1927, which applies both in the CHT and in the plains, contains provisions (in section 28) that allow assignment of the government\u2019s rights over reserved forests. In comparison, the ambit of the scope of assignment of the government\u2019s rights under section 28A, introduced by the 2000 Act, is decidedly narrower. Section 28 of the 1927 Act allows the government to \u2018assign to any village community the rights of Government to or over any land which has been constituted into reserved forest\u2026\u2019. It is clear from the section 28A de\ufb01 nition of SF as provided in the 2000 Act that government-led SF programmes will henceforth be con\ufb01 ned to lands that are either under the ownership of the government or over which the government has been assigned rights by others. Th e question that arises here is why does ownership over SF lands needs to be vested in the government when existing trends of resource management worldwide are leaning towards such programmes as inclusive and participatory rather than centralized in the hands of government agencies? (Roy & Halim 2001a: 22-23). Indigenous communities in Bangladesh have quite rightly pointed out that they do not have su\ufb03 cient access to farmlands and even where they do have access to lands, their tenure security is absent due to administrative bottlenecks and con\ufb02 icts between customary and local laws on the one hand", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74b2ca29-a8f0-4324-9c17-3b215fa89ffb": {"__data__": {"id_": "74b2ca29-a8f0-4324-9c17-3b215fa89ffb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90527669fcea9e23d59dee6b36afe431edf62fe7ec95115e0c10a3ae2167faf0"}, "3": {"node_id": "78e5a496-128a-4ac7-9347-ee5203a933d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "83e4f5204f42668404685c91d2949ae07575c5512ee8144466226795abfb67c1"}}, "hash": "69401eb075d72ed6e1422fa1e9a68c25c13da0e48838b81cf6b5310cf6eeb180", "text": "and national laws on the other. Most farmers do not own their own farmlands, leading to under-investment in these lands in terms of capital, labor and other inputs to add value to the farm produce. Th e proposed state-centric SF programmes are not only contrary to the rights and needs of forest communities, particularly those of indigenous peoples, but are likely to fail due to continued denial of tenure security. As mentioned earlier in section 3.5, the ADB has been a crucial actor in designing and supporting SF programmes all over Bangladesh, including in the so-called \u2018USFs\u2019 or mauza commons. Human rights activists in the CHT, with support from the civil society groups from the plains, have resisted the proposal of the FD because they pointed out that the model is unsuitable for the CHT as it would provide them with less rights than they can now exercise under existing CHT laws, customs and usages. Th e CHT Regional Council is also known to have disagreed with the proposed programme in the \u2018USFs\u2019 (Roy, 2002; ICIMOD). Similarly, \ufb01 ndings from the plains show that where SF has been implemented, the programmes do not account for local people\u2019s rights to land title, including in the Attia Forest area13 within greater Tangail District (Halim, 1999). 86 Bridging The Gap Th ere is also a conceptual problem with the notion of \u2018USFs\u2019 in CHT. What the Forest Department calls \u2018USF\u2019 is regarded as common property of the indigenous communities (Arnes, 1997), and a large part thereof is concurrently regarded as government \u2018khas\u2019 land by the district land administration authorities under the Deputy Commissioner. Th us these three di\ufb00 ering perspectives bring in three di\ufb00 ering law and practice regimes \u2013 whatever their formal legal status may be \u2013 quite often con\ufb02 icting with each other, especially between the indigenous communities on the one hand and the government on the other. Another government programme that has brought the indigenous people of the CHT into con\ufb02 ict with the government is the expansion of the area of RFs by including privately titled and customarily owned lands of indigenous communities and some long-term Bengali residents of the CHT. Th is has drawn widespread protests from CHT communities, who have rallied around the previously mentioned mass movement, the Forest and Land Rights Movement in the CHT (Roy, 2002b; Roy, 2004). Although the government has avoided a con\ufb02 ict with the communities so far in the face of the mass protests and advocacy campaigns \u2013 including in the capital city, Dhaka \u2013 it is reported that ADB-funded SF programmes are being quietly re-introduced in some parts of the CHT.14 7.3 Re-Empowering the Status of Customary Resource Rights: Th e Legal Status of Customary Resource Rights Th e tension and potential con\ufb02 ict between customary law regimes and essentially \u2018statist\u2019 land and forest laws are yet to be resolved despite the promulgation of the Constitution of Bangladesh in 1972, which declares that the property of the Bangladeshi state belongs \u2018to the people\u2019. Th is tension is particularly high where it concerns rights of \u2018ownership\u2019 over common resources. In comparison, the tension is far less in the case of user regimes, especially in the CHT. During the British period (1860-1947), and even up to the post- British period when British-born DCs were posted in the CHT (up to 1955), although full ownership rights over unsettled lands were always regarded as belonging to the state alone, \u2018use\u2019 or \u2018usufruct\u2019 rights based upon customary laws were acknowledged far more readily.15 Th us there are formalized laws that recognize the competence of headmen to provide settlements of rural homestead plots to hillpeople without the requirement of sanction from the Deputy Commissioner, and laws recognizing the right of hillpeople to use \u2018minor forest produce\u2019 from the unclassed state forests. In recent years, the clearest acknowledgement of customary resource rights was made in the CHT Accord of 1997 and the subsequent CHT Land Disputes Resolution Commission Act of 2001, that obliges 87 Bangladesh the CHT Land Disputes Resolution Commission to act \u2018in accordance with the laws, usages and practices of the region\u2019 in its decisions on land disputes in the CHT.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78e5a496-128a-4ac7-9347-ee5203a933d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "78e5a496-128a-4ac7-9347-ee5203a933d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90527669fcea9e23d59dee6b36afe431edf62fe7ec95115e0c10a3ae2167faf0"}, "2": {"node_id": "74b2ca29-a8f0-4324-9c17-3b215fa89ffb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69401eb075d72ed6e1422fa1e9a68c25c13da0e48838b81cf6b5310cf6eeb180"}}, "hash": "83e4f5204f42668404685c91d2949ae07575c5512ee8144466226795abfb67c1", "text": "How these customs, practices, etc, will be treated in practice by the commission, especially when they come into con\ufb02 ict with codi\ufb01 ed law, is, however, a matter that remains to be seen.

Indigenous peoples\u2019 rights over the Madhupur forest, the Attiya forest, and over the Barind tract in the northwest, have been denied through declarations of the former commons as reserved forests, vested forests, acquired forests or private forests. Lands of Santal, Oraon and other Adivasi communities in the Barind tract within the Rajshahi administrative division have been taken over both in the name of government forests (reserved or vested forests) and private forests, and even for \u2018social forestry\u2019 in recent times. Likewise, both Bengali and adivasi communities have su\ufb00 ered due to the unilateral declarations and legislation vesting all rights over the Attia forest in the government alone, overriding all rights and claims of others (see further, section 7.2). Th e Madhupur forest \u2013 traditionally the home of Garo, Koch, Hajong and other indigenous groups \u2013 has seen a long con\ufb02 ict between the Forest Department and local residents, involving court cases, a controversial Asian Development Bank-funded project of the 1980s (Earth Touch, 2004) and the killing of an activist named Piren Snal in January 2004. A similar situation prevails in the Chittagong and Sylhet administrative divisions too, particularly in reserved forests. A singular exception where customary rights were acknowledged to an extent has been in the case of Khasi communities, who have entered into agreements with the Forest Department over parts of RFs inhabited by them, on the basis of section 28 of the Forest Act. However, this is the exception rather than the rule. Th e only other area whether customary resource rights have been indirectly acknowledged is in the controversial Social Forestry Rules of 2004, in which \u2018ethnic minorities\u2019 have been included among the disadvantaged groups that will become \u2018bene\ufb01 ciaries\u2019 of the social forestry projects of the government.17 As the above discussion has shown, it is only some of the customary resource rights of the indigenous people that have been directly acknowledged by legislation. Moreover, the exact status of many of these laws has never been explored in detail, either through judicial pronouncements or legal commentaries or otherwise. Th us it is unclear how the matter would be decided either administratively or judicially \u2013 in cases of con\ufb02 ict between the aforesaid laws and other statutes. In comparison, the status of the personal and family 88 Bridging The Gap laws of the indigenous peoples \u2013 also based upon customs and usages \u2013 would seem to be somewhat higher, and less contested, particularly in the CHT. In the CHT, practices of marriage, divorce, maintenance, child custody, inheritance, etc, are generally regulated by the customary law of the people or community concerned, and this is acknowledged both by legislation and judicial pronouncements, although these rights are not de\ufb01 ned by formal laws. In addition, the judicial and other authority of traditional institutions, including the headmen and chiefs, is formally recognized by statute law. In the plains, the indigenous peoples\u2019 personal and family laws are not expressly recognized by statutes, although they continue to be practiced. However, the judicial institutions of the plains adivasis are not formally recognized, and this makes the position of adivasi customary law far more precarious. Quite apart from the fact that custom is a recognized source of law under the Bangladeshi legal system, the status of customary laws in the CHT is unique because of three important factors. First, many aspects of the CHT legal and administrative system \u2013 including in the CHT Regulation of 1900 itself \u2013 have been and still are regulated by customs, usages and longstanding practices: to deny the legal validity of such customs would leave a huge juridical vacuum in administrative law. Secondly, the CHT Regulation and many other Chakma women selling \ufb01 rewood Photo: Chris Erni 89 Bangladesh enactments did and still do recognize the presence of many customary practices regarding the use of land and other natural resources. Th irdly, even where enactments do not speci\ufb01 cally acknowledge the existence of customary resource rights, these laws do not necessarily negate the validity of such customs because, according to the CHT Regulation (at section 4), all laws apply to the region only \u2018so far as they are not inconsistent with [the Regulation] or the Rules for the time being in force\u2019.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0cddd56-3b0e-4caf-9433-70e424f87748": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0cddd56-3b0e-4caf-9433-70e424f87748", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9139e735c6ab41e32b527d2948f9281ddc367ff6d61e04f11a1c6fddc5079474"}, "2": {"node_id": "25438d63-77ef-4c26-8fc6-fe1ece1772cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "12b10e16d4fe7932f1ea349d913fe1cd46eeb6c2c3c12734a618b09ed4d4a18f"}}, "hash": "6a5299ddfddba66d40661b29f858efaca48b695d9509cf33df5a14afd707af04", "text": "Th erefore, it could be argued quite persuasively that the enactments applicable to the CHT are void to the extent of their inconsistency with these customary laws.18 Of course, even if the above contention", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13c5eff4-6e0d-4152-be1c-41adadb814da": {"__data__": {"id_": "13c5eff4-6e0d-4152-be1c-41adadb814da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "96751cbd012ddb35c71606b0a9fc172be6f277539e17a1e7c369e12550992dd0"}, "3": {"node_id": "f5374fcb-d90d-443b-8833-23ef26535211", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eedee4e64b725207e59e80e6839c0d1a35d967493c8a9e54a42bb09d8ea41f89"}}, "hash": "d1f0d509294d8311c09f7b2c6b5c5b34af9ece53e8902bfa68df9b76ce8da30f", "text": "is legally valid, it would still leave the question of the relative status of customary law and other laws unanswered, something that will have to be dealt with by the future CHT Commission on Land when it hears disputes presented before it.

In one of the rare instances when a dispute over a customary law matter from the CHT reached the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, the court upheld the concerned customary law and censured the government for acting contrary to the concerned custom.20 Th is, however, was a case concerning succession to the chiefship of the Bohmong Circle in the CHT, and therefore, a matter of customary personal law rather than custom-based resource rights. Th erefore, the more crucial question is whether the Bangladeshi juridical system, or for that matter, the country\u2019s political system, will provide as much space in the context of customary resource rights as it has in the case of indigenous customary law (Roy, 2003). 90 Bridging The Gap 7.4 Settlement Policy of Landless Bengalis in CHT Bengali Re-Settlement & Its Impact on Natural Resource Management An important development that a\ufb00 ected resource management practices in the CHT and led to the violation of the indigenous peoples\u2019 rights was the population transfer programme of the 1980s that brought hundreds of thousands of Bengali people into the CHT under direct government sponsorship. Th is not only led to a dramatic change in the demographic pattern in the CHT, but also brought signi\ufb01 cant changes in the occupational patterns of the CHT communities, many of which a\ufb00 ected existing resource management practices.21 O\ufb03 cially, low population density in the hills and over-population in the plains were used as the justi\ufb01 cation for the re-settlement. However, the underlying motive is believed to have been to outnumber the indigenous peoples and to \u2018pacify\u2019 their resistance movement and demands for autonomy, as stated by several CHT researchers (Roy, 1997b; Arens, 1997; Adnan, 2004; Mohsin, 2002; Halim & Roy, 2005). Respondents at the various workshop meetings and in focus group discussions held in the presence of the researchers claimed that the re-settlement of Bengalis had led to illegal encroachment on indigenous peoples\u2019 land, sometimes through the use of false or fraudulent land documents. Th e then government had decided to allot a combination of hillside lands, plain and paddy lands, and gently slopping or \u2018bumpy lands\u2019 to the migrants. However, the Bengali migrants were not interested in hillside lands because they were not acquainted with hillside farming techniques, which are radically di\ufb00 erent from irrigation-oriented plough farming in the plains. However, CHT did not have much plain and bumpy land available; what little there is was already under the ownership and occupation of CHT residents, both indigenous and Bengali (Roy, 1997: 172). Th us what happened was that the settlers came to gradually re-settle themselves on plainlands and gently sloping lands that were already occupied by local hillpeople, and owned by them on the basis of formal private titles or customary law. In many instances, land-grabbing involved violence, in which state security forces have been directly implicated. Tens of thousands of indigenous peoples were forced to seek shelter in the remoter hill and forest areas, themselves causing pressure on existing inhabitants of those areas and depleting the available resources (Roy, 2002; Roy, 2004b).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5374fcb-d90d-443b-8833-23ef26535211": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5374fcb-d90d-443b-8833-23ef26535211", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "96751cbd012ddb35c71606b0a9fc172be6f277539e17a1e7c369e12550992dd0"}, "2": {"node_id": "13c5eff4-6e0d-4152-be1c-41adadb814da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d1f0d509294d8311c09f7b2c6b5c5b34af9ece53e8902bfa68df9b76ce8da30f"}}, "hash": "eedee4e64b725207e59e80e6839c0d1a35d967493c8a9e54a42bb09d8ea41f89", "text": "Th e settlers were given between 2.5 acres and 5 acres of land, and support in the forms of rations (Hume, 2003) which is still being continued today; while the internally displaced are provided with no such assistance.

Th e overall impact of the trans-migration programme upon the ecology and natural resources of the region was 91 Bangladesh hugely destructive, leading to deforestation, over-cultivation, inadequate use of fertilizers, hill-cutting, landslides and soil erosion, and the contamination of rivers, lakes and other aquifers (Chakma & Hill, 1995). 7.5 Re-Empowering Customary Management Systems Strengthening customary management systems is the best way to reduce tension between state and customary systems, create synergy, and facilitate sustainable management. Th e huge depletion of natural resources in Bangladesh, especially in the reserved forests and other state-managed forests and other natural resources, has gone hand in hand with centralized decision-making and a visibly weakened role of indigenous peoples in resource management. Among the clearest manifestations of this is the 2000 amendment to the Forest Act of 1927 (Halim, 1999; Roy, 2002b; Roy, 2004). Th is is not a mere coincidence and the main reason is not di\ufb03 cult to \ufb01 nd. Where the rights and interests of the local communities are denied, and where their livelihood security is precarious, they can hardly be blamed if they fail to take measures to protect something that no longer \u2018belongs\u2019 to them. Even where some of their members are party to unsustainable use, or \u2018sale\u2019 of produce of such forests, it is a response to the situation in which they have been placed. Th e aforesaid di\ufb03 culties and defects in centralized state forest and natural resource management are not unknown to central policy-making institutions in Bangladesh and elsewhere. In fact, a number of policy shifts have taken place at international and national levels to de-centralize natural resource management practices, particularly in forestry and related \ufb01 elds. Th e most important international developments in this regard include the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, the Convention on Biological Diversity (including the special Working Groups on Access and Bene\ufb01 t Sharing and on Genetic Resources) that followed the Rio process, and the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests. At the national levels, some of these developments resulted in a more \u2018participatory\u2019 mode of forest and natural resource management, albeit with deep \ufb02 aws. In South Asia, since the 1980s, we have seen the introduction of new models of forestry that were ostensibly far more participatory than before, including \u2018community forestry\u2019 (CF) programmes in Nepal, the \u2018Joint Forest Programmes\u2019 (JFM) in India, and \u2018participatory forestry\u2019 (PF) and \u2018social forestry\u2019 (SF) programmes in Bangladesh. Th e PF, and later, SF, programmes in Bangladesh did provide villagers, including a small number of indigenous people in the plains region, with a stake in the forests, but this did not alter the manner in which the government-owned forests \u2013 particularly the reserved forests \u2013 were managed. Th e latter 92 Bridging The Gap remained as state-centric as before, and despite some minor concessions to participatory modes of forest management that were acknowledged in policy documents \u2013 such as in the National Forest policies of 1979 and 1994 and in the Forestry Master Plan \u2013 they have largely failed to include indigenous people. In many situations where indigenous communities were left in charge of managing their natural resources, including small forests, water bodies, grazing lands, etc \u2013 largely on account of the locations\u2019 remoteness or because the lands were not state-owned \u2013 the resources were seen to be far better managed than in the case of the state-managed lands and forests. Such successful examples include mauza forest commons or VCFs and small streams among Chakma villagers in Rangamati district (Halim & Roy, 2006) and bison grazing grounds among the Bawm, Khumi, Mro and Tripura in the highlands of the Bandarban-Rangamati border (Roy, 2004 & 2006). Such successful utilization of indigenous knowledge systems proves that acknowledgement of the \u2018traditional scienti\ufb01 c knowledge\u2019 of indigenous communities in Agenda 21 (at Chapter 26) and in the Convention on Biological Diversity (particularly article 8j) has a continuing utility.

In the CHT, one of the best ways to do this would be to provide stronger recognition to the customary resource rights of the indigenous peoples following the examples already contained in the CHT Regulation of 1900 and within the broad ambit of such recognition as provided in the CHT Land Disputes Resolution Commission Act of 2001 and in the CHT Regulation (Amendment) Act of 2003. Moreover, section 28 of the Forest Act of 1927 may be invoked to assign rights of government to RF-inhabiting communities, both in the CHT, and in some of the adivasi-inhabited parts of the plains regions (such as in the northwestern, north-central and northeastern Bangladesh). Th is provision is far more equitable towards indigenous communities, and far more likely to result in successfully promoting state-indigenous forestry, than the over-centralized and bureaucratized system currently practiced by the Forest Department. Such acknowledgement of existing rights and active inclusion of indigenous peoples must be attuned to their development needs. Th ese priorities may vary from people to people and may also depend upon such factors as education, location (rural/urban), economic situation (class) and sex, among others. Some of the most important issues would include those that were mentioned in the Rangamati Declaration of 199822 that came out of the \ufb01 rst people\u2019s conference on development in the CHT after the signing of the CHT Accord in 1997 (see Appendix II). Among these, the following are regarded as extremely crucial: \u2022 Just resolution to land dispossession by non-indigenous settlers \u2022 Autonomy and self-government \u2022 Protection of land and resource rights 94 Bridging The Gap \u2022 Health \u2022 Human development (education for all, capacity-raising of NGOs) \u2022 Protection of language and culture 8.2 Advocacy In order to resolve land rights disputes in the CHT, it is important to develop e\ufb00 ective strategies and tools for advocacy both at the national and international levels. National level advocacy programmes should focus on the implementation of the CHT Accord, and of the recommendations made in the PRSP and other relevant strategy documents. Strengthening the capacity of both informal (headman, karbari and other community level organizations) and formal institutions on customary laws and practices would enhance advocacy goals. International advocacy should aim to make e\ufb00 ective use of the international intergovernmental processes, including the mechanisms of the UN human rights treaty bodies, the Human Rights Council, and the o\ufb03 ces of Special UN Rapporteurs. Th ese should in particular refer to customary laws and practices, including the CHT Regulation of 1900, and crucial provisions of the CHT Accord and post-Accord laws, and international treaties rati\ufb01 ed by Bangladesh, all of which are an agreed part of the Bangladeshi political and legal system. Strengthening existing networks and creating further networks would further enhance progress in this regard. Given the situation of extreme political, social and economic disadvantage su\ufb00 ered by most indigenous peoples, this needs to be an integral strategy perspective over the long term. 8.3 Policy Reform & Implementation of Policies Th ere are di\ufb00 ering perspectives on the need for policy reform and policy implementation. Indigenous peoples put high emphasis on recognition of customary laws and practices, especially upon those that remain wholly or partially unacknowledged. Land and forest o\ufb03 cials, on the other hand, along with senior level political leaders and functionaries in Dhaka, have little or no understanding about natural resource management issues in areas outside those that are managed directly by the Department of Forest. Th us, their views on policy and policy implementation are largely ad hoc, and remain as an obstacle in this regard. Th is will have to be remedied by e\ufb00 orts to sensitize the district and national- 95 Bangladesh level land and forest administration departments, and political leaders. However, to what extent such support can be mobilized into action on policy reform will depend partly on the strength of the advocacy measures and partly upon the politics of the day. Further, the implementation of policies in several areas may need to be complemented by detailed administrative guidelines, particularly on account of the absence of knowledge on indigenous culture, and the presence of discriminotory attitudes of non-indigenous o\ufb03 cials in government positions.

Th ere must be acknowledgement of indigenous people\u2019s contributions towards the country\u2019s political, social, economic and cultural integrity and its development process, in the o\ufb03 cial versions of the national histories and in other national discourses and public information systems. Government functionaris with major responsibilities on poicy areas impacting on indigenous peoples should be provided with exposure to the reality of indigenous culture, history, life style, etc. State media should provide accurate information on indigenous peoples\u2019 social and economic contribution to the state, and information on indigenous knowledge in NRM. Private media should be encouraged to provide similar levels of accuracy. 8.5 Enhancing the Role of Indigenous Peoples Th e role of indigenous peoples in the formal development process has been peripheral at best. Th is needs to be addressed through institutional reforms and capacity-raising initiatives. First is the representation of indigenous peoples (both men and women), in decision-making, policy reforms and in programme implementation. Th is could be encouraged and ensured through legal and institutional reforms. Second is an adaptive approach in participation that would account for the positive aspects of indigenous knowledge systems related to NRM. 8.5.1 Role of Traditional Leaders Th e other major challenge is, at least in some cases, the pre-eminence of the traditional leaders (the mauza headman or the village karbari, as the case might be), which in some instances caused or contributed to con\ufb02 icts of social class or interests. Th ere were also contrary examples where the community voluntarily sought to involve the headman or the karbari because of kinship unity or his close links with or in\ufb02 uence over the community and district and sub-district senior administrative bodies. Th us, the role of the traditional leaders was seen to have both positive and negative features. Th e major challenge, which may be said to be an amalgam of the above problems, is the decision-making process that appears far less participatory than is needed, especially since discussions at most committee meetings tend to be dominated by a few individuals, particularly men. However, to what extent the non-participation of some in the verbal 97 Bangladesh deliberations of the NRM meetings can actually re\ufb02 ect their marginality or not, cannot be understood in-depth without further enquiry.

Strong local-level organizations like Taungya and others are important. Pro-people and grassroots-based NGOs can play a strong role in NRM as long as they maintain the requisite balance between inaction and overly active interventions that weaken local self-dependent e\ufb00 orts. Such e\ufb00 orts could act as a strong corollary to the communities\u2019 own e\ufb00 orts to bringing further strengthening and \u2018equitization\u2019 of the indigenous committees (Halim & Roy, 2004). Mru swidden fallow Photo: Chris Erni 98 Bridging The Gap 8.5.3 Role of National NGOs Th e role of national NGOs in the CHT is quite complex and generally have little or nothing to do with NRM. Th e orientation of several national NGOs, and micro- credit institutions (like IDF), around the disbursement and collection of micro-credit show visible concentration in urban and peri-urban settlements (particular in Bengali settlements) \u2013 with little relation to NRM activities \u2013 and absence or marginal presence in rural and remote areas. Given the lack of knowledge and experience of national NGOs regarding CHT culture and topography, perhaps this is a mixed blessing. As in the case of government agencies, national NGOs too need to be sensitized prior to starting operations in indigenous-inhabited areas. Th e NGO Bureau Guidelines of the Prime Minister\u2019s O\ufb03 ce o\ufb00 er a basis for such guidance and direction. 8.6 Promoting Gender and Class Equity in NRM Bringing about gender equity in NRM in the short term will be di\ufb03 cult without committed support from other actors, including political, social and community leaders, local NGOs and national NGOs due to longstanding gender-insensitive practices based on customary beliefs, religious and social conservatism, or otherwise, but it is a matter that requires consistent and urgent attention. Many policies on indigenous women are aimed at the atypical cases of discrimination faced by ethnic Bengali women in the plains regions. Since the social, cultural and economic contexts in the hill areas and other regions inhabited by indigenous peoples is so di\ufb00 erent, many of these laws and policies are not appropriate for preventing discrimination against indigenous women. Th e inadequacies of these policies are however seldom recognised in the national discourses on women\u2019s rights, which are dominated by concerns for Bengali speaking and Muslim women, without accounting for the problems faced by minority and indigenous women (Halim, 2002). Other important interventions should be made to address the human rights issues of adivasi women who are under-represented in political bodies and local and regional councils; and the lack of funds, necessary for mobilization drives. Awareness about the negatively discriminatory inheritance laws towards women belonging to the most of the ethnic groups in the CHT also need to be raised. It could be \ufb01 nally noted that many actors \u2013 including human right workers, development planners, and social scientists \u2013 believe that it would be useful to have comprehensive 99 Bangladesh policy regarding the lands and other natural resources of the region to ensure equitable and environmentally sound resource use and practice. It calls for elements of participatory justice (Alston, 2001) as it has become clear that without the involvement indigenous peoples proper implementation of strategies would be useless. Th erefore, any new policies that are framed will need to be carried out with the indigenous peoples, including farmers, women, community leaders, and government o\ufb03 cials. In any such reforms, the importance of traditional natural resource management process need to be acknowledged as far they are appropriate to the socio-economic and cultural needs of CHT today. Policy reforms also need to be cautious to incorporate representation on the basis of ethnicity, class and gender.

Indigenous Natural Resource Management System 2.1 Concepts and Principles of Indigenous Natural Resource Management Indigenous peoples of Cambodia have their own traditional concepts and principles of natural resource management, which are still practiced today. Some communities have adapted their system to the changes brought about by statutory laws and policies, as well as to the growing changes within their societies. Indigenous communities still maintain clear territorial boundaries between community lands, and community members do not allow strangers to use community land, although any individual may hunt on the territory of other villages. For example, people from highland villages in Ratanakiri do not allow other villages to establish rotational agricultural farms within their territory. Indigenous peoples in Mondolkiri Province, as well as a number of other provinces, do however allow other villagers to use their land for rotational agriculture and to collect products from their community forest, but anyone using neighboring land in this manner need to get prior permission from the traditional village leader. In most cases, however, families have enough resources from their own land or around their own village. If inter-marriage occurs, and the couple has no land, they can approach the village elders or their relatives to request their own plot. Th e couple are normally allowed to collect non-timber resources for their own use without getting permission from the village elder. 118 Bridging The Gap Box 1: Indigenous Resource Management Traditionally, the land is owned by the community but each family has access to resources and to their own plot of land. Th is arrangement is governed by a group of elders. Each community has clear boundaries associated with a stream, mountain, rock or big tree. Farm lands are divided and demarcated and encroachment on other peoples\u2019 farms is not allowed. Traditionally, people from di\ufb00 erent villages are not allowed to draw water from a given pool if one village has been granted rights over that pool. Communities also used to relocate their settlement and farming when they were confronted with diseases or disasters or when the population became too big. Pat Chan Seng, Tampoun from Patang commune, Lumpath District Communally-owned lands are further sub-divided into several individually managed plots. Each family within the community decides on the type of crops and varieties depending on the soil to ensure they adequately meet diverse food needs and to manage the farm work throughout the year. Th e family also uses their plots for di\ufb00 erent needs. For example, plots for long-term crops are also used to graze livestock.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d15e1025-1a66-4bf1-b530-ccefe85613c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "d15e1025-1a66-4bf1-b530-ccefe85613c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "983a8eb0bdd62f6d12cddfa739a95775a712b2c58f66d26daa94f3ee6a459dfe"}, "2": {"node_id": "a94ba1b2-49d3-40e8-8f06-dc2fe9a3fc04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a2687f95e46ed6db3ceae2daef9ab5d63a95ebebf80c73a7d81bcda5a0303ab"}}, "hash": "1129d86a6dd48c05c670033aa545583e80cf56760926edc77f2f0376a02c432b", "text": "For example, plots for long-term crops are also used to graze livestock.

Institutional structures and mechanisms exist, such as traditional land laws, to govern such a system. Th e example below shows how land use is governed by traditional customs and institutions of the Brao, Kavet, Kreung and Lun peoples, a system similar to that of other indigenous peoples in Cambodia. 119 Cambodia Box 2: Concepts and Institutions of Land Management of Brao People Land use is governed by a Brao custom called \u201ctang gup\u201d. Th e concept of tang gup is an important spatial taboo for the Brao, Kavet, Kreung and Lun, and it is fundamental for understanding their land use patterns. It explains the cultural signi\ufb01 cance of traditional boundaries, and the way they are delineated. It also explains why Brao villages tend to move in one direction up one side of a stream, and then move back down the other. It is important not only on a village-to- village basis, but also within communities. Th e concept of tang gup prevents someone from one village practicing swidden farming in the territory of another village. Th e concept also governs how swidden agriculture plots are distributed within the village area, as a person cannot have one active swidden plot on one side of a recent fallow area, and another active plot on its other side. Th is would be considered tang gup and could lead to poor harvests, a cut foot or even being bitten by a poisonous snake when crossing the fallow. It is also considered to be tang gup if someone has to pass through another person\u2019s active swidden to reach the stream where they regularly bath, reach wood resin trees that they regularly tap, or even to dig wild potatoes in the forest. Tang gup also applies for a family who eat rice from the same pot to have one active swidden on one side of a stream, and another on the other side. A sophisticated body of traditional law, which governs all aspects of Brao society, backs up these traditional beliefs. For example, every village has at least one traditional judge, called Ya Weu. Th ese individuals are elders who are considered by their communities to be fair-minded, good talkers, and with a good understanding of legal precedent. Th ere are also senior judges that may be called in to deal with particularly di\ufb03 cult cases which standard Ya Weu cannot deal with, and may be called in to make decisions on cases in other villages when the judge for that particular village agrees. A brief description of how this traditional legal system operates illustrates how organized it is: Th e Brao recognize plainti\ufb00 s, called Me Drenij, and defendants, called Me bij kadee. When a Ya Weu makes a decision regarding a case, they are expected to base it on oral precedent, from the di\ufb00 erent eras of government, such as the Th ai, French, Japanese, Sihanouk, Khmer Rouge, State of Cambodia and the present. Th is legal code is part of an oral tradition that is passed from generation to generation and from Ya Weu to Ya Weu. Th erefore, Ya Weu will have a younger assistant who attends cases with the practicing Ya Weu so that they can learn from the senior judge, and eventually take over the job when the senior elder either dies or is too old to continue practicing. Ironside and Baird, 2003 120 Bridging The Gap Judicial matters on indigenous resource management are often the responsibility of traditional village leaders. Traditional village leaders often work with other elders in the community to ensure community members abide by customary laws on the collection of medicines, land use, hunting and respect traditional rules prohibiting wrong actions such as killing someone, couples living together before marriage and other wrong actions. Although such traditional structures still exist and are very much respected in most indigenous communities in Cambodia, there is often confusion when the government appoints Commune Councils regarding the relationship between these two institutions that now exist at the same time in communities. In the eyes of the community, there is now a hierarchy between the traditional village leaders and commune councils. A number of traditional village leaders within the commune are under the administrative control of the commune council \u2013 but even though", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf491081-3cc2-49e4-a330-6d029f45912b": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf491081-3cc2-49e4-a330-6d029f45912b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31644e79d8b06c4f4fbfdb82b27f8c91132d3e7082ed83b1ae2f469791e913ab"}, "3": {"node_id": "187a9ac7-3924-4190-a664-bddce8f15fdb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "320c622e1585bb2aa5ba5fd715d16997a039cc0007207ca498784b8d673c51e5"}}, "hash": "462fb02b957879671c5b0c94c48c7c4f6790f3a1d656cc7b805519bbdd73b6c0", "text": "the commune councils are elected, they are perceived to be promoting the interests of the government.

For example, a human life is considered to be worth 12 bu\ufb00 aloes, and if someone were to make a large wildlife trap in the forest nearby, without telling other villagers, and then a person got caught in the trap and was killed, the owner of the trap would be required to pay half the value of a person, or six bu\ufb00 aloes, to the family of the dead person. However, if the trap owner had informed the community about the trap in advance, he would have to pay one third of the value of a human life, or four bu\ufb00 aloes. Cold-blooded murder requires a penalty of three times the value of a human life, or the equivalent of 36 bu\ufb00 aloes. If an unmarried young woman becomes pregnant, the family of the man who impregnated her would have to supply a pig and a jar of rice wine for the spirits. If the man did not agree to marry her, he would have to pay six bu\ufb00 aloes or six sets of traditional musical gongs. If someone became guilty of tang gup, they would have to pay for the cost of sacri\ufb01 ces required in case somebody was injured or became ill as a result of the mistake. Ironside and Baird, 2003 2.3 Indigenous Practices in Natural Resource Management 2.3.1 Agricultural Land Management Indigenous community members recognize the need to minimize the impact and allow su\ufb03 cient time for forest regeneration by rotating farm plots and maintaining evenly dispersed populations rather than concentrating settlements in one area. Swidden plots are farmed for three to \ufb01 ve years and then left fallow for eight to 10 years, re-opening the original \ufb01 elds only after the forest and soil have su\ufb03 ciently regenerated. Di\ufb00 erent crop varieties are planted in di\ufb00 erent plots depending on their age, soil type, etc. Th is allows for longer harvest times, shorter hunger gaps, more e\ufb00 ective exploitation of plant variety, spreading risk of seasonal variations, etc. Longer term crops are also cultivated in the fallows and they are used as grazing areas. 122 Bridging The Gap Box 4: Indigenous Agricultural Management Indigenous agricultural systems consist of short rotation of swidden agriculture along the edges of mountains, streams and rivers. Generally, people did not cut swiddens far from the stream, as doing so makes it di\ufb03 cult to access water. Depending on the area, people would spend \ufb01 ve to 10 years moving up one side of a stream, and then they would change sides and start working their way back down, or they would change stream valleys and start working their way down the new valley. When the village centre became too far away from the swidden plots, it would be moved in front of current swidden areas. It took about 10-20 years to return to the same location. Bamboo re-growth is preferred for swidden agriculture, because soil fertility is restored in six years or less and a large amount of ash is produced after burning. Local people therefore have bene\ufb01 ted from the \u201chumanized ecosystems\u201d that they have created. Ironside and Baird, 2003 2.3.2 Wildlife Management Th e diverse activities and land-use of indigenous peoples in Cambodia supports the mosaic of habitat types that is important for maintaining wildlife.

Th ere is a limit on the number of animals allowed to be killed during a group hunt, while only one animal is allowed during individual or family hunting trips. Animals are divided among community members, thus discouraging over-hunting. It is considered a taboo to mix more than one animal species when cooking. Every family and even a whole village prohibit a certain animal to be killed or hunted, as these animals are considered their kanchang or \u201chelper\u201d. Taboos and rituals are a very important part of indigenous hunting traditions and can be seen as wildlife management. Omens and other beliefs are grounds for controlling over-hunting since the hunter is not allowed to proceed with his hunting trips if he observes anything unusual. 123 Cambodia Box 5: Practices and Beliefs in Wildlife Management Many families and often whole Tampuon villages do not hunt bears. Th ere is a story that bears fought tigers to protect our villages. It is also believed that in the old days, bears brought food to villagers and even taught them how to start a \ufb01 re. Even now, according to my father, you can still coach a bear to get honey from very tall trees. Wanai Lieng, Tampuon 2.3.3 Biodiversity Management Th e use of medicinal plants is still practiced as part of indigenous health systems in Cambodia, and both young and old people believe that only the use of traditional herbs can cure certain ailments. Medicinal plants are mainly collected from forest areas that are conserved by communities for such purposes. Forest spirits are believed to be protectors of these areas and only old or knowledgeable herbalists, mostly women, are allowed to collect medicinal plants. Families who are in need of medicines from the protected forest area must \ufb01 rst ask the elders who will then advise them on how much they may collect and how to collect these medicinal plants. Communities still believe that they should not sell these medicines, nor should they give them to outsiders - those found doing so can be punished. An intricate system of seed sharing and exchange still exists. For example, if a person desires to get some seeds from another person, a knife, a chicken or a pig must be given in exchange. However, if the owner of seeds can no longer maintain the seeds but considers them precious, the seeds may be given to a person who has \u201cgood hands\u201d (i.e. a successful seed breeder) without expecting anything in exchange. Most families consider the best way of ensuring continual seed supply is by simply maintaining a small garden plot or patches. Many plants species are also protected through a similar belief system to that which governs actions impacting on wild animals. For example, there is a belief that bamboo protects communities during wars by magically encircling whole villages, thus hiding it from enemies. Some communities do not allow any cutting of bamboo, and if a person passes such a community with cut bamboo, they can be \ufb01 ned. Certain tree species are also prohibited from being used as building materials based on stories of natural disasters that once happened when such species were used. Th ese stories and beliefs are signi\ufb01 cant with respect to management of biodiversity. 124 Bridging The Gap 2.3.4 Water and Aquatic Life Management It is common among indigenous communities in Cambodia to protect forests immediately surrounding springs and water sources. For lakes and rivers, community members are only allowed to use \ufb01 shing methods that do not deplete \ufb01 sh resources, such as hooks and lines. Outsiders are not allowed to \ufb01 sh in lakes or rivers that are within the boundaries of a community. To ensure a constant supply of \ufb01 sh, communities prohibit the cutting down of fruit trees that are known to be a good source of food for aquatic life. 2.4 Intergenerational Transfer of Knowledge Most of Cambodia\u2019s indigenous communities still live in a traditional setting, placing importance on elders and kinship systems. Natural resource management is part of the daily life of people, with transfer of knowledge a daily occurrence. Each night, young people will gather in the house of elders or a knowledgeable person, bringing tobacco as gifts, in exchange for stories and anecdotes. Young people and even children are free to ask questions. Daily, children and youth \u201clearn by doing\u201d through the examples of the elders and family members.

Box 6: Learning by Doing Community leaders and families pass traditional knowledge to their kin during ceremonies and rituals. Use of certain plants, vegetables and animals that are restricted by taboo are taught to children from a young age. Weavers, blacksmiths and farmers also pass their skills and knowledge to anyone in the community who wishes to learn by joining in the work and through practice. Pieces of land along streams, water catchments areas and mountain areas with big rocks and big trees are considered to be governed by spirits and so opening of farming areas in such places is prohibited.

Pat Chan Seng, Tampuon from Patang village, Patang commune, Lumpath District 125 Cambodia Th e settling of disputes, such as land and resource con\ufb02 icts, is usually conducted in community halls or in the houses of the elders in the community. Again young people are allowed to listen and to ask questions. Transfer of knowledge is not limited to the village chiefs and elders but also those who hold knowledge and are good at presenting messages and information to other members of the community. Parents and grandparents, as well as siblings, are responsible for providing guidance and advice on natural resource management. 3. Legal and Policy Framework on Natural Resource Management 3.1 Natural Resource Management Laws and Policies in Cambodia Article 59 of the Constitution of Cambodia states, \u201cTh e State shall protect the environment and balance of abundant natural resources and establish a precise plan of management of land, water, air, wind, geology, ecological systems, mines, energy, petrol and gas, rocks and sand, gems, forests and forestrial (sic) products, wildlife, \ufb01 sh and aquatic resources\u201d (italics added). Th e framework of laws in Cambodia is hierarchical in structure, each deriving its authority from the law placed above it. Th e Constitution as the supreme law in Cambodia is the backbone of all other laws, which must conform with it (Article 131). Next down the hierarchy come laws passed by the National Assembly and Senate called Chhbab. Below these are the Royal Decrees or Reach-Kret followed by the Sub-Decrees or Anu-Kret. Pursuant to the Constitution, a Royal Decree is signed by the King (or Head of State as the case may be) for a list of very speci\ufb01 c tasks after being proposed by the Council of Ministers. Th e Sub-Decrees are drafted by a single ministry or in collaboration with other ministries over competent subject matters, to implement and clarify the Chhbab further, Aerial view of Ratanakiri Province Photo: Graeme Brown 126 Bridging The Gap and is signed by the Prime Minister and the Minister(s) in charge of implementation, upon approval of the Sub-Decree by the Council of Ministers. Further down the hierarchy are the Prakas, which also clarify and set out implementation guidelines for laws. Like the Sub-Decrees they are drafted by the Ministry responsible for the subject matter but with a much more limited scope. However, in the case of the Prakas, they can be signed into e\ufb00 ect by the Minister(s) in charge of the ministry having competence over the subject matter without having to go to the Council of Ministers. In that sense, they are much easier to bring into e\ufb00 ect than Sub-Decrees. Th e next in line is the Circular or Sarachor which are issued by the Prime Minister or relevant minister to instruct, clarify and further explain legal or regulatory provisions. Finally comes the Deika, which are orders given by the provincial governors or commune councils, e\ufb00 ective only within the geographical region under their authority. While there are many laws and policies governing natural resource management in Cambodia, most appear to be ambiguous, contradictory and sometimes di\ufb03 cult to access. Th ey are certainly not the realization of the vision recorded in Article 59 of the Constitution. It is also the case that some subjects have a number of laws and policies enacted and formulated (sometimes in contradiction with each other) while some do not have any. For instance, land as an area of policy and law-making seems to attract a lot of attention. Besides the Land Law of 2001, there are a few sub-decrees already issued under it, yet other important subject matters for natural resource management, such as wildlife conservation, are discussed only in four articles in the Forest Law of 2002.9 Th e Land Law of 2001, the Forest", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f50cc704-fdab-4980-9585-464e57c72498": {"__data__": {"id_": "f50cc704-fdab-4980-9585-464e57c72498", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f5c296f712fee2d03fcc8067cc7b1077ca095f4d2e138c42a56eb5ffde1c2b24"}, "3": {"node_id": "20639d82-8e71-4007-aff2-d3ada39f0e78", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d0361eb7c90723464c7661783936fd05473b1c2ee89dcc9bca8ac93f35dad106"}}, "hash": "b79a1f816bc17629b51d06ecd46d383a2a6e59bb1a6dde9212ec3f150f5d5fe7", "text": "Law of 2002, and the law on Commune/Sangkat Administrative Management of 2001 are some of the laws that have signi\ufb01 cance for indigenous peoples and natural resource management (including Royal Decrees and Sub- Decrees). Above all of these is the Constitution which is important to include in the analysis as the expression of the country\u2019s overall intentions for the management of the natural resources found in the country. 3.1.1 Th e Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia According to Article 44 of the Constitution, \u201cAll persons, individually or collectively, shall have the right to ownership. Only Khmer legal entities and citizens of Khmer nationality shall have the right to own land. Legal private ownership shall be protected by law. Th e right to con\ufb01 scate possessions from any person shall be exercised only in the public interest as provided for under law and shall require fair and just compensation in advance\u201d. Th e 127 Cambodia Constitution makes it clear that private citizens and legal entities enjoy the right to own property, notably land. Although it is implied, it is not clear whether indigenous groups as a collective can claim this right. (See also Section 1: Indigenous Peoples of Cambodia). Th e Constitution goes further on state land than it does on private (individual and collective) ownership. In a catch-all provision in Article 58 the Constitution provides that, \u201cState property notably comprises land, mineral resources, mountains, sea, underwater, continental shelf, coastline, airspace, islands, rivers, canals, streams, lakes, forests, natural resources, economic and cultural centers, bases for national defense and other facilities determined as State property. Th e control, use and management of State properties shall be determined by law\u201d (italics added).1 Th e italicized words, on a plain reading of the provision, indicate that the types of property listed are not exhaustive and if the State so wants, it has the power to include other natural resources within the de\ufb01 nition of or to de\ufb01 ne the scope of state property. Th is they have done through legislation such as the Land Law of 2001. Th e next provision, Article 59, requires the state to protect the environment and natural resources by establishing a precise plan of action. 3.1.2 Law on Environmental Protection and Natural Resource Management Th e \ufb01 rst Law on Environmental Protection and Natural Resources Management was prepared by the Ministry of Environment (MoE) between 1993 and 1995 and was passed by the National Assembly on 24 December 1996. In the legal hierarchy, this law is the 1 Article 58, Constitution of Cambodia. 1 Article 58, Constitution of Cambodia. Preparing for transplanting paddy seedlings, Ratanakiri Province Photo: Nang Noy 128 Bridging The Gap supreme legal instrument governing environmental protection and natural resources management.11 However, the law is very general and does not provide the speci\ufb01 c guidance needed, setting out only a basic overall framework based on sustainable and natural resources management. Amongst other things, the law provides for the formulation of a National and Regional Environmental Plan (Article 2) for environmental protection and sustainable natural resource management (Article 3). Th e law requires Environmental Impact Assessments to be conducted for any project, for which the procedures is determined by a sub-decree promulgated in 1999 (Article 6). Echoing Article 58 of the Constitution, the law de\ufb01 nes natural resources of the Kingdom of Cambodia as including land, water, airspace, air, geology, ecological systems, mines, energy, petroleum and gas, rocks and sand, precious stones, forests and forest products, wildlife, \ufb01 sh, and aquatic resources, which it states \u201cshall be conserved, developed, and managed and used in a rational and sustainable manner\u201d (italics added).12 Activities related to the conservation, development, management or use of natural resources must be sustainable (Article 10), and if it is found that such activities are not sustainable, then the MoE shall inform the concerned ministries undertaking the activities (Article 11). Th e law also has a provision regarding participation of the public in protecting and managing natural resources (Article 16). However, the wording of the provision is not strong enough to require participation from the public, providing only recommendations that it should be done. Besides this, the law also contains a few penal provisions as well as the creation of an environment endowment fund for environmental protection and natural resource conservation. 3.1.3 Land Law 2001 and Land Policies Before the Land Law of 2001 came into being, the Land Law of 1992 was in force.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20639d82-8e71-4007-aff2-d3ada39f0e78": {"__data__": {"id_": "20639d82-8e71-4007-aff2-d3ada39f0e78", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f5c296f712fee2d03fcc8067cc7b1077ca095f4d2e138c42a56eb5ffde1c2b24"}, "2": {"node_id": "f50cc704-fdab-4980-9585-464e57c72498", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b79a1f816bc17629b51d06ecd46d383a2a6e59bb1a6dde9212ec3f150f5d5fe7"}}, "hash": "d0361eb7c90723464c7661783936fd05473b1c2ee89dcc9bca8ac93f35dad106", "text": "Th is law, based on the culture and land-use practices of lowland Cambodians, did not re\ufb02 ect the concept of communal land ownership of indigenous peoples.

After an intensive period of study and public debate, a draft law was developed with funding from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Th is draft Land Law was approved by the National Assembly and the Senate and signed by the King on August 30, 2001.13 Th e Land Law of 2001 has 268 articles divided into 19 chapters. Of these, Articles 23 129 Cambodia to 28 in Part II, Chapter 3, entitled \u201cCommunal Ownership or Communal Property\u201d, have direct and important signi\ufb01 cance for indigenous peoples as they set out the basis for land ownership by indigenous communities in Cambodia. Th e chapter starts by de\ufb01 ning \u201cindigenous community\u201d in Article 23.14 Article 24 seeks to further de\ufb01 ne membership in an indigenous community.15 Article 25, seeking to identify indigenous communities\u2019 lands, provides that they are \u201clands where the said communities have established their residences and where they carry out traditional agriculture\u201d and includes \u201cnot only lands actually cultivated but also includes reserves necessary for the shifting of cultivation\u201d as per their traditional agricultural practice. In many cases where land is owned by the community and where traditional shifting cultivation is practiced, land may be left fallow for a number of years. Because of the non-recognition of such land use patterns and the inclination towards a concept of individual property ownership and use superseding the collective concept, con\ufb02 icts often arise. As such, this Article is particularly signi\ufb01 cant for its recognition of community lands to include lands for shifting cultivation in addition to residential and other agricultural lands. However the quali\ufb01 cation in the provision that such lands should be those \u201crecognized by the administrative authorities\u201d weakens the provision immensely as it gives the administrative authorities the \ufb01 nal say over demarcating land as belonging to a community or not. Brau crossing river with bamboo raft, Kok Lak Commune, Ratanakiri Province 1998 Photo: Chris Erni 130 Bridging The Gap Th e third paragraph of the same Article gives indigenous communities the right to assert their own claim for land and register for collective title based on negotiations with neighboring villages and authorities \u201caccording to the factual situation as asserted by the communities\u201d.

Article 26 goes on to emphasize and recognize the role of traditional authorities, mechanisms and customs in decision making and exercising the ownership rights of immovable property of the community. In the event that an individual wants to leave the community, an adequate share has to be provided to them (Article 27). However a share that is allotted to such person cannot be from lands that fall under state public property.18 Read together with Article 26, communal title may be claimed even over state public property. Article 28 reiterates the absolute right of indigenous highland peoples to immovable property stating that \u201cNo authority outside the community may acquire any rights to immovable properties belonging to an indigenous community\u201d. Besides these provisions dealing speci\ufb01 cally with lands belonging to indigenous communities, there are other general provisions in the Land Law of 2001 which are of importance. Article 2 classi\ufb01 es immovable property into three types: (i) immovable property by nature; (ii) immovable property by purpose; and (iii) immovable property by law. Of these, immovable property by nature refers to all natural grounds such as forest land, cleared land, land that is cultivated, fallow or uncultivated, land submerged by stagnant or running waters and constructions or improvements \ufb01 rmly a\ufb03 xed to a speci\ufb01 c place created by man and not likely to be moved.

It further goes on to provide that \u201cspeci\ufb01 c laws shall supplement the provisions of this law or shall derogate this law in order to meet socio-economic, land management and urban planning exigencies.\u201d Article 14 envisages two types of property: (i) public property of public legal entities or state public property; and (ii) private property of public legal entities or state private property. Article 15 of the law establishes seven categories of State public property.19 All other forms of property not classi\ufb01 ed as State public property is state private property.20 In e\ufb00 ect, this means that State private land is all land that is, (a) not State public land, and (b) not privately owned. Th e basic distinction between the two is that while state private property can be the subject of sale, exchange, distribution or transfer of rights, state public property is inalienable and ownership of such property is not subject to prescription and also cannot be acquired by the special acquisition provisions of the Land Law of 2001.21 Th e distinction of land as state public and private property becomes signi\ufb01 cant because it a\ufb00 ects the rights and duties of indigenous communities to their lands \u2013 before, during and after the titling process.22 As a result of this classi\ufb01 cation and the resulting di\ufb00 erence in rights and limitations imposed, a number of questions arise. Chief among them is whether state public property, because of its \u201cinalienability\u201d, can be part of the community title as envisaged in the land law? It appears from the overall intent of the law and the wordings used in Chapter 3, and reading other laws such as the forestry law with it, that state public property can indeed be part of indigenous community property. Th is position has been argued by experts on the land issue in Cambodia, but remains in dispute.23 Kreung rice harvest, Kralah village, Ratanakiri Province, 1998 Photo: Chris Erni 132 Bridging The Gap Another signi\ufb01 cant feature of the Land Law of 2001 is its recognition of the impact of the \u201cperiod of crisis from 1975 \u2013 1979\u201d on reconstituting ownership over land and therefore providing for a right in rem over \u201cimmovable property which was recognized since 1989\u201d that \u201cmay lead to the acquisition of ownership by the holder of the property\u201d in accordance with the conditions set by the land law.24 Th e condition for transforming possession into ownership is set out in Article 38, which provides that \u201cin order to transform into ownership of immovable property, the possession shall be unambiguous, non-violent, and notorious to the public, continuous and in good faith\u201d. Th e law is unclear however whether land left fallow as part of the traditional cultivation system constitutes an obstacle to a claim of ownership. In the case of a dispute over immovable property, Article 47 also provides that \u201csuch dispute[s] shall be submitted for investigation and resolution\u2026 Th e results of the investigation shall be submitted to the Cadastral Commission \u2026 (who) shall make a decision on the dispute\u201d. If there is disagreement or dis-satisfaction with the decision made by the Cadastral Commission, the disputants can \ufb01 le complaint to the courts. Th e organization and functioning of the Cadastral Commission is determined by a relevant sub-decree that was promulgated in 2002. Article 69 provides that the transfer of ownership shall be considered valid only upon the registration of the contract of sale with the Cadastral Registry Unit. Th is provision has given rise to some concerns vis-\u00e0-vis the draft Civil Code wherein it is stated in draft Article 133 that in relation to land, the creation, transfer and alteration of a real right shall take e\ufb00 ect in accordance with those agreed upon between the parties. In other words, land can be legally transferred through a contract between the buyer and the seller without the requirement of registration to complete the transaction. Th e Land Law of 2001 sets out important provisions on communal ownership of property, speci\ufb01 cally land, by indigenous communities. Th e law suggests the recognition of prior rights and claims of indigenous peoples over land and its resources. Another positive thing about the law is its recognition of traditional indigenous authorities and their customary law as a valid legal process in the determination of land claims.

It is also true that the Land Law of 2001 is, at times, in con\ufb02 ict with other laws in Cambodia, such as the Forest Law (to be discussed below) and such con\ufb02 icts have yet to be resolved. 133 Cambodia 3.1.4 Th e Forest Law 2002 Cambodia has the largest intact deciduous forests in Southeast Asia and retains a large proportion of its natural forest cover. Th ere are varying estimates on the amount of forest cover remaining, ranging from 30 percent to over 60 percent. Extensive deforestation has taken place since 1992-3, re\ufb02 ecting the lack of e\ufb00 ective forest management plans and ongoing security problems.26 Ever since the early 1990s when concerns were raised about forest cover, the forest sector has seen many changes and transformations. Th e Independent Forest Sector Review summed up these changes and transformations: For international donors, forestry became the emblem of the governance problems facing the Cambodian state\u2026 (with) sustained attempts over nearly a decade to reform the sector and put in place a policy and legal framework that clearly de\ufb01 nes the parameters of the sector. However, the sector has been marked by acute polarization around the problematic issue of concession allocation; abuse of the resource has been serious with evidence of over-logging and corruption. Despite a series of critical reviews, the concession system was accepted by major donors as the most e\ufb00 ective form of institutional arrangement for resource management in Cambodia. Th is acceptance has cast long shadows over the policy debate and management of the sector. In e\ufb00 ect, it has meant that forest policy has become equivalent to the management of forest concessions rather than starting from a broad Tampuen children, Ratanakiri Province Photo: New Savin 134 Bridging The Gap societal viewpoint of agreement around what forest resources there are, how they are to be managed and for whose bene\ufb01 t.27 Some progress has been seen over the last few years. Th e Forestry Law came into force in August 2002, seeking to de\ufb01 ne \u201cthe framework for management, harvesting, use, development and reservation of the forests ... (and) to ensure the sustainable management of forests for their social, economic and environmental bene\ufb01 ts, including conservation of biological diversity and cultural heritage.28 Th e Forestry Law came on the heels of the Statement of the Royal Government on National Forest Policy, an important policy document issued in 2002 which outlines the government\u2019s commitment to conservation and sustainable management goals. Th e Policy designated Cambodia\u2019s remaining forest resources as Permanent Forest Estates to be maintained in perpetuity.29 It has been stated that this Policy is \u201cone of the most important existing pieces of legislation that links to CBNRM [community-based natural resource management] issues. Th is law contains important provisions on traditional use and access rights to forest resources, though these do not include management rights. More important are the provisions that allow for the creation and management of community forests, whereby communities are granted an area of the Permanent Forest Reserve to manage and derive bene\ufb01 ts from\u201d.30 Article 2 ensures traditional user rights of timber products and Non Timber Forest Products for local communities. Article 4 is remarkable in its recognition of \u201cfull public participation in all government decisions that have the potential to impact on concerned communities, livelihoods of local communities and forest resources\u201d (italics added).31 Forest management is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF,32 under which the Forest Administration (FA) is the government institution for implementing the management of forest and forest resources.33 One of the duties of the FA is to \u201cassess boundaries, classify and demarcate forests in order to establish a land use map of the Permanent Forest Estate in coordination with MLMUPC, local authorities and communities\u201d (italics added).34 Th is provision is signi\ufb01 cant for its mandating of coordination between the two governmental agencies, as it should reduce competing interest between them, a problem which has plagued forest management in the past. Similar mandates can be found in other provisions in the same law, and in this it is an improvement over the Land Law, where such cooperation is not speci\ufb01 cally mentioned. Th e FA is also required under the law to \u201cprepare a National Forest Management Plan with broad public participation of all authorities and communities concerned\u201d.35 Under the law, Permanent Forest Estate is categorized into Permanent Forest Reserve and Private Forest.

For example, community forestry and communal land titling should go together to ensure that the intrinsic links between swidden agriculture and forest use are maintained with integrity.40 Article 15 and 16 also seem to support the contention that indigenous community title can be given over forest lands demarcated as state public property, by providing that activities of a concessionaire should not interfere with the customary user rights taking place on the land of indigenous communities and the customary access and user rights practiced by communities residing within, or adjacent to, concessions. Another indication of continuing title can be found within Article 37, which provides that local communities that traditionally practice shifting cultivation may conduct such practices on the lands of indigenous communities registered with the State. At the same time, Article 37 restricts recognition of swidden agriculture where it demands a sub- decree to delineate forest areas in which swidden agriculture can occur. An independent review of the forestry sector in Cambodia observed, \u201cthis appears to imply that the prior allocation of land under the Land Law under communal title is an important step prior to any demarcation of forest land under the Permanent Forest Reserve (PFR). If the PFR Tampuen village, Yeak Lom Commune, Ratanakiri Province, 1998 Photo: Chris Erni 136 Bridging The Gap demarcation precedes the Land Law communal titling, it is likely that indigenous peoples will have their access to future lands for swidden agriculture con\ufb01 ned by the PFR\u201d.41 3.1.5 Protected Areas In 1993, a Royal Decree established a national system comprising 23 protected areas classi\ufb01 ed under four major categories: National Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries, Protected Landscapes, and Multiple Use Areas. Th e Department of Nature Conservation and Protection under the Ministry of Environment is responsible for overseeing these 23 protected areas and an additional three Ramsar sites, two of which are contained within the 23 protected areas. All combined, these areas cover 32,289 sq km. In addition to these areas, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has set aside a number of areas for biodiversity conservation, forest protection, genetic conservation, and wildlife habitat protection. Together, these areas represent an additional 14,860 sq km under intentional protection. Th e country\u2019s entire system of protected areas covers 47,845 sq km, or about 26.3 percent of Cambodia\u2019s land territory.42 A 2003 review of protected areas found that more personnel are needed for managing the protected areas.43 Th e draft law seeking to de\ufb01 ne the framework for management, conservation and sustainable development of protected areas set out its objectives, amongst other things, as: the management, conservation, and sustainable use of natural resources in protected areas; to determine standards and procedures for managing protected areas; to determine the responsibilities and participation of local communities, indigenous ethnic minorities, and the public; and to implement regional and international conventions, protocols and agreements on the protection of biodiversity and ecosystem of protected areas.44 Th is draft law would also govern the management of State public property in protected areas.45 Th e Ministry of Environment is responsible for implementing the law, and developing a National Strategic Plan for Protected Area Management.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1984706-c5da-4dfc-954c-fbe930ac3944": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1984706-c5da-4dfc-954c-fbe930ac3944", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b1e8b6fbac940bb97f7b91a98274da3bfec3992cf1542316b2d20c6e5aad93e"}, "2": {"node_id": "95b23c92-7f31-4667-b0ba-545fd3ec626c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d989b830d8e44044972e1cc5fcd22a64e496f9fc7c917f4df1aa423a89a9bcd8"}}, "hash": "d282dd546e0e795ebf2a7fd9e86d79afd19bd113465ddf7d8d0c5de2bdfba58e", "text": "Under the new draft law there are nine categories of protected areas: (i) National Park;

It provides that the MoE, in collaboration with other ministries, shall develop an inventory that indicates the sources, types, and quantities of pollutants and waste, toxic and hazardous substances being imported, generated, transported, recycled, treated, stored, disposed, or released into the airspace, water, land, or on land; the sources, types, and extent of noise and vibration disturbances. 3.1.7 Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Cambodia\u2019s freshwater \ufb01 sheries produce over 400,000 tonnes per year and is the fourth largest national \ufb01 sheries catch in the world after China, India and Bangladesh. Th e estimate of 400,000 tonnes is additionally considered to be an under-estimate.63 Fisheries in Cambodia are interlinked with annual \ufb02 oods of the Tonle Sap (Great Lake) and the Mekong-Bassac Delta around and downstream from Phnom Penh. About 14,000 sq km are \ufb02 ooded annually and \ufb01 sh migration, as part of their breeding cycles, coincides with these \ufb02 oods. It is reported that more than 100 species are regularly caught in the Tonle Sap, although up to 200 species have been recorded in the Tonle Sap itself and over 500 in the freshwaters of Cambodia.64 About 90 percent of the total inland production is from capture \ufb01 sheries and the rest from aquaculture.65 Concerns have been raised about over- \ufb01 shing, particularly of larger and less fertile species. Th e Fisheries and Administration Law (Fiat-Law No. 33 Kro chor of 1987), which is the principle \ufb01 sheries legislation, does not provide for co-management arrangements or mechanisms.

However, the government requested that this agency should be under the authority of the Department of Agricultural Hydraulics and Hydro-Meteorology of the MoA. Th at request was not accepted by the ODA and there are now at least six di\ufb00 erent ministries involved in water management in Cambodia. Cambodia has the second highest hydropower generating capacity in the Lower Mekong Basin, amounting to 8,000 MW. However, present electricity generation is entirely by thermal power plants using imported fuel and per capita power generation is the lowest in the region at 0.007 kW (Mekong Secretariat April 1995, pg 55). Making a rice granary, Ratanakiri Province Photo: Lam Suet 140 Bridging The Gap Despite the numerous ministries charged with water management in the country, not a single authority has looked at watershed management. Such attention is critical as communities rely on water supply from gravity feed. Most communities have also been looking after community catchment areas and the destruction of such areas would not only a\ufb00 ect the communities but wildlife within a particular habitat. 3.1.9 Commune Administration Law 2001 Th e Commune Administration Law (2001)69 provides for the establishment of Commune Councils to manage small groups of villages (communes) through local elections, government funding for their work, and a local development planning process. Th e Commune which governs the local a\ufb00 airs is based on the Constitution,70 with legislative and executive authority vested in the Commune. While the recognition of the Commune Council is important and would provide indigenous communities the opportunity to have a say in local a\ufb00 airs, in practice the system has been shown to be subject to abuse. Most land sales and registration apparently involve Commune Chiefs without the consent of the a\ufb00 ected communities. As such, the tendency to address this is to limit the scope of Commune Councils to avoid abuse of power and ensure that any dealings with respect to indigenous lands should be consistent with the Sub-decree on Registration of Indigenous Land Rights. Th ere is a growing awareness of the need to recognize that the traditional authority provided for in the Land Law 2001 need not be assumed to be the Commune Council. Th us the role of the Commune Council may be seen more for the physical development of communities, such as infrastructure, education and participation in local government, while the traditional leaders can take the role of maintaining the cultural and territorial integrity of the community. 3.1.10 Management and Exploitation of Mineral Resources71 Under this law,71 the term \u201cland owner\u201d refers to general land owners, which may include indigenous communities. Under Article 5, \u201clegal owners or possessors of private land can use gravel, sand, stones and clay without requiring license, but they are not permitted to transport beyond the boundary of that land for business purposes\u201d. Th e law does not provide a mechanism for obtaining free, prior informed consent. Neither does it mention the right of land owners to reject exploitation of resources in their lands. However, it does provide for compensation under Article 26.72. 141 Cambodia 3.2 Policy for Highland Peoples\u2019 Development Th e Cambodian Government established an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) in 1994 to develop a policy on indigenous and ethnic minority peoples, as part of the government\u2019s plans to improve the quality of life of indigenous peoples living in highland and mountainous areas.

In addition the Department was given the mandate to prepare and revise the policy on indigenous peoples to submit to the government for approval. Stieng community, Chingkon, Kratie Province, 2007 Photo: Colin Nicholas 142 Bridging The Gap Th e DEMD is playing an important role in \ufb01 nalizing the Policy for Highland Peoples\u2019 Development (now called National Policy for Development of Indigenous Peoples after the national consultation in August 2005). Th e drafting of the policy for indigenous peoples demonstrates the Government\u2019s intention to accommodate and preserve indigenous groups, give them some group-speci\ufb01 c citizenship rights and promote a multicultural society. Strongly in\ufb02 uenced by ILO Convention No. 169, this document details a number of objectives, intentions, and measures to accommodate the country\u2019s indigenous communities. Th e policy consists of three chapters: General Provisions, Guidelines, and Action Plan. Th e main di\ufb00 erence in the current draft to the original document is that the previous references to \u201cindigenous minority people\u201d have now been replaced with \u201cindigenous peoples\u201d. Th e General Provisions highlight the need for indigenous peoples to be consulted in development processes and to be part of the decision-making process, and for indigenous peoples to have the same rights and duties as other Cambodian citizens. It also a\ufb03 rms that indigenous peoples have the right to manage their natural resources. Among the gaps in the present policy draft is the need to respect indigenous land rights, culture and indigenous knowledge per se and not judged based on what is appropriate.

In Chapter 2, the guidelines to implement the policy address issues on environment, land, agriculture, education, health, culture, access to justice for indigenous peoples and infrastructure. Under environment, one gap identi\ufb01 ed is the lack of recognition of the role that indigenous peoples play in the management of their natural environment and natural resources as an important contribution to the preservation of national natural resources. Th e language on consent is weak and needs to be strengthened in line with emerging principles of Free, Prior and Informed Consent. On land, the proposed monitoring of the e\ufb00 ectiveness of land use and the development of measures to ensure the sustainable use of natural resources by the Village-Commune Natural Resource Management Committee (VCNRMC) may not align with the interests of indigenous communities. Th ere is a need to \ufb01 rst explore the possibility of allowing village elders within traditional authorities and members of the community to take on this role. Th ere are some major gaps under the Guidelines for the Agriculture Sector. Th e existing statement in the Khmer version talks about research and extension and the increase of tree planting. Th is should be changed to emphasize improving existing agricultural methods by working jointly with farmers and making use of their local knowledge. Th ere should be a clear statement of Government support for traditional and rotational forms of swidden agriculture. Emphasis to \u201cpromote the investment in agricultural sector and organize an integrated agricultural production in order to increase agricultural production\u201d (Article 3.1) may not be the best option for indigenous communities. Th e guideline\u2019s discussion on education is progressive, including an article calling for the establishment of community learning centers and the training of indigenous teachers who would then teach in their own community.

Likewise, the guidelines for implementation under the Health Sector could look into the establishment of traditional health centers. Th e suggested policy guidelines under the Culture Sector appear to be comprehensive. On infrastructure, the main issue is the lack of a mechanism to obtain Free, Prior and Informed Consent of communities prior to any development taking place. Chapter 3 of the Policy on the priority action plan outlines six points: (i) human resource development, particularly for women; (ii) poverty reduction; (iii) improving the information system for indigenous peoples; (iv) strengthening indigenous communities, especially for 144 Bridging The Gap traditional elders, women and children; (v) ensuring community participation; and (vi) training of government sta\ufb00 and NGOs working with indigenous peoples. Th is policy was \ufb01 rst submitted to the Council of Ministers in 1997 and discussed in two sessions, but was not approved. After several rounds of revisions through wide consultations, the Policy was again presented to the Council of Ministers in February 2006, but it was again rejected. 4. Interface between Indigenous and Statutory Systems on Natural Resource Management Th is Chapter is devoted to assessing the interface between indigenous and State systems and laws on natural resources management, with a view to identifying gaps and challenges for further action. It will also look at current e\ufb00 orts to harness indigenous natural resource management systems with other systems to illustrate the need to further develop such initiatives, as well as examine and illustrate the roles of government, NGOs, community organizations and donors. Recognizing the need for indigenous peoples\u2019 involvement in natural resource management, section 3.4 highlights mechanisms and issues for e\ufb00 ective participation. 4.1 Indigenous Peoples and State Legal and Policy Framework 4.1.1 Implementation of Laws and Policies It may appear that several laws and policies exist that protect indigenous rights. However, implementation of these laws and policies is far from adequate. For example, implementation of Land Law 2001 is hindered by lack of e\ufb00 orts to resolve land tenure issues Weeding upland rice \ufb01 elds, Ratanakiri Province Photo: New Savin 145 Cambodia with respect to a\ufb00 ected communities who were included in national parks. As a result, the recognition of indigenous knowledge on forest resources, and community participation in park protection and management, takes a back seat. Con\ufb02 icting information, such as prohibition from living and conducting swidden agriculture within certain zones inside the park, are confusing for indigenous peoples and must be clari\ufb01 ed. Although there is some progress in the titling of communal lands, many issues and questions remain. Box 7: Pilot Project on Community Title Th ree areas were selected as pilot sites for the communal titling of land - two in Ratanakiri and one in Mondolkiri Province. Lessons learned/issues raised 1. Where there are strong support groups, the project appears to have gone well. One of the pilot sites in Ratanakiri which lacks such support groups is proving to be di\ufb03 cult. 2. Except the MoE, other Ministries are not actively involved in the project. 3. Too many issues and agencies are involved, making the process confusing. 4. No person or body works on the project consistently, either from NGOs or from other advisory bodies. 5. Indigenous organizations and communities are not empowered to pursue communal land titling. 6. Th ere are doubts on whether the community is really interested in communal titles, even after the communities have clearly shown their preference for communal title. A series of information workshops were held to explain the di\ufb00 erence between communal and individual titles. However, the process was over-simpli\ufb01 ed, for example the provincial governor once came and asked the people to put up their hands to choose and they all chose to opt for communal titles. 7. Many see the community consultations as a time-consuming and unnecessary exercise. 8.

Currently they have come to accept ownership of land through communal titling of areas based on territories traditionally occupied by a particular community. Communal titles are perceived as providing security and ensuring communities are in control and are better able to manage natural resources in traditional territories. Th is compliments the government\u2019s clear policy on the importance of the social function of land for sustainable economic and social development, poverty reduction, decentralized administration, good governance, equitable land distribution to assist the poorest of the poor, and tenure security to prevent or resolve con\ufb02 icts. It also recognizes the importance of preventing illegal land acquisition and land concentration. However, titling on areas where indigenous communities are most vulnerable to being dispossessed has not been given priority. Box 8: Indigenous Land Titling At a planning meeting in 2002 for the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS), some of the reasons why communal land titling is bene\ufb01 cial for indigenous communities were identi\ufb01 ed, and recommendations made: 1. Ensures traditional access of established local communities to common property resources (land, forest and waterways) is not usurped by new groups. 2. Improves limited/insecure access of the poor to common resources. 3. Ensures tenure security for rural people by correcting weaknesses in existing land practices and laws. 4. Need to examine gender bias in land policy and registration systems to ensure that women and girls have access to land titles and natural resources. 5. Need to improve farmers\u2019, rural poor and other vulnerable groups\u2019 access to land, water and other productive inputs for sustainable livelihoods, food security and overall socio-economic development. NPRS 2002 147 Cambodia 4.1.3 Implementing Use Rights Framework Cambodia\u2019s law on recognition of customary use rights is among the most progressive in the region. Th e Forest Law (Article 15) and the Sub-Decree on Forest Concession Management (Article 2) both provide for the rights of indigenous peoples living within or adjacent to a forest concession, by ensuring that they do not interfere with the customary user rights of indigenous communities, and protect their access rights to forest resources that are of economic, subsistence and spiritual value to them. Recognizing that indigenous peoples are not immune to the possibility of overexploiting forest resources does not necessarily mean that their rights to use natural resources should be curtailed. Rather, a check and balance for ensuring sustainable management should be put in place. Root causes for local overexploitation also need to be ascertained, and if necessary, relevant assistance provided. 4.1.4 Recognition of Customary Law Recognition of traditional authorities such as indigenous governance over natural resource management by the Land Law 2001 is very progressive. Customary laws on natural resource management is still highly respected by Cambodia\u2019s indigenous communities, and are being implemented as part of peoples\u2019 way of life. However, with the introduction of the commune councils and the Commune Council Law, coupled with the tendency of most governments to look up to leaders who are literate or to put in place regulations that are more in line with state laws and policies, it can be very easy to replace the traditional authorities and customary laws. If this happens, it would pave the way for illegal land acquisition and land concentration and over-exploitation of resources that could seriously result in con\ufb02 icts within the community and among authorities. In the long run, this could contribute towards the lack of con\ufb01 dence among community members themselves. Fences starting to appear as a result of land alienation, Ratanakiri Province Photo: New Savin 148 Bridging The Gap Section 2.2 above illustrates a highly evolved and time-tested system that remains very applicable to the everyday lives of Brao people. It suggests that indigenous natural resource management strategies can be much more e\ufb00 ective, at least at the local level, if they are integrated into Brao law. For example, established Ya Weu could be asked to act as judges in cases when community natural resource management regulations are broken by outsiders or members of the community. Th us far, other laws on natural resource management have not attempted to incorporate customary practices and laws into statutory laws as seen in many countries in the region. Th e recognition of customary law and traditional authorities is a step in the right direction. A programme to train traditional leaders to engage and communicate e\ufb00 ectively with government departments, and vice-versa, would be more appropriate than introducing other forms of governance within indigenous communities.

A new project by UNDP Cambodia is working with communities to clarify roles of traditional authorities and build from these existing institutions instead of promoting new ones that are alien to indigenous peoples. 4.1.5 Con\ufb02 ict in Perceptions Debate over natural resource management continues to be dominated by contrasting perceptions between locals and outsiders on wilderness and cultural landscapes. Conservation thinking has tended to opt for preservation of \u201cwilderness\u201d areas and therefore the automatic rejection of any human in\ufb02 uence. However, this focus on the steady state of \u201cwilderness\u201d has hindered a realistic appraisal of the role of disturbance processes and change in maintaining ecosystems (Ironside and Baird, 2003). Often the \u201cbalance between protection of indigenous culture and becoming developed\u201d is equated with giving up certain rights. While culture is dynamic, it does not necessarily mean accepting modern lifestyles, but rather embracing aspects of both. Being able to attend school is used as a measure of development, even though indigenous peoples insist that school curricula must respect indigenous cultures as it has resulted in the alienation of indigenous youths from their own community. Th ese are but a few of the con\ufb02 icting perceptions of indigenous peoples and natural resources conservation and management held by communities and by outsiders. Th ese con\ufb02 icting perceptions tend to complicate the issues and result in indigenous peoples being 149 Cambodia treated as subjects for studies, rather than owners of the process of their own development and little e\ufb00 ort is placed in trying to gain an understanding of indigenous peoples\u2019 own perceptions of their path of development. 4.1.6 Recognition of Indigenous Natural Resource Management System Indigenous knowledge on natural resource management needs to be recognized; recognition that does exist in Cambodia is partial and even then only on paper. Many of the recommendations for natural resource management still tend to rely on western concepts, rather than promoting indigenous customary practices. In the process of enhancing the capacity of indigenous peoples to promote natural resource management, there is a need to look at these issues to ensure that the process will promote traditional systems of natural resource management. A management plan that outlines bene\ufb01 ts and responsibilities for both government and indigenous peoples would ensure that indigenous culture is protected, sustainable incomes from the forests are assured, and wildlife and biodiversity is conserved. Box 9: Yeak Loam Lake Ecotourism Project Tampoun community around the Yeak Loam Lake harnessed their traditional knowledge in managing the habitat in and around the lake to provide an income through an ecotourism project. Th e community also established a museum and traditional structures to provide information about Tampuon cultures to visitors. Th ough the income is modest, the community is proud of their e\ufb00 orts, which has at the same time enabled them to conserve the natural beauty of the lake and surrounding forest. Wanai Lieng, Tampuon from Yeak Loam 4.1.7 Land Demarcation Land, as a vital part of indigenous peoples\u2019 lives, must be clearly demarcated. Numerous issues remain to be addressed, particularly the interface between indigenous peoples\u2019 and the State\u2019s concept of land.

Under Forestry Law the Administration is empowered to determine the Permanent Forest Estate, even though logically steps 1 and 2 above should happen prior to the de\ufb01 nition of the Estate.

Mary Hobley - Forest 151 Cambodia 4.1.8 Developing Partnerships and Mutual Leanings Mistrust between government authorities and indigenous communities still hinders openness and sharing of responsibilities. Consultation and information-sharing that could build partnerships and mutual learning are not built into mechanisms on natural resource management. For example, villagers believe that since the local people withdrew from the Virachey National Park, outside hunters and NTFP collectors have had more opportunities to exploit resources. It is not possible for park rangers to e\ufb00 ectively control this in\ufb02 ux, due to the park\u2019s size. Th e destruction of the rattan and eaglewood resources over the recent past can be partly attributed to the fact that there are no longer communities living in these areas. If partnership between park authorities and the people exist, villagers can assist in monitoring the park, as has been successfully demonstrated in other countries in the region. Indigenous peoples believe that if they were allowed to live in the park, they could help to control illegal hunting and NTFP exploitation. Some communities have already established committees for this purpose (Ironside and Baird, 2003). Th e policy to move indigenous peoples\u2019 communities and to change their cultures, thinking and way of life has only served to perpetuate mistrusts and suspicions, instead of harnessing the knowledge and skills on other livelihood strategies, particularly on swidden agriculture. Box 11: Historical disharmony Challenges for developing partnerships and mutual learning are enormous as this goes against the history of relationships between indigenous peoples and outsiders. For indigenous groups, particularly in Northeast Cambodia, the slave trade, which continued over such a long period and with such intensity, was cultural rape. Th e disharmony continued with the relocation of Brao and Kavet people to lowland villages adjacent to the Sekong and Se San Rivers in the early 1960s in order to \u201ceducate\u201d and \u201cKhmerise\u201d them; then continuing with the draconian policies of the Khmer Rouge to make wet rice paddy rice cultivators out of swidden agriculture farmers, and \ufb01 nally with the policies of the State of Cambodia government to keep the people in the lowlands. Ironside and Baird, 2003 152 Bridging The Gap 4.1.9 Strengthening Links Between Government and Indigenous Communities Th e Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) for Highland Peoples Development was formed by the Royal Government of Cambodia in 1994, and is composed of the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, the Ministry of Social A\ufb00 airs, Labors, Vocational Training and Youth Rehabilitation, the Ministry of Women\u2019s and Veterans A\ufb00 airs, the Ministry of Environment, and the Cambodian Mines Action Centre. Having a committee at such a high political level to look speci\ufb01 cally at indigenous issues is an important step in ensuring a broader understanding of indigenous peoples\u2019 situation and is critical in the establishment of more equitable laws and policies. It is unfortunate, therefore, that the IMC was apparently dissolved after the creation of the Department of Ethnic Minorities Development (DEMD). Nevertheless, the DEMD has played an important role in \ufb01 nalizing the Policy for Highland Peoples\u2019 Development and has a potential role to act as an important link between government departments and indigenous peoples. Th ere is a need to raise the pro\ufb01 le and capacity of the DEMD as it appears to be at a low rank in the hierarchy of the government.

Th ere are also many institutions that involve government, local and international NGOs and UN agencies that have developed tools and models of participatory action research. However, the inaccessibility and remoteness of most villages hampers information dissemination. Producing information that is easily understood also poses a challenge. Many indigenous peoples did not, and still do not, have access to formal schooling, making it di\ufb03 cult to promote written materials. More popular forms such as radio programmes and audio-visuals have been found to be most e\ufb00 ective. Box 12: Community Documentation Project Th e Ratanakiri Natural Resource Management Network (RNRMN) started a video project to document the situation faced by indigenous communities. In this project, indigenous representatives are given basic training in handling video cameras and editing, and subsequently assigned to take footage of interviews and scenes in their own villages. Video productions are done in Khmer or indigenous languages and translated into English for wider distribution. Th is activity has proven to be of immense support to communities facing various problems and an important awareness-raising and alliance-building tool.

Initiated in June 2001, the CBNRM Learning Initiative has been actively working with local communities in the areas of capability-building, learning, networking, and policy support. Th e learning initiative is being co-sponsored by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), Oxfam America (OA), and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), and is being supported by the Regional Community Forestry Training Centre (RECOFTC), the CBCRM Learning and Research Network (LeaRN), and the Mekong Learning Initiative (MLI). A major activity of the CBNRM Learning Initiative has been the holding of case study writing workshops that aim to synthesize insights from CBNRM e\ufb00 orts by local communities, enhance people\u2019s research and analytical skills, and develop and extend the network of organizations and institutions in CBNRM. Th ese case study writing workshops have not only served as a venue for the sharing of experiences among CBNRM practitioners in Cambodia and Southeast Asia, but have also contributed to promoting CBNRM as a viable and important aspect of socio-economic development e\ufb00 orts, particularly in the case of the Royal Government of Cambodia. Th e workshop outputs have likewise served as basis for the development of relevant policy and legal frameworks in CBNRM. Regional Newsletter on CBCRM 4.2 Harnessing Indigenous Natural Resource Management Indigenous peoples\u2019 detailed knowledge can be used in community mapping to identify important cultural sites, terrestrial habitats and place names in their traditional territories. Traditional resource management systems and the traditional legal systems of indigenous peoples can also be integrated with other resource management systems. In remote areas, this traditional legal system could continue to be used to resolve their con\ufb02 icts. 155 Cambodia Although the contribution of traditional knowledge on resource management such as the above has often been quoted, there is still a tendency for these statements to be mere lip service.

While collective rights traditionally include women, sometimes even as primary managers, private ownership that has been introduced through the land law could exclude women from ownership and control of natural resources. In an impact assessment of the Yali Falls dam on the Se San River in Ratanakari Province, indigenous women complained about the loss of their livelihoods.

Many NGOs and government departments are also working on natural resource management, which have established forest committees. Th ese organizations are: Ratanakiri Network Support Project (RNSP); Highlander Association (HA); Non-Timber Forest Project (NTFP); CIDSE (now called Development and Partnership); ICC; Seila; and CEDAC. At the same, many NGOs are also involved with improving infrastructure, including schools, health centers, and rural roads. Indigenous organizations in Cambodia are still unable to e\ufb00 ectively engage with governments, local and international NGOs and UN agencies. Th e next four sub-sections will look at the institutions involved in natural resource management and the mechanisms for engagement. 4.4.1 Government Cambodia\u2019s current institutional approach on natural resource management is to assign responsibility for state resource management to sectoral ministries at the national level, who subsequently assign it through the provincial departments. Provincial governors also exercise control over state resources, particularly in areas where ministries do not have active management control. Th ere is a lack of active and sustained mechanisms to coordinate among these ministries and governors, which are very dependent on \ufb01 nancial resources from international donors. As seen in Chapter 2, each ministry would be guided by the laws and decrees. Brau land use planning workshop, Kok Lak Commune, Ratanakiri Province 1998 Photo: Chris Erni 157 Cambodia 4.4.2 Community Organisations Th e growing capacities of a number of indigenous networks such as the Indigenous Forum and associations have played an important role in raising the awareness of communities, especially in remote areas. Of particular importance are the roles in organizing activities to enable communities to understand the provisions in the land law, forest law and in international human rights instruments on indigenous peoples\u2019 rights as well as the ongoing processes such as the policy on indigenous peoples\u2019 development and the draft protected area law. Indigenous networks and associations could also play a role in encouraging collaboration with local and international NGOs and donors to enhance the capacity of community representatives and organizers to improve knowledge and skill to dialogue with the government, investors and donors as well as assist community representatives in attending relevant workshops and conferences at the national and international levels. Community organizations at the village level have an important role in promoting traditional natural resource management systems and strengthening traditional authorities and mechanisms for decision-making by the community. Th is implies the active promotion and inter-generational transfer of knowledge on indigenous culture and identity. Village- level community organizations also need to coordinate their engagement and to participate e\ufb00 ectively in various processes to voice their perspectives on community development to guarantee the rights and interests of indigenous peoples. Box 15: Highlander Association Th e Highlander Association (HA), set up as a network, is governed by committees at the village and commune level to strengthen solidarity and traditional practices such as reciprocity within communities, be it exchange of food or labor. It has conducted studies of indigenous peoples\u2019 livelihoods, history and traditional culture. It also conducts workshops and other educational activities to discuss land tenure and natural resource management issues. Where requested, it also promotes income generating activities such as cashew nut marketing, animal husbandry and credit project as well as the collection and marketing of forest products.

Traditional leaders mobilize labor and other resources to support community members during harvest, planting and ceremonies. Th ey also play a role in supporting weak community members. Particularly, when con\ufb02 icts arise, they have to bring the o\ufb00 enders and o\ufb00 ended together in order to \ufb01 nd mutually agreed settlements. Th e elders and women healers, who are also considered traditional leaders, conduct spiritual ceremonies, communicate with spirits and pray for the good health of community members. Leaders are also responsible for transferring traditional knowledge to young people. For many years now, traditional leaders have increasingly smaller roles and authority in governing communities, with the government claiming more and more power. It is the government who created and gave authority to the local administrative structure which is now key in the management of local areas. Pat Chan Seng, Tampuon 4.4.3 Local, National and International NGO\u2019s Many NGOs have been active in promoting the land law, forest law and indigenous peoples\u2019 rights, focusing their e\ufb00 orts on the right to utilize, own and control land and natural resources. NGOs that have good relations with government have also facilitated engagement between communities and relevant departments. NGOs and the government SEILA program established community forests and also strengthened the capacity of natural resource management (NRM) committees. Th ese NRM committees play an important role in facilitating the community in establishing rules and regulations for the community forest. Th e NRM committee also developed the participatory land use plan (PLUP), assisted in demarcating community boundaries, provided classi\ufb01 cation of several types of land use and protection areas. However, the committees largely failed in these activities due to lack of support from local authorities (commune councils) and community members. A number of communities have also expressed the need for NGOs to engage in a more sustained campaign for the recognition of indigenous peoples\u2019 rights to natural resources, and to pressure the government to enforce laws have been adopted and which are supposed to protect their interests. 159 Cambodia Box 17: NGO Forum Th e NGO Forum is made up of local and international non-governmental organizations grounded in their experience of humanitarian and development assistance to Cambodia. Th e NGO Forum exists for information sharing, debate and advocacy on priority issues a\ufb00 ecting Cambodia\u2019s development. Th e NGO Forum has an important role to highlight the impact of development processes and economic, social and political changes on Cambodians. Under the Land and Livelihood Programme of NGO Forum there is a project on indigenous peoples and a project on forest livelihoods. Th e former is aimed at cooperating with various organizations to ensure that the capacity of indigenous peoples to advocate for their own rights is strengthened and that their concerns are heard and acted upon by the government, donors and the wider community, particularly in relation to their rights to land and natural resources. Th e forest livelihood project strives to enable local communities living in and near forest areas to gain secure tenure over the forest resources that they have traditionally relied upon for their social, economic, and cultural development. www.ngoforum.org.kh 4.4.4 Donors and UN Agencies Donors and UN agencies played a very important role in shaping the laws and policies on natural resource management in Cambodia. Further technical and \ufb01 nancial support to clarify these laws and policies to ensure their feasibility for implementation on the ground, particularly with and for indigenous peoples, has been signi\ufb01 cant. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that gaps in understanding indigenous systems, which also exist for donors and UN agencies, need to be addressed so as to avoid imposing western ideas on local institutions and customary laws and practices. Th e concerns that donors and UN agencies themselves have identi\ufb01 ed, such as having e\ufb00 ective consultations, providing continuity and avoiding \ufb01 nancial dependence, need to be seriously addressed in order to ensure that continued support is e\ufb00 ective. 160 Bridging The Gap 5. Challenges and Drawbacks Th is Chapter focuses on cases that illustrate challenges and drawbacks in the implementation of laws and policies on natural resource management. 5.1 Illegal Land Sales and Land Grabbing Th e foremost challenge in relation to indigenous peoples and NRM today is the illegal sale and acquisition of land - \u201cland grabbing\u201d.

Many indigenous communities are being deceived daily into losing their lands, although there is a growing awareness within indigenous communities of the danger of illegal land acquisition, as expressed by the statement by a gathering of indigenous peoples in 2004 Tampuen \ufb01 eld hut, Yeak Lom Commune, Ratanakiri Province, 1998 Photo: Chris Erni 161 Cambodia Box 18: Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Statement on Land Sales Numerous illegal land sales and land grabbing have been identi\ufb01 ed in Ratanakiri and Mondolkiri as con\ufb01 rmed by indigenous peoples at the Indigenous Forum in 2004. A statement by the NGO Forum to draw the attention of the government and developers in October 2004 stressed that this contradicts the intention of the 2001 Land Law and the policy priorities identi\ufb01 ed by the Poverty Reduction Strategy of the government. To illustrate the nature of the problem, the statement mentioned examples such as the issuance of 70,000 ha of land concession over the land of the Suy indigenous people in Kompong Speu; 1,400 ha and 2,000 ha of gem mining concession over indigenous peoples\u2019 land in Lumphat district and Borkeo district respectively in Ratanakiri Province, and 200,000 ha concession proposed for Mondolkiri Province. Th e statement said that the traditional management systems of indigenous communities are being destroyed by individual land sales of community land mainly to powerful businessmen. Land sales were approved by individuals within the community but in an environment of insu\ufb03 cient information, disinformation, and sometimes threats and intimidation. In other cases, the local authorities (commune councils) arbitrarily sell land without informing the people living on the land, while in other cases land is forcibly occupied by powerful indigenous and non-indigenous individuals with strong connections with powerful individuals. Indigenous communities are demanding a moratorium on land sales and on granting land concessions that a\ufb00 ects traditional lands until the adoption of the sub-decree on both indigenous collective titles and economic concessions. Indigenous communities also want the forests and water resources traditionally used by them to be recognised as part of the traditional management and ownership of indigenous communities. Respect for traditional structures is also urged to ensure community solidarity and cultures are kept strong, and for new governance structures to respect and consult traditional systems. www.NGOForum.org.kh 162 Bridging The Gap 5.2 Developing Partnerships and Mutual Learning Information dissemination, as an important mechanism for building partnerships and mutual learning, is a major challenge, due largely to language and cultural barriers. Most indigenous peoples lack access to formal education and Khmer literacy levels are low. In strengthening links between government and indigenous communities, a major challenge includes encouraging government sta\ufb00 to spend more time in villages, to learn from local people and increase interactions with elders in the communities. Meanwhile, the formulation of policies for the development of indigenous peoples faces major challenges from the lack of detailed resource use plans to guide State resource management decisions, and lack of capacity for monitoring resource use and revenue availability. A report on the latest National Consultation Report states that \u201cthe indigenous representatives seemed to get lost in the midst of these intellectual debates on the meanings of words and phrases. Some of them seemed to have di\ufb03 culty to read the documents, hence clearly limiting their participation. All these are just observations without real discussion due to limited timeframe\u201d. Th is indicates that there was a lack of information on the policy paper despite the length of time it has been in circulation. In circulating documents, local languages should be used and promoted as much as possible through appropriate media such as community radio and audio-visual materials discussed earlier. Another drawback is misunderstandings about indigenous land use practices: Misunderstandings abound regarding land use practices of indigenous peoples. Outsiders and government o\ufb03 cials assume that the local people are nomadic, and that their farming systems are environmentally destructive, with low agricultural productivity. Even though humans have lived in and helped shape large areas of Virachey National Park, for example, within the wilderness paradigm it is heretical to suggest that swidden systems might have had, and could have, a role in conserving overall landscape biodiversity. Th e real question about the future role of swidden is: can swidden be used to stimulate the ecological processes that can best achieve the most productive food webs and the most biodiversity habitats both for community use and wildlife? (Ironside and Baird, 2003) More recently in Cambodia, e\ufb00 orts on collaborative management in protected areas have received a large amount of interest among government, international NGOs and funding agencies.

People feel the Park sta\ufb00 do not allow them to understand too much (access su\ufb03 cient information) and that the sta\ufb00 work very far from the people. Kok Lak people compare the NTFP\u2019s regular partnership with the community with the partnership e\ufb00 orts of the Park sta\ufb00 in Virachey NP. Meetings are only once every two to three (up to six) months. Sometimes meetings are short: one to two hours. People say that if they have long meetings, the Park sta\ufb00 and rangers are afraid people will ask a lot about illegal activities in the Park. People suspect Park sta\ufb00 of being involved in illegal activities. Before the sta\ufb00 did not have anything, now they have motorcycles and houses. Community representatives say there is no justice or equality in the management of the Park. Examples used to illustrate these feelings included the fact that no Kok Lak people are employed, only Lao and Khmer people; that the community committees have been chosen to assist with Park activities but there have been no meetings with them for nearly a year; that a signed agreement was made about the boundary for a CPA but now they are told that people do not have any right to manage that area and must get a permit to enter anywhere in the Park; and that there is still no assistance with agriculture and with bu\ufb00 aloes for lowland rice growing despite promises by the Park sta\ufb00 prior to the establishment of the Park. Now, since the recent logging, villagers are starting to say that rangers want to stop people from going into the Park because they can make partnerships with local businessmen/companies (made up of Police, Military Police, Chinese traders) to exploit the resources of the Park. At present, small scale loggers are cutting Granugn wood in the forests to the south of the Park and people are worried that in the future this activity will encroach into the Park. Park Rangers are telling people not to hunt animals, and will even be stopped if they \ufb01 sh. People, however, see the rangers going on patrol and then they hear mines and guns going o\ufb00 in the forest. People also say they have seen the remains of samba deer, gibbon and monkey in the forest that have been eaten by the rangers. Local villagers have also followed up on a pangolin that was con\ufb01 scated from a villager. When they asked the rangers they were told that the pangolin was freed but some villagers saw the animal in a local Chinese wildlife traders\u2019 house. Such observations and discrepancies serve to increase the mistrust with which communities view the establishment and management of National Parks. Ironside and Bunma 2004 164 Bridging The Gap 5.3 Coordination between Government Departments Another major challenge is the lack of coordination between departments dealing with natural resource management. One example is the pilot project to title communal land in three areas in Ratanakiri and Mondulkiri. Th e departments involved are the Ministry of Environment (MoE), Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) and Ministry of Land Management Urban Planning and Construction (MLMUPC). However, only the MLMUPC was actively coordinating with NGOs and the community to implement the project. To ensure success of the project and extension to other communities, it is imperative to have all three departments involved. Resources would need to be set aside for such inter-departmental coordination. 5.4 Land Alienation for Logging and Plantations As mentioned, the most serious problem that indigenous peoples face is land alienation. Large scale land alienation occurred during the last two to threes years after the roads were built to Ratanakiri and Mondulkiri provinces, when newcomers moved in and land prices increased. Alienation of land stemmed especially from the government planning development through land concessions. As a consequence of the land alienation, indigenous communities are deprived of their lands, threatening their very existence as peoples. Associated with indigenous land alienation and the expansion of cash cropping agriculture, deforestation is becoming a serious environmental problem. Many communities continue to be cheated by others - be they politicians or business people - to sell their land.

Kreung spirit forest, Kralah village, Ratanakiri Province, 1998 Photo: Chris Erni 165 Cambodia Box 20: Monitoring Land Alienation Th e agency responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Forestry Law and the Sub-Decree is the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (particularly its Department of Forestry and Wildlife). In this respect, there are concerns that the Ministry\u2019s overt pro-exploitation policies con\ufb02 ict directly with its responsibility to implement the community management goals of the 2003 Sub-Decree. Despite the passage of the new Forestry Law and a moratorium against logging announced in January 2002, the acute problem of forest mismanagement persists. For one thing, the government continues to grant timber concessions outside the revised legal framework and has also failed to terminate many non-performing concessionaire contracts. Th e few contracts which were in fact terminated in recent times appeared to involve companies which were either bankrupt or not aligned with the \u2018right\u2019 political groupings. Overall, illegal logging by companies backed by political clout persists, and provisions of the Forestry Law are \ufb02 agrantly breached. While the Forestry Law requires concessionaires to produce Strategic Forest Management Plans and Environmental and Social Impact Assessments, the government has reportedly been willing to accept assessments of extremely low quality. In some instances, assessments had simply been copied from previous reports. In this regard, the World Bank itself has been severely criticized for releasing loans to the government in breach of its own forest-reform conditions. Th e Forestry Law itself contains inherent weaknesses \u2013 one unsatisfactory feature is the failure to distinguish between \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cplanted\u201d forests. Th us, logging companies can simply claim to be engaging in reforesting and disguise the reality, that is, the destruction of villagers\u2019 community forests, grazing land, commons and fallows, to be replaced by even-aged stands of species of fast-growing (but often alien) trees. Th e in\ufb02 uence of vested interests over the forestry sector is also illustrated by the government\u2019s decision in April 2003 to terminate the representation of an independent NGO monitor in the Forest Crimes Monitoring O\ufb03 ce. Th is O\ufb03 ce had been established to monitor illegal logging activities and comprised o\ufb03 cials from the Department of Forestry and Wildlife and the Ministry of Environment, together with Global Witness - as an independent observer. Subsequently, Global Witness was \ufb01 red following con\ufb02 icts with the government over the documentation of several cases of connivance by government o\ufb03 cials in illegal logging. Singapore Yearbook of International Law (SYBIL) 166 Bridging The Gap 5.5 Large-scale Development Projects Another major challenge with respect to indigenous peoples and natural resource management is the implementation of large-scale development projects such as dams without obtaining the consent of a\ufb00 ected communities. In some cases, the appeals and suggestions of indigenous peoples are disregarded. Problems of lack of consent and redress are compounded in projects that are trans-boundary, involving neighboring countries. Box 21: Indigenous Voices Falling on Deaf Ears in Dam Construction Extreme problems have been reported since mid 1996 with the impact of hydropower dams located on the Sesan River in Vietnam, which \ufb02 ows through Ratanakiri and Stung Treng provinces in the northeast of Cambodia. Th e dams have resulted in deaths from \ufb02 ooding, erratic river levels, degraded water quality, increased health problems, a severe decline in \ufb01 sheries and riverine biodiversity, and these e\ufb00 ects continue to threaten the livelihoods and lives of the people who depend on the river. While these problems continue, they are likely to be exacerbated by more dams that have already been commenced or are being planned in Vietnam and Lao PDR, on the Sesan River, Srepok River, Sekong River and Mekong River.

Th ere are very strong local concerns that industrial power generation and the model of industrial development that it supports have profound and long-term negative impacts on the lives of indigenous peoples. 167 Cambodia All of these dams are being built despite the demands of the communities who live along these rivers. Th e demands of the villagers include the restoration of the natural \ufb02 ow (of the river); compensation for past harm; no more dams until agreement is made with the villagers; improvement of the noti\ufb01 cation system; bene\ufb01 t sharing and economic development; insurance if the dam breaks; and greater participation in environmental governance. In addition to dams a\ufb00 ecting the northeast, a survey by the Cambodian Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy has proposed hydro-power dam projects in numerous areas throughout Cambodia. If constructed, these dams will a\ufb00 ect indigenous peoples in at least eight provinces. Graeme Brown, CPAC 5.6 Enhancing Capacity of Indigenous Communities In cases of indigenous land alienation, it is very clear that indigenous communities do not know that the Land Law grants them rights to collective property under the responsibility of their traditional authorities and their mechanisms for decision making. If they were aware of this they would not be so vulnerable to the threats of brokers. It is also clear that they do not know that the Land Law prohibits indigenous common property alienation, so a contract to sell indigenous land has no legal e\ufb00 ect, because the subject matter of the contract is illegal. Indigenous peoples have expressed as a problem the loss of their culture, languages, customs, and traditional authorities. It seems that many groups of indigenous peoples are not aware of the legal statutes in force that protect their rights. Further, they are not familiar with the institutional channels to pursue their demand for the enforcement of those rights. A handful of indigenous students at the local universities and colleges and indigenous community leaders have therefore found it extremely important to gain exposure to relevant laws, international instruments, as well as learn from the experience of other indigenous communities outside of Cambodia.. 168 Bridging The Gap 5.7 Harnessing Indigenous Livelihood Strategies If poverty reduction is to be e\ufb00 ective, indigenous peoples\u2019 customary use of natural resources in their territories needs to be harnessed in partnership with conservation strategies. Th e challenge is to use a combination of e\ufb00 ective joint management strategies and recognition of the rights of communities over their resources. Box 22: Access Rights to Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP) Th ere should be recognition of local community rights to control the use of several NTFPs in National Parks. In the recent past, exploitation of NTFP in National Parks has been anarchic and destructive. Part of the reason for this has been the inability of local communities to control access to important resources, and, therefore, to implement their own form of sustainable management. Th e recent e\ufb00 ort by the park and communities to control the destructive harvesting of malva nuts is a good example of the kinds of joint management approaches that can be successfully implemented. However the park needs to go further in granting local communities management rights, so that they have an incentive to sustainably manage natural resources, knowing that they will be able to bene\ufb01 t from them in the future if they are to manage them properly now. People wish to protect for their own future use, and more speci\ufb01 cally, to protect from unsustainable exploitation and destruction by outside interests. Due to the historical records of communities collecting and trading these forest resources for considerable periods of time, several of these NTFPs could be considered to be the \u201ccultural inheritance\u201d of the Brao, Lun, Kavet and Kreung people. Ironside and Baird, 2003 5.8 Use of Criminal Laws and Police in Land Con\ufb02 icts Although there are speci\ufb01 c laws regulating the use of various natural resources, these laws are often not used when con\ufb02 icts arise. Instead, the police are brought in and criminal laws exercised, which are often more expedient in dealing with indigenous peoples who are struggling for their rights to their land. 169 Cambodia Box 23: Unjust Treatment of Indigenous Peoples Th ere is a considerable number of indigenous people in prison.

Pathways to Justice, p103 5.9 National Implementation of International Instruments Th e presence of several UN agencies and international NGOs in Cambodia has provided the necessary \ufb01 nancial and technical support to indigenous organizations and provided an avenue to share international legal instruments such as the United Nations Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Th e World Bank (WB) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have also adopted policies to recognize and respect indigenous peoples\u2019 rights, and have determined that their policies apply to indigenous peoples in Cambodia. However, the major challenge is to ensure that projects supported by such agencies and bodies to implement human rights standards are not met with mere lip service by local and national government o\ufb03 cials. One observed drawback is the implementation of pilot projects that are money-driven and which have not seen long-term commitments or bene\ufb01 ts. Th e International Labor Organization (ILO) established an o\ufb03 ce in Cambodia to promote ILO Convention 169. It has been a major challenge to get government departments to support the activities of this o\ufb03 ce, even the promotion of the UN- declared International World Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day on August 9 each year. Th e ILO o\ufb03 ce and the Department of Ethnic Minorities Development, which organized an event to celebrate the international day in 2005, were disappointed when several indigenous representatives traveling from several provinces to Phnom Penh were not allowed access by the local authority and stopped by police, just one instance of a regularly observed tendency on behalf of some parts of the police to obstruct and hinder indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations and associations. 170 Bridging The Gap Notes 1. In this report, government (particularly the Department of Ethnic Minorities Development), NGO and indigenous peoples representatives agreed to the use of the term \u201cindigenous peoples\u201d. Some documents still use the term \u201cethnic minorities\u201d and are left as it is when the document is quoted. \u201cEthnic minorities\u201d is not otherwise used as it is often confusing when used in the context of Ratanakiri and Mondulkiri where they represent the majority (67% and 71%). 2.

Indigenous Peoples of Malaysia 1.1 Indigenous Peoples of Sabah Based on the 2000 census, an estimated 39 indigenous groups make up about 60 percent of the estimated 2.6 million total population of Sabah. Th ey speak more than 50 languages and 80 dialects, with the Dusunic, Murutic and Paitanic groups the largest among them. In 1970, the term \u2018bumiputera\u2019, literally meaning \u2018sons of the soil\u2019 was created primarily to facilitate the implementation of Malaysia\u2019s New Economic Policy (NEP).1 Th e special position and privileges as bumiputera accorded to the Malays in Peninsular Malaysia were extended to all native groups in Sabah and Sarawak in the early 1970s but the term is objectionable to many indigenous peoples of Sabah since they are non-Muslims and non-ethnic Malays. Th e Indigenous Peoples Network of Malaysia and other indigenous organizations now use the Malay term \u2018Orang Asali\u2019 or \u2018indigenous/original people\u2019 as Semai women carrying rattan across a bamboo bridge, Ulu Woh, Perak Photo: Colin Nicholas 179 1 Th e NEP was introduced to strengthen unity through (1) reducing and ultimately eradicating poverty by increasing the level of income-expanding opportunities for employment and (2) restructuring society in order to correct the economic imbalance between the di\ufb00 erent ethnic groups. 1 Th e NEP was introduced to strengthen unity through (1) reducing and ultimately eradicating poverty by increasing the level of income expanding opportunities for employment and (2) restructuring society in 180 Bridging The Gap a collective term to refer to themselves. Th is term is accepted and used by the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, but there is still debate among some government agencies. However, indigenous peoples in Sabah often interchange the term \u2018indigenous/orang asali\u2019 and \u2018native/anak negeri\u2019, and thereby accept the use of the latter in many legal documents. Th e Sabah Native Ordinance 1952 outlines who is a \u2018native\u2019. Th e de\ufb01 nition of \u2018native\u2019 is wide and includes, inter alia, any person whose parents, or at least one parent, is indigenous to Sabah and has been living as a member of a native community. It also includes indigenous peoples of Sarawak, Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore and the Sulu group of islands in the Philippines Archipelago who have settled in Sabah before 1963 and have been members of a native community in Sabah for three to \ufb01 ve years consecutively preceding the claim to be a native of Sabah.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77a8496d-c505-4406-8e26-bcf300e2485e": {"__data__": {"id_": "77a8496d-c505-4406-8e26-bcf300e2485e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dbdc0ba0ba93a81678fb22e4058c3ab1a978d074a6aecaa727deecabaf3b3288"}, "2": {"node_id": "b85e70cf-ac48-47cf-a227-4ccb4834f18c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6249f7bbdce3c4998cb087f4c519479c8ee76d3983bec449b26555479631037b"}}, "hash": "3360c19f95ad7839407eaac7af413c753311ed8134ac9061bbc5ed10af1cfc8b", "text": "Basic Information about Sabah Covering an area of 73,619 square kilometers (73.7 million ha), Sabah is the second largest of the 13 states in the Federation of Malaysia.

Most of the lowlands are con\ufb01 ned to the coastal region. Both the coastal belt and mountainous slopes are heavily forested, and tropical rainforest of one type or another characterizes most of the state. Sabah has been called \u2018the land of biodiversity\u2019 in reference to the State\u2019s rich natural resource endowment contributing to one of the highest species-biodiversity in the world. Archaeologists estimate that Sabah was populated at least 30,000 years ago when the early inhabitants frequented the Madai limestone caves for shelter and food. Hunting and gathering were probably their main economic activities with little or no agriculture. Subsequent documentation of communities living in the coastal plains of Sabah indicates that they were largely self-reliant, producing food and other necessities for themselves. Forest and land were the main resources, which everyone had rights to use, cultivate or occupy. A communal way of life was practised and decision-making was more by consensus than enforced authority. Increasing piracy, invasions, slave-raiding and oppression from the Brunei and Sulu Sultans, who considered themselves the owners of the land and the people, forced communities to move inland. As trade developed, combined with feudalism, people had to produce not 181 Malaysia just for subsistence and for barter, but also to pay poll taxes and custom dues that were imposed by the Sultans, Datus and their functionaries. Very often people responded to these oppressive acts by getting together and \ufb01 ghting back, though not always successfully. From the 17th until the early 20th century, slavery was a thriving trade, while piracy was rife from the 18th century onwards. Th e commercial potential of Sabah\u2019s natural resources has been a decisive factor in shaping the State\u2019s history. Until 1877 Sabah was part of the Brunei Empire, but that year the sultans of Brunei sold the northern part of Borneo (Sabah) to a British trading company. Th e British government granted the trading company a Royal Charter and the North Borneo Chartered Company was established. In 1888, control was consolidated when North Borneo became a British Protectorate. As any other company, the main objective of the Chartered Company was to secure a pro\ufb01 t. Th e expanding market for tobacco and later rubber stimulated European interest in setting up plantations in Sabah. Th e Chartered Company realised that to achieve this, it was necessary to clarify legally the boundaries between the land used by the natives and the land available for such plantations. Th us, as part of the aim to develop agricultural production and to gain access to resources, a system of codi\ufb01 cation and land titling started under British rule. After the Japanese Occupation during World War II, Sabah became a British Crown Colony in 1946 and the exploitation and control of Sabah\u2019s natural resources, especially timber and farmland, continued. In August 1963, Sabah became independent, but joined the Federation of Malaysia on September 16 in the same year. Table 1.

Between 2,000 and 3,000 years ago, the southerly groups came in contact with the sea- faring peoples from Borneo and the Indonesian islands. Some of these Orang Asli who traded with the Austronesian-speakers assimilated with them, hence the term proto-, or early-, Malays. Th e exception perhaps is the Orang Kuala group who are said to have migrated from Sumatra about 600 years ago. Th e ancestors of today\u2019s Orang Asli never lived in isolation nor were they removed from the political situation of the day. As early as the 5th Century AD, for instance, the Orang Asli played a signi\ufb01 cant role in the Malay Peninsula\u2019s economic history as collectors and traders of primary products. Being the only ones who had the needed knowledge and skills to locate and extract these commodities, the Orang Asli were sought by traders from India, China and the Mon civilisations in southern Th ailand. Forest products such as resin, camphor, ivory, rattan and even gold were bartered for salt, cloth, beads and iron tools. Sea products \u2013 such as the rare black branching coral known to the Malays as akar bahar and the famed tripang or sea slug used as an ingredient in Chinese soups and medicinal preparations \u2013 were also traded by the coastal Orang Asli. Some of the Orang Asli groups also played very dominant roles in the administration and defence of earlier political systems in the Malay Peninsula. Th us when Parameswara with his following appeared in Malacca from Tumasek (as Singapore was called) and later 183 Malaysia established one of the \ufb01 rst Malay kingdoms, there was already a small \ufb01 shing village at the site, whose population included the Orang Laut. In fact, Hang Tuah, the most famous Laksamana in Malay folklore, was himself of Orang Laut background. For centuries to follow, the Orang Laut devotion to the Malay rulers of Malacca, aided via judicious marriages into the royal family itself, was a crucial factor in the kingdom\u2019s preservation and prosperity. Marriages between Malay rulers and Orang Asli brides were also not uncommon. Aspiring heirs in Negri Sembilan, for example, had to resort to claiming Orang Asli (matrilineal) ancestry in order to be eligible for hereditary positions.

For the most part, from this time the Orang Asli lived in remote communities, each within a speci\ufb01 c geographical space (such as a river valley) and isolated from the others. Th ey identi\ufb01 ed themselves by their speci\ufb01 c ecological niche, which they called their customary or adat land, and developed a close a\ufb03 nity with it. Much of the basis of their culture and religion is derived from this close association with their particular environment. Th eir basic economic activities \u2013 hunting, gathering, foraging, swiddening and some trade \u2013 remained unchanged for a long time.

Colonial Impact/Th e Emergency For the most part, prior to the early 1900s, the Orang Asli were regarded as pagans and ka\ufb01 rs (unbelievers) and were called various names such as the much-despised sakai (slave or dependent) and orang liar (wild men).

Th is attitude changed substantially only with the Emergency of 1948-1960 during which the Orang Asli were known to provide food, labour and intelligence to the communist insurgents, or had even joined their ranks. In an attempt to stop this relationship, the colonial authorities uprooted whole Orang Asli villages and moved the inhabitants to hastily-prepared resettlement camps. A few hundred Orang Asli died in these crowded and sun-baked camps, mainly due to mental depression rather than diseases. Th is caused Orang Asli resentment and anger towards the government and provoked a few of them to increase their support for the insurgents. 185 Malaysia Th e Colonial Government was then forced to devise ways to win over the Orang Asli to their side. Th e Department of Aborigines was established and the post of Adviser on Aborigines created. Th e Aboriginal Peoples Act, which had both protection and control measures over the Orang Asli, was enacted in 1954. Th e dreaded resettlement camps were replaced by \u2018patterned settlements\u2019 (later to be called \u2018regroupment schemes\u2019) established close to, though not always within, their traditional homelands, and where a small shop and medical facilities were available within the watchful sight of the security forces. Th e strategy nevertheless proved successful and Orang Asli support for the insurgents eventually waned. When the Emergency was declared o\ufb03 cially over in 1960 a period of much more active and direct involvement by the state in the a\ufb00 airs and lives of the Orang Asli begun. Modernisation and Integration with the Mainstream In 1961, a year after the end of the Emergency, the government resolved that it should \u2018adopt suitable measures designed for their [Orang Asli] protection and advancement with a view to their ultimate integration with the Malay section of the community\u2019. Th is policy of integration into the Malay mainstream was to be achieved by promoting economic development projects among the Orang Asli, delivered mainly through the agency of the Department of Orang Asli A\ufb00 airs (JHEOA). However, the onset of the Second Emergency (1968-1978) that saw the communist insurgents operating once again from the forest homelands of the Orang Asli, forced the authorities to give priority, yet again, to security. As a result, more Orang Asli settlements, especially along the forested spine of the peninsula, were removed from their traditional environment and relocated into large new regroupment schemes, not unlike the FELDA schemes for landless settlers. Even after the communist insurgency formally ended in 1989, the policy of regroupment remained with the rationale that the perceived nomadism of the Orang Asli made it di\ufb03 cult and uneconomic for the government to bring development to them. Nevertheless, while the expressed goals of the government remain largely unchanged \u2013 viz. to improve the wellbeing and to integrate the Orang Asli with the national society \u2013 there were signi\ufb01 cant changes in the way these were to be achieved. Changes included the introduction of privatisation as a tool for the development of Orang Asli areas, their participation in tourism, and the development of an entrepreneurial class of Orang Asli youth. Th e strategy also involved e\ufb00 orts at introducing a value system based on Islam for the integration of the Orang Asli with the wider society in general and the Malays in particular. 186 Bridging The Gap Th e rapid pace of modernisation in and around their traditional territories has a\ufb00 ected the way of life of many Orang Asli communities. Developments in social services have also improved their condition, especially in regards to access to health and educational facilities. Nevertheless, as a community, the Orang Asli still lags far behind other Malaysians in all indicators of wellbeing. Th is is likely to change for the better, as greater self-awareness and self-con\ufb01 dence have resulted in more Orang Asli becoming increasingly vocal and pro-active in seeking their rightful dues and in improving their situation. Despite the vast changes occurring around them, the Orang Asli remain a distinct and proud people. 2.

Apart from farming, many of the land-based indigenous communities rely on the diverse forest resources for their food, medicine, fuel, building materials and other household needs. Along the coastline and river mouths, there are many \ufb01 shing communities that derive their cash incomes both from agriculture as well as \ufb01 sh sold at the market. 2.1 Concepts and Principles of Indigenous Natural Resource Management Natural resources to indigenous peoples in Sabah include land, forest, agricultural areas, and rivers and coastal areas, in which land is central and often understood to encompass all these natural resources collectively. Traditional communities have a close relationship to land and resources and see themselves as part of the whole ecosystem. Natural resources are signi\ufb01 cant not only as a means of production but also as part of indigenous peoples\u2019 spiritual and cultural traditions, giving them their identity as peoples. Indigenous knowledge, innovations and practices on natural resource management is a little understood yet highly complex system, one that is closely interlinked with other indigenous systems. It incorporates a keen awareness of the environment, an appreciation for conservation and continuity, encourages sustainable innovation, and places the well- being of the community as the focus of all activities. 187 Malaysia 2.2 Framework and Institution of Indigenous Natural Resource Management Th e goals of indigenous natural resource management are economic self-su\ufb03 ciency and environmental sustainability. Th e indigenous natural resource management system is closely linked with other indigenous systems, such as social, cultural, spiritual, economic, governance, juridical, health, technological and learning systems. Management of natural resources through the adat has been established for generations and unwritten laws are transmitted by parents and elders in the community. Adat management of resources is also an integral part of community institutional control over lands and resources. Traditionally the Council of Elders governs the management of natural resources through customary laws and socialization of the whole community. Th e Council of Elders is composed of the village head, elders and the bobohizan (priests/priestesses). Natural resource management involves both physical and spiritual realms and its practices are manifested by every indigenous person in their daily activities such that it has become a way of life for the community. Th e balance between the spiritual and physical realms will determine the condition of the universe and the immediate environment of communities, including the circumstances and conditions of the people. In spiritual terms, the \u2018hot\u2019 (ahasu) condition symbolizes tragedy resulting in sickness, death or bad luck. It is believed that this condition comes about when members of the community go against set rules \u2013 be they socio-cultural, spiritual or those that relate to the environment. When the condition is ahasu, traditional communities believe that only the bobohizan can restore the balance through ceremonies. Division of the tagal catch among all the villagers, Photo: PACOS Trust Kampung Pongobonon, Penampang 188 Bridging The Gap For the physical realm, the village head and elders instruct and enforce the adat to ensure that the whole community not only manages resources in a responsible manner but also passes on the knowledge to the next generation. In the past, the ketua kampong and elders were selected based on their wisdom and expertise. Th ey would make decisions on a consensus basis, taking the interest of the community as whole into consideration. A big part of their role was to manage the natural resources of the community to ensure sustainability and fairness. Th e institution of the Council of Elders has now disappeared, having been replaced by the JKKK or Village Development and Security Committee. Members of this committee used to be elected by the community, but in recent years their appointment has been based on allegiance to the political party in power. Although the Council of Elders no longer exists in most indigenous communities, the bobohizan and knowledgeable elders are still called upon to perform the ceremonies. Today, the government recognizes only the village head (ketua kampong) as the traditional authority, in charge of the administration of the customary juridical system. However, as they are also in the employ of the government, their (most of the village heads are men, with a just a handful of women ketua kampong) power is gradually being taken away. Th eir role as instructors and enforcers of the adat has diminished, and many are relegated to routine settling of family disputes and some inter- village con\ufb02 icts.

Resources Management Committees are formed through community meetings. Th ey often have women, youth and elders as members, and are functioning well with various activities. However, there is also growing realization and re\ufb02 ection on the importance of strengthening traditional institutions, to ensure that indigenous natural resource management systems once again become vibrant and relevant systems, with customary laws and the adat put in place to guide community members in education (knowledge transmission) and monitoring within indigenous territories. 2.3 Indigenous Natural Resource Management Practices Th e indigenous concept and principles on the use and ownership of natural resources are realized though a variety of practices that embody spiritual beliefs and respect for the natural resources. Box 1 illustrates some examples of these practices that are still used today. 189 Malaysia Box 1: Examples of Indigenous Resource Management Practices Lands and Forest Traditional ownership of a plot of land is based on mutual agreement within the community. Land ownership can be con\ufb01 rmed by a headman and is identi\ufb01 ed by the presence of certain signs such as fruit trees or the burial grounds of ancestors. Boundaries are marked by certain trees, a large rock/megalith, and the rolok bush or by reference to rivers or streams. To ensure that forest resources are not taken without permission of the owner, certain signs \u2013 understood by most indigenous communities \u2013 are placed strategically around the lands. To ensure that forests are healthy and productive, unnecessary cleaning and cutting of trees is prohibited. Th e opening of farmland is usually on a small scale and restricted to areas of secondary forest growth. When fertility of the land for hill paddy cultivation is reduced, a fallow period is observed to give the land a rest and to restore its fertility. Wildlife \u2013 Seeds, Plants (including Medicinal Plants) and Animals To ensure that wildlife continues to thrive, selective hunting is practiced whereby only mature animals and game are hunted. In the same way, knowledge on seed selection and storage, maintained in particular by women, are important management strategies at the household and community level. A practice of leaving the last fruits to ensure continuity of plant varieties is still maintained by many communities. Indigenous peoples believe that medicinal plants have spirits and that respect is necessary before taking any plants. Th e concept of \u2018use and protect\u2019 ensures plants and animals with medicinal properties are not over-harvested and practices such as taking only what is needed still prevail among indigenous communities. River, Water and Aquatic Life When the number of \ufb01 sh is on the decline in rivers and inland waters, a communal understanding can be proclaimed through the practice of managal, the marking of a stretch of river as a \u2018no \ufb01 shing\u2019 zone for a certain period of time (six months to a year). Th e proclamation is performed through a ceremony called the monogit, where the community slaughters a pig and eat it together to mark the period of abstinence. 190 Bridging The Gap Natural Resource Management and Indigenous Spirituality Indigenous concepts of natural resource management are based on the world-view that all matter has a spirit (moinat) and therefore ought to be treated with respect. As such, the arbitrary taking of life is prohibited \u2013 whether plants, animals or birds \u2013 and arbitrary destruction of the environment through logging, clearing of land and other activities, which disrupt harmony and cause con\ufb02 ict between the spiritual and physical realm, is likewise banned. Indigenous spirituality is thus the expression of respect for spiritual being, social relations and the environment in which they manifest. 2.4 Inter-Generational Transfer of Knowledge Th e village head, or ketua kampong, presides over community meetings and hearings and plays a major role in ensuring adherence to traditional land boundaries, and the exclusive ownership of certain natural resources according to customary laws. Th e maintenance and transfer of knowledge is a responsibility of every individual in the community, although parents and elders play a particularly strong role. Such knowledge is learned orally through constant reference/repetition, by encouraging children to observe and to put them into practice in their daily life. Herbalists, carpenters and priests/ priestesses acquire and pass their knowledge through apprenticeship. Th ey learn not only their trade but also study the natural resources important to their work, and the traditional knowledge concerning the management of those resources. Communities are aware that the traditional knowledge on natural resource management is eroding gradually due to several political, economic and socio-cultural factors that are impacting on the lives of indigenous communities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c444c48-712c-4c69-9f94-0eded7c5ca4f": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c444c48-712c-4c69-9f94-0eded7c5ca4f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f09391a9e1701e3ef669e981bfe93912f06dd877207cbf7668d2e6ef8cc0fde"}, "3": {"node_id": "0c036f9b-cdf1-49b1-97f4-eeaeb0891208", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd6f309b73cf664b160c3372813f7db1a5a1dd66a8fd6dfc2ebf9d89fcb235bf"}}, "hash": "729e9252ab2c80c6fd3f271607ec1b89973bfef95a5325a98075f4a49a1b436c", "text": "Th is includes consumerism, cultural borrowing and exposure to other in\ufb02 uences brought on by the arrival of roads, western education models, a cash economy and mass media. All these have changed indigenous peoples\u2019 perceptions on natural resource management. Th e separation of the younger generation from their immediate environment and the compartmentalized way of thinking also means that they are no longer accustomed to the holistic approach inherent in the indigenous concept of natural resource management. Th is leads to a lack of re\ufb02 ection on the concepts and principles of community-based resource management. 191 Malaysia 3. Legal and Policy Framework on Natural Resource Management Th is chapter reviews and analyzes current laws and policies regarding natural resource management, land tenure and resource access, with a view to identifying gaps with respect to the recognition of indigenous peoples\u2019 rights. 3.1 State and Federal Constitution Th e indigenous peoples, or \u2018natives\u2019, of Sabah are accorded special rights and privileges under article 153 of the Federal Constitution. Further, article 161A(5) provides that state law in Sabah and Sarawak may provide for the reservation of land for natives or for giving preferential treatment in the appropriation of land by the state. Th e Federal Constitution speci\ufb01 es the division of powers between the state and federal governments. Th e Constitution\u2019s Ninth Schedule divides the various responsibilities, privileges, and jurisdictions into three lists: List 1, the Federal List; List 2, the State List; and List 3, the Concurrent List. Article 73(b) of the Federal Constitution also empower the states of Sabah and Sarawak to enact their own laws though their State Legislative Assemblies. 3.2 Natural Resource Management Laws in Sabah In Sabah, there is no single law or policy that governs natural resource management. Resources are compartmentalized (e.g. according to land, \ufb01 sheries, forests, parks, wildlife, water, plantations and biodiversity). Any given law and its accompanying \u2018rules\u2019 govern the management of a particular resource under a speci\ufb01 c department created to administer the law. Many laws on natural resource management also overlap in their jurisdiction and this requires inter-departmental and inter-ministerial coordination. 3.2.1 Land Ordinance, 1930 A whole section of the Land Ordinance is dedicated to Native Lands (Part IV, sections 64 to 86), with some other relevant sections also found in the main body of the law. Th e law also covers various sections on sub-surface and surface resources, as well as sea and coastal areas. Section 15, on Native Customary Rights (NCR), is also provided in the Land Ordinance. NCR to land include: 192 Bridging The Gap \u2022 Land possessed by customary tenure; \u2022 Land planted with 20 or more fruit trees per acre; \u2022 Fruit trees, sago, rattan and other plants of economic value that are planted, upkept and regularly enjoyed as personal property; \u2022 Grazing land stocked with cattle or horses; \u2022 Land that has been cultivated or built on within 3 years; \u2022 Burial grounds and shrines; and \u2022 Rights of way for people and animals. Customary tenure is de\ufb01 ned as the lawful possession of land by natives by occupation or cultivation continuously for three or more consecutive years or by title deed. However, in practice land titles are seen to be an indefeasible right of ownership. All land is considered to be state-owned and claims to non-state ownership have to be registered and approved by the state. Section 15 was an attempt to incorporate indigenous peoples\u2019 customary law on land ownership into the land law. However, due to the lack understanding of indigenous peoples\u2019 concept of land and natural resource management and the misrepresentation of customary law, this has resulted in inconsistencies and gaps within the process of land delineation.

Th is was the case for the Sabah Forest Industries and the Sabah Land Development Board. Non-implementation of existing safeguards is a further concern. Section 13 of the Ordinance requires the posting of a notice and validation in the area concerned in any application for land ownership. In reality this has not happened, with the posting of notices only in the district o\ufb03 ces of the Lands and Survey Department, where indigenous people do not regularly visit or visit at all. Section 17 states, \u201cexcept with the written permission of the Minister all dealings in land between non-natives on the one hand and natives on the other hand are hereby expressly forbidden and no such dealings shall be valid or shall be recognised in any court of law\u201d. Th is section has often been circumvented, and many indigenous peoples have lost their traditional land in deals that did not bene\ufb01 t the indigenous owner. A controversial addition under section 12(5) to allow sub-lease of native titles up to 99 years is now being reviewed. Sections 23 and 24 give the right to sub-surface and surface resources such as minerals, timber or other forest produce or any earth, gravel, stones, coral, shell, guano, sand, loam or clay, or any bricks, lime, cement or other commodities manufactured from these materials to the state. Most indigenous people have opted for individual native titles over their land, mainly because this is the most strongly promoted by the government. However, the Land Ordinance provides for other forms of title, including communal title or native reserve, and simply registering land with NCR. Section 76 provides for the (Chief) Minister Communal Titles, \u201cin cases where a claim to customary tenure of land has been established or a claim to native customary rights has been dealt with by a grant of land and such land 194 Bridging The Gap is held for the common use and bene\ufb01 t of natives and is not assigned to any individual as his private property\u201d. Th e Director of Lands and Survey holds the title in trust for the community concerned, without power of sale. Section 78 provides for the gazetting of Natives Reserves by the Governor if he thinks it necessary to protect the present and future interests and well-being of the natives of Sabah or any community. Th e Native Reserve is held in trust by any person appointed by the Governor, in most cases the district o\ufb03 cer or the village head. 3.2.2 Land Acquisition Ordinance As mentioned, any land may be subjected to compulsory acquisition by the state if it is deemed for \u2018public purpose\u2019. Under section 2(h) a broad de\ufb01 nition of \u2018public purpose\u2019 is provided, including resettlement, conservation and exploitation of natural resources. Th e Ordinance does provide explicitly for the determination of claims to compensation, although in many cases indigenous communities have lost Native Customary Rights land through such acquisition without compensation. Th is is because section 9 allows only three months for the owner to register their interest and serve a notice to the authorized o\ufb03 cer after which claims to compensation are considered invalid. 3.2.3 Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Enactment 2003 Under Part V of the Enactment on Riverine Fishing and Fisheries, sections 35 to 37 relate to Community Fisheries Management Zones. Section 35 allows for the declaration and recognition of indigenous system of resource management, while sections 36 and 37 create a new protocol by providing for the creation of a committee to administer such zones, and by introducing punishment related to the Community Fisheries Zone. As mentioned earlier, although the law itself is very progressive in recognizing community system of managing riverine resources (by creating committees under sections 36 and 37), it has in a sense contributed to the weakening of traditional authority for the Tagal system (see also 4.1.3). Even though the state Fisheries Department has done an admirable job in promoting Tagal, by not specifying the need for equal partnership and equal decision- making by the community in all developments in inland \ufb01 sheries, the success of the traditional Tagal system was in a sense taken over by the Department. 195 Malaysia 3.2.4 Forest Enactment, 1968 and Forest Rules, 1969 Th ere is no provision in the Forest Enactment 1968 for the recognition of indigenous land rights. However, the enactment allows indigenous peoples to use forest resources for their livelihood, including use for the bene\ufb01 t of the individual and the community and their traditional way of life (section 41).

Th ese two provisions represent the two biggest areas of contention for communities, particularly regarding the process followed in the \u2018enquiries\u2019 and settlement of claims. Such enquiries and subsequent settlements have rarely been done in accordance with the requirements. Several communities claim that their objections were not recorded and they in fact su\ufb00 ered repression as a consequence of their objections. Today, the area gazetted as Forest Reserves (49 percent of the total land area of Sabah) is already established and there is no provision within the Enactment for appeals or settlement of claims. 3.2.5 Parks Enactment, 1984 Th e objectives and functions of the (Department of) Sabah Parks are, among others, to preserve signi\ufb01 cant geographical, biological or historical features for the bene\ufb01 t, education and enjoyment of present and future generations and to provide accommodation and amenities without disturbing the environment of the Parks. Th e Department controls, manages and maintains all areas legislated under the Parks Enactment 1984, which includes both inland and marine ecosystems. However, section 20 of the Parks (Amendment) Enactment 2002 empowers the Parks Board of Trustees to also carry out bio-prospecting and tree plantations as well as developing commercial and industrial enterprises. Th e law, however, does not provide for the participation of indigenous peoples in collaborative management of the Parks. 3.2.6 Conservation of the Environment Enactment 1996 and the Environment Protection Enactment 2002 Th e Conservation of the Environment Enactment was enacted in 1996 and came into force on 1st August 1998, coinciding with the establishment of the Department of Environmental Protection. Th e Enactment has been amended twice to strengthen certain provisions, in particular providing for heavier penalties for causing serious environmental 196 Bridging The Gap degradation, mainly directed at large companies opening up tracts of land for plantations. However the Department of Environmental Protection lacks sta\ufb00 and resources and has not had any signi\ufb01 cant impact in realizing its mandate. Th e Department was the main body responsible for drawing up the Sabah Biodiversity Enactment 2000. Th e Environment Protection Enactment enacted in 2002 to complement the Conservation of the Environment Enactment is still not in force. Th e Conservation of the Environment Enactment also has no provision for indigenous peoples\u2019 rights, and in fact in several sections restrictions are imposed on the use of land (see, for example, section 28) and activities a\ufb00 ecting vegetation (section 33). 3.2.7 Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 and the Wildlife Regulation 1998 Th e Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 recognises community hunting areas (section 32) and honorary wildlife wardens (section 7) from the community. Th e training of these wardens and the procedures to set aside community hunting areas that were developed by the Wildlife Department and Danish Cooperation for Environment and Development (DANCED) strongly emphasize indigenous knowledge on wildlife management and conservation. As in all of the other Ordinances and Enactments to reserve land for speci\ufb01 c purposes, the Wildlife Conservation Enactment provides an outlines in section 9 of the necessity for a notice to explain the purpose and call for settlement of claims. Section 9(2)(c) in particular requires explanation of \u201cnative or traditional rights that will continue to be exercisable after the coming into e\ufb00 ect of the declaration of the proposed sanctuary\u201d. Section 9(2)(d) also requires a summary of representations made by communities likely to be a\ufb00 ected. Th e main weakness of these provisions is the relatively short period of 90 days to be published in the government Gazette and posted in the o\ufb03 ce of the Lands and Survey Department located in town centres. No speci\ufb01 c provision exists with respect to indigenous knowledge under the Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997. Many of the plant species that are used in traditional medicines are considered protected species and require a license to collect, a requirement for indigenous communities as well as others. It is not clear whether this restriction has a\ufb00 ected the indigenous health practices of communities.

Although the Enactment appears progressive with respect to management of water resources, there are gaps with respect to setting aside water protection areas. In section 36, interest to protect areas precedes the rights of indigenous peoples to land and does not recognize the fact that indigenous peoples may have been traditionally protecting the area adequately. An example is a case in Bundu, where communities have managed to stop large-scale loggers from entering their watershed area upstream. Th e area remained pristine but the declaration of the area as a water protection area did not stop logging companies from attempting to enter and devastate the entire area, creating havoc to peoples\u2019 lives in the process.

Much of the land alienated to these state agencies were indigenous peoples\u2019 land claimed under native customary rights. Th e land was acquired under section 28 of the Land Ordinance 1930 or under the Compulsory Land Acquisition Act, with little or no compensation. Th ese agencies include Sabah Forest Industries (SFI) and the Sabah Land Development Board (SLDB). In the 1990s the state agencies were privatized whereupon the alienated lands became private property. Of the many state agencies created in the 1980s, only the Rural Development Corporation (KPD), the Sabah Rubber Industry Board and the Sabah Forestry Development Authority (SAFODA) remain full government agencies. Section 39(1) of the SAFODA Enactment provides for compulsory acquisition of land. Although there are also provisions for appeal, the lack of mechanisms for notifying the owners on the ground e\ufb00 ectively prevented indigenous peoples from recording and settling land disputes in an organized manner. Under an anomalous section, section 47, SAFODA is deemed a Native entity for the purpose of any law relating to land. 3.2.10 Biodiversity Enactment, 2000 Although the draft Sabah Biodiversity Enactment did not undergo much public scrutiny prior to its adoption in 2000, sustained e\ufb00 orts by indigenous organizations to engage the government and to raise issues on recognition of rights to lands and resources, traditional knowledge and bene\ufb01 t-sharing has resulted in a number of progressive sections within the Enactment. Th e Enactment contains eight important sections that are relevant to indigenous peoples. Section 9(1)(j) provides for a system to ensure that indigenous peoples and other local communities are, at all times and in perpetuity, the legitimate creators, users and custodians of traditional knowledge, and collectively bene\ufb01 t from the use of such knowledge. It also recognizes rights to biological resources in land claimed under NCR (section 16(b)), and has provisions to ensure that any activities related to the collection of biological resources do not negatively impact the livelihood, quality of life and the way of life of indigenous peoples (sections 20(3) and 25(1)(b)). Th e Enactment, however, cannot be implemented until the Rules that accompany the Enactment are formulated and adopted. In 2004, indigenous organizations again went 199 Malaysia through a series of consultations with communities, NGOs and the government to produce the draft Rules related to sections relevant to indigenous peoples.

Th e policy strongly emphasizes the need for sustainable forest management, forest legislation, use of non-wood forest products, conservation of biodiversity, community forestry, recreation and tourism. Under the policy, communities may cultivate within forest reserves, move inside the forest freely and collect any forest produce. Th ey are allowed to reside within the limits of forest reserves and are encouraged to participate in forest management through a joint forest management approach. Th e latest action taken by the Sabah Forestry Department to legally recognize cultivation within forest reserves is the approval of Occupation Permits. Under the Sustainable Forest Management System, areas may be set aside for community forest 200 Bridging The Gap areas. License agreements between Forest Management Unit holders and the Sabah Forestry Department also recognise customary use of resources by indigenous communities. All research and collection of specimens inside forest reserves requires a permit from the Sabah Forestry Department. However, enforcement is a huge task, as 49 percent of Sabah\u2019s total land area of 74,000 sq km has been gazetted as forest reserves. It is therefore still possible to acquire plant and animal specimens and relevant knowledge on the use of such specimens from the community without the knowledge of the department, and for it to be brought out of Sabah undetected. 3.3.2 Sabah Conservation Strategy 1992 Focusing on wise land use as the key to conservation and development in Sabah in the 1990s, the Sabah Conservation Strategy of 1992 calls for the establishment of a variety of protected areas, as well as improved management of resources on a regional basis. Th e Strategy proposes a variety of actions covering land-use, land revenue, multiple use management, water catchment areas, community forests, timber production, damaged forests, illegal logging, plantation forestry, biodiversity, mining, ecotourism, land applications, Environmental Impact Assessments, coastal development and others. For example, the Strategy calls for the preparation of a series of maps to assist in environmentally- friendly land-use planning. \u2018Environmentally sensitive\u2019 areas also need to be identi\ufb01 ed and reserved. Implementation of these strategies supports conservation e\ufb00 orts covering the entire country both at state and federal levels. 3.3.3 National Policies Federal policies that are also relevant include the National Development Policy, the 5-yearly Malaysia Plans, National Agriculture Policy, National Environment Policy, National Forest Policy, National Mining Policy, Soil Conservation Action Plan and the National Biodiversity Conservation Policy. 201 Malaysia 4. Th e interface between Indigenous and Statutory Systems and Laws on Natural Resource Management In this chapter the interface between indigenous and state systems and laws on natural resource management are assessed, with gaps and challenges identi\ufb01 ed for further action. Th e chapter looks at current e\ufb00 orts to combine indigenous systems with other systems on natural resource management to illustrate the need to further develop such initiatives; as well as examining and illustrating the current and potential roles of government, NGOs, community organizations and donors in improving natural resource management in Malaysia. Recognizing the need for indigenous peoples\u2019 involvement in natural resource management, section 4.2 highlights mechanisms and issues for e\ufb00 ective participation. 4.1 Indigenous Peoples and the State Legal and Policy Framework 4.1.1 Ownership Rights Framework Th e key to access and control of resources is recognition of land rights. Existing laws on natural resource management do have some provisions for the recognition of native customary rights to land, and for settlement of claims arising from the need to gain consent of \ufb01 rst or existing settlers. However, as illustrated in the Sabah Land Ordinance, the interpretation of rightful occupation does not coincide with indigenous peoples\u2019 concepts and customary law on land ownership. Th e recognition of collective rights for indigenous peoples would mean the preservation of collective identity. Collective rights include access to and control over lands and resources, and also participation in and control over decision-making. Th is has led to the dispossession of traditional lands, the main source of material and spiritual well-being of indigenous communities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d52e8c5-9754-452d-bbaf-694a83f8c17b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d52e8c5-9754-452d-bbaf-694a83f8c17b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29aae64ac0fe2887970a2638684869347a38654abf81322ab24a76da80850454"}, "2": {"node_id": "d9b63c92-52de-4516-97e1-692f32707448", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37b0b7d840c92e0824e203db6ca84e9f505867b51e1c0669da5aaeeb11a5c386"}}, "hash": "7fe1a5b9a6900d1e298e4dfc56284e81429388cd97d08136c7acd2d9c2643e7a", "text": "4.1.2 Use Rights Framework Access to resources in many cases may be granted but this right is not consistent between the di\ufb00 erent laws, and is further complicated by gaps in the existing laws.

Th e Sabah Parks is developing a policy to create Traditional Use Zones within the Crocker Range Park, but this policy 202 Bridging The Gap would be invalid without legal reform to allow it to be o\ufb03 cial. Continued use of resources in an uno\ufb03 cial manner leaves communities vulnerable to strict enforcement of existing laws, and such use must be made legally defensible. Explicit legal and policy attempts to do so, such as the policy to set aside Community Forest Areas under the Sustainable Forest Management System, are rendered useless as they are not implemented Forest Management Unit holders. 4.1.3 Incorporation vs Recognition of Customary Law Recognition of indigenous resource management to date has been characterized by attempts to incorporate an aspect of the traditional management system into state/national laws. For example the customary tagal system of resource management was incorporated into the Sabah Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Enactment 2003. However, such a strategy may not necessarily capture indigenous concepts adequately, a situation illustrated by the incomplete incorporation of indigenous land ownership into the de\ufb01 nition of native customary rights to land in the Sabah Land Ordinance. Th ere is no requirement to recognize customary law per se. Part of this unwillingness to recognize customary law stems from the fact that customary law in general, and on natural resource management in particular, is not well-understood or documented, and there is often fear of recognizing it from the side of governments. Past e\ufb00 orts of the government to recognize customary law has thus involved some form of codi\ufb01 cation to lessen the fear of the unknown, a process which is inappropriate and rejected by communities, as it ignores the diverse nature of customary laws of communities. Th e other weakness is the tendency to form committees to manage resources, taking away the control that was traditionally held by the community. Although such committees may in fact allow more participation, particularly from women and youth, it nevertheless means that the already-weakened traditional structure is increasingly sidelined. In the long run, it will further dis-empower indigenous communities in their aspiration for self- determination and a pluralistic society. 4.1.4 Consultation vs Consent Provisions and procedures for obtaining consent are implicitly or explicitly contained in most laws relating to lands to be set aside for native titles and protected areas, or the rights to access and use resources found therein. It is assumed that in Sabah, where the rural areas 203 Malaysia are traditionally occupied by indigenous peoples, the spirit of these laws is to give priority to indigenous peoples\u2019 claim to lands and resources. Settlement of claims is also expected prior to gazetting of lands, and the granting of a title or permit. But apart from the fact mentioned earlier about the non-compliance with these provisions to provide adequate notice, the gap in the law also lies in the requirement for consultation rather than consent. Th e state assumes control and authority on how lands and resources are managed, and its authority pre-empts indigenous authority. Consent from indigenous communities is secondary to the government plans for land use \u2013 they are consulted about the use of their lands but do not necessarily have to give consent. 4.1.5 Con\ufb02 icting Provisions Section 28 of the Land Ordinance 1930 continues to represent the most signi\ufb01 cant reason for indigenous peoples\u2019 dispossession of land in Sabah. Th is section is used widely to set aside land for \u2018public purpose\u2019, interpreted as activities that are in line with the government\u2019s economic interests. Th is includes large-scale oil palm and tree plantations. Within the Land Ordinance itself, provisions for the recognition of native customary rights land under section 15 is considered secondary to the legal right to gazette provided for in section 28. Land titles, which are considered as the strongest proof of rights to land, can also be subjected to acquisition for public good through the Land Acquisition Ordinance. 4.1.6 Con\ufb02 ict in Development Paradigms Di\ufb00 ering concepts about the fundamental purpose and meaning of development lie at the heart of con\ufb02 icts over land and natural resource management use. As far as the State is concerned, the \u2018use\u2019 of natural resources is mainly for exploitation to \ufb01 nance infrastructure development and other expenditures of the state. Th ere is no regard for indigenous peoples\u2019 own concepts of development, which are often considered unproductive, and therefore indigenous peoples\u2019 customary use of natural resources is not encouraged or developed.

Th e majority of indigenous peoples in Sabah still live in rural areas, but are increasingly migrating \u2013 either temporarily or permanently \u2013 to urban areas as livelihoods deteriorate due to natural resources exploitation and insecure land tenure. 204 Bridging The Gap Indigenous peoples are increasingly joining, or are forced to accept, mainstream development and commercialization. Th is poses a challenge to natural resource management especially in and around sensitive areas. Th e gazetting or declaration of parks and other protected areas under the current laws is also an important factor leading to unresolved con\ufb02 icts between the state and indigenous communities, due to loss of access to or restricted use of resources within these areas. 4.1.7 Recognition of Indigenous Natural Resource Management System Th e underlying con\ufb02 ict between concepts on the appropriate use of resources by the State and indigenous peoples undermines recognition of indigenous natural resource management. Th e state views resources in a compartmentalized manner and separates the management of resources rather than conceptualizing resource management in a holistic way. Th e ecosystem approach is much closer to the concept of indigenous communities, employing traditional knowledge systems in the management of resources. Traditional knowledge about the management of resources such as seeds, medicines and other biological resources is recognized in the Sabah Biodiversity Enactment 2000 but implementation is not possible as there are still no rules to accompany the Enactment. In the meantime, a Community Protocol on research and access to resources has been implemented by communities. Th e fact remains that the indigenous concept of using and at the same time protecting the environment is not well accepted by the government. Ecologically sound practices such as rotational agriculture in upland areas are still considered destructive and discouraged, yet alternatives are not provided. At the same time, inputs such as chemical fertilisers and pesticides continue to form the bulk of government agricultural subsidies. 4.1.8 Repressing the Nurturers Enforcement of existing natural resource management laws is also a challenge for many departments because of limited human and \ufb01 nancial resources. In the past, particularly when dealing with con\ufb02 icting claims by indigenous peoples over resources, police and army personnel would suppress communities that attempted to protect their rights to resources. Such direct and violent suppression would often happen when lands and resources were given to private corporations as logging concessions, plantations, dams and mining. 205 Malaysia Th e positive provisions within natural resource management laws described above are seldom used. Instead, communities that are often protectors and nurturers of natural resources are the ones arrested and charged for a criminal o\ufb00 ence under the penal code. 4.2 Harnessing Indigenous Natural Resource Management One tool to assist in management of resources through the indigenous NRM system is zoning according to traditional use, with the involvement of communities in mapping and other related activities. Community boundary mapping and resource mapping can be established using modern instruments such as GPS, employing up-to-date satellite images for developing GIS. Zoning of areas can be crucial in implementing resource management that has been traditionally practiced but not recorded or done in a systematic way. Such zoning and mapping must be done locally with in-depth discussions involving those knowledgeable about the community area. Customary laws may not be adequate to meet new challenges and issues in access and control of resources. When communities in Sabah realized that there was no comprehensive adat to regulate access and control over community resources, in particular by researchers and bio- pirates, they developed a community protocol for this purpose. Traditionally, indigenous communities monitor and assess their own resources on the level of responsibility and needs of the community. Since most communities do not own instruments such as early- warning systems, they usually rely on their observation and traditional knowledge to monitor and assess the condition of community resources. Hence, the development of a community protocol was to equip communities with tools generally available to the government and the encroachers. 4.3 Engaging Institutions Cooperation between Donors, Government, NGOs and Community Organizations While it is extremely important to engage all players in the management of natural resources, indigenous communities must be accorded recognition as \u2018rights-holders\u2019 over indigenous territories. Wherever possible, when indigenous peoples\u2019 organisations have su\ufb03 cient organizational capacity to bring together various institutions, they should be encouraged to take the lead in such multi-sector cooperation.

Box 2: Community Protocol and the SBE 2000 In an e\ufb00 ort to \ufb01 nd ways to protect indigenous knowledge and access to biodiversity in the traditional lands of indigenous communities, a series of community workshops were organised by PACOS Trust, a community based NGO, between 1998 \u2013 2000, under the Sabah Anti-Biopiracy Programme. Th ese consultations resulted in the formulation of a Community Protocol. Th e Community Protocol is aimed at getting bio-prospectors, specimen collectors and researchers to respect communities\u2019 ways of life and indigenous knowledge. After getting wide feedback from communities, government departments and NGOs, the protocol was \ufb01 nalised and printed as a poster for wide dissemination. Regional workshops and training were also encouraged and organized by donors of the programme. Th en in 2000, as part of an e\ufb00 ort to advocate for a law and policy on biodiversity, the PACOS Trust, together with communities involved in drafting the protocol, called for a seminar with relevant NGOs and government departments, in particular the Sabah Museum and the Environmental Conservation Department. It was at this seminar that the draft Sabah Biodiversity Enactment (SBE) 2000 was revealed. Although communities were not given an opportunity to comment on the draft SBE, which was circulated for comments for only one month, PACOS Trust felt that their e\ufb00 ort to engage communities, NGOs and government has resulted in the inclusion of a number of good sections within the SBE 2000, adopted in November 2000. 207 Malaysia 4.3.1 NGOs Non-governmental organizations in Sabah have been key players in bridging the gaps in understanding of donors and the government, as well as providing indigenous communities information and knowledge regarding respect to indigenous peoples and natural resource management. In particular the PACOS Trust, a community based NGO, has not only helped enhance capacities of indigenous peoples in negotiation, it has also played a role in enhancing capacities of government departments. It is important to note that NGOs that wish to support indigenous peoples\u2019 struggle for the recognition of their rights have to be consistent \u2013 both in bridging the communication gap that often exists and also in building communities to e\ufb00 ectively and independently engage with government and companies in the long term. Box 3: Watershed Conservation \u2013 Training of Government Sta\ufb00 by PACOS Trust Between February 2002 and March 2004, PACOS Trust was commissioned by the Drainage and Irrigation Department (DID) of Sabah, with \ufb01 nancial support from both the Sabah Government and DANIDA, to train DID sta\ufb00 in community participation. Th e training was aimed at providing the necessary skills, knowledge and sensitivity to DID sta\ufb00 to ensure e\ufb00 ective participation of indigenous communities in its e\ufb00 ort to consult with them on the proposed Water Resources Master Plan. Such training was possible due to strong support from the Director of DID and the Chief Technical Advisor from DANIDA. Although the Master Plan 1994 and the Water Resources Enactment 1998 only provide limited protection for indigenous peoples, the fact that the DID is implementing the consultation clause in the Enactment has enabled indigenous communities to understand these provisions and express their concerns to the department. Th e DID recognized that without the assistance of PACOS Trust, which is experienced in establishing rapport and gaining the trust of communities, the consultation with a\ufb00 ected communities would not have been possible. 208 Bridging The Gap 4.3.2 Government Several government departments have implemented the existing provisions in various natural resource management laws and policies which respect indigenous peoples\u2019 customary practices. However, the government still tends to undermine indigenous peoples\u2019 customary rights and often views indigenous resource management system with disdain.

Box 4: Implementation of the Customary Tagal system Indigenous peoples in Sabah have practiced the Tagal system for generations to control over-harvesting of \ufb01 sh from rivers. It involves an agreement by the whole community on the conditions, areas, duration and \ufb01 nes with which the Tagal is to be enforced. Every member of the community is expected to monitor the implementation while the enforcement of punishment would usually be the responsibility of the village headman using the indigenous juridical system. A ceremony to mark the beginning and the end of the Tagal is a part of the whole system. Th e Fisheries Department had for years been trying to control over-\ufb01 shing in rivers in Sabah, with little success. Th e posting of signboards along riverbanks detailing department rules failed to deter o\ufb00 enders. A pilot initiative by the department using the Tagal system to control \ufb01 shing, and a subsequent study in Kampung Babagon in Penampang district in 2000, was observed to be successful. In 2002, having concluded that this indigenous resource management system is e\ufb00 ective in the conservation and protection of \ufb01 sh resources, the Department decided to incorporate the Tagal system into a new bill, which was subsequently adopted as the Sabah Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Enactment 2003. In its implementation of this Enactment, the Fisheries Department organized seminars and workshops and supervised the enforcement of the Tagal system. It also carried out research on freshwater \ufb01 sh, replenished \ufb01 sh stocks in rivers, and continued to assess the e\ufb00 ectiveness of the system. Currently, 212 areas involving 107 rivers in 11 districts in Sabah are revitalizing this traditional practice and are being coordinated and systematically managed. Awareness-raising e\ufb00 orts and cooperation between the villagers and the government are also ongoing. 209 Malaysia 4.3.3 Community Organisations Since the traditional institution in indigenous communities no longer exists, many village chiefs and elders have had to take on the role of ensuring the continued management of natural resources. Some communities have now established community or peoples\u2019 organizations to facilitate various tasks, including securing land rights where they been contravened or compromised. Indigenous communities consistently state that they are not anti-development, and community organizations have an important role in expressing a community\u2019s own aspirations with respect to the management and development of natural resource in its territories. Participation and the informed consent of communities are key to such e\ufb00 orts. Community organizations also have an important role to protect natural resources from being exploited. Box5: Community Organisation Reclaiming Traditional Lands Under section 28 of the Sabah Land Ordinance, 4,940 hectares of native customary rights (NCR) land were acquired by SAFODA in Kanibongan for the planting of Acacia Mangium in 1983. Th e Rungus indigenous communities were given oral assurances that the land would be returned to the people after the trees were harvested. However, the agreement was never ful\ufb01 lled and the people were told that the government would be developing the land further. Th e communities involved organized several actions to protest this through a network of 21 villages under the leadership of KK Muringkat, the village headman and chairperson of the network. Th eir strategies included lobbying political leaders and organizing community land rights workshops with PACOS to raise awareness and to get support from other communities in other districts. Becoming more courageous after meeting with other communities facing similar problems, the network met with lawyers, the Malaysian Human Rights Commission and the Sabah Chief Minister in 2003. Finally, their struggle for the restitution of their land paid o\ufb00 and the communities\u2019 traditional lands were de-gazetted from the land vested in SAFODA on 1st March 2005. 210 Bridging The Gap 4.3.4 Donors Prior to 1997, participation of NGOs and community organizations in project planning and implementation was rare in Sabah.

Box 6: DANCED and Capacity Building of the Sabah Wildlife Department to Ensure Participation of Indigenous Peoples With support from the Danish Government, through DANCED, a capacity building project was launched for the Sabah Wildlife Department (SWD), with the initiative to include a community component aimed at obtaining better understanding of various aspects of hunting and wildlife management by rural indigenous communities in Sabah. In the Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 there are two provisions that relate to the participation of local communities in sustainable wildlife management \u2013 the Animal Kampung (Village) Hunting License, AKHL (section 32) and the Honorary Wildlife Warden, HWW (section 7). Th ese two provisions involve developing an understanding of indigenous knowledge on wildlife management. In November 2001 the Sabah Wildlife Department Capacity Building Project and PACOS TRUST initiated the Pilot Project on AKHL and HWW. Two indigenous communities were selected as pilot areas, with the main objectives of the Pilot Project to develop a model for the issuing of AKHLs to local communities in Sabah, to develop appropriate wildlife management mechanisms, and to appoint a number of community Honorary Wildlife Wardens. 211 Malaysia In cooperation with the local communities, mechanisms for participation in, and administration of, hunting and wildlife management were developed, including the formation of a Community Wildlife Committee; the appointment of a number of HWWs to assist SWD in implementing the Wildlife Conservation Enactment; an agreement on a hunting quota stating the types and number of animals to be hunted; development of a Community Hunting Protocol; and the development of a Hunter Ledger to be \ufb01 lled out by the communities to manage and monitor hunting quotas. Th e experiences gained during the implementation of the Pilot Project show that local communities are willing to participate and compromise on natural resource management, even if it restricts their hunting activities, if it ensures recognition of their rights to manage their wildlife resources and assists them in developing appropriate wildlife management mechanisms. Th is potential role of donors in facilitating engagement between indigenous peoples and governments is very signi\ufb01 cant in Sabah. 4.4 Participation in Natural Resource Management As demonstrated, the Sabah Government has articulated the need for indigenous peoples\u2019 participation in natural resource management through a variety of laws. Indigenous peoples themselves have created and strengthened many opportunities for participation, particularly when capacities are enhanced and openness is expressed by the government. Workshops, seminars and conferences organized by government departments, academia and NGOs are important venues to articulate opinions (although these have sometime been criticized as inappropriate for indigenous peoples as English is often used and the venue chosen is often not conducive to discussion). Communities have also facilitated several dialogues but government representatives have not reciprocated by attending these meetings, thus denying themselves the opportunity to listen to and see the conditions to which indigenous peoples are subject. Another mechanism for participation is through the submission of written comments on natural resource management. Th is has not proven to be e\ufb00 ective for either the government or indigenous peoples \u2013 the government being poor in providing relevant information in an appropriate form, and communities being inarticulate and unable to process feedback in the short time-frame often required for these comments. Th e role of NGOs in facilitating this process and bridging the gap has, however, made this mechanism more e\ufb00 ective. 212 Bridging The Gap More recently, conditions attached by donors to development cooperation (see 4.3.4) have given rise to more direct participation of indigenous peoples in the implementation of pilot projects. However, the weakness of these pilot projects lies in the lack of commitment by both donors and the government departments involved to replicate the projects in areas outside of the pilot areas. Th e issue is not only about funding but about acceptance. It could be that these pilot projects present \u2018alien\u2019 solutions to natural resource management issues, which do not capture the minds and hearts of either the government departments or indigenous communities. Yet the pilot initiatives have lead to successes. An example of a successful initiative that received tremendous support is the implementation of the Tagal system (see 4.3.2), which has been accepted without further injection of funds. Participation would be ensured if decision-making with prior informed consent was recognized throughout the process. In many instances, the opportunities to express opinions \u2018granted\u2019 to indigenous peoples are mere lip service and often made to pacify communities. Sadly, input on natural resource management is often ignored.

Yet, development projects are often targeted at men and the recognition of women\u2019s knowledge by institutions still has a long way to go. Nevertheless, after years of struggle, some changes have been achieved. Female heads of households, including single mothers, are now recognized by law and there are now more opportunities in capacity-enhancement for women (for example in food processing and teacher training). However, projects and programmes are seldom designed to take into consideration active participation of women. For example, women are asked to cook during functions and women with children are not given necessary childcare support. If they do participate, they are not encouraged to speak and their ideas are not actively sought. 213 Malaysia Box 8: Development of Rules for the SBE 2000 As mentioned above, the Sabah Biodiversity Enactment was adopted in November 2000. However, it could not be implemented until the Rules to the Enactment were formulated and adopted. PACOS Trust thus undertook several consultations with communities and government to develop the Rules accompanying the Sabah Biodiversity Enactment 2000 in order to ful\ufb01 l the requirements of section 9(1)(j) which requires the creation of a \u2018system\u2019 that ensures indigenous peoples \u201cshall all times and in perpetuity, be the legitimate creators, users and custodians of traditional knowledge, and shall collectively bene\ufb01 t from the use of such knowledge\u201d. Th is system also draws upon the requirements of the various relevant international legal instruments, some of which have come into force subsequent to the passing of the Enactment. Th e result of an extensive consultation process with representatives from over 40 indigenous communities, the system provides a culturally appropriate means for the dissemination of information, the obtaining of consent on mutually agreed terms, in accordance with customary law and the equitable sharing of bene\ufb01 ts with indigenous communities. Practical bene\ufb01 ts include increased e\ufb03 ciency in collection e\ufb00 orts and e\ufb00 ective monitoring of illegal collection activities, poverty alleviation and the realization of human food security and health and cultural integrity within indigenous communities. 5. Challenges and Drawbacks Th is chapter focuses on the challenges and drawbacks in the implementation of laws and policies on natural resource management and the perceptions and responses of communities. A number of case studies are used to illustrate the challenges. 5.1 Implementation of Laws and Policies on Indigenous Resource Management System As seen in chapter 2, there are numerous laws and policies that accord certain recognition to indigenous peoples but this information has not been e\ufb00 ectively disseminated. As a result, many indigenous peoples have lost their land and resources, especially when 214 Bridging The Gap companies, government statutory bodies and outsiders have taken advantage of this lack of information. One important example is the requirement for making claims for native customary rights to indigenous lands. Here the Lands and Survey Department failed to provide information about a form (LSF 1898) that would make the process easy for indigenous peoples to secure their rights to their lands. Another challenge is actual contravention of the laws themselves (such as use of section 28 of the Land Ordinance 1930) or in the course of implementation (when the government failed to settle NCR claims prior to the gazetting of forest reserves). Th e implementation of policies and strategies by the government has also failed to take into consideration the rich knowledge and experiences of indigenous peoples in natural resource management that has been handed down over generations. It was only recently that remedial action was taken, with certain actors deciding to take a more serious look at these laws. However, the damage was done and the indigenous resource management system continued to erode as the alienation of land for resource exploitation occurred actively between the 1970s and 1980s. Today, 49 percent of Sabah\u2019s total land area of 74,000 sq km has been allocated as Forest Reserves, mainly for commercial logging, while 12 percent is for plantations. 5.2 Community Perceptions and Responses Contradictions between policies and implementation have served to confuse the people. One example is in Bundu in the Tambunan district where villagers were shocked to be told that the area which they had been protecting for generations and which had been gazetted as a watershed area was handed over to loggers by the government. Th e logging activities devastated the catchment area and silted the river which they relied on for irrigating their paddy \ufb01 elds.

Although traditional institutions have been replaced by a so-called Village Development and Security Committee that is supposed to be composed of more educated and informed representatives, this has worked against the community. Very little information is actually transmitted to the ordinary members of the community, especially those in the rural areas, and if there is, the information is often biased towards the government. As a result there is little re\ufb02 ection on the policies and laws and how they a\ufb00 ect indigenous rights. 215 Malaysia Many communities are convinced that the laws and policies do not function, and cannot guarantee their rights to manage natural resources. Petitions to relevant departments have been sent, and when these failed to get a response, some communities \ufb01 led police reports or press statements to draw attention to the disrespect of indigenous peoples\u2019 rights or exploitation of natural resources. Often the government response has been to reprimand communities, to voice its displeasure or threaten communities using laws that are unfair, resulting in further con\ufb02 ict. Some communities have thus resorted to bringing court cases against the encroaching company or the government. Th ree such cases, illustrated below, are Bundu in Tambunan, Tongod in the Kinabatangan district, and Desa Montoki in the Ranau district. 5.3 Cases illustrating Challenges and Drawbacks 5.3.1 Coordination between Government Departments Th e Sabah Wildlife Department Pilot Project mentioned earlier (see 4.3.4) highlighted some of the major constraints preventing local communities from exercising their rights to participate in natural resource management as stipulated in the various enactments and policies. In this case, the Forest Management Unit holder\u2014the Sabah Foundation\u2014which was granted a 100-year term to manage the area sustainably, is not willing to recognize the community hunting area, as the Sabah Foundation plans to open the area up for logging. Th ere is now an ongoing dialogue between the Sabah Wildlife Department, communities and relevant government agencies to make Forest Management Unit holders comply with their obligations under the Sustainable Forest Management System and for them to recognize the importance of involving local communities in natural resource management. 5.3.2 Non-recognition of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights to Land On 6 September 1999, the government issued and registered a Country Lease to a company for the cultivation of oil palm on NCR land belonging to the Dusun Minokok indigenous communities in Tongod in the Kinabatangan district, thus alienating their land from them. Th e communities had been residing as a native community in the Tongod Region for seven generations. Th ey inhabited the Tongod Region even before the formation of the Colonial Government of North Borneo, and have established villages in various localities along the tributaries of Tongod River. As natives of Sabah, and by virtue of their long and continuous occupation and use of the land upon which they have continuously cultivated 216 Bridging The Gap and resided, the community acquired NCR, native titles and usufructuary rights over the land. Th e communities\u2019 customary and proprietary rights were not extinguished by any enactment or law subsequently enacted. For years the government informed the community that it was undertaking a settlement scheme for their bene\ufb01 t, similar to the Tongod Regional Planning Study (TRPS), and that upon completion of the Study, the land occupied, used and enjoyed by the community would be allocated to them. Further, the government led or misled the community to believe that their land applications submitted and accepted since 1985 would be kept in abeyance, pending the \ufb01 nalization of the TPRS, and that until then there was no need to submit land applications. Th e community \ufb01 led a case against the company and the government, in which the court decided in favour of the community and ruled that the alienation through the issue of the Country Lease was unconstitutional, violating Article 161A(5) of the Federal Constitution with regard to the special positions of natives in the State of Sabah. It further decided that the government ought to have exercised their powers under Article 8(5) of the Federal Constitution and the Sabah Land Ordinance (Cap. 68) to protect the NCR land. Th e action of the government was thus discriminatory, unfair and unconstitutional, having violated Article 8 of the Federal Constitution which guarantees equality of all peoples before the law, and Article 13 of the Federal Constitution which guarantees that no person shall be deprived of their property without adequate compensation. 5.3.3 Implementing Resource Use Rights In 2004, Sabah Parks drew up a management plan for the Crocker Range Park (CRP).

After a series of consultations, two proposals were made on the settlement of claims by indigenous peoples. One is the establishment of \u2018Traditional Use Zones\u2019 for areas such as community hunting areas and watershed areas that will be jointly managed within the CRP. Another is the excision of land, particularly traditional agricultural areas. Communities will be accorded rights to the resources within the Traditional Use Zones. However, the Parks Enactment and the categorization of CRP as a strict protected area (IUCN category II), currently does not recognize the utilization of resources and the involvement of communities in management committees. Th e challenge lies in the amendment of the law to accommodate these needs amidst debate within various government departments 217 Malaysia that are not supportive of such moves within protected areas. A Collaborative Management Learning Network in Southeast Asia could help bridge the gap in terms of laws and policies for the recognition of resource use rights within protected areas. 5.3.4 Resettlement of Communities \u2013 GRID, Gana Although the Forest Enactment and forest policy allows indigenous communities to remain within forest reserves, the resettlement of communities does occur, as seen in the Gana Resettlement and Integrated Development (GRID) project implemented in Kampung Gana, Kota Marudu in 1997. Th e project cost RM 8,765,000 (USD 2.3m) and has brought about physical and socio-economic changes to the Dusun Sonsogon indigenous community. Th e expressed goal of the project is to ensure sustainable use of forest resources in the area, as well as in the Lingkabau Forest Reserve (LFR), while improving the standard of living of the local communities. Th e plan is for the local population to be the main players in the management of the area, and to directly bene\ufb01 t from the forest produce. Th e key issue is the management of natural resources to ensure that all forest resources within the commercial forest reserves are managed on a sustainable yield basis for economic, social and environmental purposes. To a\ufb00 ected indigenous communities, the GRID project means the resettlement of communities living inside the forest reserve. Th e people living in or near a forest reserve can be the greatest threat to its survival, but can also be its strongest supporters and enablers. A forest reserve is more likely to survive if it has the support of the local people and working with local people is the only way to achieve long term forest protection. Th e Sabah Forestry Department recognizes that this can only be accomplished with active cooperation and participation of the communities bordering forest reserves. 5.3.5 Information Dissemination Two initiatives by PACOS Trust in 2004\u2014a process to draft both the Rules that would accompany the Sabah Biodiversity Enactment 2000 and the Crocker Range Park Management Plan\u2014demonstrated commendable e\ufb00 orts in information dissemination, particularly to indigenous communities. In the past, various government o\ufb03 cials and politicians have repeatedly expressed the need to take the views of indigenous peoples seriously, but this was always seen as mere lip service. When the Crocker Range Management Plan was unveiled, only three months were set aside for comments. Sabah Parks was unable to provide o\ufb03 cial translation of the documents, 218 Bridging The Gap but were open and willing to \ufb01 nancially support translation of the document into Malay. PACOS Trust undertook this challenge to translate, disseminate and collect feedback from a\ufb00 ected communities within this stipulated timeframe. It is yet to be established whether the comments that were painstakingly collated by PACOS Trust and submitted to the Sabah Parks will be taken into consideration and incorporated into a revised management plan. Responding to concerns by some government departments and communities, PACOS also initiated the dissemination of the Biodiversity Enactment and drafted the Rules relating to the provisions on indigenous peoples\u2019 rights. It was heartening to observe the active participation of many government departments, research institutes and NGOs in the drafting of the Rules. 5.3.6 Provisions and Mechanism for Obtaining Consent Obtaining the consent of communities for the declaration or gazetting of protected areas such as watersheds, forest reserves, sanctuaries and parks has failed dismally in the past. In more recent Enactments, such as the Sabah Biodiversity Enactment 2000, stronger provisions for obtaining consent from communities serve as a test as to whether this will change. Internationally, the principle of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) is gaining acceptance, and mechanisms are being drawn up to ensure that genuine consent is obtained from indigenous communities. FPIC gives indigenous peoples the right to be consulted and provide", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c47ce32-59eb-413d-90cf-2fd503757bf2": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c47ce32-59eb-413d-90cf-2fd503757bf2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29c65bf1caa40bf822d24e24d1ae3ff3f215a0cb206fec09ee9a047d2bc950d6"}}, "hash": "29c65bf1caa40bf822d24e24d1ae3ff3f215a0cb206fec09ee9a047d2bc950d6", "text": "(or deny) their consent, to negotiate terms of agreement and to decline a project that is not bene\ufb01 cial. A big challenge remains in ensuring that existing laws and policies are amended to include FPIC provisions, and to include provisions for redress and restitution to those communities whose claims were not settled when their lands and resources were taken for protected areas. 5.3.7 Interpretation of the Laws Section 15 of the Sabah Land Ordinance 1930 was adopted from a standard law by the British colonial rulers and has not been changed much in subsequent years. Among the contentious elements in the de\ufb01 nition of Native Customary Rights (NCR) under section 15(b) is the number of fruit trees per acre of land to be found when ascertaining NCR. Even though indigenous communities and organizations have repeatedly asked the 219 Malaysia government to amend the section as it was not an appropriate indicator, these requests have fallen on deaf ears. A recent amendment instead increased the number of fruit trees from 15 to 50 per acre. Indigenous communities have also petitioned to repeal section 28 of the Sabah Land Ordinance and have sent memoranda to the national Human Rights Commission and the Sabah Chief Minister. However, due to the low capacity in negotiation skills and the lack of sustained e\ufb00 orts on the part of communities, this has not been successfully achieved to date. 5.3.8 Enhancing Capacity of Indigenous Communities Enhancing capacities among indigenous communities is also a big challenge because of the lack of resources and support for such e\ufb00 orts. Very few NGOs and support groups have the time or patience to do capacity enhancement in a manner that is sensitive to communities. Many young people who have had some formal education have either left or are seldom in the community. Others who received tertiary education often see the e\ufb00 orts of their elders and members of the community to assert their rights over natural resources as futile or backward. Even though there are now more opportunities to engage with the authorities, many are unable to do so because these engagements are mainly based on conditions established by the government. Often meetings are held in 5-star hotels, conducted in English and further constrained by a limited number of invitations given at short notice. As such, these meetings do not build indigenous peoples\u2019 capacities but instead can be disempowering. Capacity enhancement through building of community organizations also takes much e\ufb00 ort, resources and long-term partnerships. 5.3.9 Erosion of Indigenous Resource Management System Natural resources are now viewed as individual property rather than being collectively owned by the community. Th is has created competition in some communities leading to unsustainable resource utilization. An example is the extraction of timber in a community forest by individuals for self-gain. Th e challenge is re-establishing communal responsibility and revitalizing the indigenous resource management system so that resources can be utilised in a sustainable manner for the wellbeing of the community. 220 Bridging The Gap Another drawback is non-genuine project development by some communities. In some instances, indigenous landowners have applied for various projects stated as forest management when the real intention is the extraction of timber. An example is the application for logging rights in a water catchment system for a gravity-fed water management project that results in the destruction of the area. Another example is the application for the establishment of less suitable grazing reserves in steeply forested areas instead of low-lying hilly grassland areas. Th ese areas are abandoned after commercial logs have been extracted. Th e challenge is both in e\ufb00 ective enforcement and in building understanding to overcome the desire for short-term monetary gains. Th ere are also many instances where communities facilitate illegal logging in their native reserves in return for various favours from the logging company, such as the repair of the drainage and irrigation for their rice \ufb01 elds or the repair of football \ufb01 elds. Such an idea stemmed for example in the early 1990s in Sabah, when the Forest Department sanctioned logging in return for building wooden houses to replace traditional houses. Th e challenges involve good dialogue with the community to ascertain their needs and for the government to respond appropriately to these needs in a timely manner. 5.3.10 Use of Police in Land Con\ufb02 icts Th e involvement of the police in resource con\ufb02 icts is a serious and on-going issue in Sabah, and is in direct contravention of national and state law.

On 26 July 2005, two police o\ufb03 cers came to the house of Mr Kopit Tayu, an indigenous person from the Dusun indigenous group, to arrest him. He was not told the reason for his arrest. It was only upon reaching the Penampang Police Station that he was informed of the accusation against him of stealing the belongings of Mr Ooi Say Tuan. Mr Kopit was held for 7 days. Th en on 25 August 2005, a plainclothes police o\ufb03 cer and Mr Ooi came to the house of Mr Martin Galagub at 7.30 pm, asking him to go to the police station to discuss the land on which he had built his house. Martin was threatened that his non-compliance would result in actions against him. At the police station, Martin and the village headmen, Mr Gamato Galagub, were forced by Mr Ooi to consent to compensation of RM 7,800 (USD 2,053) and to sign a letter of agreement between Martin and Ooi, a letter written by Sergeant Hassan Sani. 221 Malaysia On 26 September 2005, Mr Soikun Sumporo received a call from a police o\ufb03 cer from the Penampang Police Station ordering him to come to the station without giving any reasons. At the station, Sergeant David Jamilong informed him that he and his family were ordered to leave their present house within 7 days as the land was owned by Mr Ooi. Th e next day Mr Ooi and 7 others arrived at Soikun\u2019s house to forcibly evict him. 5.3.11 National Implementation of International Instruments Current issues on natural resource management are being actively debated at the international level, particularly the processes related to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). In line with usual international compartmentalization of issues, indigenous issues are being discussed separately at the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (PFII), leading to inconsistency in debates and agreements across the two fora. Malaysia rati\ufb01 ed the CBD and is also often represented at the PFII. However, the representations at these fora do not re\ufb02 ect the decentralized manner in which the states operate. As such, government delegates from Sabah and Sarawak, where the majority of indigenous peoples reside and where laws and policies on natural resource management are enacted separately, are not included in the o\ufb03 cial national delegation. For example, none of the government departments from Sabah were o\ufb03 cially invited to the 7th Conference of Parties hosted by Malaysia in 2004. Th e opportunity accorded in terms of understanding international debate on indigenous peoples and natural resource management are not maximized, making it an even bigger challenge to implement the international instruments. 5.3.12 Impact of Natural Resources Development on Women In a study conducted by PACOS in the Bundu village in Sabah in 2001, women said that the depletion of natural resources has made it more di\ufb03 cult for them to go about their traditional activities, such as the preparation of food and making of handicrafts. Women also feel more burdened with the responsibility of looking for increasingly scarce income- generating alternatives, especially if they are denied access to natural resources for food, water and fuel (\ufb01 rewood). Also, since the health of the family is often the responsibility of women, the burden is placed on them to keep families healthy in the face of a deteriorating environment. Once the forest resources are too far away or too dangerous for them to get, some of the traditional 222 Bridging The Gap social reproductive roles of women are taken over by men. Th us the independence of women erodes as they increasingly depend on men to accompany or assist them in getting the scarce resources for the daily needs of the family or for handicrafts. 6. Laws on Natural Resource Management a\ufb00 ecting the Orang Asli Th is chapter focuses on the Orang Asli, the indigenous peoples of Peninsular Malaysia. It attempts to demonstrate that while the various laws a\ufb00 ecting Orang Asli rights to their traditional lands and resources may not be explicit in protecting these rights, there is actually enough in local laws to support recognition of this inalienable right \u2013 if we only want to do so.

Chewong returning from their farm with bananas for sale, Teris River, Pahang Photo: Colin Nicholas 223 Malaysia 6.1 State Laws and Regulations Several laws and regulations a\ufb00 ect the status of the Orang Asli even though they may not directly concern them or mention them speci\ufb01 cally. Some examples are the Town and Country Planning Act 1976 (Act No. 172) and the Local Government Act 1976 (Act No. 171). Both e\ufb00 ectively remove any semblance of autonomy that the Orang Asli may have had over their traditional lands. Th e following laws, however, have a greater bearing on the Orang Asli insofar as the management and control of their territories and the resources found therein are concerned: \u2022 National Land Code 1965 (Act No. 56) \u2022 Land Conservation Act 1960 (Act No. 385), revised 1989 \u2022 Land (Group Settlement Areas) Act 1960 (Act No. 530), revised 1994 \u2022 Protection of Wildlife Act 1972 (Act No. 76), revised 1976, 1991 \u2022 National Parks Act 1980 (Act No. 226) \u2022 Aboriginal Peoples Act 1954 (Act No. 134), revised 1974 Th e National Land Code established a uniform system of tenure under which title to an interest in land depends on registration. Th is act applies only to the Peninsula and deals with matters of tenure, title, and land transfer. Under the Act, authority over all land, mineral, and rock material is given to the respective states. Th e Land Conservation Act 1960 consolidates the law relating to the conservation of hill lands and the protection of soil from erosion and the inroad of silt. Section 5 provides that no person shall plant any hill land with short term crops (i.e. crops that normally complete their life cycle within two years after planting) without an annual permit from the Collector of Land Revenue. Section 6 goes on to prohibit the clearing of hill land. Th ese provisions are detrimental to Orang Asli communities who live in forest and forest fringe areas and who still depend on the traditional swiddens for their subsistence. Th e Land (Group Settlement Areas) Act 1960 enables land agencies such as the Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA), the Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA) and other agencies such as the Pahang Tenggara Development Authority (DARA) to take over state land and to develop it for the purpose of land settlement, which culminates in the issue of titles to the settlers. Frequently Orang Asli traditional areas have been converted to such land schemes, with them neither enjoying the fruits of the programme nor being entitled to obtain the titles. 224 Bridging The Gap A law that expressly mentions the Orang Asli (or \u2018aboriginal community\u2019) is the Protection of Wildlife Act 1972 (Act 76). Wildlife Reserves and Sanctuaries may be declared by the state under this legislation. In such areas, an Orang Asli may shoot, kill or take certain wildlife for the purpose of providing food for himself or his family. Another law that is applicable to the Orang Asli is the National Forestry Act 1984, which provides for the administration, management and conservation of forests and forestry development in the states. It also provides that forest produce is the property of the state and that harvesting requires a license. Basically, it treats the Orang Asli harvesters of such forest produce (e.g. rattan and petai) as labourers of the traders who hold the necessary licences (or \u2018bund\u2019 as they are called in Perak) from the Forest Department. Th e National Parks Act (Act 226) 1980 is an act to provide for the establishment and control of National Parks and for matters connected therewith. While usufructuary rights of the Orang Asli may not be curtailed in such parks, their right to own and control their traditional territories certainly comes under serious jeopardy. Th e Aboriginal Peoples Act (1954, revised 1974) is the only law that speci\ufb01 cally relates to the Orang Asli. While the Act provides for the establishment of Orang Asli Areas and Orang Asli Reserves, it also grants the state the right to order any Orang Asli community to leave \u2013 and stay out of \u2013 an area.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68cceb96-5901-43be-8546-516f916636e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "68cceb96-5901-43be-8546-516f916636e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba15b7e5e800cc23219f326663f4ed46bccd0f6443c98ec77afcce2803fd581d"}, "2": {"node_id": "23fa268b-00fe-463d-8ad3-88431c669047", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d4fa2a2dc7a0acfe46a189fd0e131e07c8866346ac02ec7ca3152630de7b2d4"}}, "hash": "e092fe11720436f1a9f1db0df93a4e524737e9c0bd5fa9a551599e3f1231d9cf", "text": "In e\ufb00 ect, the best security that an Orang Asli can get is one of \u2018tenant-at-will\u2019.

If at such time the state wishes to re-acquire the land, it can revoke its status and the Orang Asli are left with no other legal recourse but to move elsewhere. Furthermore, in the event of such displacement, the state is not obliged to pay any compensation or allocate an alternative site, and may only do so at its discretion. Th us, the Aboriginal Peoples Act laid down certain ground rules for the treatment of Orang Asli and their lands. E\ufb00 ectively, it accorded the Minister concerned \u2013 or his representative, the Director-General of the Department of Orang Asli A\ufb00 airs (JHEOA) \u2013 the \ufb01 nal say in all matters concerning the administration of the Orang Asli. In matters concerning land, the state has \ufb01 nal say. All these laws give the federal and state governments a tremendous amount of leverage against the Orang Asli. (Th is, at least, is how the above laws, and especially the Aboriginal Peoples Act were interpreted \u2013 until, that is, the October 2005 decision of the Court of Appeal in the Sagong Tasi case, as discussed below.) Even supposedly sustainable and rights-respecting initiatives such as the Malaysian Timber Certi\ufb01 cation Council (MTCC) prefer to hide behind the catch-all clause \u2018subject to national laws\u2019, knowing full well that such national laws generally favour the interests and greed of the well-placed and well-heeled rather than the Orang Asli inhabitants of the areas they now seek to exploit or appropriate. 6.2 Th e Federal Constitution, Land, Natural Resources and the Orang Asli Th e welfare of the Orang Asli comes under the Federal List in the Federal Constitution, while land and forest matters come under the State List. Also, as every state is independent under the Constitution, federal legislation in most cases is not binding on the states. On the contrary, the Federal Constitution accords substantial powers over land use and natural resource management to the respective states. Although under the Constitution the Federal Government is empowered to make laws it deems necessary to ensure continuity throughout the country, the Federal Government often serves merely as a coordinating entity. As such, federal agencies like the Department of Orang Asli A\ufb00 airs (JHEOA) would consequently assume only a liaison and cooperative role with respect to the state authorities. In fact, the rationalization that, while the Orang Asli are a federal concern, all matters pertaining to land reside in the state, and the federal government has no say or in\ufb02 uence, is an oft-heard explanation whenever those responsible for gazetting or reserving lands for 226 Bridging The Gap the Orang Asli are asked why such dismal progress has been made. Th at there is a glaring precedent in the case of FELDA\u2014which e\ufb00 ectively uses the Land (Group Settlement Areas) Act of 1960 to direct states to give up some of their land for landless settlers in their development schemes\u2014is lost on these administrators and decision-makers. Th e crux of the problem lies in the fact that with forests being such a valuable productive resource in the country, it is in the interest of the states to maintain control over their forest lands. Creating Orang Asli reserves in their now-valuable land banks would e\ufb00 ectively deny the state a revenue-generating facility, as such reserves would come under the purview of the Federal Government. Th us, it does not make economic sense for the states to gazette lands for the Orang Asli. Th is is, of course, based on the presumption that states enjoy the legal right to those lands that are contested by the Orang Asli as their own. But as we shall see below, this perception is steadily giving way to an interpretation of natural resource law that is bound to bring changes to the way traditional territories are controlled and managed. 6.3 Th e Changing Status of the Orang Asli in Natural Resource Law 6.3.1 Only Orang Asli have rights to forest produce in Orang Asli areas Koperasi Kijang Mas v Kerajaan Negeri Perak In 1992, the Ipoh High Court, in deciding the case of Koperasi Kijang Mas v Kerajaan Negeri Perak, held that the State Government of Perak had breached the Aboriginal Peoples Act 1954 (revised 1974) when it accepted Syarikat Samudera Budi Sdn.

An important point canvassed by the State Government was that the lands, although approved as Aboriginal Reserves, had not been gazetted. Justice Malek, in a strong opinion, held that gazetting was not a mandatory requirement for the recognition of reserves and the relevant laws therein. Th e approval of the State Government for the lands to be aboriginal reserves had, without the necessity of gazetting, created the reserves, and thereafter only Orang Asli have exclusive rights to the forest products in the reserves. 227 Malaysia Th is decision has important implications for Orang Asli land rights as o\ufb03 cial sources indicate that some 29,144.18 hectares of aboriginal lands in 2002 were approved, but are yet to be gazetted. In respect to these lands, Orang Asli therefore have some measure of statutory protection from encroachment and displacement by many other interests. 6.3.2 Orang Asli have proprietary interest on the land Adong bin Kuwau v. State of Johor In 1997, the Johor High Court awarded compensation to 52 Jakuns for the loss of 53,273 acres of ancestral lands. Th e State Government had taken the forested land and leased it to the Public Utilities Board of Singapore, who subsequently constructed a dam to supply water to both Johor and Singapore. Justice Mokhtar concluded that the Jakuns had proprietary rights over their lands, but no alienable interest in the land itself. Th at is to say, while the Jakuns may not hold title to their traditional lands, they nevertheless have the right to use it for their subsistence and other needs. In this instance, the court ruled that while certain lands are reserved for aboriginal peoples, they also have recognized rights to hunt and gather over additional lands \u2013 the \u201cright to continue to live on their lands, as their forefathers had lived\u201d.

Th e authorities maintained that the Orang Asli were mere tenants on state land and as such were not entitled to compensation under the Land Acquisition Act 1960. With the help of a pro bono team of lawyers from the Bar Council, the Temuans took their case to the courts. Th ey asserted that they are the owners of the land by custom, the holders of native title to the land and the holders of usufructuary rights (i.e. right to use and derive pro\ufb01 t) to the land. Th ey also maintained that that their customary and propriety rights over the land which they and their forefathers have occupied and cultivated for a long time were not extinguished by any law. In April 2002, Justice Mohd ruled that the Temuans did have native title under common law over their lands. As such, compensation was to be paid to them in accordance with the Land Acquisition Act 1960. Th e four defendants\u2014the Selangor State government, United Engineers Malaysia (UEM), Malaysian Highway Authority (LLM), and the Federal Government\u2014appealed. In October 2005, Court of Appeal Judge Gopal Sri Ram, sitting with two others, unanimously threw out the appeal and held that the High Court was not misdirected when it decided, based on a large quantity of evidence and fact that was not challenged, to rule that the Temuans did indeed have propriety rights over their customary lands. As such, these lands should be treated as titled lands and therefore subject to compensation under the Land Acquisition Act.

Unfortunately, this was a right that had to be challenged in court and not one that was conceded with magnanimity as be\ufb01 tting a position that is just and equitable. Earlier we noted that in Malaysia\u2019s legal hierarchy, state laws and regulations appear to be given greater weight and authority than the Federal Constitution. Th at this is so was clearly elaborated by Justice Gopal in his judgement of October 2005. His 59-page judgment in the Court of Appeal is more than just an a\ufb03 rmation of the rights of the Orang Asli to their traditional lands. It was a condemnation of the way the Orang Asli have been treated by the authorities and a wake-up call to the government to ful\ufb01 l its \ufb01 duciary responsibility towards the community. In his words, \u201cHere you have a case where the very authority \u2013 the State \u2013 that is enjoined by the law to protect the aborigines, turned upon them and permitted them to be treated in a most shoddy, cruel and oppressive manner\u201d. 6.4 Failure in Fiduciary Duty Acknowledging that the purpose of the Aboriginal Peoples Act 1954 is to \u201cprotect and uplift the First Peoples of this country\u201d, Judge Gopal asserted that \u201cit was therefore fundamentally a human rights statute, acquiring a quasi-constitutional status giving it pre-eminence over ordinary legislation. It must therefore receive a broad and liberal interpretation.\u201d Th is was in keeping with the early debates and discussions as recorded in the Federal Legislative Assembly hansards, newspapers of the day and archival records, which clearly show that Orang Asli lands were to be recognized. For example, as noted in the judgment, when the Orang Asli representative, Tok Pangku Pandak Hamid, asked the Minister of Education if the government had any plans to ensure that the hereditary lands of the Aborigines are reserved for their use, Enche Mohd Khir Johari replied: \u201cSteps are now being taken to create these reserves and there are also in existence others which were gazetted prior to the introduction of the Ordinance\u2026. At the moment there are in existence in the Federation, 58 Gazetted Aborigine Reserves covering in all approximately 30 square miles, and including some 5,200 aborigines. An additional 120 areas are currently under consideration, with a view to gazetting as Reserves. Th ey cover about 389 sq miles and include approximately 21,000 aborigines.\u201d 230 Bridging The Gap Alas, as the court was later to \ufb01 nd out, none of these good intentions were realized. In the case of Bukit Tampoi, the Temuans faced both under-gazettement as well as non- gazettement of their lands. Th us, as a result of the state and federal governments\u2019 neglect in both under-gazetting and not gazetting areas which they knew were inhabited by the Temuans, the latter\u2019s rights in the land were placed in serious jeopardy. For the state and federal governments now to say that no compensation is payable to the Temuans because the disputed lands were not gazetted, is to add insult to injury \u2013 injury caused by their own neglect and failure. Th is prompted Judge Gopal to comment that, \u201cI am yet to see a clearer case of a party taking advantage of its own wrong\u201d. 6.5 Making the Aboriginal Peoples Act compliant with the Federal Constitution Th e practice to date has been to use the 1954 Act as the legal basis for compensating the Orang Asli only for their crops and dwellings whenever their lands are taken. Th e 1954 Act has also been used to argue that the Orang Asli do not hold proprietary interests in their land, and that the state governments exercise wide powers as to the disposal and compensation of these lands. Th e Orang Asli as such are only tenants-at-will, living on state land at the state\u2019s largesse. Citing a number of legal precedents and justi\ufb01 cation, Judge Gopal reversed this interpretation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f6cd5bd-b4f5-4aed-928d-b027648a42cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f6cd5bd-b4f5-4aed-928d-b027648a42cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e18ecbbeff479a7321d917c5743496fcd4ecdbff04b09128426c9355693faaf"}, "2": {"node_id": "af5279ee-30c6-45ed-b266-151e3c036997", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe0e20acf04a7f2bf8cc37fc9ef7dc74db595225d20b86747728590d4fcd4149"}}, "hash": "a20f2f2dd3e0adbcbec6dd184b3713b6344056335715a53807d939a47a5d4dc9", "text": "In light of the obvious con\ufb02 ict between the 1954 Act and the Federal Constitution, wherein Article 13(2) states, \u201cNo law shall provide for compulsory Temuan man at his swidden on the forest edge, Kelau, Pahang Photo: Colin Nicholas 231 Malaysia acquisition or use of property without adequate compensation\u201d, he ruled that relevant portions of the 1954 Act had to be brought into conformity with the Constitution.

Conclusion and Recommendations For the Orang Asli, the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the case of Sagong Tasi v Kerajaan Negeri Selangor is without doubt a landmark decision in many respects. It shows that there are enough laws to protect the rights of the indigenous peoples to their traditional lands and resources if the government has the will to do so. Indigenous peoples are increasingly pressured to \ufb01 le cases in the court and this is proving expensive \u2013 not just for indigenous communities but also for the government. For the government, losing a case can be a cause for embarrassment and bad publicity that can be avoided by being pro-active and reviewing policies and laws that deny indigenous peoples their rights to resources. Various recommendations have already been made in the di\ufb00 erent chapters. However, indigenous peoples and governments, meeting at a local consultation to validate the preliminary report of this research, have unanimously agreed on the following: Th e formation of an Inter-Ministerial Committee, or a body that has su\ufb03 cient authority at the state and national level to review the various policies and laws on natural resource management and indigenous peoples, with a view to streamlining such laws and policies to protect indigenous rights. Th e Committee is also expected to identify sections that should be amended and the obstacles to the implementation of such laws and policies. References 1. Anaya, James & Robert A.

O\ufb03 cial recognition as \u2018mountain peoples\u2019 has been granted to only 10 ethnic groups; the Karen, Hmong, Lahu, Iu Mien (Yao), Lisu, Akha, Lua (Lawa), H\u2019tin (Kachin), Khamu, and Mlabri, despite there being many more.3 Th ey are o\ufb03 cially designated by the Th ai government as \u2018Chao Khao\u2019 which is colloquially translated as \u2018hill tribes\u2019 or \u2018people of the mountains\u20194. In addition to these highland peoples, the \u2018Chao Th ale\u2019 or the \u2018sea gypsies/people of the sea\u2019 are also widely recognized as Th ailand\u2019s indigenous peoples, although the government does not use this term.5 Some of them, like the Lawa, H\u2019tin, Mlabri and most probably the Karen, have been living in areas now part of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "350d1146-c998-4036-9665-ef06349eebd8": {"__data__": {"id_": "350d1146-c998-4036-9665-ef06349eebd8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57dd784a7bf01b1a869e8387061185a8f2a82686e57d54d052e697634418344e"}, "3": {"node_id": "8ff6469a-f8bf-4b10-825b-2159fe7e8e2e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "17a935328cf0682e0363130a0eb4cc7bcebb07947a338aa8caa2ae919463c84a"}}, "hash": "61fc93fbc2c6397976401fe21d209a95aa382f9fcc8da7028a9b83b0bc5b984c", "text": "the Th ai nation state before the Th ai speaking ethnic groups immigrated at the beginning of the second millennium.

Th ey have their own cultures, languages, customs, modes of dressing and belief systems which are distinct from the majority Th ai lowland settlers, and which are distinct from each other.8 Th ey have systems of natural resource management that are centered on traditional knowledge which they have developed, tested and passed down from generation to generation for hundred of years.9 Th ere are many customs and mores to govern the practices of natural resource management within these communities, some of which will be looked at in detail in this study. Often these governing rules are, however, not known and comprehended by the authorities and the public.10 Th e hill tribes are not recognized as distinct in terms of their indigeneity.11 In a 1992 submission to the UN Commission on Human Rights the Th ai government stated, \u201cone of the great sources of pride of the Th ai people is their rich and diverse ethnic and cultural heritage. Th e hill-tribes of Th ailand and their distinct lifestyles are part of this colourful heritage. Th ese tribes are among the many ethnic groups that constitute Th ai society. Th ey are not considered to be minorities or indigenous peoples but as Th ais who are able to enjoy fundamental rights and are protected by the laws of the Kingdom as any other Th ai citizen.\u201d12 In reality the policies of the Th ai government toward hill peoples have resulted in discrimination and exclusion.13 Some anthropologists have di\ufb00 erentiated these groups according to the altitudes at which they traditionally form their communities. Th e Karen, Lawa, H\u2019tin and Khamu thus identi\ufb01 ed as living in altitudes between 400 \u2013 1000m above sea level and the Hmong, Iu Mien, Lahu, Lisu and Akha in the higher reaches above 1000m.14 Altitude of settlement is also directly linked to the dominant agricultural systems used in these communities. Groups living at the lower altitudes traditionally plant rice in sedentary forms of rotational swidden systems, sometimes in combination with paddy \ufb01 elds, while those living at higher altitudes practiced swidden cultivation with long cultivation and long fallow periods. However these bases of di\ufb00 erentiation are becoming outdated. Due to state intervention and international development in\ufb02 uences, agricultural practices and settlement practices have changed radically; and settlement patterns of these groups have undergone many changes. Th ose \u201ctraditionally\u201d found in higher uplands can be now found in lower uplands and valleys, and there is a far greater diversity of agricultural systems practiced. 241 Thailand 1.2 \u2018Chao Khao\u2019 or \u2018Hill Tribes\u2019 Th e term \u201chill tribes\u201d is used as a generic, semi-o\ufb03 cial term for the various non-Th ai groups living in the uplands of northern and western Th ailand, dating from the late 1950s. Riener Buergin identi\ufb01 es the polarities implicit in the use of the term \u2018chao khao\u2019, or more historically, \u2018chao pha\u2019 or people of the forests.

Frequently, the pole of \u201ccivility\u201d was identi\ufb01 ed with dominant ethnic Th ai groups, while the \u201cforest/wilderness\u201d pole was related to marginal ethnic minority groups at the edge of the Th ai polity.15 During the 19th century, these \u201cforest peoples\u201d played an important role in the economy of Th ailand by facilitating access to forest products aimed primarily at local Asian markets.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ff6469a-f8bf-4b10-825b-2159fe7e8e2e": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ff6469a-f8bf-4b10-825b-2159fe7e8e2e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57dd784a7bf01b1a869e8387061185a8f2a82686e57d54d052e697634418344e"}, "2": {"node_id": "350d1146-c998-4036-9665-ef06349eebd8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "61fc93fbc2c6397976401fe21d209a95aa382f9fcc8da7028a9b83b0bc5b984c"}}, "hash": "17a935328cf0682e0363130a0eb4cc7bcebb07947a338aa8caa2ae919463c84a", "text": "However, with the growth of large-scale trade with European markets where Th ais supplied goods such as rice and teak, the economic importance of these peoples decreased.

Important factors within these developments were the e\ufb00 orts to eradicate the opium trade and to control the communist insurgency. Opium was an important source of income for the state during the 19th century and the \ufb01 rst part of 20th century, and highland peoples were the source of the primary resin, traded for lowland goods such as oil and salt. However with the illegalization of opium by most western countries, Th ailand was pressured to prohibit cultivation of opium. Although previously part of an opium trade integrally dependent on the Th ai middle men, soon opium growing groups such as the hill dwelling indigenous peoples came to be seen as a \u2018problem needing to be solved\u2019. Around the same time, problems with communist insurgents having their centers in remote hill areas started. As a result, the state became more and more interested in exerting stronger state control over the upland regions of the north and west of the country.18 Part of the response to this new perceived need for control, the Central Hill Tribe Committee (CHTC) of Th ailand was established in 1959 and a national policy towards 242 Bridging The Gap the \u201chill tribes\u201d was formulated for the \ufb01 rst time. Th e objectives of the policy were to protect \u2018national security\u2019, re\ufb02 ecting fears that communist in\ufb02 uences may spread among the ethnic groups of the uplands, control and substitution of opium cultivation, and the abolition of shifting cultivation, which in the international development community had been perceived as destructive, a threat to forest resources, and a hindrance to development.19 A policy towards the \u2018chao khao\u2019 framed in such terms of threat and control could only have one outcome, and soon the term was identi\ufb01 ed with a negative stereotype of forest destroying, opium cultivating, dangerous foreign troublemakers. Originally this image was mainly derived from the Hmong20 as their swidden cultivation systems frequently included opium cultivation, and some communities were involved in the communist insurgencies of the 1960s. However the stereotype soon spread from reference speci\ufb01 cally to the Hmong to all the di\ufb00 erent groups categorized as \u201chill tribes\u201d.\u201d21 Th e creation of this category of people had major political connotations. Th eir traditional lands and resources were territorially included within the Th ai nation state but were culturally excluded as what some scholars have called \u201cothers within\u201d.22 One of the most prominent manifestations of this stereotype of \u201cothers\u201d is the denial of citizenship to a large number of indigenous peoples in Th ailand. A further manifestation has been the continued focus in government policy making on \u2018solving the problem of the hill tribes\u2019 Public perception of marginalized hill tribe communities was strongly in\ufb02 uenced by all these prevalent o\ufb03 cial stereotypes which in turn reinforced o\ufb03 cial policies against the hill tribes. Since then, these negative stereotypes of hill peoples have remained widespread, and indeed have been revived and exploited in the debate around the drafting of the community forest bill and during the con\ufb02 icts over water and forest resources in the 1990s. Not only are the hill tribes seen as peoples who have, due to their place of residence and their way of life, excluded themselves from the Th ai nation, they are seen as threatening the welfare of the country by destroying its forests, producing narcotics and harboring foreign in\ufb02 uences.23 Because of these negative stereotypes, a number of indigenous activists in Th ailand do not like the term \u2018chao khao\u2019 and its literal translation of \u2018hill tribes\u2019 and a range of terms such as chao thai phu khao \u2018Th ai mountain peoples\u2019 and chon pao puen muang \u2018indigenous tribes\u2019 have been used.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "afae8377-f4fc-446a-9493-e6a147b1a816": {"__data__": {"id_": "afae8377-f4fc-446a-9493-e6a147b1a816", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92a473d18cb4b036d81e85ca21d1f2dcc5a75ced311f8a6ec66d0cb139017d56"}, "2": {"node_id": "7c35cc92-43d9-4524-8255-dacf5f901e01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0267bbba2dfcb7f7440270ac34f48cf194a88dbc7b9a2f156df776632dd9d9ef"}}, "hash": "92349c52cd41709af4b0b49a62722b86fde6deac2176acd1050ddcaea8c48329", "text": "For political correctness, the term \u2018hill peoples\u2019 has been introduced as the dominant English term.24 1.3 A Brief Historical Look at Approaches toward Indigenous Peoples of Th ailand Much of the available literature on the history of Th ai government policies a\ufb00 ecting indigenous hill peoples report the 50s as the period when \u201cproblems\u201d regarding indigenous hill people were \ufb01 rst identi\ufb01 ed.

For instance early forestry laws were enacted before the 1950s which a\ufb00 ected them as they mostly resided in forest areas. However, the earliest policy a\ufb00 ecting hill tribes was the \ufb01 rst Nationality Act of 1913, which granted Th ai citizenship based on bloodline (Th ai father) and territorial basis (born in Th ailand), thus replacing previous customary laws. Th e \ufb01 rst national census in 1956 failed to include hill tribes and thereby excluded them from Th ai nationality, an exclusion that was only partially addressed in 1965 and created legal divisions very early on.26 Clearly the early neglect of the Th ai state in its relationship with highland communities was to have long-term impacts. Changes to this attitude of separation and neglect came most clearly with the establishment of the Central Hill Tribe Committee (CHTC), and the subsequent creation of the Hill Tribe Welfare Division within the Ministry of Interior. As a \ufb01 rst step toward attaining the objectives of national security, control of opium cultivation and abolition of shifting cultivation, resettlement programmes were implemented in 1960-61 to concentrate the hill tribes in a few, easily accessible places. As Prof. Kesmanee notes, \u201cAt that time, the Department of Public Welfare had already established self-help settlements for the lowland Th ai therefore it was felt that such settlements could also be set up for the Karen man in rice swidden Photo: Chris Erni 244 Bridging The Gap hill tribes. Th e settlements were established in four areas: Tak, Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai and Phetchabun provinces.\u201d27 However several obstacles and di\ufb03 culties, including strong disinclination by highland communities to being resettled, and to staying in the assigned (ecologically weak) resettlement sites and the resettlement project was shelved shortly after. Th is was followed by the commissioning of a study in 1961-62, supported by the UN Narcotic Drugs Division, on the various indigenous groups in the uplands. Th is study led to the establishment in 1963 of mobile units called Hill Tribe Development and Welfare Centers to look after the hill tribe groups, as well as the setting up of the Tribal Research Centre in Chiang Mai University in 1964.28 Because of the link drawn between hill tribes, opium cultivation and communist insurgency already mentioned, hill tribe policies, from the middle of the 1960s to the middle of the 1970s, were directed by such \u2018national security\u2019 concerns, and in the \u2018battle zones\u2019 the military became responsible for hill tribe communities.29 Indeed, the attempt of the Th ai government to eliminate opium cultivation by outlawing it in 1959 became the key factor that triggered (and misdirected) highland development policies.30 Th e First National Economic and Social Development Plan (NESDP) of Th ailand was drawn up for implementation in 1961-66. Th is plan included a section which aimed at preventing forest and watershed destruction; ending opium cultivation; bringing socioeconomic development to hill tribes; and instilling a feeling of loyalty to Th ailand among the hill tribes. Besides building schools in some areas where hill tribes resided, the implementation of some minor development projects and the establishment of the Tribal Research Center, the plan was not implemented comprehensively.31 Th e policy toward the hill tribes was reformulated in 1968, to aim at concentrating scattered settlements, resettlement to the lowlands, and assimilation into Th ai society to secure loyalty toward the state.32 For the most part, until the 1980s, no major changes in government policies toward the hill tribes took place.33 Laws that a\ufb00 ect indigenous peoples and their natural resource management are discussed in the Chapter III. 1.4 Citizenship Currently there remain signi\ufb01 cant numbers of indigenous peoples in Th ailand who have not received formal legal status, whether citizenship or other legal status providing the right to residence in the country.34 Individuals without citizenship or other formal legal status 245 Thailand face numerous obstacles in everyday life; they are not able to formally access government services in health, education, exercise their political rights and enjoy basic rights such as the right to unrestricted travel.

Consequently, obtaining Th ai citizenship and the rights inherent within has become a key priority for indigenous peoples in Th ailand. Th e \ufb01 rst population census was conducted in 1956 in accordance with the National Household Registration Act. Indigenous peoples were largely excluded due to the lack of access to their villages, lack of o\ufb03 cers and ingrained o\ufb03 cial prejudice. An o\ufb03 cial survey of the hill tribe population was conducted in 1969-70 covering 16 provinces of Northern Th ailand and an estimated 111,591 people were o\ufb03 cially recorded. However, the enforcement of the Citizenship Act had already made most hill-tribes aliens. Th e fact that most indigenous peoples could not speak Th ai made it di\ufb03 cult to prove their origin even if they have been living in Th ailand for hundreds of years.36 Th e Nationality Act of 1965 extended Th ai citizenship to people belonging to ethnic minority groups who were born in the kingdom providing both of their parents were Th ai nationals.37 Given the historical fact of exclusion, this criteria did little to extend citizenship in practice. In 1976 a Cabinet memorandum called for the acceleration of the registration of ethnic minorities who had entered Th ailand prior to 1975, with the ultimate aim of enabling them to become citizens.38 It also attempted to reduce the population growth rate among indigenous peoples by promoting family planning services. Th e distinction between those who entered Th ailand before and after 1975 as the de\ufb01 ning line between those who are, and are not, entitled to citizenship remains in e\ufb00 ect today, despite the signi\ufb01 cant di\ufb03 culties in proving date of entry into the nation.39 Government o\ufb03 cials have been accused of disinterest in e\ufb00 ectively implementing policies that would recognize citizenship of indigenous peoples. One oft cited reason by o\ufb03 cials is the in\ufb02 ux of immigrants and refugees from neighbouring countries, especially Burma, which has caused o\ufb03 cials to be more restrictive in granting citizenship. Th is has resulted in people with legitimate claims facing a long and tedious application process to obtain citizenship, despite Cabinet Resolutions aimed at reducing the bureaucratic obstacles to citizenship. District o\ufb03 cials who are required to cooperate are also often not willing to go into the interior mountain areas and therefore neglect such areas. 246 Bridging The Gap 2 Natural Resource Management System of Indigenous Peoples in Th ailand40 2.1 Natural Resources of Indigenous Peoples in Th ailand Most indigenous groups in Th ailand do not have exact terms that can be translated into the English phrase \u201cnatural resources\u201d, although there are obviously phrases that describe the concept of natural resources. Th e Karen (or Pga k\u2019nyau) phrase ta ba-ter is often used to describe naturally occurring things and means \u2018that which has arisen by itself.\u2019 Another phrase used by the Pga k\u2019nyau to describe naturally occurring things is ta ler aku taw kawae which means \u2018things arising spontaneously\u2019. Similar to the Pga k\u2019nyau, the Hmong have the term ib txwm ntuj tsim teb rau meaning \u2018things that arise by themselves naturally\u2019. Th e pre\ufb01 x \u2018ta\u2019 used by the Pga k\u2019nyau has the simple meaning of \u2018thing\u2019. However it possess the deeper underlying meaning of things that are unseen, the existence of a force or power above everything else and from which nature emanates. Th is approach of associating natural resources with spiritual and cultural meanings is not unique to the Pga k\u2019nyau, and other indigenous groups have similar belief systems. Th e Lisu also believe in the connectedness of natural resources with the spiritual world and that they originate as a result of some divine force.41 For indigenous peoples in Th ailand, \u2018natural resources\u2019 is therefore understood to be an all encompassing concept including land, forest, water bodies, trees, wildlife, agricultural areas and watershed areas, all understood as having cultural, economical, political and spiritual signi\ufb01 cance.

Because natural resources are understood to be an integral part of their everyday life, respect for them and their importance is manifested in everyday activities and practice, as well as in ceremonies and rituals. Knowledge for the management of these resources is embedded in the social, cultural, economic and political milieu of the peoples. Taboos, ceremonies and rituals which express respect and devotion to the spirits that are believed to guard di\ufb00 erent natural resources not only serve an important ceremonial role but also ensure that rules for resource use are adhered to by community members. Some examples of how natural resource management is manifested in beliefs and culture, how they are practiced and how such practices have been institutionalized through the ceremonies and rituals of indigenous peoples in Th ailand are given below. 2.2.1 Lands and Forest Like indigenous peoples in other parts of the world, indigenous communities in Th ailand have a strong a\ufb03 nity toward the land and forest in which they live and on which they depend. Land has physical, spiritual, cultural, economical and political signi\ufb01 cance. Di\ufb00 erent indigenous peoples have di\ufb00 erences in their concepts of land ownership and use as well as similarities. Th e Lisu, who traditionally practice shifting cultivation, choose their farming sites carefully, depending on the kind of cultivation they intend to take up, identifying forest areas which are cultivable, not prohibited by taboos or areas which they traditionally believe should not be disturbed and where the area does not slope too much as to cause erosion. A group of four or \ufb01 ve families usually looks for a suitable site together. Once a site is selected, a sign such as a piece of wood with a cross on the top is cut and placed to mark the area as occupied. Planting occurs only after a ceremony is performed asking for permission, help and protection from the spirits of the area. According to their traditional knowledge, black and loamy soil is fertile and good for all kinds of crops; they plant rice, corn and sesame in warm places while opium poppy and beans are planted in cold areas. Th ey believe that land has life and it dies if care is not taken in its use. Th is prevents them from exploiting land beyond what it can sustain. Th ey leave their land fallow for a minimum of \ufb01 ve years for regeneration. However there are no tenure rights over these fallow lands, anybody with the permission of the previous user can cultivate it if it has regenerated enough. 248 Bridging The Gap Th e Pga k\u2019nyau also practice swidden cultivation, planting rice and various vegetables such as cassava, tubers, corn, pumpkins, chili and eggplant for domestic consumption throughout the year. Th is agricultural system involves leaving the land fallow for seven to ten years before replanting. Like the Lisu, they choose their agriculture area with careful consideration of a number of factors such as whether the area is a taboo forest, watershed etc. Ownership of swidden agricultural land is partially communal, in that if it is not used by the original owner, then that owner is obliged to hand it over for use by other community members. Th e land may not be sold or passed on to one\u2019s descendants. Clearing land for new cultivation sites is never done during the rainy season. Forests are also categorized and di\ufb00 erentiated by both the Lisu and the Pga k\u2019nyau depending on a number of factors. Perhaps the most extensive forest categorization is practiced by the Pga k\u2019nyau people. Th ey classify forest according to various criteria \u2013 topography, altitude, climate, belief, and use. Th ese categories have many more sub- categories which may overlap with each other.

Th ere is also a spiritual classi\ufb01 cation of Pga Ta Du or Taboo Forest which includes Du Mu Ber (meaning a forest area with a shape resembling a toad or turtle); Pga Maw Pu (\u2018salt lick\u2019 forests, where cattle \ufb01 nd salt-licks); Taw De Do (meaning big hair-like forest); Pga Ti Per taw (\u2018water coming out of a hole\u2019 forest, or forested areas around a spring); Pga Swa Ko (burial sites); and Pga ta Nghae Lo Pu (ritual area forests). Most of these types of taboo forest are in watershed areas, have trails and waterholes frequented by animals and support a diverse range of species of plants. All forest types classi\ufb01 ed as Pga Ta Du are absolutely forbidden to be disturbed. Besides these taboo forest types, there are also the \u2018Th Ta\u2019 (forests with powerful spirits), areas that were once cultivated but are associated with unpleasant events that occurred to the family or community in the year it was used, therefore creating fear in re-cultivating them; and the \u2018Du Pga\u2019 (forests to protect and safeguard) which are forests that protect the ecological system in the main 249 Thailand cultivation area of a village. Th ese forests can be cultivated, however no big trees can be cut or new areas cleared. Th is serves to provide su\ufb03 cient fallow time and to protect wildlife preserving the ecological system. Th e Karen (Pga k\u2019nyau) also classify forest and land according to its use. Th e \u2018Hu\u2019 or \u2018Yi\u2019 comprises village areas where houses, rice silos and structures for other public use are constructed. Close to this area, but set apart, is the \u2018Der Ker\u2019 (adjoining the village) forest believed to protect the community. It is also the area where community members tie the umbilical cords of new born babies to selected trees. Once a tree has been selected for a child\u2019s umbilical cord, it is believed that the tree is then linked to the life of the child. Th e tree brings fortune, goodness and protection for the child throughout their lives. However any damage sustained by the tree is believed to damage also the child whose cord was tied there. Th is practice indicates and signi\ufb01 es the relationship between human and trees. Aside from the Der Ker, there is also an additional forest encircling the village called \u2018Ngaw Ker Ter\u2019 which protects the village from becoming too dry, provides food for domestic animals and where rituals to propitiate spirits such as the se k okra, the wit a, and the ser ta. Gardens and paddies called \u2018Ker Rer\u2019 and the swidden \ufb01 elds called \u2018Du La\u2019 are also separately classi\ufb01 ed. Lisu TTh e Lisu also have important forest areas which they believe should not be disturbed. Th e A Pa Mo Hi, a forest area very close to the village, is believed to be the abode of the god \u2018A Pa Mo\u2019, in whose honour a shrine is set up within the forest. Th e Lisu believe that A Pa Mo protects and guards the village from harm and destruction, thus the continued existence of the village depends on A Pa Mo. Th is forest area is regarded with the high reverence and fear. No tree- cutting, hunting or collecting of plants are allowed here. Th e I Da Ma forest, found about two kilometers from the village and considered to be the abode of the god I Da Ma, is normally on a mountain-top. Hunting or tree-cutting are allowed not allowed here. Th e third important area is burial sites. No speci\ufb01 c burial site exists in Lisu tradition and sites are selected according to the wish of the family or the dead person.

Without the forest, wildlife cannot survive; without wildlife, it will not have diversity. Th e role of animals in spreading and propagating plants by eating seeds of plants which they deposit elsewhere is widely acknowledged and recognized by indigenous communities. Accordingly, they are mindful of this when they go hunting for animals and birds. Th e Iu Mien people conduct a ceremony before any hunting expedition in which they ask the permission of the protector spirit of the animals to hunt them. In the ceremony, they also have to specify how many animals they want to kill. Th ere are strict ethical practices which hunters must follow. For instance, a hunter cannot hunt more than \ufb01 ve big animals in a year. If a person hunts more than this, it is believed that it will bring bad luck and disaster to him. In such a situation, the hunter has to propitiate the gods by burning silver and gold so as to buy those animals from their gods. Th e Akha also have a similar practice where a person is limited by the number of animals they can hunt in a year. Lua with squash from her swidden Photo: Chris Erni 251 Thailand Among the Lisu hunting can only be for food and only after permission from I Da Ma (the protector and owner of forest) has been obtained. Hunting certain wildlife such as hornbills, gibbons and elephants are considered absolutely taboo as it would bring calamity and disaster to the hunter and the community. Th ere are also days on which no hunting can take place such as Ah-fyu-thi-nyi (the \ufb01 rst day of the New Year), Li-Hi-Sua-Nyi (day of paying merit to a dead person), Jue-nyi (a village holiday once every 15 days according to the lunar calendar). 2.2.3 Watershed, Rivers and Aquatic Life For indigenous communities, water does not just serve a physical need but spiritual purposes as well. Many indigenous communities use water for a number of rituals signifying its importance in their everyday life. According to traditional Karen (Pga k\u2019nyau) beliefs there was water on earth before anything else. Th ey believe that it is the origin of all life forms and therefore it must always be protected. Th is motivates their preservation of forest, which they know is intrinsically linked to the conservation of water. All indigenous communities have beliefs and taboos against disturbing any watershed area or springs. Often forest areas with watersheds and springs are considered taboos forests by most indigenous communities. It is no coincidence but an indication of the knowledge of indigenous communities about the importance of such forest areas for the sustenance of plant and life forms that depend on it. Th e Karen (Pga k\u2019nyau) liken the fontanel of a new born baby which they believe is the \u201cbrain water pushing up\u201d to the source of a spring where the water \u201cpushes up\u201d. Th ey believe the soul of a baby resides in the fontanel and similarly the soul/spirit of a stream resides in the spring. Th erefore they do not commit any act that would disturb such sources. Doing so would incur the wrath of the spirit of the area. Th ere are a number of rituals followed by di\ufb00 erent indigenous communities which involve water and its use. Th e Hmong perform a ritual known as the Teng Hao Te in the area of the village\u2019s watershed. Th e purpose is to give thanks and to propitiate the Lord of the Water who protects and keeps the forest lush and the water source \ufb02 owing the entire year for the community. Th is ritual is particularly important for communities where water is scarce, so as to ensure a yearlong supply. After the ritual, the watershed area cannot be disturbed. Th ere can be no hunting, collecting of herbs or cutting of trees for any reason. Th e Hmong also have taboos against playing around and unnecessarily disturbing water bodies. Th us they believe one should not throw rocks or things into water without a 252 Bridging The Gap reason as it will disturb the life forms that live in it. Among Hmong, houses cannot be constructed too near a stream as it could disturb the \ufb02 ow of water or in times of excess water \ufb02 ow, endanger the lives of those who live in such houses. Th ere are also strict taboos against changing the natural courses or disturbing the \ufb02 ow of water.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5847d861-f1ed-4728-9521-aa6b05f52611": {"__data__": {"id_": "5847d861-f1ed-4728-9521-aa6b05f52611", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c34d73298a6a5ace7221b0575cd137de2ae7b75f65c90ea4ea616d6095dbe3e"}}, "hash": "6c34d73298a6a5ace7221b0575cd137de2ae7b75f65c90ea4ea616d6095dbe3e", "text": "2.1 Natural Resource Management and Indigenous Spirituality For all indigenous communities, natural resource management always has a spiritual component to it. No natural resource exists without a spiritual connection. Th is belief is manifested in the ceremonies and rituals they perform. Some rituals and ceremonies are described below to highlight the connectivity between natural resource management and indigenous spirituality. Box 2. Some Examples of Indigenous Spirituality Th e Lisu believe that the Juedu Suepa and Juedu Suema are the protectors of watershed areas, Jhatusuepa and Jhatusuema are the god and goddess protecting the land, and I Da Ma, is the protector and owner of forest. Th e permission of these gods has to be received before any of the resources under their control are used. Th e Iu Mien also believe that everything and every place in the world has a spiritual owner and a spiritual protector. Th us any action that a\ufb00 ects natural resources or biological diversity must be done with care and forethought, and with the permission of the spiritual guardians, rather than being done as the actions of humans as owners of nature. Th ese beliefs are re\ufb02 ected in various ways, in daily activities, in traditional and cultural forms that display traditional wisdom in the use and conservation of natural resources. Th e Iu Mien perform the Sib ta poong mian ceremony at the community level three days after the Iu Mien New Year. Th e ceremony is performed annually in a particular area of forest referred to as ho pry chan. Th is area of forest is a fertile water catchment area higher than the village settlement itself. A tall and strong tree is the central point around which the ceremony is performed to give thanks to nature and the particular community spirits that are respected by the Iu Mien and which have provided protection to the community in the previous year- cycle. Th e ta poong mian spirit is invoked and thanked in particular, as is the yud 253 Thailand tay hoong (sky god), taow te mian (land god), suy kaow mian (water god), ta tiew mian (forest and mountain god), ti taong mian (god of the ancestors) and tieb tin hoong (god of the underworld). After this ceremony is performed, all community members are prohibited from entering or using the forest area. Th e ceremony expresses the community\u2019s beliefs about appropriate natural resource use and displays respect for biological diversity. It also serves as a means to convey the Iu Mien traditional knowledge about conservation, which is then practiced and taught to succeeding generations. For the Hmong, resource management is closely linked with their dependence on the forest and its resources. Such close dependency fosters respect and reverence for natural resources that provides for its proper use and management. Th ey believe that resources have spirits that protect and own them. For example Xeeb Teb Xeeb Chaw is the Lord of the Forest and Mountains; Th ep tu ti is the Lord of the Water. Th e Hmong management of natural resources including forest, soil, water, and even wildlife resources is based on recognition of the inseparable relationship between these resources. Th ere are strong taboos to control resource use and to enable equitable sharing of resources by all members of the community. At the same time, there are restrictions against making use of resources belonging to other individuals as well as people from elsewhere. Th ey believe that use of natural resources must be tied with conserving them for sustained use; their traditional knowledge has elements of reviving resources. Certain ceremonies seek to bring these elements of use, conservation and revival together. Th e dong seng is a divination ritual or sacri\ufb01 ce designed to invoke the Lord of the Land to protect land resources and forest resources to shelter the members of the community so they will have good land and forests as well as wildlife. A tall straight tree with a thick trunk and lush branches, in a spot overlooking the community, is chosen for performing this ceremony.

It also emphasizes the idea that di\ufb00 erent elements of nature are related to each other and that adverse action against one will a\ufb00 ect everything. Th e \ufb02 exibility of indigenous systems has been able to accommodate or adapt to other institutionalized religions such as Buddhism. For instance, Buddhist beliefs and rituals, such as the sa\ufb00 ron cloth tying ceremony around trees, are now practiced alongside traditional systems of natural resource management. 2.2 Intergeneration Transfer of Knowledge Elders, priests and shamans in each indigenous community play a vital role in ensuring that their knowledge is passed down from generation to generation. Th ere are various ways in which they do this. It could be through proverbs, sayings, poetry, songs, ritual chants, and riddles. For instance the Karen (Pga k\u2019nyau) have an adage which goes \u201cDu pga o tit a yeu ti li lu no kae bo a sui\u201d which means \u201cIf you are seeking a fertile forest look for one with squirrels and tree shrews\u201d. Th e Hmong has a song, \u201cTxuag siav ces siav ntev/ txuag zam ces zam tshiab/ Txuag xyoob ces xyoob ntev/ txuag ntoo ces ntoo siab\u201d which translates into \u201cNever erring, life is long/ keep clean and your clothes will stay new/ Care for the bamboo, they will be straight/ care for the trees, they will be tall.\u201d In certain communities, there are teachers who transmit traditional knowledge. Th e Hmong have teachers in their villages who teach certain things like the performance of ceremonies such as the Dong Seng. Th is process involves learning the meaning and signi\ufb01 cance behind the ceremonies and not just the form of the rituals. Depending on the things taught, fees are given to the teachers. Th e Hmong also have di\ufb00 erent songs, poems and proverbs for di\ufb00 erent situations and circumstances. Th ese ingenious ways of passing knowledge also ensures that the distinctive identity of this body of knowledge is preserved. However, with the onslaught of new external practices and systems, much of the body of indigenous knowledge is being threatened. While indigenous knowledge keeps slowly adapting itself to changing circumstances, there are cases where there have been radical changes. Th is poses an urgent challenge for indigenous natural resource management. 255 Thailand 2.3 Gender and Natural Resource Management Socioeconomic factors play a very important role in how natural resources are accessed and managed. Tuong Vi Pham notes that \u201cusing resources generate bene\ufb01 ts for both men and women, but access to these resources di\ufb00 ers by gender and this di\ufb00 erential in turn in\ufb02 uences opportunities in the development process. As women get lesser opportunities, they depend more on natural resources.\u201d44 Indigenous women, like most poor rural women around the world, are severely a\ufb00 ected by environmental degradation and limited access to natural resources due to their dependency on the natural environment for sustenance and health.45 Th e situation is no di\ufb00 erent for indigenous women in Th ailand. For instance, it was found that one of the most heavily impacted group of people in the Asian economic crash of 1997 in Th ailand were women, of which indigenous women constituted a signi\ufb01 cant number.46 Further, as indigenous women in Th ailand face additional di\ufb03 culties stemming from ethnic and racial prejudice in wider society, and negative impacts felt by women generally are no doubt harder still on women in marginalized groups. It is important to note that within indigenous communities in Th ailand, the role of gender in work allocation and labour responsibilities can be seen very clearly. For instance, among the Lisu and Hmong, the role of women in decision making are limited even though they take equal part in the utilization and management of natural resources.

Seen in the overall context of indigenous natural resource management, the ability of women to observe, classify and experiment with plants and seeds plays a very important role in preserving the diversity of food sources and resource management. 3. Legal and Policy Framework on Natural Resource Management In the past two decades, rapid industrialization in Th ailand has witnessed an accompanying decline in the environmental health of the country. As with many neighbouring countries, Th ailand has experienced a host of environmental problems stemming from rapid industrialization, ranging from deforestation and declining \ufb01 sh yields to air and water pollution in major cities and industrial areas.47 Th e response of the government has been to enact laws and formulate policies. However such laws have not always resulted in positive developments for indigenous peoples. 3.1 Structure of Government and Hierarchy of Laws Th ailand is a constitutional monarchy, with the King as the Head of State. Th e Prime Minister heads the government and presides over a Cabinet of Ministers. Th e Th ai Parliament is the supreme law-making authority, and consists of the Senate whose members are elected for six year terms, and the House of Representatives, whose members are elected for four-year terms48. Th e structure of governance is divided into national, provincial and district levels, with the provinces headed by governors and districts by district chiefs. Recently, decentralization e\ufb00 orts have shifted more focus on administrative roles at the sub-district which is governed by a Tambon Administrative Organization consisting of the Kamnan and the village headmen of all hamlets in the Tambon, and the Tambon doctor, and of elected members, elected by the people in each of the hamlets in the Tambon.49 Th e hierarchy of laws in Th ailand is very clear and simple. Th e Constitution is the supreme law of the land from which the authority of other law emanates. \u201cActs\u201d are passed by the Parliament under the Constitution. To clarify and implement the Acts enacted, the respective Ministries may make \u201cRegulations\u201d and \u201cNoti\ufb01 cations\u201d. 257 Thailand 3.2 Environmental Institutions Th e responsibility of managing natural resources in Th ailand is shared among various ministries and departments. Th e Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC) is an important player in natural resource management, under which under which are the Department of Agriculture, Department of Land Development, Department of Fisheries, and the Agricultural Land Reform O\ufb03 ce. Th e new Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) includes three main administrative \u201cclusters\u201d: the environment cluster, covering pollution and environmental quality control; the inland water resources cluster; and the natural resources works cluster covering protected areas, forestry, coastal and marine conservation and mineral development, managed, for example, the Department of National Park, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation, Royal Forest Department, Department of Water Resources, Department of Mineral Resources, and Department of Coastal and Marine Resources. Th e National Environment Board (NEB) and the O\ufb03 ce for Environmental Policy and Planning (OEPP), previously under the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment (MOSTE) have also been moved to MONRE. OEPP was changed into the O\ufb03 ce of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning (ONEP). Th e NEB was formed as a policy-making and coordinating body on natural resources, chaired by the Prime Minister and comprised of the head of all the sectoral ministries whose activities a\ufb00 ect the environment, head of departments and government boards, and the private sector. It seeks to coordinate the environmental protection e\ufb00 orts of governmental agencies inter se at the central level and with those of local governments at the provincial level. To do this, it submits policies and plans to the Cabinet for approval, and has the power to prescribe environmental standards, approve Environmental Quality Management Plans Karen villagers clearing a \ufb01 rebreak in their community forest Photo: Colin Nicholas 258 Bridging The Gap and provincial action plans, recommend amendments, improvements and enforcement of laws, and the monitoring of environmental compliance by government agencies and state enterprises.

Th e most recent Constitution of 1997 is considered the true public version as the Th ai people were involved in drafting it from the very beginning, it is however being re-drafted by the post-coup government of 2006. For the purposes of this paper, we will focus on this most recent Constitution and it\u2019s relevant environmental clauses, in the hope that the new Constitution of 2007/2008 will not alter this too much. Th e intention of the 1997 Constitution was to create people\u2019s participation, recognition of human rights and dignity, creation of political stability, establishment of mechanisms for checking utilization of state power to promote good governance, and decentralization of power to the public.52 Signi\ufb01 cant provisions touching on issues of participation which a\ufb00 ects indigenous peoples\u2019 rights are Articles 46, 56, 59 and 79. Box 3: Th e Constitution of the Kingdom of Th ailand Article 46 Individuals who form into traditional, local communities have rights to preserve and revive their customs, local knowledge, arts or culture at the local and national levels; and to participate in the more balanced and sustainable management, maintenance, and utilization of natural resources and the environment. Th is would be in accord with the enacted law. 259 Thailand Article 56 Th e rights of individuals to collaborate with the state as well as community in the maintenance and bene\ufb01 t sharing of natural resources and biological diversity; and in the protection, promotion and maintenance of environmental quality, in order that they can continue to lead a normal life within an environmental context harmless to health and well-being; and their quality of life is protected.

Article 59 Individuals have the right to be informed, explained to, and reasoned with, by government organizations, state agencies, state enterprises, or local o\ufb03 cial organizations, prior to the approval or implementation of a project or activity that may a\ufb00 ect the quality of the environment, health, quality of life, or other important gains or losses related to them or their local communities; and the right to express their opinion on such an issue. Th is would follow the process of public hearings as indicated in the enacted law. Article 79 Th e State is obliged to promote and support peoples participation in preserving, maintaining, and utilizing natural resources and biological diversity in equilibrium; this includes participation in promoting, maintaining, and protecting environmental quality following the principle of sustainable development as well as to control and eradicate pollution that can a\ufb00 ect people s health, well being, and quality of life. Other provisions that are important to environmental management are Articles 49, 50, 69 and 290. Article 49 deals with rights and duties in the expropriation of immovable property. Preserving natural resources or the environment is a valid ground for restricting the liberty of individuals to engage in an enterprise or an occupation under Article 50. Article 69 cast a duty on every person to conserve the national arts and culture and local knowledge and conserve natural resources and the environment. Article 290 sets out the powers and duties of local governments in promoting and maintaining the quality of the environment. 260 Bridging The Gap 3.4 Laws on Natural Resource Management Th ere are more than 20 laws on forest and resource management in Th ailand.53 Not surprisingly, there are con\ufb02 icts in laws and policies and in the functioning of di\ufb00 erent departments and agencies of the government. For instance, there are 16 agencies for forest management, 6 agencies for mangrove forest, and more than 24 agencies for water resources provision and distribution.54 3.4.1 Forest: Laws & Policies A century ago, forests54 covered 72 percent of Th ailand\u2019s territory. Th is accounted for approximately 230 million rai (1 ha = 6.5 rai) of land. In 1961, less than 40 years ago, that number was still relatively high at 171 million rai or 53 percent of the country. However, most recently (1995), only one quarter or 26 percent (82 million rai) of Th ailand remained under forest cover. From 1961 to 1995, Th ailand lost an average of 2.6 million rai of forest every year.55 In contrast with this, the area designated as National Forest Reserve continued to increase to about 46% of the country in the early 1990s.56 In 1992, in compliance with the 7th NESDP and the increasing challenge of resettlement, the Royal Forest Department (RFD) divided the national forest reserve estate", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b8771ad-c385-4180-a26a-eb9cd9bdce2c": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b8771ad-c385-4180-a26a-eb9cd9bdce2c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f90a4738b0686ab5ff019fe57cd8259841cd154541cbc86bedf942f10c64f8eb"}}, "hash": "f90a4738b0686ab5ff019fe57cd8259841cd154541cbc86bedf942f10c64f8eb", "text": "into three zones.57 Th e Conservation Forest Zone (Zone C) is prohibited for agriculture and covers existing protected forest areas and areas of natural forest minimally a\ufb00 ected by human activity. However, some of this area especially in the Northern watersheds remains occupied by permanent agriculture, shifting cultivation and associated human settlements. Th e Economic Forest Zone (Zone E) was set aside from arable land suitable for commercial tree plantations for distribution to landless farmers. Th e E-zone is often devoid of forest and some has been under cultivation for well over a decade. Some E-zone lands are in degraded forest areas. Th e Agricultural Zone (Zone A) portion of the national forest reserve estate was set aside expressly in deforested areas deemed suitable for agriculture. Th ese areas are in the process of being allocated to farmers by the Agricultural Land Reform O\ufb03 ce (ALRO). Transfer of land from the national forest estate to ALRO is accompanied by transfer of management responsibility. Until recently, the history of laws on resource management, particularly forest resource, has been one of resource extraction rather than its sustainable use. For instance, the 1941 Forest Act re\ufb02 ected the fact that Th ailand still had abundant forest areas, but beginning in 1961 a succession of \ufb01 ve-years NESDPs began to progressively re\ufb02 ect the fact that substantial declines in forest area had occurred, and that forest conservation and replanting were becoming increasingly essential.58 261 Thailand 3.4.1.1 Th ailand National Forestry Policy (TNFP), 1985 A National Forest Policy was drawn up and adopted by the Cabinet in 1985 in an attempt to unify forest policy in the country and to place forestry within the context of overall national development.60 Th e TNFP seeks to \u201cachieve a long term and coordinated national forest administration and development and for better understanding between state and private sectors\u201d (emphasis added). Some key aims of the policy61 are the establishment of guidelines for maximizing national social, economic bene\ufb01 ts, national security and environmental protection with emphasis on harmonized utilization of resources; promotion of shared roles and responsibility between government and private sector in forest management and development; maintaining 40% of the country area under forests with 25% as protected forest and 15% as production forest; 62 management of forest for perpetual bene\ufb01 ts to the country; science and technology use to increase e\ufb03 ciency in agricultural productions; development of a forest management plan; improved e\ufb03 ciency in timber production; accelerate city planning and designation of forest, residential, rural and agricultural areas; establishment of National Forest Policy Committee; undertaking awareness programs on positive forest resources use; encouraging reforestation and export of wood and wood products and community forestry such as reforestation on public land by private sector, tree planting on marginal agricultural land and establishment of forest woodlot for household consumption; encourage integrated wood use; amendment of forest laws; substituting fossil fuels with wood use through energy plantations; designation of land with a slope of 35% or more as forest land; formulate guidelines to deal with forest degradation problems e.g. shifting agriculture, forest \ufb01 res, forest clearing by the hill tribe minorities etc; incentive for reforestation by the private sector; and rural settlement planning to conform with national natural resources management and conservation plans. (Italics added). It is evident that the policy does not include any design that encourages community participation in forest management. Th e policy encourages the private sector to become involved in tree planting projects for both domestic and export supply and there is an emphasis on partnership with the private sector. However, the private sector was interpreted to mean concessionaires and business people rather than rural people.63 Th is led to a sharp rise in the number and total area of industrial tree plantations in the Northeast.64 Further it identi\ufb01 es hill peoples and their practices such as shifting cultivation as causes of forest degradation. Most importantly, it fails to even marginally address the con\ufb02 ict over forest resource use by indigenous hill peoples, often identi\ufb01 ed as \u201cillegal encroachers\u201d.

It automatically brought such land under state ownership. From the outset, the main purpose was the control of the harvesting of forest products, and the act did not contain any speci\ufb01 c conservation goals.67 Th e Act mainly focuses on timber trees or forest products seeking to regulate activities within the forest and prohibiting such activities as logging of preserved species of timber, extracting forest products, \ufb01 ring, and land occupation. It divides reserved timber species into two categories: (i) ordinary reserved timbers which are species for logging for which permission must be obtained; and (ii) special reserved timbers which are rare species or species needing to be preserved for which logging permission cannot be granted [Sec. 6]. A provision which has direct consequence for indigenous land use and natural resource management is Sec. 54 which prohibits the clearing, burning, occupying or possession of any forest land. Contravention of this provision attracts a \ufb01 ne extending from \ufb01 fty Lahu terrace-rice \ufb01 eld Photo: Kittisak 263 Thailand thousand baht to one hundred thousand baht and possible imprisonment for between two and \ufb01 fteen years. 3.4.1.3 National Reserved Forest Act 1964 Th e National Reserved Forest Act, at the time it was enacted, sought to revise the law on the protection and reservation of forests. Th is Act, along with the National Park Act of 1961, now forms the basis for the determination, control and maintenance of National Reserved Forests and other protected areas in Th ailand. Th e National Park Department oversees the management, control and use of National Reserved Forest under the law. \u201cForest\u201d is de\ufb01 ned as land which includes mountains, creeks, swamps, canals, marshes, basins, waterways, lakes, islands or seashore which has not been taken up or acquired by a person in accordance with the law [Sec. 4]. Th e Minister of Agriculture is responsible for the implementation and execution of this Act and is empowered to appoint competent o\ufb03 cers and issue ministerial regulations [Sec. 5]. Section 6 declares reserved forest existing at the time this 1964 law takes e\ufb00 ect to become National Forest Reserve under this law. Further it gives power to the competent Minister to determine any other forest as National Reserved Forests with a view to reserving its nature, timber, forest products or other natural resources, which shall be made by a noti\ufb01 cation in the ministerial regulations. Th e Ministerial Regulation along with a map of the determined area is required to be put up in the o\ufb03 ce of the District or Sub-district, Sub-district Headman and in open and conspicuous places in the villages concerned [Sec. 9]. Once a forest is determined as National Reserved Forests, a committee for such National Reserved Forests shall be set up [Secs. 10 & 11]. A person having a claim over or to exploit any National Reserved Forest can \ufb01 le an application within 90 days from the point at which the regulation comes into force [Sec. 12]. Th e Committee inquires into the claim and depending on their \ufb01 ndings, can \ufb01 x compensation; or \ufb01 le an appeal with the concerned Minister against the decision of the Committee [Sec. 13]. Within the National Reserved Forests, no person shall occupy, possess, exploit and inhabit the land, develop, clear, burn the forest, collect the forest products nor cause by any other means whatsoever any damage to the nature of the National Reserved Forest [Sec. 14]. However logging or collection of forest products and logging of reserved timber species may be done after obtaining permission from the Director General [Secs. 15 & 16]. 264 Bridging The Gap Sec. 16 (bis) provides that in cases where any National Reserved Forest, in whole or in part, is so deteriorated that it\u2019s old shifting cultivation land or grassland or valuable timber has become scanty or otherwise with fewer standing trees and cannot naturally be rehabilitated, it will be regarded as deteriorated forest. Such deteriorated forest can be declared to be part of a land reform scheme. A person can apply to inhabit and exploit such land [Sec. 16 (bis) (1)].

However, the Forest Act also contains provisions that regulate forestlands spatially.68 As with other laws described in this paper, the impact of the imposition of the National Forest Reserve Act had direct negative impacts on highland indigenous communities. It is stated in the law that any claim to user-rights or ownership rights to land declared as National Forest Reserve must be made within 90 days of the demarcation and declaration of the new status. Indigenous communities simply are not informed of these legal changes to their lands and territories, due either to the remote sites of their communities or language barriers. As with other laws regarding the legal status of lands in Th ailand, this Act led to many indigenous communities becoming illegal encroachers on their own lands. Karen spirit forest Photo: Chris Erni 265 Thailand 3.4.1.4 National Park Act 1961 Th e concept of protection of forests in National Parks stemmed from the United States of America, where parks were established in the last century to protect extraordinary natural features of educational and recreational value for the sake of all (non-Indian) Americans.69 Th e model of Yellowstone National Park in the USA was taken as the basis for protected areas in Th ailand, mainly on the advice of US National Park o\ufb03 cials.70 Th ere are a total of 102 national parks in Th ailand of which 81 are terrestrial parks and the remaining 21 are marine parks.71 A national park is an area of least ten square kilometers that contains natural resources of ecological importance or unique beauty, or \ufb02 ora and fauna of special importance. An area may also be declared a national park for its historical or cultural features.72 Th e National Park Act of 1961 closely followed the enactment of the Wild Animal Preservation and Protection Act (1960) and provided the legal basis for the creation of national parks in Th ailand. Th e Act is a very short law with only 30 provisions; however it has wide rami\ufb01 cations for indigenous hill peoples. It is identi\ufb01 ed as one of the most used law in arresting and detaining indigenous hill peoples.73 Under the law, a national park may be created from \u201cany area of land which is of interest and be maintained with a view to reserving it for the bene\ufb01 t of public education and pleasure \u2026 (such) land shall not be owned or legally possessed by any person other than a public body [Sec. 6. italics added.].\u201d It is very clear that the purpose of creating parks under the law is not for conservation or preservation of resources, and that \u201ceducation and pleasure\u201d superseded the emphasis on sustainable use of resources. Under the law, a National Park Committee has the duty to give advice to the Minister in charge of implementing the law on: (1) determination of land to be reserved as National Park and extension or cancellation of the National Park; (2) protection and maintenance of the National Park; and (3) matters consulted by the Minister [Sec. 15].74 Section 16 of the law is the main backbone on which the maintenance and protection of a national park rest. It prohibits a number of activities within a national park. Most signi\ufb01 cantly it makes unlawful any act that a person depending on forest resources would commit. As such it impinges directly on the use rights of forest resources for indigenous peoples. Th e penalty for violation of section 16 ranges from paying a \ufb01 ne of 500 baht to imprisonment not exceeding \ufb01 ve years [Secs. 24 \u2013 27]. 266 Bridging The Gap Box 4: Section 16 of the National Park Act, 1961. Within the National Park, no person shall: 1. occupy or possess land including build up, or clear or burn the forest; 2. collect, take out, or alter any act whatsoever things, endanger or deteriorate timber, gum, resin, wood-oil, turpentine, mineral or other natural resources; 3. take wildlife out or alter any act whatsoever things or endanger the wildlife; 4. alter any act whatsoever things, endanger or deteriorate soil, rock, gravel or sand; 5. change a waterway or cause the water in a river, creek, swamp or marsh to over \ufb02 ow or dry up; 6. close or obstruct a water course or way; 7. collect, take out, or alter any act whatsoever things, endanger or deteriorate orchid, honey, lacquer, charcoal, bark or guano; 8. collect or alter any act whatsoever things, endanger \ufb02 owers, leaves or fruits; 9. take in, take out", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "59957f3b-f1b6-4db7-8410-cbb266e221fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "59957f3b-f1b6-4db7-8410-cbb266e221fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "739327ab1437d122e5e81d6540d7709befa0c7ac48c696008a79c7f2cf970c8a"}, "3": {"node_id": "f956f852-1ac8-4859-8b2b-44fdd7f85f52", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf0249ece971e6983b6805b320f7b60a8daf99292381c1282db0398e29209471"}}, "hash": "4bab2017ae4c6f039fd3d63c9382280fd28716554003f3d583214f102e10bd54", "text": "any vehicle or drive it on the way not provided for such purpose, unless written permission has been obtained form the competent o\ufb03 cer; 10. cause any aircraft to take o\ufb00 or land in the place not provided for such purpose, unless written permission has been obtained from the competent o\ufb03 cer; 11. take cattle in or allow them to enter; 12. take in any domestic animal or beasts of burden; unless he has complied with the rules laid down by the Director-General and with the approval of the Minister; 13. carry on any activity for bene\ufb01 t, unless written permission has been obtained by the competent o\ufb03 cer; 14. post a noti\ufb01 cation or advertisement, or scratch or write on any place; 15. take in any gear for hunting or catch wildlife or any weapon, unless written permission has been obtained from the competent o\ufb03 cer and the conditions stipulated by the latter have been complied with; 16. \ufb01 re any gun, cause any explosive article to be exploded or let o\ufb00 any \ufb01 re work; 17. make a nosy disturbance, or alter any act causing trouble or nuisance to any person or wildlife; 18. discharge rubbish or things at the place not provided for such purpose; 19. leave any in\ufb02 ammable article which may cause \ufb01 re. 267 Thailand 3.4.2 Laws on Wildlife & Fishery Management Th e basis for wildlife preservation and protection before the enactment of the 1992 law was the Wildlife Preservation and Protection Act of 1960. Th e 1960 law provided protection for wild animals in general by establishing wildlife sanctuaries and non-hunting areas. Th e 1960 law provided total protection to nine species, prohibiting hunting of these species. Th is has been increased to 15 species in the 1992 law. 3.4.2.1 Wildlife Preservation and Protection Act 1992 Th is Act establishes a National Wildlife Preservation and Protection Committee, chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives and with a membership drawn from various government departments [Sec. 9]. Th e Committee is empowered to designate wildlife conservation areas, to list species subject to protection, and to undertake certain related activities [Sec 15]. Th e Act forbids hunting, propagating or breeding, possessing, trading, collecting, endangering or possessing any protected and preserved wildlife or their nests [Secs. 16 \u2013 21]. Exceptions to some of the prohibitions are acts such as killing protected and preserved wildlife for educational or research purposes may be permitted by the Minister [Secs. 29 \u2013 3]). Th e competent Minister has the power to declare wildlife sanctuaries by announcement in the Royal Gazette [Sec. 33]. No person can hunt wildlife, collect or endanger any nest within a wildlife sanctuary except for educational purpose and then only with permission [Sec. 36]. Further no person can enter, possess or occupy land, construct, cut, fell, clear, burn or destroy trees within such wildlife sanctuaries [Secs. 37 & 38]. Th ese provisions make unlawful most acts that forest dependent communities living inside wildlife sanctuaries would perform for their daily survival. Extensive penal provisions for violations of the Act are set forth with punishment ranging from 5 thousand baht to imprisonment not exceeding \ufb01 ve years. 3.4.3 Land Laws Historically, the evolution of individual land rights and enforcement mechanisms is the result of increases in population density relative to land availability.75 Before 1900, all land belonged to the king from which he made grants to nobles, o\ufb03 cials, and other subjects. Such grants could be passed on to heirs, mortgaged or sold. Land could also be cleared and used by farmers who, after three years of continuous cultivation, established an informal land claim. In 1901 the Department of Lands (DOL, Ministry of Interior) was 268 Bridging The Gap established to formalize title deeds. Th e process of administrating land evolved gradually and culminated in the formulation of the Land Code of 1954. Land is administered by 14 government departments in two ministries; the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. Th ree broad classi\ufb01 cation of land can be made: 1. State Land; 2. Undocumented Land; and 3. Private land.

STK-1 and NS-2 allows temporary land occupation and a claim of a person who possessed the land and made use of it prior to 1981. Within the classi\ufb01 cation of private land also comes Communal Land which is not further de\ufb01 ned. Indigenous peoples were initially excluded from getting titles over land on the basis that they were not Th ai citizens when the Land Code came into being. More recently, it is based on the watershed classi\ufb01 cation that designates most highland areas as o\ufb00 limits to human activity. 3.4.3.1 Land Code 1954 & Land Code Promulgation Act, 1954 Th e Land Code of 1954 (\u201cthe Code\u201d) was promulgated through the Land Code Promulgation Act of 1954. Th e Code has the most important bearing on the question of land ownership and by implication on the process of centralization.77 Th e Government, through Sec. 5 of the Land Code Promulgation Act, provided the option that anyone occupying any forest land as of November 30, 1954 can receive a land use claim certi\ufb01 cate provided he/she can prove his/her claim within 180 days. Most indigenous hill peoples living in remote areas were unaware of this law and even those living close to provincial 269 Thailand towns were unaware of this time stipulation and failed to take advantage of it, thus becoming encroachers. Th e Land Code also declared 50% of the country as forest land under the management of the Royal Forest Department (RFD) [Sec. 1]. Th e Land Code de\ufb01 nes land as the land surface everywhere including mountains, hills, streams, ponds, canals, swamps, marshes, waterways, lakes, islands, and the sea coast [Sec. 1]. It vested ownership with the state of all lands for which there is no owner [Sec. 2]. Th e Land Code classi\ufb01 es land by soil fertility and land suitability, and used the \ufb01 rst general soil map produced in 1953 as a basis.78 Chapter 2 of the Code concerns cadastral survey for land reform purposes and the establishment of the National Land Allocation Commission which shall be the main public body to administer land allocation. Th ree types of documents corresponding to stages of land acquisition are de\ufb01 ned in the Code: occupancy, utilization and legal possession [Secs. 29 \u2013 33]. Th is system has the potential to be exploited where a person after getting legal possession sells the land and starts a whole new process of occupancy in another land area leading up to legal possession again. Deforestation has been attributed to this as the Land Code encouraged the clearing and occupation of forest land by establishing legal systems for land titling.79 Chapter 3 deals with delimitation of rights in land.

Consequently it encouraged a more participatory approach. It stated that \u201clocal communities and individual villagers will have decision-making powers entrusted to them concerning the forest resources they depend on.\u201d83 Further it attempted to strengthen sustainable management and conservation of natural forests and ecosystems, develop a strategy for policy implementation through sustainable and participatory methods, and enhance capacity building for monitoring and evaluating the progress. Th e RFD saw the proposed TFSMP as a \u201cmeans to calm critique of top-down management\u201d84 and under which \u201can amount of land and the rights to this land shall be given over to local management as so called \u201ccommunity forestry\u201d85. However there was widespread opposition to the plan from NGOs and community organizations. One reason given is that it was seen as largely driven by outside technical experts, and therefore had little national ownership.86 Th e Plan also failed to pay su\ufb03 cient attention to broader sectoral issues; was not su\ufb03 ciently attuned to changing societal interests in forest management, particularly the shift from an emphasis on exploitation to one on conservation; the process used to develop policy positions was too technically driven and lacked e\ufb00 ective participation of key stakeholders.87 As a result the Plan was never implemented. 3.4.4.3 Watershed Classi\ufb01 cation and Management Th e RFD started watershed management programs in 1953 by setting up four watershed rehabilitation \ufb01 eld stations under the Silviculture Division. Th e main task was focused on up-stream watershed rehabilitation by reforestation on abandoned shifting cultivated areas. Th is is symptomatic of an approach used for watershed management at that time, a \u2018re-greening\u2019 of the watershed area by reforestation assuming that only the forest can produce optimal yield and distribution of water. Th is was the \ufb01 rst e\ufb00 ort at 273 Thailand formal management of watersheds in Th ailand.88 However degradation of watershed areas continued and hence an inter-institutional watershed management program was initiated and a Committee on Watershed Conservation and Development was set up. Problems of non-cooperation were encountered in its functioning and it was abandonded quickly. Meanwhile the Soil and Water Conservation and Management Division under the Land Development Department and Watershed Research Sub-Division under the RFD were established. Th e latter became the Watershed Management Division in 1975. Presently, responsibility for watershed management in Th ailand falls under the Watershed Management and Conservation O\ufb03 ce within the Department of National Park, Wildlife & Plant Conservation.89 Th e \ufb01 rst watershed classi\ufb01 cation was made by the National Environment Board soon after it was established in 1975. It divided watershed into 3 classes in which 60% of highland areas fell into Class 1 where no resource utilization could take place and all residents were required to be evacuated. Much controversy was generated as a result. Due to the controversy over the \ufb01 rst watershed classi\ufb01 cation, a revised version was presented in 1983 by the National Environment Board. Th e classi\ufb01 cation divided watershed forests into 5 classes according to physical features. Th e current status of this classi\ufb01 cation remains:90 Watershed class Physical environment Proposed management Area in Sq. Km.

Karen women harvesting Photo: Chris Erni 275 Thailand A series of three Cabinet Resolutions, popularly known as the Wang Nam Khiaw resolutions, were issued in April 1997. Th ese resolutions were in\ufb02 uenced by the Assembly of the Poor campaign.93 While one of them (22 April 1997) was a general policy statement, the other two issued on 19 and 29 April 1997 allowed villagers who had been living in reserve forests prior to 1993 to remain there on the condition that they take part in forest conservation. Proof of settlement for the \ufb01 rst time took into account the village\u2018s history as well as the age of fruit trees and buildings, and the government tried to settle land rights con\ufb02 icts in 107 forest communities in the north and northeast.94 In the early part of 1998, large parts of northern Th ailand were a\ufb00 ected by forest \ufb01 res. Indigenous hill peoples were the most convenient scapegoats. Th e then Deputy Agriculture Minister went on record to say \u2018encroachers\u2019 (clearly referring to \u2018indigenous hill peoples\u2019) were behind the forest \ufb01 res.95 Very soon thereafter, the forestry chief was reported to have raised the possibility that settlers in conservation forest may be relocated even though they settled before the declaration of the protected area, and that the Ministry is of the view that the April 17, 22, and April 29 cabinet resolutions of 1997 are impractical and encourage more forest encroachment.96 Meanwhile a logging scandal in the Salween forest of Mae Hong Son involving provincial and district forest and o\ufb03 cials was exposed in April 1998. All these led to a halt of settlement approval in the form of another cabinet resolution on 30 June 1998, which cancelled the three April 1997 resolutions regarding human settlement in forests and recommended the old strategies of classi\ufb01 cation and zoning, with the eviction of villagers living in \u201csensitive areas\u201d. 3.4.4.5 Cabinet Resolution of 10th August, 2004 Th is Cabinet Resolution intends to initiate a \u2018New Plan of Forest Villages Project\u2019. Th is Project aims to lessen the incidence of trespass on forests; create collaborative management practices, to protect, conserve and sustainably use resources, with communities living within the Project areas. Th e target area includes many indigenous communities living in forested areas. Th is Resolution is very positive in its recognition of the possibility of people and forest coexisting. Th e Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Vegetation and the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources are responsible for implementation of this Resolution. Unfortunately, the method of implementation is based on the Cabinet Resolution of 30th of June 1998 which has had very negative impact on people living in forested areas and does not support original patterns of community living. 276 Bridging The Gap 3.4.4.6 Cabinet Resolution 17th January 1989 (Order number 32/2532). Between 19 and 24 November 1988, heavy rains triggered massive landslides, a\ufb00 ecting all of Th ailand\u2019s eastern coastal provinces, killing 373 people, injuring hundreds and rendering thousands homeless. Many reasons for the \ufb02 ood were identi\ufb01 ed but logging became the most infamous culprit. Persistent pressure following the disaster convinced the Government to impose a total logging ban on 17 January 1989 in the form of a Cabinet Resolution (Order number 32/2532). Th is resolution revoked all logging licenses in natural forest and e\ufb00 ectively banning all forms of logging, particularly in the uplands.97 However logging in plantations and mangrove forest continued. Th e main goal of the resolution was the protection of remaining natural forests and the punishment of encroachers in protected forests.

On the wave of political reforms initiated in the 1990s and the demand for an opening of the governance structure of the country to allow people\u2019s direct participation, decentralization became a high point on the agenda.99 Th e Tambon Council & Tambon Authority Act was promulgated in 1994 but it came into e\ufb00 ect only in 1995.

A TAAC comprise of two elected members from each hamlet/village or in the case of Tambon Administrative Authority having only one or two villages/hamlets, six members [Sec. 45]. Th e TAAC has the powers and duties to approve Tambon development plans, draft Tambon regulations, annual expenditure and budget regulation etc [Sec.46]. Th e Tambon Administrative Authority Council Administrative Committee (TAACAC) is composed of one Chairman and two Members elected by the TAAC [Sec. 58] and has the powers and duties of administering the day to day businesses of the Tambon Administrative Authority (TAA). Th e TAA has a number of duties and businesses listed out in Secs. 67 and 68 of the Act, amongst which is the duty to \u201cprotect, look after and maintain natural resources and he environment\u201d [Sec. 67 (7)]. Th e TAA has the power to collect taxes and generate revenue within its jurisdiction and duties to provided essential day to day services [Secs. 74 to 89]. Th e District o\ufb03 cer has the power to supervise the performance and functioning of the TC [Sec. 38] and TAA [Sec. 90] to ensure they are in accordance with law.

To implement the Master Plan, hill tribe communities/villages were classi\ufb01 ed into four groups:105 1. Permanent villages which had more than 50 households with permanent settlement and no migration for the last 20 years, suitable for permanent agriculture, outside watershed class 1 or wildlife areas, with government agencies present and car transport possible; 2. Potential permanent settlements which were those villages that posed no threat to national security, has 20-50 households, with no migration for 10 years, with permanent houses and suitable for permanent agriculture; 3. Non-permanent settlements which were communities that did not ful\ufb01 ll the conditions for group 2; and 4. Special: special community.106 To get legal recognition, a community must not be a threat to national security; it must have government agencies operating on a permanent basis; it must have accepted development initiatives of the government and can support them; it must be located in suitable zones where permanent cultivation is possible; it must comply with the Local Administration Act of 1914 and the voluntary self-protection law of 1979; and it has at least 50 households, not shifted in the last 10 years and practices permanent 280 Bridging The Gap agriculture. Once these criteria are ful\ufb01 lled, it must register with the Village Directory of the Department of Local Administration where it obtains a village number and a Th ai name.

Th e 2nd Master Plan for Highland Development (1997-2001) did not show major changes from the \ufb01 rst one, though it mentioned implementation problems such as a lack of coordination among agencies, restrictive forest policies, a slow citizenship process, and a lack of planning meetings between provincial and local organizations.107 It was characterised by three strategies: the creation of security for highland communities; the management of natural resources with a focus on people and forest living together, economic diversi\ufb01 cation and land use boundaries; and administrative cooperation between the government and the private sector.108 It also stressed the importance of the clear demarcation of village land use boundary for planning, temporary residence and relocation. Th is period also saw the adoption of the new Th ai constitution which recognized and granted communities the right to participation in the preservation and conservation of natural resources.109 Th e present 3rd Master Plan (2002 \u2013 2006) emphasizes the relocation, control and \u2018management\u2019 of highland communities instead of a concept of cooperative development. Th e Master Plan stresses the use of the Cabinet Resolution of the 30th of June 1998 which details a process of rights veri\ufb01 cation that is inappropriate for the reality of indigenous hill peoples. Th e Master Plan also divides all highland communities into 4 groups, according to which the future of the community is determined, as shown here: 1. Formally registered villages under the Local Administration Act of 1914 2. Villages established without yet receiving formal registration, but likely to qualify for registration 3. Villages established without formal registration, and lacking the capacity to be registered formally (to be relocated) 4. \u2018Special category\u2019 communities with special dispensation from the Cabinet to remain for the time being. 281 Thailand Th e current Master Plan reinforces negative stereotypes of indigenous hill peoples. For instance it associates drug trading, destruction of forest and water resources, soil degradation with indigenous hill peoples. In spite of the decentralization initiatives that are already present, such as the Constitution, the Master Plan encourages a centralized approach without involvement of local administrations. One of the biggest challenge and shortcoming of these Master Plans is that there was completely no involvement and participation of indigenous communities in their formulation despite the fact that they are the target and \u201cbene\ufb01 ciaries\u201d of the Plans. Aside from the problems this approach poses in formulating a policy sensitive to the needs of the community, there are problems in implementation as well. 3.4.4.10 Th e National Economic and Social Development Plan (NESDP) As previously mentioned, the \ufb01 rst NESDP contained some provisions that a\ufb00 ected indigenous hill peoples. However it was not until the 5th NESDP that indigenous hill peoples\u2019 issues were directly included for the \ufb01 rst time. Th e entry of a host of international development agencies and donors in the 1980s \u201cdivided northern Th ailand into development project areas\u201d110. It required coordination and hence the 5th National Economic and Social Development Plan (NESDP 1982-86) included hill tribe issues for the \ufb01 rst time.111 Security concerns, opium reduction, Karen women in rice swidden Photo: Chris Erni 282 Bridging The Gap reforestation, reduction of population growth and conversion to \u2018good Th ai citizens\u2019 were the main objectives.112 During the implementation of this plan, a special Committee for the Solution of National Security Problems Involving Hill Tribes and the Cultivation of Narcotic Crops was created by the Ministry of Interior. Th e Centre for the Coordination of Hilltribe A\ufb00 airs and Eradication of Narcotic Crops under the Th ird Army was also set up in 1986 to coordinate between government agencies. Around the same time that the First Master Plan for Highland Development was implemented, the 7th NESDB was also executed. Th is plan called for sustainable development and three development key objectives were adopted. Th ey included economic growth, income distribution, and development of human resources, quality of life and environment. Th e most important feature, vis-\u00e0-vis indigenous hill peoples, of this Plan was the declaration that 25% of the country should be protected conservation forest. Th e period also saw the enactment of the new Watershed Act 1993 which classi\ufb01 ed 45.9% of the country as national forest reserve.113 Th e Asian economic crash of 1997 brought home the fact that the rapid growth Th ailand had enjoyed could not be sustained without adverse social and environmental consequences.

Amongst other things, it stated, \u201cLocal people and community organizations should be urged to play an increasingly active role in the management of natural resources and environments\u2026 Furthermore, restraint and greater e\ufb03 ciency should be promoted, so that natural resources can be used to the greatest possible advantage for the economy as a whole, while having the least possible environmental impact.\u201d115 It also envisioned increasing employment opportunities in rural areas and developing local economy. Th e present 9th NESDP was presented as embodying the king\u2019s concept of \u201csu\ufb03 ciency economy\u201d which was explained as based on adherence to the middle path, and involving moderation not just as a guide for economic policies but as a way of life. Th e 9th NESDP which was formulated in consultation with NGOs, civil society and the private sector has its main goals as poverty alleviation, good governance, sustainability, stability, and strengthening development foundations. 283 Thailand 3.4.4.11 International Treaties and Documents Aside from these national laws and policies, Th ailand is also party to important international treaties and documents on environment which impact natural resource management such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), Agenda 21 and the Ramsar Convention. Th e National Policies, Measures and Plans on the Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Biodiversity (1998-2002), was approved as an administrative framework to implement the CBD. Seven strategies were outlined in the Plan for implementation:116 \u2022 Build capacity of institutions to conserve biodiversity; \u2022 Enhance e\ufb03 ciency in management of protected areas; \u2022 Improve incentives for conservation of species, population and ecosystems; \u2022 Conserve species, populations and ecosystems; \u2022 Control and monitor activities that threaten biodiversity; \u2022 Encourage traditional cultural management of biodiversity; \u2022 Promote cooperation between international and national agencies in the conservation and sustainable utilization of biodiversity. 4. Interface between Indigenous and Statutory Systems and Laws on Natural Resource Management One obstacle in local communities\u2019 participation in natural resource management is the gap between the way of living of indigenous peoples, policies and other legal frameworks put forward by the government which impinges the community\u2019s rights and ignores the people\u2019s customs and tradition. Such obstacle had led to con\ufb02 ict and violence in enforcing laws on the part of the government agencies.117 Th e present Th ai legal framework of natural resource management is based on the concept that public resources can be divided into separate categories according to their utilitarian value, encouraging commercial ends for their use. Such a perspective places emphasis on the physical property of the resources and ignores the value in other domains such as local culture and tradition that serve as the basis for customary legal framework for resource management. It results in the statutory laws serving the interests of only certain groups in the society. Th ere is a need therefore to look at how such gaps can be negotiated. 284 Bridging The Gap 4.1 Interaction between Indigenous Systems and Statutory Systems A constant point of interaction between indigenous systems and the codi\ufb01 ed system of the State is the con\ufb02 ict that regularly arises when they overlap, or as often is the case, exclude each other. Some key issues that need to be acknowledged to address the problems include: 4.1.1 Non - Recognition of Indigenous Natural Resource Management System Most of the existing laws and policies of Th ailand on natural resource management were enacted and formulated without the participation and consultation of right holders. And often, these laws were modeled on the laws of other countries that fail to appreciate local situations. Further, the adoption of \u201cscienti\ufb01 c\u201d approaches to natural resource management continually encouraged a top-down forest and resource management approach. A consequence of this approach was the sidelining of indigenous knowledge and institutions and non-recognition of indigenous systems in natural resource management. However it is important to recognize that \u201cindigenous institutions represent established local systems of authority and other phenomena derived from the socio-cultural and historical processes of a given society.\u201d118 Because they originate from local cultures, their implication and potential for natural resource management is vast. Th ere are already indications that certain state agencies have already incorporated a participatory approach toward natural resource management incorporating the views of indigenous rights holders. For instance, a Community Forestry Development Center was established in the Phupan National Park, a site of constant con\ufb02 ict and contestation over natural resources, to study and develop the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4a64a0c-0b28-4d21-abb2-ed040f8e9366": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4a64a0c-0b28-4d21-abb2-ed040f8e9366", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "716129a36554cec37fc01aace71ed9a569fe1f7109522a418ccecdbc60a049dc"}}, "hash": "716129a36554cec37fc01aace71ed9a569fe1f7109522a418ccecdbc60a049dc", "text": "process and method for use of natural resources with the local people. It was previously under the management of the Community Forestry Division of the RFD but it has been decentralized to the Udonthani Forestry Region O\ufb03 ce, a further indication of a more participatory approach.119 However, it is often the case that participation is de\ufb01 ned and viewed di\ufb00 erently. Government agencies understand participation to mean only giving information to the public without proactive consultation and decision-making roles. 4.1.2 Land Tenure and Use Rights of Natural Resources Th e many cases of con\ufb02 ict over natural resources in Th ailand revolve around land tenure security. As it has been right observed, \u201cTh e \ufb01 erce and often violent arguments 285 Thailand on deforestation and strategies for forest protection are only intelligible against the background of the unsolved land rights issue in Th ailand.\u201d120 Much of the insecurity over land tenure, and the consequent impact this has had on natural resource management, is centered on the manner in which the government has approached and viewed natural resources as the legitimate domain and subject of State policy making without considering other rights holders. Such claims of power comes with arbitrariness in policy making. In this respect the Th ai government has been extremely inconsistent vis-\u00e0-vis its policies for natural resource management. Policies have been modi\ufb01 ed or changed radically to suit economic or political interests, and this is especially so when such policies intersect with indigenous hill peoples. As it has been observed, \u201c[the] government\u2019s political and administrative policy a\ufb00 ecting tribal populations changes continually\u201d.121 For instance, while laws and policies on national parks and wildlife sanctuaries do not allow settlements or use of resources within its borders, and it has resulted in the relocation of indigenous hill peoples, tourism in these protected areas is widely promoted. Infrastructure and private construction for tourism is allowed in national parks.122 Use-rights of resources within national reserved areas and wildlife sanctuaries are ambiguous and not clari\ufb01 ed. It gives vast leverage to authorities to use the law at their convenience. On the other hand, in areas where there is a strong collective community initiative, this ambiguity also allows indigenous communities to negotiate use rights with the local authorities. For instance, in the Sopsai watershed in Nan Province, indigenous villagers have been able to gain recognition from the local authorities over their \u201ccommunity forest\u201d and land use practices. Th is has been attributed to the presence of a strong community mobilization within the watershed.123 Similar experiences in other places have also been documented. 4.1.3 Citizenship Another signi\ufb01 cant factor compounding land tenure insecurity and a\ufb00 ecting natural resource management is the denial of citizenship to a high number of indigenous hill peoples. As pointed out previously, the possession of citizenship documents is essential to accessing any facilities in Th ailand. Without such document no use rights can be proven, let alone right over land. 286 Bridging The Gap Box 5: Citizenship and Land Rights In 1999, between April and June, indigenous peoples organized demonstration in Chiang Mai to ask for Th ai nationality and land rights. Th e demonstration was broken up by 1,600 police and rangers in the middle of the night - presumably on the orders of the then governor of Chiang Mai.124 However it resulted in some e\ufb00 orts by the government to recognize the citizenship rights of indigenous hill peoples. After the protest of 1999, the government decided to review the citizenship applications. On 29 August 2000, the Cabinet adopted a resolution to complete the review of citizenship applications by 28 August 2001.125 Under the Cabinet Resolutions hill people were classi\ufb01 ed under three groups: 1. People residing in Th ailand who migrated to Th ailand between 1913 and 1972126; 2. People who migrated to Th ailand between the 14th of December 1972 and the 3rd of October 1985 and are eligible for permanent resident status127; and 3. People who have allegedly migrated after 3 October 1985 and are considered \u201calien and illegal\u201d and can be forcibly removed from the country.128 Th e process of reviewing citizenship applications were to be completed within one year; however, four more subsequent cabinet resolutions were made and even by mid 2004 there were 377,677 individuals who did not have Th ai citizenship or any legal status.129 In June 2005, in a meeting discussing citizenship rights, participants called for the amendment of Sec. 7 (bis) (3) of the Nationality Act which denies citizenship to children born to parents with alien status in Th ailand.

Th ese children have been classi\ufb01 ed as stateless and, as such, have been denied rights to education, health services and other welfare bene\ufb01 ts granted to a Th ai citizen.130 Th e law requires proof that a person, plus one parent, is born in Th ailand. However most indigenous hill peoples who live in remote mountains do not have birth registers or other means of proof. In another recent development, in September 2005, the Supreme Administrative Court at Chiang Mai ordered the reinstatement of the names of 1,243 villagers into the citizenship register from Mae Ai after it was arbitrarily ordered to be removed by the Mae Ai district Local Administration Department which had the e\ufb00 ect of taking away the citizenship rights of these villagers. 287 Thailand 4.2 Participation of Indigenous Hill Peoples in Policy Formulation Participation with regard to natural resource management, as envisaged in the 1997 Constitution, is the involvement of individuals, groups or communities in receiving relevant information, accordingly identifying problems, planning and managing, monitoring and evaluating, and coming up with solutions and answers for the problems that are identi\ufb01 ed through such processes. However Th ailand has long su\ufb00 ered from a top-down approach that failed to involve local people and represented the ideas and viewpoints of only a few people.131 By excluding communities from participatory natural resource management, intensive competition for resources resulted and, in turn, more degradation of the natural resources occurred.132 However new institutions and legal frameworks are providing opportunities to address this. Th e Tambon Council and Administrative Authority Act of 1994, the Decentralization Act of 1999, the Enhancement and Conservation of National Environmental Quality Act of 1992, the Constitution etc all lay down provisions for involving people at the local level. In spite of criticisms against some of these laws, their potential is immense. Given the participatory and democratic nature of indigenous communities in decision making, it would not be di\ufb03 cult to adapt participatory approaches as envisioned in these enactments to natural resource management. Th ere are already a number of projects and programs undertaken by the government as well as NGOs and community organizations that seek to implement decentralization plans based on these laws. However it also has the danger of displacing the already much threatened indigenous institutions. One of the greatest strength of indigenous institutions and systems are their ability to adjust and the space they allows for maneuvering according to di\ufb00 erent situations. Rather than adapting indigenous systems to a rigid structure with codi\ufb01 ed rules and regulations, statutory provisions must be \ufb02 exible enough to accommodate the malleable nature of indigenous institutions. Further, the failure of many programs and policies of the government formulated without the involvement of communities illustrates the need for the active involvement of target communities as right holders. For one, involving communities from the outset would give a much better insight into the needs and concerns of the communities but more importantly it will give them a sense of ownership which is very vital to the success of any policy. 288 Bridging The Gap Box 6: Community Forest Bill Community forestry is not a recent concept but has been traced far back in the history of what now constitutes the Th ai state.133 However community forestry as an approach entered the o\ufb03 cial forest resource management lexicon in 1985 with its appearance in the Th ai National Forestry Plan (TNFP). Unfortunately, community forestry was inferred to mean commercial plantations by private concessionaires under the TNFP. Th e history of the Community Forestry Bill is closely linked to the political, social and economical developments of Th ailand.134 Community forestry in Th ailand is a highly politicized issue, it involves contesting discourses between centralized, professionally-oriented forest management, and a social movement of marginalized forest communities who advocate social justice and decentralization of resource management.135 It is not only a struggle for control of forest resources but is also increasingly becoming a constitutive struggle for power by the local people to govern themselves.136 Th e failure of the forestry policy that favoured private commercial plantations and conservation at the expense of forest communities during the 80s led to increased pressure on the government resulting in the RFD proposing a community forest bill in 1990.137 However no de\ufb01 nite outcome resulted. Community forestry re- emerged in the political arena in 1992 in the context of national elections that were to be held the year with each political party proposing their own versions.

However academics, researchers and NGOs drafted a version in 1993.138 Another draft known as the \u201cSuanbua Draft\u201d was brought out in 1996 which was approved in principle by the Cabinet, however political developments that toppled the government then again relegated the bill to the background. Using the provision of Article 170 of the Constitution which allows the public to propose new legislation if 50,000 or more signatures can be collected, the Assembly of the Poor proposed a people\u2019s version in 1997. After much discussion and lobbying, in Nov. 2001, the Council of State approved the community forest bill and sent it to the Senate for approval. However the Senate, in March 2002, passed the bill after making substantive changes that diminished the whole point of the bill. A table comparing the draft Community Forestry Bill passed by the Council of State and amendments made by the Senate indicates the changes are shown below:139 289 Thailand Draft Community Forestry Bill Amendments by Senate Section 18. The right to propose an area of community forest was limited to groups of 50 or more persons aged over 18 years and from a traditional community native or indigenous to the area that has been active in forest preservation for at least the previous \ufb01 ve years. The number of proponents increased from 50 to 100 and community forests excluded in protected forest areas such as watersheds, wildlife sanctuaries, the time frame for forest conservation activity \u2018to at least \ufb01 ve years before the bill takes effect\u2019. Section 29.

Trees to be cut only for subsistence and public utility, which should follow guidelines set by a relevant policy committee. Locals cannot gather any forest products in the community forest except with permission from the Royal Forest Department The changes made to Section 18 have been particularly of concern as it would a\ufb00 ect more than 500,000 families living in 5,000 community forests across Th ailand. As it now stands, the Council of State will consider the amended bill and if they do not agree to the amendments, a joint committee will be formed to study the bill again. Several groups with di\ufb00 erent ideologies and political ambition have since then debated and made known their point, sometimes violently and forcefully. Th e most contentious issues concern the area permitted for establishing community forests, the activities to be allowed on the land and the control of the area, including penalties for contravening the rules.140 Th e whole debate is shaped by two con\ufb02 icting stories about people and forests. One is that forests have to be generally protected against people, and the other, that village people, are suited to live in harmony with forests.141 290 Bridging The Gap [Ed. note to the second edition. Th e Community Forest Bill has been passed in the Senate-amended form described above in late 2007. However the passage of the Bill took place under a military government, and many within civil society in Th ailand do not accept the amended version passed. It remains to be seen whether the Bill is revised again] 4.3 Connecting Di\ufb00 erent Institutions \u2013 Government, NGOs, Donors and Community Organizations Th ree main actors are usually identi\ufb01 ed in the discourse on natural resource management in Th ailand: the government, NGOs and local communities, or more speci\ufb01 cally indigenous hill peoples. Each has tried to in\ufb02 uence natural resource management in di\ufb00 erent ways. However it is also important to factor in the role of donors within the natural resource discussion as they have a huge say in how resources are managed and allocated. It is important that the speci\ufb01 c roles of these institutions are identi\ufb01 ed within the overall framework of natural resource management, and at the same time, to examine how they interact with each other. 4.3.1 NGOs NGOs in Th ailand have been instrumental in shaping policies on natural resource management. Within the environment discourse, two general categories of NGOs can be seen - the \u201cDark Green\u201d142 and the \u201cLight Green\u201d groups. Th e Dark Green groups are mostly middle class environmental groups who believe in strong conservation", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53cc1647-a9cf-4356-8847-6c71f6c07be2": {"__data__": {"id_": "53cc1647-a9cf-4356-8847-6c71f6c07be2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a056c54e91eda88918321cdfbe5f527e13f96de31190a12b20a42d04eb288e85"}}, "hash": "a056c54e91eda88918321cdfbe5f527e13f96de31190a12b20a42d04eb288e85", "text": "methods and the exclusivity of natural spheres and human beings.

Not surprisingly, most indigenous organizations fall within this latter category. Th e di\ufb00 erence in perspective has resulted in fragmentation of NGO opinions which has a\ufb00 ected natural resource management gravely.144 For instance, the Community Forest Bill has been a strong site of contest between these two groups, preventing its enactment. 291 Thailand As NGOs have the crucial role of synergizing and linking di\ufb00 erent agencies and organization, most importantly, connecting governments to the community, it is important that the di\ufb00 ering approaches and viewpoints toward natural resource management among NGOs themselves are bridged. Box 7: IMPECT Association Th e Inter Mountain Peoples Education and Culture in Th ailand Association (IMPECT) is an indigenous organization founded and sta\ufb00 ed entirely by representatives of indigenous communities in Th ailand. It focuses on developmental work with seven indigenous groups found in the northern provinces of Th ailand: Akha, Hmong, Lahu, Lisu, Lua, Karen and Iu Mien. Currently it is implementing the Highland Mapping Development and Biodiversity Management as one of its many projects. Th e project is an important e\ufb00 ort towards involving communities in the decision making process through innovative use of technology. Th e project operates at two levels.145 Community and land use mapping is done using GIS. Th is information is then used in enhancing the capacity of communities by facilitating a more critical understanding and analysis of resource use. A number of trainings, consultations and workshops have been organized in which community maps are used as the negotiating basis for resource use. A participatory approach is utilized and emphasized in which everyone within a community is involved in decision making, notably women. Communities have been able to e\ufb00 ectively engage with local governments, Forest and Park o\ufb03 cials, using the information from this project to demarcate and negotiate resource use, even within national parks and protected areas. One of the limitations pointed out, though, is its inability to in\ufb02 uence policy making at the national level. However, IMPECT has actively networked with other organizations to push for policy change. Besides the national network of indigenous groups, it actively engages with national level community and peoples organizations such as the National Federation of Peasants (NFP), Northern Farmers Network (NFN) etc. Organizations such as the NFP and NFN, where many lowland Th ais are also actively involved, are potential platforms for \ufb01 ghting the negative stereotypes attributed to highland indigenous peoples. IMPECT also has been instrumental in formation of networks on indigenous health and women. 292 Bridging The Gap 4.3.2 Community and People\u2019s Organizations Community and people\u2019s organization in Th ailand, such as the Northern Farmers\u2019 Network, Assembly of Indigenous and Tribal Peoples etc, have been highly active in negotiating with di\ufb00 erent players within the natural resource management setting in developing a people- centric approach toward natural resource management. Th ese organizations came about as a response to the adverse impact government policies and actions by dark green NGOs had on the lives of indigenous hill peoples. Th ey have been able to create cultural spaces to express indigenous traditional knowledge, concepts, and beliefs in the use and management of natural resources. Most importantly they have been able to put into place self-governing rules on natural resource management within their communities. However community organizations need to be strengthened further and promoted in all levels of governance. Box 8: Th e Highland Nature Conservation Club Some academics, community leaders and social workers recognized and felt the need to respond actively to put forward the case of the indigenous hill peoples in the context of forest policies which encouraged forceful relocation and resettlement of indigenous hill peoples, and the campaign of lowland conservation groups targeting indigenous hill peoples as the culprits of environmental degradation in the late 1980\u2019s. Th e Highland Nature Conservation Club (HNCC), a community organization resulted. Over the years, HNCC has taken up many activities of lobbying for positive policy change as well as implementing community activities at the local level. HNCC have been quite successful in combining technology and indigenous knowledge in demarcating use zones, regulations and rules for community forests and land use, setting up \ufb01 re-break zones.

Th ey are presently involved in the implementation of a pilot project in four schools at Khun Tae, Khun Ya, Some Poi and Khun Pae where the curriculum consist elements of traditional knowledge and customs. Th e positive result of their capacity building activities can be seen from the level of participation of women in decision making which numbers almost as much as men. 293 Thailand 4.3.3 Government A recurring criticism of the government\u2019s approach to natural resource management is the overlap between di\ufb00 erent government agencies and institutions that deal with natural resource management. Closely related to the overlap between government agencies is the overlying characteristic of provisions in key laws governing natural resource management. Th e recent restructuring attempts to address this problem but further clari\ufb01 cation of roles and streamlining is needed. Th ere are still a lot of institutional limitations and reluctance to address issues related to indigenous hill peoples. Th ere is also an inherent problem with the segmented approach that the government takes in addressing natural resource management and indigenous hill peoples\u2019 issues. However there is a growing realization and recognition among government agencies on the need to involve all parties, especially the target groups in program and policy formulation. Box 9: Participatory Land Use Planning of the RFD As an alternative to infeasible resettlement programmes and in order to address the complexity of environmental problems, a model called \u201cParticipatory Land Use Planning\u201d was developed jointly by the Royal Forest Department and the University of Chiang Mai. Th e approach integrates measures of soil and forest conservation whereby emphasis is put on enabling local communities to assess and modify local land use systems according to watershed management objectives. After promising results during a pilot implementation that started in 1987, the model has been adopted by various large projects of international donors and has gained widespread popularity also in other countries. Critics, however, claim it overemphasizes social and psychological aspects such as community organisation and environmental awareness without providing clear guidelines for resource management and proof of its resource e\ufb00 ectiveness. 4.3.4 Donors At the height of the development push during the 1980s, there were a total of 168 agencies from 31 government departments and 49 international donors active in Th ailand.146 Donors have been instrumental in in\ufb02 uencing the government to undertake programs and projects for highland development, starting with the controversial opium replacement monoculture cash-crop plantation projects and progressing to a plethora of programs now. Most of the projects now have a strong component focus on a decentralized natural resource management model that seeks to ensure the livelihoods and socio-economic needs of a\ufb00 ected groups. However problems are still encountered in implementation of programs. Th ere are criticisms against donors for pushing their self-de\ufb01 ned agendas of \u201cdevelopment\u201d that are not sensitive to the needs of indigenous hill peoples or which would not realistically improve their situation. Box 10: JOMPA Presently one project that touches the core issue of conservation, natural resource management and indigenous issues is the Joint Management of Protected Areas Project (JoMPA). JoMPA is a sub-component of the Th ai-Danish Programme for Co-operation in Environment funded by DANIDA. It aims at promoting participatory approaches to protected area management in Th ailand securing both biodiversity conservation and improved livelihood of local communities. Key problems addressed by the sub-component are the continued loss of biodiversity, degradation of the ecosystem functions, loss of livelihood opportunities for the rural poor and lack of democratic involvement of a broad range of stakeholders in the protected area management.147 JoMPA, in the long-term, aims to secure biodiversity conservation with responsibilities and outcomes of sustainable management shared among authorities, local stakeholders and general public..148 It supports the implementation of basic principles of peoples\u2019 participation and decentralisation as stressed in the Constitution of Th ailand and policies on decentralisation.
