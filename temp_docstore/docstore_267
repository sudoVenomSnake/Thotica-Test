The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) donated a 5-metre dish antenna that enabled me to receive signals from com- munications satellites placed over the Indian Ocean. It was a crowd-puller for several weeks: every- one from cabinet ministers and civil servants to school children wanted to see pictures coming in from the skies. Today, television rules how Sri Lankans work, dine and socialise. And when an important cricket match is being broadcast live,I have to look hard to find any signs of life on the streets of Colombo. Even if the novelty of images from the skies has completely worn off, debates on their social and cultural impact continue. In the early days, I was often approached by people who were concerned about what satellite television might do to local cultures,traditions and values.Some of us who suffer from information overload find it difficult to imagine its even deadlier opposite: information starva- tion.I get annoyed when I hear arguments \u2014 usually from people who have been educated beyond their intelligence \u2014 about the virtues of keeping happy, backward people in perpetual ignorance. Such an attitude seems like that of a fat man preaching the virtues of fasting to a starving beggar. Every TV programme has some education content: the cathode ray tube (and now the plasma screen!) is a window on the world; indeed, on many worlds.Often it\u2019s a very murky window, but I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that, on balance, even bad TV is preferable to no TV at all. In the mid 1970s, I was associated with the world\u2019s first systematic attempt to transmit educa- tional television programming directly to villages.The Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE) involved 2,400 villages in six Indian states,and used a leased American communications satel- lite to beam television programmes carrying information on family planning, crop production, healthy living and other practical matters that can raise the quality of life \u2014 and often save lives. Working with the indefatigable Dr Yash Pal and his dynamic team gave me valuable insights on how developments in communications can produce tangible benefits for large numbers of ordi- nary people. Soon after SITE ended, I wrote, \u201cOne of the most magical moments in Satyajit Ray\u2019s exquisite \u2018Pather Panchali\u2019is when the little boy Apu hears for the first time the aeolian music of the telegraph wires on the windy plain. Soon, those wires will have gone forever; but a new generation of Apus will be watching, wide-eyed, when the science of a later age draws down pictures from the sky \u2014 and opens up for all the children of India a window on the world.\u201d Those experiments with the \u2018schoolmaster satellite\u2019now seem to belong to a completely differ- ent age. Much has happened since, particularly in the 1990s when commercial satellite television proliferated, opening up fierce competition in the skies over India. Many millions of dishes have bloomed across the subcontinent, and tens of millions of modern-day Apus are now growing up taking satellite television, mobile phones and internet for granted.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4b9bd40-2c40-4dbd-8374-8281850a4e79": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4b9bd40-2c40-4dbd-8374-8281850a4e79", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bcd1470de7f46369d986510092fa41a0f79a9969caf64aec8262a4b625c18a7f"}, "2": {"node_id": "524b0a97-3dae-4c75-a63b-47f63af4057b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05590d302dbaaf6f1b61b9b31afcd0780619185f94b5ab1991eec91989c01353"}}, "hash": "ea63505ec4ea940a77b767e0e6e4b0362502136d0060b72f68eb06d6377c2d04", "text": "But we have to acknowledge that the communications revolution has bypassed tens of millions of others in many parts of the world.We are reaching the point in our technological evolution when we can \u2014 and must \u2014 commit more time and resources to solving the problems of poverty,depri- vation and inequality.

I would like to see a cost-effectiveness study of rural telephone systems for the developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. But the financial benefits, important though they are, might be insignifi- cant compared with the social ones.\u201d iv When I spoke my mind from that famous podium in New York,I did not imagine how quickly my words would be illustrated by actual developments. Just as satellite television swept across the globe during the 1980s, the internet spread rapidly in the 1990s.Virtually everything we wish to do in the field of communications is now technologically possible. The key limitations are financial, legal, social and political. In time, I am sure, most of these will also disappear, leaving us with only limitations imposed by our own morality. And making the right choices and investments is indeed a hard task.There is a danger that techno- logical tools can distort priorities and mesmerise decision-makers into believing that gadgets can fix all problems. A computer in every classroom is a noble goal \u2014 provided there is a physical classroom in the first place.A multimedia computer with internet connectivity is of little use in a school with leaking roofs \u2014 or no roof at all.The top priorities in such cases are to have the basic infrastructure and ade- quate number of teachers \u2014 that highly under-rated,and all too often underpaid,multimedia resource. We must therefore take a few steps back from the digital hype and first try to bridge the \u2018Analog Divide\u2019 (to coin a phrase) that has for so long affected the less endowed communities in developing countries (and even in some developed ones). Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) should be part of the solution,not the only solution. We need to ensure that ICTs are not only accessible but are also affordable. I have seen how some Sri Lankan schools have all the hardware and software and yet can\u2019t use the internet \u2014 because they can\u2019t afford the phone bill.I was appalled to hear some years ago that about a third of transistor radios in the developing world are not used \u2014 because their owners can\u2019t buy new bat- teries. (This inspired British inventor Trevor Bailey to develop the wind-up radio). Our big challenge, therefore, is to get ICTs to solve real life problems without creating any new ones.In the early part of the last century,Mahatma Gandhi proposed a simple test for the effective- ness of any development activity: find out how the last man would be affected by it. We should adapt this as a test for ICTs in development: how will the last man, woman and child be reached, touched and transformed by these marvellous communication tools? This Regional Human Development Report is a pioneering attempt to examine how ICTs can be used effectively to bring about such development and social change.It is no coincidence that it cov- ers the Asia Pacific region \u2014 home to the world\u2019s largest television audience, and where mobile phones and personal computers are among the fastest selling consumer electronic products.Using the United Nations\u2019eight Millennium Development Goals as a benchmark, the Report presents the experience of nine Asian countries. There is no single formula for success; each country has to define what works best within the range of options and technologies available. Such decisions and choices have to be made quickly and resolutely as the development needs are vast and urgent. The information age has been driven and dominated by technopreneurs \u2014 a small army of \u2018geeks\u2019who have reshaped our world faster than any political leader has ever done.And that was the easy part. As this Report shows, we now have to apply these technologies for saving lives, improv- ing livelihoods and lifting millions of people out of squalor, misery and suffering. In short, the time has come to move our focus from the geeks to the meek. Sir Arthur C. Clarke Colombo, Sri Lanka 12 November 2003 [The world\u2019s best known writer of science fiction,Sir Arthur C Clarke has long advocated the appropriate use of information and communications technologies for development. He was the first to propose the concept of the geostationary communications satellite in 1945, and one of his short stories inspired the World Wide Web. He has lived in Sri Lanka since 1956 and was until recently Chancellor of the country\u2019s MIT \u2014 the University of Moratuwa.] v Preface The Regional Human Development Report on Promoting ICT for Human Development: Realising the Millennium Development Goals,is a first time attempt to systematically assess the role and impact of information and communication", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4e2e9cf-dd51-4445-b72a-52d1f80efb90": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4e2e9cf-dd51-4445-b72a-52d1f80efb90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "860d61417f28f359283bbbffa19f4c5b274e1968bffa07d1f80b3a77e986ba0f"}, "3": {"node_id": "0ae3e86a-09e1-4feb-ba3f-9bfd8b3aad8d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b5da673e1d1739b3dbbd31a9c2b394a7aa48597659558fae91f51f6454db138"}}, "hash": "65fa9fdea3226c72b6be82c13174dc78d1539d193da29158eb2533304eddd5ed", "text": "technologies (ICTs) on human development in Asia.Initiated joint- ly by UNDP\u2019s Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme (APDIP) and Asia-Pacific Regional Human Development Reports Initiative (APRI), the Report makes a significant contribution to our understanding of the potential and challenges of using ICTs to achieve human development goals. The Report covers nine countries in Asia: China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,Thailand and Viet Nam. This timely effort comes in the wake of an increasing global acceptance of ICT as a tool to fight poverty, especially in the developing world. Ambitious ICTs infrastructure initiatives and develop- ment strategies and programmes on ICT are being widely launched across Asia. While the advan- tages of ICT for development are enormous and rightly acknowledged, it has become equally imperative to recognise that benefits of ICTs are not evenly distributed. Many sections of societies in developing countries of Asia have been barely touched by the opportunities of the information age.It is this digital divide that needs to be urgently bridged today.The gap in opportunities occur- ring across and within countries due to differences in starting points, inaccessibility to technology and knowledge exchange, lack of infrastructure and inhibiting social and cultural factors, needs to be overcome.There is also the gap in relevant content that addresses the concerns of the worst off. This Regional HDR is a major step towards bringing this to the centre of the development debate. The Report\u2019s unique approach lies in its use of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to meas- ure and monitor the impact of ICTs on human development. Its comparative study across the nine countries in Asia highlights both qualitative and quantitative linkages between ICTs and human development and the channels through which the linkage effects occur. The Report provides a clear documentation of the different levels of achievement of human devel- opment from the perspective of the MDGs and effective ICT use towards achieving them in the nine countries of Asia. Country-specific experiences, and cross-country comparisons capture the rich variety of ICT initiatives in the region, as well as their successes and failures. Conscious efforts are needed to level playing fields for harnessing the use of ICT for human development in the region. The possibilities of using ICT towards realising MDGs are numerous.A future in the information and communications age that not only includes the poor,but also provides them with increasing oppor- tunities and choices for a better life, however, will not occur automatically.The role of governments will continue to be central in deployment and facilitation of ICT initiatives. Civil society groups are emerging as important stakeholders, particularly to complement the efforts of governments. The trend of deregulation of ICT industries is also increasing the role of industry in ICT.The challenge is to channel this for human development initiatives. Effective partnerships among stakeholders, as the Report emphasises, is also key to any successful ICT initiative towards human development.ICT is only a tool.The success of harnessing this tool effectively is dependent on the commitment of the stakeholders to the realisation of the MDGs. The battle for poverty and MDGs will be won or lost in parts of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. This report, therefore, is a timely analysis on the potentials of ICT as a tool and the role it can play in achieving these goals and enhancing human development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ae3e86a-09e1-4feb-ba3f-9bfd8b3aad8d": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ae3e86a-09e1-4feb-ba3f-9bfd8b3aad8d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "860d61417f28f359283bbbffa19f4c5b274e1968bffa07d1f80b3a77e986ba0f"}, "2": {"node_id": "d4e2e9cf-dd51-4445-b72a-52d1f80efb90", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "65fa9fdea3226c72b6be82c13174dc78d1539d193da29158eb2533304eddd5ed"}}, "hash": "0b5da673e1d1739b3dbbd31a9c2b394a7aa48597659558fae91f51f6454db138", "text": "Hafiz A.

There has been much hype surrounding the potential and promise of ICT for developing countries. The study underlines the need to go beyond the mere promise of these technologies by mapping concrete Asian initiatives to har- ness ICT for human development. Nine detailed country studies (Table 1.1), commissioned exclusively for this project, were prepared by teams of experts. The nine countries \u2014 China, India,Indonesia,Malaysia,Mongolia,Pakistan,Sri Lanka,Thailand and Viet Nam \u2014 are spread over the three distinct sub-regions of South Asia, South East Asia and East Asia, providing a rich and diverse canvas.Each country study provides extensive qualitative documentation on the specific uses of ICT across the MDGs for promot- ing human development. A separate statistical exercise, aimed at identify- ing key ICT indicators relevant to and available for Asia, was undertaken to complement the country studies. Indicators were selected for combining such data on ICT as could help in for- mulating composite aggregate indices to help capture quantitatively the overall ICT for human development situation in individual countries. The findings of the RHDR are thus informed by an interesting combination of a qualitative analysis from the nine countries and a quantita- tive exploration. According to the UNDP definition, ICTs are basi- cally information-handling tools \u2014 a varied set of goods,applications and services that are used to produce, store, process, distribute and I Introduction 1 Region Countries Number South Asia India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka 3 South East Asia Indonesia, Malaysia,Thailand and Viet Nam 4 East Asia China and Mongolia 2 Asia 9 Table 1.1 Countries covered by the Regional Human Development Report 2 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals exchange information.

Over the past two centuries many parts of the world have witnessed unprecedented econom- ic growth and raise in living standards. Yet, the transformation from subsistence to affluence has been far from uniform.The human develop- ment record in large parts of the developing world continues to show a persistence of pover- ty, hunger and malnutrition, illhealth and dis- ease, illiteracy and unequal access to skills and knowledge.Unequal opportunities have severe- ly restricted the choices for large sections of the population such as women, the poor and indigenous peoples. Moreover, affluence has brought new concerns regarding lifestyle- related health issues, environment and inter- generational sustainability. The world continues to face unacceptable lev- els of deprivation (UNDP 2001). Of the 4.6 bil- lion people in developing countries, more than 850 million are illiterate, nearly a billion lack access to improved water sources, and 2.4 billion lack access to basic sanitation. Nearly 325 million boys and girls are out of school while 11 million children under age five die each year from preventable causes \u2014 equiva- lent to more than 30,000 children a day (WHO 1997). Moreover, around 1.2 billion people live on less than a dollar a day (1993 PPP US$) and 2.8 billion on less than 2 dollars a day (Smeeding 2001b, UNAIDS 2000a, 2000b; UNESCO 2000b; World Bank 2000d, 2001b, 2001c, 2001f; WHO 1997, 2000b; OECD and Statistics Canada 2000). The philosopher- economist and Nobel laureate, Amartya Sen, summarised this situation eloquently: ...We also live in a world with remarkable depri- vation, destitution and oppression. There are many new problems as well as old ones, includ- ing persistence of poverty and unfulfilled elemen- tary needs, occurrence of famines and wide- spread hunger, violation of elementary political freedoms as well as basic liberties,extensive neg- lect of the interests and agency of women, and worsening threats to our environment and to the sustainability of our economic and social lives. (Sen 1998) In Asia, human development mapping has reflected overall progress over the past two decades. The nine countries have progressed steadily since 1975 in terms of Human Development Index (HDI). Many Asian countries have also experienced dramatic economic growth giving rise to the widespread use of the term \u2018Asian Miracle\u2019.For the past decade or more, it was the Asian dragons that captured the imagination and admiration of the world with their phenomenal GDP growth bordering on 10% annually. Today it is China and India, the two most populous nations, which are leading the Asian economic drive. Yet in many countries in Asia and among sec- tions of the population even in the relatively better off countries, human development con- tinues to pose a significant challenge, blemish- ing otherwise commendable achievements.The persistence of income poverty, hunger, low lev- els of adult literacy, preventable diseases and poor healthcare, as well as significant gender inequalities reiterates the need to place human development at the core of national and inter- national development agendas. At the turn of the century, it became increasing- ly evident that collective action on a global scale would be required to rid the world of the alarm- ing levels of poverty, hunger and deprivation. The historic UN Millennium Summit held in September 2000, where Member States of the United Nations agreed to work together to erad- icate poverty, promote human dignity and equality, achieve peace, democracy and envi- ronmental sustainability. The Millennium Declaration issued at this summit demonstrates the commitment of world leaders to collectively work towards a global partnership for improv- ing the human condition. A concrete contribu- tion of the Declaration was the global consen- sus on the Millennium Development Goals 3 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to which 191 UN Member States have pledged themselves. For the first time in human history, the global community committed itself willingly and voluntarily to an agenda consis- tent with human development through eight specifically identified development goals. The MDGs are a time-bound set of goals, most of which are to be achieved by the year 2015, tak- ing 1990 as the base year (Box 1.1).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "12302b1c-0baf-4c56-a585-ad0660d1e4be": {"__data__": {"id_": "12302b1c-0baf-4c56-a585-ad0660d1e4be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2c61a55c0974b8fa867dd4c64ae3bc8b4135b622a50eb758a4c68427a3c81e88"}, "2": {"node_id": "d90265dc-4496-4316-ad14-8f7e55319ce8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56b6b1413c000c907a0bceb7efebb4f64e5bcf521c08fde76e0a38c424143d6f"}}, "hash": "5d7d562b9b221a7790e24388c5b2d8f21bec6fd749c1c6adaa17de5f937a7197", "text": "Hence the MDG framework is used in this Report to analyse the extent to which ICTs can promote human development.Each of the MDGs has specific tar- gets, totaling 18, to be monitored through 48 specific indicators (Appendix 1).

In Asia, governments are launching ambi- tious ICT infrastructure initiatives, radically changing their policy frameworks on communi- cations and placing ICT applications at the cen- tre of their socio-economic development strate- gies. The Asian region is particularly well placed to harness and strategically deploy ICT for enhancing human development as it not only constitutes one of the fastest growing ICT mar- kets, but also one of the fastest growing regions for ICT industries in the world.However,the digi- tal divide, both between Asian countries and within them, reveals the enormous disparities in ICT access,connectivity and skills.This divide can be a major hurdle in the effective application of ICT for overcoming the human development challenge. This document presents a summary of the research with its key findings.The following sec- tion (Section II) contains a discussion on the state of human development in the nine coun- tries.Section III then tracks the progress of these countries with respect to the MDGs. It is seen that although all the countries do show improvement, human development has been quite varied across the countries.Section IV con- tains a discussion on the potential and promise of ICT for human development and how ICT can break barriers to human knowledge, participa- tion and economic opportunities. A significant long-term impact of ICT lies in the ability of these technologies to expand human capabilities and choices. Section V describes the status of ICT diffusion and use in Asia, high- lighting the rapid growth of the sector in most Asian countries. However, as the next section (Section VI) on the digital divide demonstrates, Asia\u2019s ICT develop- ment reveals deep and widening disparities in ICT diffusion across geographic and social lines. These disparities can exacerbate existing inequalities of opportunities, constituting obstacles to har- nessing ICT for widening choices for all sections of the society. Section VII contains a quantitative exploration of the empirical linkages between ICTs and MDGs for human development.Selected indica- tors were used to construct a set of thematic indices covering five distinct dimensions of ICT availability and use, which were then aggregat- ed into a composite aggregate index capturing ICT-MDG relationships. Two different statistical methods were applied. The nine countries have been ranked based on the two sets of aggregate indices.The rankings by two methods show sim- ilarities at the top and bottom ends demon- strating the robustness of the conclusions, with some interesting reversals in between.The com- posite aggregate indices, given the data limita- tions,are not perfect.Yet they constitute the first attempt that can help in tracking progress by developing countries and ranking them, thus contributing to the debate on the subject. Section VIII provides interesting insights through a systematic exploration of the applica- tion of ICT with respect to each of the MDGs. There is a detailed discussion on specific areas of effective ICT use as well as areas where ICT has relatively limited scope as compared with more direct intervention and service provision.

Success in bringing human develop- ment concerns into ICT applications is likely to be conditioned by the benefits perceived by dif- ferent stakeholders,including governments,civil society organisations, the private sector and individuals. 5 In the 1990s, while human development wit- nessed unprecedented overall progress,including the Asian region, a few regions in the world faced setbacks.The Global Human Development Report 2003 (UNDP 2003) indicates that the HDI had fall- en in 21 out of a sample of 113 countries with com- plete data. It also argued that in some countries the fall in HDI could be attributed to lower incomes and failed economic growth, as also to the spread of HIV/AIDS which lowered life expectancies in many of these countries. Of the 113 countries with data since 1980, only four saw their HDIs decline in the 1980s while 15 saw the declines in the 1990s (UNDP 2003). The Asian region is characterised by improvements in HDI, which is in keeping with the overall trend for developing countries as against the situation observed in Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and sub-Saharan Africa where reversals were observed (Table 2.1). The experiences from the nine coun- tries studied in Asia reflect considerable diversity that can be of great interest as it helps in exploring a variety of circumstances.While showing an over- all improvement trend in the HDI and the individ- ual indicators relevant for human development, countries show enormous variation in values. Starting with income poverty,relevant for human development as it contributes to a reduction of economic inequalities, data from six regions in the world show that both East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia have done much better as compared to the other regions (Table 2.2). In keeping with the overall situation in Asia, human development measurements for the nine countries covered by this Report have gen- erally reflected continued progress over the past two decades or more. All the countries studied,have shown steady progress since 1975 in terms of HDI (Table 2.3).With the exception of Pakistan, all of them are situated in the medium human development category.

Malaysia not only holds the highest HDI rank of 58,out of 175 countries, but it is also the only country among the Asian nations which is close to breaking into the high human development category of countries. Comparing the HDI value for the year 2001 for the nine countries with that calculated for all developing countries put together, India and Pakistan are the only two countries which have values lower than that for all developing countries. Pakistan\u2019s HDI value is lower than the overall HDI value of South Asia. Malaysia, Thailand and Sri Lanka are clearly above the world HDI value.

Table 2.3 Trends in the Human Development Index (HDI) from 1975 to 2001 7 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals Technology Achievement Index (TAI) used in the Global HDR, 2001, on Making New Technologies Work for Human Development. The index aims to capture how well a country is cre- ating and diffusing the technology and building a human skill base \u2014 reflecting capacity to participate in technological innovations. Comparing directly the HDI and TAI rankings, a close regularity may be observed.The two coun- tries on top of the HDI rankings are also those with the best TAI ranks \u2014 Malaysia and Thailand. At the lower end,India is followed by Pakistan in both. Sri Lanka and China change places by one level with a higher HDI rank for Sri Lanka com- pensated with a higher TAI rank for China.While nothing can be firmly inferred about causation, the close correlation between the HDI and TAI ranks is noteworthy. Comparison of critical human development indicators Human development measures across the range of critical indicators like life expectancy at birth, adult literacy rate, combined primary, sec- ondary and tertiary gross enrollment ratio as well as GDP per capita, reveal significant dispar- ities across the nine Asian nations. While coun- tries such as Malaysia, Sri Lanka and China have relatively high values for life expectancy at birth (standing at over 70 years), much higher than the world figure of 66.7 years, Mongolia, India and Pakistan continue to have a ten-year gap with a far lower life expectancy (just over 60 years) ( Table 2.4). While education of users is less relevant for com- munication technologies like radio, TV and tele- phone (the less skill-dependent technologies),it is very relevant for absorption and use of newer computer and internet-related (the more skill- dependent) technologies. Within a country or region ICTs can promote human development better if their applications can counter digital divides and inequalities, rather than exacerbate them.To the extent better-off sections of the pop- ulation are in a superior position to take advantage of the technologies,inequalities will only increase.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b167245-7de6-4eb9-8462-34db62dab1e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b167245-7de6-4eb9-8462-34db62dab1e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b069255bf4dd1a251965e72ed96d55b9e58b7649ebf20944a1f6beef34e588e7"}, "2": {"node_id": "35fab970-2cbb-4155-9857-4f76c0e1968f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79fe7d0fe74555b0c19f62fd307f42acb2058d53abdd6aaaf1f0a952868c1f4e"}}, "hash": "0106c01dea888e9aff430d96c54551724ce3f84d3155d31d0168d8fa81b46011", "text": "Comparing the adult literacy rates, defined as the per centage of literate people aged 15 years and above,the differences in literacy are quite stark.In 2001, while Mongolia achieved close to 100 per cent adult literacy, Pakistan recorded the lowest rate at 44 per cent with India\u2019s figure second from Table 2.4 Human Development Index (HDI) and indicators HDI S.

The other countries have enrollment ratios ranging from 56 per cent (India) to over 60 per cent (China, Indonesia,Mongolia,Sri Lanka and Viet Nam). Finally,the HDI also highlights stark differences in GDP per capita (measured in terms of PPP US$) across the nine nations (Table 2.4).Higher levels of income can contribute to funding not only basic infrastructure like roads, electricity and so on, it can also contribute to funding specialised ICT- related infrastructure.Malaysia has a high GDP per capita of US$ 8,750 which is even higher than the world GDP per capita figure of US$ 7,376,followed by Thailand\u2019s figure of US$ 6,400; there is China with a GDP per capita of US$ 4,020;this is followed by the three countries, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and India,which have a GDP per capita of around US$ 3,000; and finally we have Viet Nam, Pakistan and Mongolia constituting the lower end with GDP per capita at or below US$ 2,000. Human poverty indicators Recent data on human poverty also reveal stark differences among the nine countries (Table 2.5).If one were to consider the data on the probability at birth of people not surviving to age 40, the top three countries with less than 10 per cent of their population in the 2000-05 cohort who will not live till the age of 40 are Malaysia (4.2 per cent), Sri Lanka (5.1 per cent) and China (7.1 per cent). 1 China 7.1 14.2 25 10 16.1 47.3 4.6 26 14.2 2 India 15.3 42.0 16 47 34.7 79.9 28.6 53 33.1 3 Indonesia 10.8 12.7 22 26 7.2 55.4 27.1 33 17.9 4 Malaysia 4.2 12.1 \u2014 18 \ufffd2 9.3 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 5 Mongolia 13.0 1.5 40 13 13.9 50.0 \u2014 36 19.1 6 Pakistan 17.8 56.0 10 38 13.4 65.6 32.6 65 40.2 7 Sri Lanka 5.1 8.1 23 29 6.6 45.4 25.0 34 18.3 8 Thailand 10.2 4.3 16 19d \ufffd2 32.5 13.1 24 12.9 9 Viet Nam 10.7 7.3 23 33 17.7 63.7 \u2014 39 19.9 Source: Global HDR, 2003. * Refers to Human Poverty Index for developing countries. a Data refer to the probability of not surviving to age 40, times 100.

In respect of population without sustainable access to an improved water source, the scenario seems to be reversed with Pakistan coming out on top (10 per cent) followed by India (16 per cent), which perform better than the others. However, India and Pakistan perform poorly in respect of the percentage of children under 5 years of age who are underweight for their age with 47 per cent and 38 per cent, respectively of children being under- weight. A comparison of the poverty percentages show that Malaysia and Thailand have the lowest prevalence of population living below the income poverty line of US$ 1 per day (less than 2 per cent). India is at the bottom (35 per cent) with China, Mongolia,Viet Nam and Pakistan following (13 to 18 per cent). Overall, the data reveal the need to improve living conditions of the people in these countries through improvements in education, healthcare and hygiene,as well as income genera- tion among the poorer sections of the population. Human Poverty Index (denoted as HPI-1 in case of developing countries) ranks of the nine nations reflect a rather poor record and per- formance. Considering that the HPI-1 rank for Malaysia is unavailable, Thailand and China come out on top, with ranks of 24 and 26 out of 94 countries. They are followed by Indonesia (33), Sri Lanka (34), Mongolia (36) and Viet Nam (39) whose rankings are almost successive in this scale.India,which is ranked 53,and Pakistan ranked a distant 65 on the HPI-1, are again the laggards in the fight against human poverty. The gender divide factor Equitable human development cannot be achieved without addressing gender divides in the development equation. Women are key agents of development and equal participation of women in the decision-making process is an essential precondition to development in all its dimensions. In order to bridge the digital divides, it is essential that the existing gender inequalities be addressed. Unfortunately, one of the weak aspects of human development in Asia remains the wide gender gaps.Referring to the Gender-related Development Index (GDI) of the nine countries in this study (Table 2.6),it can be seen that the life expectancy for females is the lowest in Pakistan at 60.3 years, worse than the male figure of 60.6 years. This difference becomes more significant when compared to the other countries in the study, where female life expectancy exceeds male life expectancy, as is the case for almost all countries in the world. The highest life expectancy for females among the nine countries is seen in Sri Lanka at 75.5 years, closely followed by Malaysia at 75.3 years. A comparison of male-female literacy rates shows dismal figures for Pakistan and India,fol- lowed by China with high male-female gaps. In Pakistan the female literacy rate is only 28.8 per cent, a whopping 29.4 per cent behind the male literacy rate.Except Mongolia,in no coun- try does female literacy exceeds that of males. The combined school enrollment ratio also brings out male-female gaps, with Pakistan at the bottom followed by India, while the gaps are much narrower in the other countries. In fact, Mongolia actually has a reverse gap with female enrollment figures significantly exceed- ing those of males (perhaps a reflection of the privatisation of ownership of animals, that con- tributed to male children taking up herding). Similarly male-female gaps are seen in earned incomes. With regard to the proportion of seats in the national parliament that are held by women, an important indicator used in the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), Sri Lanka has the lowest per centage (only 4.4 per cent of parlia- mentary seats are held by women), followed by Indonesia, India and Thailand. At the upper end Viet Nam is a clear leader with 27.3 per cent of par- liamentary seats held by women followed by China and Pakistan (Table 2.7). Thus, while Asian nations have made considerable progress in their overall human development record,many critical challenges continue to impede progress. Lack of access to basic education and healthcare,stark socio-economic disparities,poverty prevalence,deep gender divides constitute some of the persistent obstacles to human development. While the diversity of experience in Asia provides a rich canvas for an exploration of linkages between human development and ICT, pre-existing dispari- ties among different sections of the population can aggravate inequalities of opportunity caused by the growing use of ICT.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be7b568d-b2b7-418f-88c2-040c2f10d693": {"__data__": {"id_": "be7b568d-b2b7-418f-88c2-040c2f10d693", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94957c7a20a3a46aadefb8a54f47b951adbc0d0dd41b06a344e88a3529b1e6a0"}, "2": {"node_id": "b9a935a5-f1d8-4895-a564-4b8dcac4b09e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f1369819fe1e24625e6b518394c235525203ecc8b82d6590857dbd6b431f3fe"}}, "hash": "cc19348cae733da9356c87ec713e96f96ef940e8d344a752c2dd7040877ea809", "text": "For ICT to contribute to the widening of choices for human development, this concern needs to be addressed. 10 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals Value", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c14b8ab1-a8a4-449c-84e1-80707e72c595": {"__data__": {"id_": "c14b8ab1-a8a4-449c-84e1-80707e72c595", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1842c13220c0d924a66c753fa6b63b74a17f7c97aeede8c4cd3c8c0be22c9eab"}, "3": {"node_id": "a23b1a45-1871-4ecf-8ce6-0915112bba0f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f171a0c5cb5900757d5e71c3c6788131fb9363b72b110e130340a31722e766d"}}, "hash": "2758d7225c82a508f5462a88da8dde38d9cad75d4c8330d87a10f7316277aa2f", "text": "Rank (out of 70 countries) 1 China 21.8 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 2 India 9.3 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 3 Indonesia 8.0 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 4 Malaysia 14.5 20d 45d 0.47 0.503 45 5 Mongolia 10.5 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 6 Pakistan 20.6 9d 26d 0.32 0.414 58 7 Sri Lanka 4.4 4 49 0.50 0.272 67 8 Thailand 9.6 27d 55d 0.61 0.457 55 9 Viet Nam 27.3 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Source: Global HDR, 2003. a Data are as of 1 March 2003.Where there are lower and upper houses,data refer to the weighted average of women\u2019s share of seats in both houses. b Data refer to the most recent year available during the period 1992-2001.

Apart from being globally accepted commitments,con- sistent with human development in poor coun- tries, they also recognise the responsibility of the developed countries to support development initiatives in the poorest nations of the world. While not perfect, the MDGs cover a majority of the most critical development challenges. These include a wide range of interrelated issues each of which cannot be addressed in isolation.Beginning with the eradication of poverty and hunger, the MDGs deal with education (achieving universal primary education), healthcare (eradicating major diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria as well as reducing child mortality and improving maternal health), gender equality (empowerment of women), environmental sustainability and creat- ing global partnerships for development.

These assessments which have tracked the per- formance of countries in terms of MDG progress clearly show that there are remarkable dispari- ties between and within regions, with human development reversals noted in some cases (sub-Saharan Africa, Central and Eastern Europe and the CIS). Interestingly, most countries in the Asian region, including South Asia which has some of the poorest countries (HDR,2003),show advances. These findings highlight the difficulties for many, if not most of the countries, of attaining their MDG targets. While East Asia and the Pacific on the whole has made remarkable progress in its attempt to halve income poverty and is well on track towards the goals of reduc- ing hunger and achieving universal primary education, at its current rate of progress it will still not be able to meet the MDG targets for gender equality, reducing child mortality and providing sustainable access to improved water sources and sanitation by the year 2015. South Asia needs to make significant progress in almost all areas if it is to achieve its MDG targets. While it has made remarkable progress in reduc- ing income poverty and is likely to succeed in halving the number of people who live on less than US$ 1 a day by the year 2015, it lags far behind in the reduction of hunger and will be III Asia\u2019s March Towards the Millennium Development Goals 12 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals able to reach its target in this area only after 2100. South Asia is \u2018on track\u2019for only two indica- tors \u2014 reducing poverty and providing sustain- able access to improved water sources. At its current rate of progress, South Asia will fail to reach the other goals by 2015; for example, the goals of achieving universal primary education, gender equality and reducing child mortality are expected to be reached long after 2020. Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger This goal relates to the most basic resources that people require, which are enough income for subsistence and access to sufficient food of a minimum quality in terms of nutrition. According to the Economic and Social Commission for the Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and UNDP regional MDG report titled,Promoting the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP 2003), countries in the Asia-Pacific region have made very good progress with regard to the first target of halving the propor- tion of people whose income is less than US$ 1 a day.Between the early and late 1990s,the overall incidence of poverty declined from 34 to 24 per cent. Although this left an estimated 768 million people living on less than a dollar a day, it repre- sented striking progress in this region (ESCAP 2003). According to the Global HDR, 2002, con- sidering the indicator for the second target,\u2018per- centage of undernourished people\u2019,six out of the nine countries are \u2018on track\u2019. India is \u2018far behind\u2019 the target, while Mongolia is categorised as \u2018slip- ping back\u2019. Data are not available for Malaysia (Table 3.1).

In addition, families have even less incentive to send their children to school when the schools may be poorly equipped or staffed. Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women The crucial target for this goal is the elimination of gender disparity in primary and secondary education, preferably by 2005, and at all levels of education no later than 2015.In terms of primary education, there is still some way to go in the Asia-Pacific region. In almost all the countries here, there are moderate or significant gender disparities. However, the case of China leads one to be optimistic: although in the late 1990s there was a moderate disparity, with an enrollment ratio of girls to boys placed at 0.92, by 2000 the situation was reversed, with more girls than boys enrolled (ESCAP 2003). Based on available data it is observed that countries have performed mod- estly in terms of female gross primary enrollment ratios for both primary and secondary education. The performance of China and India reveals a wider gender gap in secondary than in primary education (Tables 3.4 and 3.5).While China is \u2018on track\u2019,India is rated as \u2018far behind\u2019in maintaining gender equality. In the case of Pakistan and Thailand data are not available. The most strik- ing case is Mongolia, where there are far more girls enrolled than boys, with the enrollment ratio of girls to boys being 1.11. This could be related to the privatisation of ownership of ani- mals, when more boys took to herding. China has room for improvement in this category although the ratio rose from 0.71 in the early 1990s to 0.82 in the late 1990s (ESCAP 2003).

Data on the proportion of women who are actively involved in wage employment in the non-agricultural sector are scarce.The available data suggest that the proportion of women is 15 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals on the rise. By the late 1990s, the share of women had reached 16 per cent in India, 39 per cent in China and 46 per cent in Sri Lanka.2 Less satisfactory though is the participation of women in decision-making at the national par- liamentary level: this is typically below 10 per cent in most developing Asian countries. A notable exception is Viet Nam, where the pro- portion of women in the national parliament has increased significantly from 18 per cent in the early 1990s to 26 per cent in the late 1990s.3 Goal 4: Reduce child mortality The target for this goal is to reduce the mortali- ty rate of children under the age of five years by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. ESCAP (ESCAP 2003) has rated progress for this goal as slow, with most countries in the Asia-Pacific region missing the target and lacking renewed efforts. The majority of children who die before they reach their fifth birthday, die from disease or from a combination of malnutrition and pre- ventable diseases such as diarrhoea and measles. Of the nine countries, Indonesia, Malaysia,Sri Lanka and Thailand are categorised as \u2018on track\u2019, while India and Viet Nam are \u2018lag- ging\u2019. Pakistan, with its under-five mortality rate at 109 per 1000 live births in 2001,is \u2018far behind\u2019 its 2015 target of 42 per 1,000 live births.4 China is also similarly placed (Table 3.6). Goal 5: Improve maternal health The target for this goal is to reduce the maternal mortality rate by three-quarters between 1990 and 2015. Across the Asia-Pacific region, it is still common for women to die of childbirth-related circumstances.In addition,pregnancy and child- birth can aggravate micronutrient deficiencies such as anaemia.Teen pregnancies due to early marriage, inadequate child spacing and high parity births combined with deliveries at the hands of untrained birth attendants, poor hygiene, all contribute to avoidable maternal mortality.In many Asian countries where women have a low stating,the ability of women to nego- tiate for control over their own bodies even with- in marriage cannot be taken for granted. Data for this MDG is difficult to obtain, because estimating maternal mortality rates requires cur- rent information on the number of deaths of women of reproductive age and the cause of death. Registration systems needed for such information gathering are inadequate in most countries in the Asia-Pacific region.With the lack of reliable data,the tracking of trends in maternal mortality rates becomes a formidable challenge.

The second target is to halt the spread of malar- ia by 2015,and achieving the reversal of the inci- dence of malaria and other major diseases. The need to curb the spread of malaria has gained urgency recently, due to the malarial parasite developing drug resistance and insecticides becoming less effective in controlling mosqui- toes. Another serious concern is the spread of tuberculosis. For example, the prevalence rate of 335 per 100,000 people in Indonesia, in the year 2000, provides cause for concern. In South-East Asia alone, there are around 3 mil- lion cases a year (WHO 2003). The HDR, 2002 assessment does not have data on categoris- ing countries under this goal. Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability The first target for this goal is the integration of the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programmes,and reversal of the loss of environmental resources. Defore- station,industrial pollution,domestic wood burn- ing and human waste are among the numerous ways by which environmental degradation occurs in Asia. Reforestation in some instances has been helpful; for example, forest cover in China and Viet Nam appears to have increased slightly, between 1990 and 2000.5 However, loss- es in forestry continue to occur in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. While legisla- tion is usually adequate, enforcement in remote areas poses a great challenge to the authorities, and is complicated by corruption.ESCAP has rated the progress for this target in the Asia-Pacific region as poor so far,with few countries giving this target sufficient attention (ESCAP2003). The next target is to halve,by 2015,the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drink- ing water.Urban water coverage is 93 per cent and rural coverage is 75 per cent for Asia (Kataoka 2002). Thus, the most serious problems regarding clean water access can be found in the rural areas, where millions of people lack water from protect- ed sources.There has been some progress in cer- tain countries;for example,in India,rural coverage went up from 61 per cent in 1990 to 79 per cent in 2000. However, based on current trends, it is likely that the region as a whole will miss the target.6 Sri Lanka is the only country that has \u2018achieved\u2019 the target while China is rated as \u2018far behind\u2019 and Viet Nam is \u2018lagging\u2019 in terms of population using improved water sources (Table 3.7). Assessments in Asia\u2019s march towards achieving the various MDGs indicate a mixed and varied performance. Countries like Malaysia, Thailand and even China show significant progress and are \u2018on track\u2019 to achieve most of the goals and targets. Sri Lanka\u2019s performance with reference to most of the goals and targets is also com- mendable. Pakistan, India and Mongolia lag behind the other six countries in almost all the MDGs, while Indonesia stands between the suc- cessful countries and the laggards with a very mixed overall record.

Information and knowledge are expanding in quantity and accessibility. In many fields future decision-makers will be presented with unprecedented new tools for development. In such fields as agriculture, health, education, human resources and environmental management, or transport and business development, the conse- quences could be really quite revolutionary.

It is also more practical, environmentally sound and less expensive than all earlier forms of technology. Harnessing technological change for human development can happen in several ways. Advances in medicine, agriculture, energy, com- munications,etc.can directly build human capa- bilities through improvement in health,longevi- ty, knowledge and greater participation in social, economic and political life. It can also expand human choices through productivity gains and increase in income. Human capabili- ties in turn, through creative application of edu- cation, can trigger further technological change which can be harnessed for building human capabilities and expanding choices (Figure 4.1). Figure 4.1 Harnessing technology for human development The literature on the role of ICT in promoting economic development is rich in terms of empirical rigour and diversity of opinions, despite having a short history (Brynjolfsson & Hitt 1996, Lehr & Lichtenberg 2003). The final report of the Digital Opportunities Task Force (DOT Force 2001) has highlighted the transfor- mational impact of ICT by examining over three hundred ICTs for development initiatives from around the world.

IV ICT for Enhancing Human Development: Potential and Promise 18 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals empirical evidence to illustrate the role of ICTs in generating new economic opportunities, deliv- ering improved healthcare and education, pro- moting sustainable environmental manage- ment, fostering democratic governance by empowering people and organisations, and making government processes more efficient and transparent. Although such studies have suggested a posi- tive impact of ICT on income and employment growth, most of them pertain to developed countries {Oliner & Sichel,2000;Javala & Pahjola, 2002; Dewan & Kraemer (forthcoming)}. In the case of developing countries where non-ICT investments tend to have a higher pay-off than ICT investments, a positive relationship is either weak or absent. In view of this, scholars have argued that growth of ICT should not become a \u2018techno-quick-fix\u2019 for solving development problems as there may be unacceptable trade- offs with MDGs in less-developed countries (Wilde 2003). They believe,\u201cWe are only begin- ning to understand how the application of ICTs relates to the achievement of social goals and economic growth and there are serious doubts whether the benefits truly outweigh the costs.\u201d Proponents of the view that ICTs have powerful positive impact on human development have argued that harnessing the power of ICTs and ushering in of a \u2018digital revolution\u2019can transform production processes, commerce, government and education and create new forms of eco- nomic growth that will benefit all sections of the population. Furthermore, these can contribute to the realisation of social goals through greater dissemination of health and reproductive infor- mation, training of medical personnel and teachers, equitable access to education and training facilities, opening up of opportunities for women and expanding the scope for citizen participation.Taking a sample of 37 developing countries, one study (Baliamoune 2002) estab- lishes that ICTs have a strong positive effect on the process of socio-economic development, provided that governments create and maintain a conducive, enabling environment. Technological innovations in the information and communication sectors are seen to affect human development in several tangible ways.In this study, the development effects of ICT are explored through three channels: i) ICT as a sec- tor of economic activity; ii) ICT as an enabler or input for enhancing human productivity;and iii) ICT directly influencing human development through access to information, knowledge and enlarging choices. First,and this is perhaps where the impact of ICT is immediately visible, is the contribution of the ICT sector to the overall economic growth of a nation or even to the global economy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af48a308-8bf7-458e-a5a3-245366d1c961": {"__data__": {"id_": "af48a308-8bf7-458e-a5a3-245366d1c961", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd47538bd60206fa04dc947a32a530cfe27c340b39fa4fe71b211c7f31a28caa"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9e90061-ec84-430c-8a23-4925ae6dff39", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "58dc0777a7a8afb3a545084b809068ae9ac512dbe2a28cd1b2cc653290f0b122"}}, "hash": "58ad75a991dc9a525f6acfa53358be7f3c79b745151fc4e32a0e9e88f82c947c", "text": "Global spending on information and communications technology is projected to grow from US$2.2 trillion in 1999 to US$ 3 trillion in by 2003.7 The ICT sector and industry have witnessed unprecedented growth in the past decade.

In 1998, the contribution of the ICT industry to world economic growth was 14.7 per cent, and actually exceeded 25 per cent in view of a decreased value of products and serv- ices. In 1999, the merger and acquisition trans- action in the global information industry amounted to up to $1 trillion, with an average annual growth of 200 per cent. Second, ICT enhances the process of human development through productivity gains that it generates in every sector. The pervasive poten- tial impact of ICT emerges from its being used as control technology, leading to innovations in products and processes in the manufacturing sectors and resource extraction industries. It plays a critical role in computational activities supporting scientific and technological research and in the network of communication research and development and business activity around the world (Mansell & Wehn 1998). At this level, however, quantitative assessment of the impact of ICT becomes difficult as it is so embedded and integrated in all industrial and services sectors. The problem lies in isolating and then quantifying actual contributions made by ICTs themselves. ICTs have in fact become indispensable ingredients in all forms and processes of economic activity ranging from stock inventories, product and service informa- tion,marketing,manufacturing and design.They have become a vital component of national and international business transactions, stock mar- ket information, international trade and global currency markets. 19 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals Third, and perhaps most significant, the long- term impact of ICT lies in its ability to directly expand human choices through increased access to information and knowledge. ICT derives its significance in the development equation from being one of the most important purveyors of knowledge. Knowledge plays a critical role in people\u2019s ability to process, inter- pret, evaluate and deploy information in their own context and in the pursuit of their own interests. Knowledge empowers individuals, organisations and communities by providing them with choices far beyond those that may be available to them otherwise.These choices gen- erate opportunities for increased participation \u2014 economically,socially,politically and cultural- ly. ICT enables this flow of knowledge across geographical,political,economic and social bor- ders thereby breaking earlier forms of knowl- edge monopoly which led to the exclusion of large sections of the world\u2019s population. ICT breaks barriers to human development in at least three ways not possible before or with other forms of technology: Breaking barriers to human knowledge Access to information and education are indis- pensable in building human capabilities. The internet and other ICTs are increasingly becom- ing their key delivery mechanisms to sections of the population which did not have access to educational infrastructure and content. Moreover, these new delivery mechanisms pro- vide access to global and diversified sources of information and educational content, thereby enhancing dramatically the quality of educa- tional inputs that are available to even the most remote and deprived populations. ICTs are also being actively used in promoting life-long learn- ing and continued education as well as reinte- grating unemployed people into the workforce through re-education and retooling of skills. Women and other excluded groups stand to benefit particularly from this. Breaking barriers to participation The world has witnessed innovative uses of the internet and other ICTs in enhancing political par- ticipation as well as in bringing about greater transparency and accountability.In many parts of Asia, where the mass media have been and con- tinue to be strictly controlled by governments, the internet has offered a new medium of politi- cal mobilisation and participation. In Malaysia, the emergence of alternative news and online websites such as Malaysiakini have provided a channel for opposition groups and parties as well as critics of the government to express dissent, thereby creating a new space for political debate and expression. In India, Tehelka.com, an inves- tigative journalism website,broke news of a high level defense scandal involving senior defense officials of the government who were caught accepting bribes in exchange for giving out defense contracts. These internet and ICT based news and information groups have contributed to the creation of a more vibrant public sphere. They increase social, political, economic and cul- tural participation which enhances networking and social mobilisation and can drive govern- ments to become accountable and transparent (Banerjee 2003). Breaking barriers to economic opportunity Since the ICT sector requires less initial invest- ment than the more traditional sectors of indus- trial activity,it lowers the barriers to entry into the economy for people who could", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b1835c4-3616-4f60-ad47-9afc41badbfd": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b1835c4-3616-4f60-ad47-9afc41badbfd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2fbb6dddde69e3dd14c19b457096a71e5948613d167446f45dbc0ffee242c030"}, "3": {"node_id": "aa5535ab-efe7-4f33-9c3f-88f4048f778e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14bf1b21f028c15e0a1180a60f36ea5510a0fee754a31568a9355e211386aafe"}}, "hash": "39bcb952b02c5c191ffc7a27d168ea3418ed4f89e051efc3ee8361c5570264fc", "text": "never break into the industrial sector. ICT provides new and unprecedented opportunities to people who have proficiency in handling ICT tools and have an idea or service to sell. This was undoubtedly one of the underlying forces of the dotcom boom. This is what helped people with ICT skills in countries like India,China and Malaysia to over- come the traditional barriers to employment and wealth creation by joining the computer soft- ware industry or related ICT industries. ICT has also created new outsourcing opportunities whereby services are provided in one country and delivered to another country.The global out- sourcing market is worth more than US$ 100 mil- lion and provides an array of opportunities to Asian countries with their high-skill ICT proficien- cies and relatively cheap labour. In addition, ICT, through the creation of call and transcription centres, has led to new economic opportunities for large sections of the Asian population. These new avenues of employment have particularly benefited the underprivileged sections;for exam- ple, in India, women constitute a large section of the workforce in call and transcription centres. 20 Asian nations are well placed to leverage the use of ICT for socio-economic and human development. In just over a decade, several Asian nations have emerged as global leaders in terms of ICT use and penetration.Telephone, personal computer (PC) ownership and internet access are spreading rapidly, pushed by grow- ing government support through pro-ICT poli- cies and regulations as well as much lower start-up costs compared to what developed countries experienced initially. Asian popula- tions are also increasingly spending more and more on ICT.Expenditures for ICT,which include external8 and internal9 spending on informa- tion technology, are on the increase for some Asian countries (Table 5.1). In all countries where data were available (except Indonesia), ICT expenditure is seen to have increased both in absolute terms and as a share of GDP between 1995 and 2001.The extent of increase has varied, with a high absolute increase of around 227 per cent in China and a low increase of a little over six per cent in Thailand.India also shows a remarkable increase, more than dou- bling its ICT expenditure over this period. Indonesia is the only country that actually experienced a decline of a little over 18 per cent. In terms of GDP shares the variations recorded are less, with all countries showing increases including, interestingly, Indonesia.

With regard to wireless communication,although the possibilities are endless, it is the relative advantage (the degree to which it is perceived to be better than what it supersedes) and the com- patibility (consistency with existing values, past experiences and needs) which are critical factors for its adoption. For example, in geographically difficult regions, while the relative advantage of wireless communication is significant, actual adoption could face obstacles of limited past experience, exposure, cost, etc. Currently the biggest barrier to wireless internet access is band- width and speed. Sending data to and from a mobile device is still tedious;users are not inclined to send mile-long emails via their mobile phones. In most developing countries, where even basic communication infrastructure is a problem, mobile telephony is proving to be a boon. Operators no longer have to invest heavily in hardware and in countries where laying land- lines is a difficult process, user rates of mobile telephony are on the increase. In 2001, China\u2019s SMS revenues totaled US$ 234 million and as diffusion spreads exponentially,revenue is set to triple every year. In Mongolia, all aimags, or provinces, (except for Huvsgul) are connected with microwave digital lines, with some aimags having satellite connections. In terms of internet penetration in Asia, the International Telecommunications Union esti- mated that in 2001,Asia-Pacific had over 160 mil- lion internet users with a penetration rate of 460 users per 10,000 inhabitants (Table 5.4).Amongst the nine Asian countries, China leads with a little over 59 million users, followed by India with a lit- tle under 17 million users. However, in respect of number of users per 10,000 inhabitants, it is Malaysia that emerges on top,with a penetration rate of 3197, well above the Asia-Pacific average. The other eight countries are all well below this rate, with Thailand coming in second at around 776.The lowest penetration rates are observed in Pakistan and Sri Lanka,with a little over 100 users per 10,000 inhabitants. With respect to personal computer (PC) penetra- tion, Malaysia leads the nine countries with 14.7 PCs per 100 inhabitants.All the others have single digit PC penetration rates.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c97043be-a3a4-4a3f-9f0c-87a61e978e3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c97043be-a3a4-4a3f-9f0c-87a61e978e3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85c60a36bff44c03d208c9db5d73b43fc19f134d6ec237b61a67a50628cd3265"}, "2": {"node_id": "464b872a-a2ca-40d9-88a0-5a6b9cb44f5f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f797de2fcd6c5c245a8af8a9aae5b41fe9f5c51816bdb64334ad6bb0b7ab510"}}, "hash": "1929c1471635e4c74a9f22757a10d1f599c7756799fee481e6ebcfb98fdf7f9e", "text": "In fact, Pakistan, India and Viet Nam are at the bottom,with the PC pen- etration rate below one per 100 inhabitants.Data on internet hosts per 10,000 inhabitants reveals a similar picture.

There were also many whose lives were being nega- tively affected by their exclusion from the glob- al information society or by the social or eco- nomic dislocations that can accompany the impact of ICT. The term \u2018digital divide\u2019 denotes the disparity in the adoption of ICT by different sections of the society. In spite of the commendable efforts by many Asian governments, ICT diffusion and use has followed existing socio-economic, gender and urban-rural divides.Digital divide is a reflec- tion of existing broader socio-economic inequalities. It is urgent to reinstate human development at the core of ICT initiatives in Asia to avert widening of the digital divide and pre- vent the exclusion and marginalisation of cer- tain sections of the population in the develop- ing world (Mansell & Wehn 1998). Factors in digital divide Digital divide can be assessed by examining indi- cators like penetration, cost, technology acheive- ment,network readiness,socio-economic factors, locally relevant content and appropriate policy regime. These factors influence the ability to derive economic and social benefits from infor- mation-intensive activities (DOT Force 2001).

Thus the digital divide in terms of internet penetration clearly persists across regions. This is significant because the United States and high-income OECD countries constitute just 19 per cent of the world population. With regard to PC penetration,the digital divide is clear (Table 5.4) across the nine Asian coun- tries. Putting this in a global context, enormous digital divides across regions of the world also exist in respect of both PC and internet penetra- tion (Table 6.2). Cost Cost considerations are a critical factor in the digital divide.The poor are already hampered by social factors such as low education and unfa- miliarity with technology. Adding the burden of high cost of access to ICT services only serves to deepen the digital divide.Unfortunately,users in countries which are in the early stages of ICT development encounter higher cost of access as companies have to factor in capital costs as well as a lower user", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fe42b0a-d259-4df0-be44-f54e3b2738df": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fe42b0a-d259-4df0-be44-f54e3b2738df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3138bb2f8f332d0b93bebb8d8c294742203e0c142fd757c0df5540b7dc9ced0c"}, "3": {"node_id": "76d274bc-c377-437c-bc5d-d0b099cc02b0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "81facc8dc46f414f1df0e2411898d657309c7dcce51d11592b0255729b88d363"}}, "hash": "1f6bb578dace6e601f41ffbf62f254643b3032e16dc3c98e83a36c8e0bce21f0", "text": "base.Data on internet retail pric- ing reveals enormous usage cost differences across countries (Figure 6.1 & Table 6.3).

Particularly striking is the case of Cambodia,where the total cost of internet usage per 30 hours stands at an exceptional high of US$ 123.60.At the other end of the spectrum, better off countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand face costs for comparable services ranging between US$15 and US$ 23, well below the average. There is also a relationship between the number of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in these countries and the retail prices faced by users (Table 6.3). The countries with higher retail prices have far fewer ISPs as compared with the countries with relatively lower retail prices. Within each country also, cost differences exac- erbate the digital divide. According to the Mongolia country study associated with this Report the price of internet connections has been dropping overall. An hourly rate of US$ 0.60 in internet cafes makes access more afford- able for citizens who have no computer at home or in the office,in the urban area of Ulaan Baatar. Unfortunately, for users in rural aimags, dial-up connections are costly since phone calls cost US$ 0.20 per minute. In comparison, phone calls cost only US$ 0.06 per minute in Ulaan Baatar. Therefore the only alternative in rural aimags are the internet caf\u00e9s at the local post and telecom- munication offices, which charge rates of US$ 0.45 to US$ 0.60 per minute. In another example from India, it cost the state government of Maharastra US$ 600,000 to wire up 70 contiguous villages in the districts of Kolhapur and Sangli. With 550,000 villages across India, the cost of wiring every single vil- lage in the country would work out at US$ 4.7 billion, far beyond the ability of even the most capable government administration. The Malaysian government has allocated US$ 290 million in its Eighth Malaysia Plan to bridge the digital divide among its citizens,underlining the role of the state in reducing such inequali- ties. However Malaysia has also given some companies a Multimedia Super Corridor status which entitles them to financial incentives such as no income tax for up to 10 years or an invest- ment tax allowance with no duties on the import of multimedia equipment. While this provides incentives for companies to establish themselves in the Malaysian technopole, it can have the unintended effect of further privileg- ing the larger business enterprises. Hardware and software costs Another area of concern is the cost of hardware. While tariff and excise duty reduction has helped bring down the cost of ICT equipment,it still is unaffordable from the point of view of providing IT to the masses.One such initiative in India aims to reduce hardware costs by simplify- ing the equipment as well as its usage. The Simputer was designed in 2001 as a simple, easy-to-use and inexpensive device with multi- lingual software, aimed at providing hardware access to a large number of poor users at low cost. Priced at less than US$ 200, it is currently being produced in small prototype batches and is being field-tested in selected ICT for develop- ment projects.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76d274bc-c377-437c-bc5d-d0b099cc02b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "76d274bc-c377-437c-bc5d-d0b099cc02b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3138bb2f8f332d0b93bebb8d8c294742203e0c142fd757c0df5540b7dc9ced0c"}, "2": {"node_id": "0fe42b0a-d259-4df0-be44-f54e3b2738df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f6bb578dace6e601f41ffbf62f254643b3032e16dc3c98e83a36c8e0bce21f0"}}, "hash": "81facc8dc46f414f1df0e2411898d657309c7dcce51d11592b0255729b88d363", "text": "It is widely accepted that initial software costs and costs of upgrading software can be sub- stantial if ICT for development projects depend Country Total Number of ISPs Number of ISPs cost (licensed) (operational) Singapore 15.38 44 NA Malaysia 17.63 18 NA Thailand 22.93 18 18 Indonesia 26.90 150 60 Philippines 30.43 150 50 Viet Nam 37.88 5 4 Laos 44.96 2 2 Cambodia 123.60 3 3 Source: International Telecommunication Union, 2001 Table 6.3 Internet retail pricing and number of ISPs in selected Asian countries in the year 2001 26 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals Asia\u2019s", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69cb4123-10d0-4e59-a2e9-4bae4bce069e": {"__data__": {"id_": "69cb4123-10d0-4e59-a2e9-4bae4bce069e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04171daf714472d90afa45cd17d95e930e6423414a9d43248fdf05a59abedf33"}, "3": {"node_id": "66d359e9-62d8-4ff7-8bfa-4e29f0a26914", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bd52d12ed9eb69083fe59b31892c524082e65010e1ea78181f5c4dc99ec11077"}}, "hash": "4f6a45331c18a5c85506860316534f4ac1743ecdff060d68600a177132e203cd", "text": "development and divide in the ICT sector has also been captured by several recent e-readi- ness assessments. E-readiness has been defined by the Harvard Centre for International Development as the potential of a community to participate in ICT developments. Two bench- marks of e-readiness have emerged \u2014 the Technology Achievement Index (TAI) (UNDP 2001) and the Networked Readiness Index (NRI).10 TAI was first used by the UNDP in the Human Development Report 2001.The index meas- ures \u201chow well a country is creating and diffusing technology and building a human skill base, reflecting capacity to participate in the technological innovations of the network age\u201d (UNDP 2001). TAI focuses on four dimensions of technological capacity to make up the TAI value: cre- ation of technology, diffusion of recent innovations, diffusion of old innovations, and human skills.TAI categorises countries into four levels: \u2022 Leaders (TAI above 0.5) \u2014 countries at the cutting edge of technological innovation;high achievements in technology creation, diffusion and skills. \u2022 Potential Leaders (TAI 0.35 \u2013 0.49) \u2014 countries with investments in high levels of human skills; wide diffusion of old technologies but limited innovations; skill levels comparable to leaders. \u2022 Dynamic Adopters (TAI 0.20 \u2013 0.34) \u2014 countries with dynamic uses of new technology; higher skills than fourth group; with important high-technology industries and technolo- gy hubs; slow and incomplete diffusion of old inventions. \u2022 Marginalised (TAI below 0.20) \u2014 technology diffusion and skill building have a long way to go; large sections of the population not benefited from old technologies. Box 6.1 Measures of e-readiness capturing inter-country digital divides solely on proprietary software.There is a gather- ing momentum in the open source software movement,promoting a more equitable and fair pricing. This has generated some interesting debates regarding \u2018open source\u2019 and \u2018free\u2019 soft- ware, often leading to confusion. Most valuable for lowering costs and maximising diffusion is software where the source code has been made easily acceptable for programmers and users to modify the software as required. The attraction of open source software lies in the fact that its use by government and a large public could encourage local software professionals to pro- vide software support in the form of add-on applications that are written at a cost much smaller than that required to buy multi-featured packaged software. This would decentralise software production, challenging the large transnational producers of packaged and bun- dled software, who have been able to convert the software industry from a service industry to one of large-scale manufacturing, thus worsen- ing digital divides. Recently the government of the state of Madhya Pradesh in India publicly announced its decision to use the well-known open source Linux soft- ware in its official IT programme, which includes its e-governance (Gyandoot) and computer- enabled school education (Headstart) initiatives. This is in keeping with trends in other develop- ing countries including China and many in Latin America like Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Peru. In Asia,as per TAI,Japan,Korea and Singapore are the only countries in the leader category (Table 6.4). The digital divide across countries is again evident, with only one country among the nine, Malaysia, being categorised as potential leader with a TAI value of 0.396 and ranked 30 out of the 72 countries ranked. China, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand come under the dynamic adopter category,while Pakistan is marginalised. Categorisation was not possible in the cases of Mongolia and Viet Nam as satisfactory data was not available; this itself probably reflects even lower levels of technology adoption. The NRI framework for 2002\u20132003 takes into account more than ICT use in the economy: it also incorporates factors that contribute towards the use of ICT for a nation\u2019s develop- ment.

At the other end of the scale, Viet Nam (71) and Indonesia (64) are the least network-ready countries. Pakistan and Mongolia do not feature in this ranking due to data limitations. Socio-economic factors and the digital divide The digital divide is not limited to issues of penetration,costs of access,hardware and soft- ware and e-readiness. Increasingly recognised as more fundamental factors are the social, economic, cultural and locational disparities, which lead to further cumulative inequalities. The interdependence among these factors deepen and widen the digital divide, impeding the effective use of ICT for human develop- ment. In Asia, male-female gaps, urban-rural disparities, special disabilities faced by remote and indigenous populations, inter-genera- tional gaps, all create sizeable obstacles to ICT absorption and use. ICTs have a requirement of specific skill and that comes in the way of its adoption by the under- privileged groups and regions. For example, in less-developed countries, legal and administra- tive structures that have been considered impor- tant for providing equitable access to all sections of the population are yet to be institutionalised. Even when these structures are in place, difficul- ties in implementation can negate their effec- tiveness for human development,strengthening the position of economic and political elites vis- a-vis others.These elites have larger resources at their command to own or access the technology, can acquire the necessary skills easily due to their higher levels of secondary and tertiary edu- cation and can establish links through ICT with other productive and social sectors for appropri- ating new facilities and opportunities. Content The information and communication revolua- tion can bypass the disadvantaged popula- tion groups if there is inadequate attention to developing locally relevant content. Issues of poverty, inequality and exclusion cannot be addressed if content does not address real life problems for these groups. For example, infor- mation on health that focuses on tackling lifestyle diseases like obesity, is of little use in a situation of poverty and starvation.

Rural develpment issues are harder to address if the content is not in local language and idiom. Policy Appropriate policy regimes can also influence digital divide. Policies can influence content, access, competition, availability and spread of infrastructure, etc. Choices guiding ICT initiatives in Asia are often driven by economic and commercial interests and the gloss around the technology obscures social choices about how to computerise or communicate and the ways in which different forms of computerisation or communication advance different values (Mody 1999).The guid- ing of ICT initiatives in Asia is also driven by gov- ernmental agendas such as political interest, social policy and military security, not always consistent with promoting human develop- ment.

Table 6.5 Network Readiness Index (NRI) of selected Asian countries 29 Role of ICT in promoting MDGs has been a point of debate among planners, policy mak- ers, researchers and others. Many consider ICT to be the only possible means of achieving MDGs through technological leapfrogging. An equally vociferous view, on the other hand, is that ICT is of no great value and could even be detrimental to the less-developed world, par- ticularly for populations that are economically and socially underprivileged. Indeed, the impact of ICT in a country or a region depends on its nature, the purpose of its deployment and spatial spread, besides the economic, administrative and social environment back- ing up the strategy of its diffusion. In this con- text, assembling empirical evidence on the impact of ICT on human development is of key importance. Objectives To assess empirically the linkages between ICT linked services and their contribution towards achievement of MDGs for human development in Asia, an empirical study was undertaken to: \u2022 Identify ICT indicators that articulate the key concerns for human development and MDGs; \u2022 Construct composite indices for captur- ing the extent of ICT use for human development, towards achievement of MDGs. Data for the nine countries of Asia were used for the study. Constructing the indices serves as a benchmarking exercise. This could initiate the process of determining and monitoring the progress of different countries towards the stat- ed goals. Recent initiatives and limitations of existing data sources A number of regional and international organi- sations have undertaken studies and proposed frameworks to assess progress in ICT develop- ment for achieving various socio-economic goals. Orbicom\u2019s Monitoring the Digital Divide assesses the magnitude of the digital divide and, more specifically, progress of different countries toward the \u2018infostate\u2019, by building the- matic clusters of indicators related to info-densi- ty and info-use. Global Information Technology Report, brought out by the Global Economic Forum, gives a monitoring framework with an index of three elements: environment for ICT; readiness of stakeholders; and usage of ICT among stakeholders. Global Survey and Guide to ICT Planning in Education is an important instru- ment in assessing ICT progress in education. A study by the European Commission has built Statistical Indicators Benchmarking the Information Society (SIBIS) for a large number of OECD countries. It provides information related to access of ICT to households for various pur- poses like business, education and healthcare. Unfortunately, a similar exercise has not been carried out for Asian countries.The World Health Organisation is working on a set of ICT-related indicators for the health sector. Data on Asian countries from this source are not yet available to researchers and policy makers. International Development Research Centre (IDRC) gives, besides the supply indicators, information on users and usages. An important initiative is that of the United Nations ICT Task Force, established in March 2001. It has attempted to place relevant initia- tives and research studies within a coherent VII ICTs and the MDGs: A Quest for Empirical Regularities and Indexing 30 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals policy framework. The Task Force has overviewed, largely in qualitative terms, the current applications of ICT in different countries and come out with a set of indicators to chart progress, which could help in setting up targets for ICTs. It has also come up with a matrix that maps ICTs across the eight MDGs.This suggests a path \u2014 translating each MDG into a set of indi- cators,working out corresponding ICT goals,and then constructing a set of compatible ICT indica- tors. Following these guidelines, a list of indica- tors under each MDG has been worked out (Appendix II). However, it is not possible to obtain information on many of these indicators for Asian countries from international websites. Meeting data deficiencies through cross-country surveys are prohibitively expensive.

For developing countries, there is a strong case to go beyond supply-linked indicators to assess whether technologies are promoting the devel- opment process.This would require information on user-specific indicators like ICT applications, purpose of use, agencies involved and legal framework for adoption of ICTs. Existing data sources for Asian countries do not permit building up of such specific indicators suitable for cross-country comparison. Generation of fresh data would make difficult financial and administrative demands on national and international statistical systems. Also,these countries are so very diverse in levels of economic development, human develop- ment,degree of openness to world markets and socio-cultural specificities that it is difficult to generalise and arrive at a consensus on user- specific indicators.14 Further, a review of litera- ture and analysis of interdependencies of ICT in developing countries may not be adequate to estimate its role in future years, particularly because ICT is still in its infancy.15 Identification of different dimensions of development and their constituent indicators The difficulties16 encountered in cross-country comparison necessitate the use of straight for- ward indicators reflecting primarily the degree of availability of ICT17 (see the list of supply-side indicators under eight MDGs in Appendix II). They are combined with a few sector- or user- specific indicators that are obtainable from international documents or websites of UN agencies and the World Bank. These indicators are classified into four categories, focusing on four broad aspects: (Appendix III) availability or supply-linked; efficiency and speed; targeting social sectors; and targeting vulnerable groups. Availability-linked indicators Availability-linked indicators have been placed in two sub-categories: skill-independent and skill-dependent. The first includes popular ICT tools for which users do not require much skill or training,such as tele- phone mainline connections, cellular subscrip- tions, television sets and radio sets, all being pre- sented per 1,000 of population. Under the skill- dependent ICT category18 where training and skills are required, the indicators identified are internetusersper100people,personalcomputers per 100 people and per capita ICT expenditure. Higher expenditures would imply greater use of the technology by larger sections of population as they cover purchase of ICT products, including telecommunication facilities and other equip- ment for offices, businesses, households, govern- ments and educational institutions.Two separate categories have been kept on the supply side so astoincreasetheimportanceofavailability-linked indicators in the overall aggregation scheme. Indicators of efficiency and speed Indicators that capture aspects of efficiency, internet service provider charges, telephone usage charge for internet,cost of peak rate local 31 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals call per three minutes from the fixed line,cost of peak rate call to the United States per three min- utes, internet speed and access, and IT training and education. Information on these indicators are compiled from the World Bank website on data and statistics19 and the Global Compet- itiveness Report (GCR) 2001-02. Internet service provider charge is the monthly dial-up access charge for 20 hours of use and telephone usage charge is the telephone call charge for 20 hours of access. Higher costs would imply lower effi- ciency and lesser access. The last two are posi- tive indicators of efficiency as these assign high- er values to countries where the ICT facilities are relatively more efficient as manifest in greater speed of access and higher expenditures incurred in training of personnel. Indicators of targeting social sectors These include internet access in schools, com- puters in educational institutions per 1,000 stu- dents,government prioritisation of ICT,and gov- ernment online services availability. The impor- tance of universal literacy held by MDGs justifies inclusion of two educational indicators. Two government-linked indicators have been included, as the state continues to have a major role in promoting social development in Asian countries.

Also, greater competition is likely to generate greater employment in the informal sector,ben- efiting poor and vulnerable groups like women. Government\u2019s success in ICT promotion as also greater efficacy in the legal system for e-com- merce, consumer protection etc., would reflect the outreach of the technology. This, too, will benefit vulnerable sections that tend to be mar- ginalised under free functioning of the market, without adequate protection of the state or legal institutions. Rationale for selection of indicators What is the extent to which the selected indica- tors can map the attainment of MDGs? For goals like eradication of poverty, the important ques- tion is whether the income and employment effect of ICT has a bias in favour of the poor that could help them move above the poverty line. Despite equivocal opinions, there is adequate empirical evidence to suggest that the overall impact of the availability of ICT has been posi- tive for the poor.In any case, availability is a pre- condition for any kind of application, pro-poor or otherwise. This would justify inclusion of availability-linked and efficiency indicators of ICT development. Besides, the state playing a role in providing public access to internet and in ensuring competition among service providers, the legal system promoting ICT development would help in better penetration of technology among the masses22 and make a dent in pover- ty and inequality.It would be useful to construct other indicators for accessibility to the under- privileged or coverage of remote and backward areas, but this is not possible with existing offi- cial as well as non-official databases. The role of ICT in improving education has been noted as positive and justifies inclusion of the availability-linked and efficiency indicators, in the context of meeting the education-related MDG. In addition, internet access in schools and computer use in educational institutions have been considered extremely useful sectoral indi- cators in articulating progress of countries towards universal primary education. Statistics on access and usage of ICT by women relative to that of men would be useful in under- standing the gender divide.While data are avail- able in The World\u2019s Women 2000, with citations from Cyber Atlas and NUA,there are serious infor- mation gaps and problems of reliability due to 32 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals sources of different quality in the Asian coun- tries.23 There are also anomalies and inconsisten- cies in data collection procedures adopted by different countries,particularly for temporal com- parison (Hafkin, 2003). One alternative is to take the percentage of women having tertiary level of education (university, teachers\u2019 college or higher professional school), or enrollment of women in the field of science and engineering,24 but this would be a bit remote in capturing gender sensi- tivity in ICTs. It is, therefore, proposed to capture this dimension through the share of females among professionals and technical workers. In the context of maternal and child health, access to basic amenities including sanitation facilities, and other social sectors, indicators per- taining to the role of the government such as public access to internet, success of the state in internet promotion,efficacy of laws in ICT use,are useful as the state plays a key role in social devel- opment in Asian countries.These may be includ- ed to indirectly reflect the coverage of social sec- tors,as disaggregated data on use of ICT in these sectors are not available.25 Besides, there would be dependence on availability-linked indicators since the growth of ICT per se can help achieve these goals through market functioning. This is possible if countries follow certain kinds of ICT policy which, the overview suggests, is still in the formative stage in most Asian countries. The Task Force concedes that selection of indi- cators at any point of time will be guided by availability of data. It argues in favour of a cer- tain flexibility in the methodology so that the experiences gained over the years can be brought in to improve and refine the indicators over time. Further, it recognises the limitation of not getting hard empirical evidence to justify the selection of indicators or determine their relative importance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0497edf4-ba8a-43ff-b3d3-60b839af9bca": {"__data__": {"id_": "0497edf4-ba8a-43ff-b3d3-60b839af9bca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f13b3f0c3ebaed9fa409c8e917b321793f0ddcea8fe68d0323aa7789a4e04111"}, "2": {"node_id": "2a132f93-9d85-49bb-bc7d-d482ec75aad9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "27b0447e735b04b8cc32e65c9eddadb259472bca8e15edb9fd2d597fda47ff43"}}, "hash": "1b5c2817500dd63b69555f83bea7926367fb38a995d0a114706fde9315974d67", "text": "Therefore the Task Force argues that assembling anecdotal evidence and success stories would be a useful complementa- ry exercise.Hence the attempt to work out a few composite indices reflecting various dimensions of ICT development as also its overall progress.

The methodology attempts aggregation of the indi- cators in several stages, as has been done in working out the HDI. The method of assigning weightages on the basis of a correlation matrix, such as Principal Component Analysis, is not considered appropriate here since the pattern of interdependencies is likely to change as the technologies take firmer roots in the region. As there is no other empirical basis to work out the relative importance of indicators, they are assigned equal weights.26 The other important problem is the elimination of the bias of scale that characterises each indi- cator.In computing the HDI for the Global HDRs, UNDP adopts a \u2018Range Equalisation (RE) method\u2019 where each indicator is divided by the range (after subtraction of the lowest value) so that scale-free values vary between 0 and 1. In recent years HDI methodology has changed, as it uses fixed range computed on the basis of predetermined \u2018goalposts\u2019, reflecting the feasi- ble upper and lower limits to the values. This enables temporal comparisons not only of the rank scores of the countries but also of their human development indices. The disadvantage is that the three constituent indices pertaining to life expectancy, education and GDP have lost the feature of a fixed range of unity.The highest value in each constituent index falls short of unity as the value for the top ranking country is below the goalpost. Similar is the explanation for the minimum value being higher than zero. In view of the popularity of this method among practitioners and policy makers, as well as for comparability, the same has been used in the present analysis. However, fixing the range of the constituent indices through division by range discriminates against indicators that have greater disparity. Also, as inequalities in different indicators show different trends, it would be inappropriate to force these to have uniform and constant range over time. Indeed, with the introduction of the concept of goalposts to compute the range, the (scale-free) values of the indices no longer have the constant range of unity (thereby have lost their unique property). But the maximum and minimum values have been specified based on possible values over recent years and division by range is expected to ensure that the differ- 33 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals ence in disparity in the constituent indicators does not get reflected in HDI. There can also be disagreements in fixing goalposts for indicators like GDP per capita and life expectancy as the issues involved here are empirical. The two bounds for literacy and gross enrollment, on the other hand,are mathematical.While inequality in these two over time will decline as the maximum value is fixed,the same may not be the case with per capita income (Kundu 2003). Unfortunately, the RE method treats the two types of indices in identical manner.The popularity and acceptabili- ty of HDI among policy makers seem to have come in the way of these issues being investigat- ed adequately in the literature. It is proposed to use an alternate method that permits the coefficients of variation of different indicators to remain different even after making them scale free and lets these differences be reflected in the composite index and ranking.All the indicators have been made scale free through division by their own means.27 The coefficients of variation of the original indica- tors, thus, become the standard deviations of the scale-free indicators, which are then carried into the component indices. Another important point is temporal compara- bility of the indices. As the present exercise is undertaken to make the comparison across countries only, elimination of scale effect has been done by dividing each indicator by either range or mean, computed for the chosen year. In case such comparisons are to be made over time, it would be necessary to fix the values of the divisors, as is now being done in comput- ing HDI in HDRs. Indeed, for computing ICT composite indices for any future year, it would make sense to use the same means as in the base year in the denominator for each indica- tor. However, in case the base year is not con- sidered representative of the early years of the 21st century, it should be possible to work out the mean of the first three years,say 2001,2002 and 2003 and fix these as the denominators for eliminating the scale bias for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0ca7519-520c-4d91-a565-8052e7150643": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0ca7519-520c-4d91-a565-8052e7150643", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f782927b4ac11d73ea79b4f6dff83a0afe9b7151468e83a0190017edf974534"}, "3": {"node_id": "507a3c74-ce22-4dd6-b7f0-60a053a4ebd8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a12423706d89a8b014b8f50e961c13feaa28c533ffa94613d75ec73756b5056d"}}, "hash": "9dc29ae0a47daa04f449ae09434bbeeaaceb352a92f39b537f9a2a5b4d3f3dc2", "text": "all subsequent exercises. Five component indices have been constructed, in the first stage by (RE) method as well as by (DM) method of indexing,to cover the following aspects: skill-independent ICT; skill-dependent ICT;efficiency and speed;Social sector targeting; and vulnerable groups targeting. Before composition,all the indicators need to be made uni-directional within each category. Indeed, the indicators reflecting the costs of interaction, such as internet service provider charges, telephone usage charge for internet, cost of local call and cost of call to U.S., cannot be combined with those articulating internet speed or IT training.It is necessary to reciprocate these cost figures so that efficiency indicators get defined as: (a) internet time available per US dollar; (b) telephone time for internet per US dollar; (c) local telephone time (at peak period) available per US dollar; and (d) US telephone time per US dollar. This is based on the under- standing that the higher the accessibility of ICT time per unit of money, the greater is the effi- ciency of the system. This problem does not exist for any other category of indicators.Finally, the composite aggregate index of development of ICT in the context of MDG has been obtained by combining the five component indices. Component indices obtained through RE method and the corresponding aggregate index Following the RE method, the component index for a category is obtained by first making each indicator scale free, by subtracting its minimum value from each observation and then dividing it by its range. The average of these values across the indicators (within the category) for each country then becomes the value of its component index. Understandably, if a country has maximum values for all the indicators in a category, it will score an index value 1. Similarly, a country will obtain a composite score of zero only when it has the minimum value in all the indicators.The larger the value of group-specific or aggregate index,the higher is the role played by ICT towards the attainment of MDGs. An aggregate index for ICT development has been computed by using the same methodology as that of category-specific indices. The indices of skill-independent and dependent ICT availability measure the relative positions of countries for availability of different types of facilities. Malaysia obtains the top position in both skill-independent and skill-dependent ICT categories (Table 7.1).The value of skill-depend- ent ICT index in this case is unity as it secures the highest value in all the indicators belonging to this category. Thailand and China that follow Malaysia are way behind, reflecting the differ- ences across countries within the Asian region. The value of skill-independent ICT index for 34 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals Malaysia is also very high but its gap with the second and third position countries is less than in the previous case.The availability of ICT across the countries, therefore, exhibits wide inter- country variation. The efficiency and speed index depicts the rank- ing of the countries in providing access to high- speed ICT at low cost to their people. Here, too, Malaysia obtains the highest position. However, its relative position, vis-a-vis other countries is not as high as in the case of ICT availability indices due to high cost of providing internet facilities and a call to the US being more expen- sive here compared to other countries (the two indicators belonging to this category).Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan report high values (fairly close to Malaysia),although these have very low levels of ICT availability. The social sector targeting index reflects the performance of the countries in promoting ICT in certain specific directions for the well-being of the people.The idea is to assess whether ben- efits of the technology have remained restricted to a few or have percolated down to larger sec- tions of the population. China obtains the high- est position here, followed by India and Malaysia. The high value obtained by China is largely due to the indicators pertaining to deployment of computers in the field of educa- tion and government giving ICT a high priority.

In skill-independent ICT again, Malaysia has a very high value (followed by China), exhibiting a huge gap from India and Pakistan. In the case of ICT efficiency, India and Pakistan are impressive, almost similar to Malaysia and China. Sri Lanka, which secures modest values in availability-linked indicators, goes to the top for efficiency. This index does not show much variation across countries, as costs are becom- ing similar around the world, under the impact of globalisation of technology. In targeting social sectors, China secures the highest value, basically because ICT is used in a big way in educational institutions and government assigns it a high priority. It is only in this cate- gory that we see Malaysia sinking very low, going below the average of the series, while India and Thailand notch significantly higher positions. In targeting vulnerable sections of population, India and Malaysia seem to be doing well. In both countries, the state plays an important role in prioritising ICT as also in cre- ating a competitive environment among serv- ice providers. Again, inter-country disparity does not show alarming proportions because of the nature of the indicators. Understandably, Malaysia has the highest value in the aggregate index, followed by China and Thailand, the countries that have been part of a globally-linked rapid develop- ment process during the past two decades.

Comparison of the alternate sets of indices A quick comparison of the rankings obtained from the two composite aggregate indices (by RE and DM methods) suggests that the results are not very different. The top three positions are occupied by Malaysia, China, and Thailand and the bottom by Viet Nam in both the meth- ods. There are a few changes in the ranking of the middle order countries that are marginal. It could be argued that since the proposed DM method gives results similar to the RE method, the credentials of this alternative needs to be noted in the literature of aggregative indices. The objective of using the two different meth- ods in this exercise, however, is quite different. It is to identify and focus on the differences that have emerged from the two methods, identify and analyse the reasons in the context of the dynamics of ICT development. The first major difference is that despite the ranks of the countries being similar, the gaps in the values of the indices are quite different. For example,the difference between China,Thailand and India, obtained by the RE method, may be seen as insignificant. This, however, is not the case by the DM method. Of particular impor- tance here is the gap between India and the other two countries, which is due to the low val- ues of the former for two composite indices of ICT availability. It is important that the alternate DM approach succeeds in retaining the signifi- cant variation in these two indices (Table 7.2) and gets these reflected in the aggregate index which brings down the figure for India. The RE method implicitly reduces their importance by treating them at par with other (component) indices that do not exhibit significant inter-coun- try variation. Similarly, Mongolia and Viet Nam score very low values in the aggregate index by the RE method, which is not the case with the alternate DM method. This again is because the availability indicators, for which these two coun- tries record reasonably high values, receive low weightage in the logic of aggregation applied in HDI. One major difference is in the ranking of Pakistan vis-a-vis Sri Lanka in the aggregate index by the two methods. The higher scores of the latter on availability get reflected in the aggregate index by the DM method, with a relatively higher weight giving it a higher rank. In the RE method, the importance of the availability indices (with high disparities) are implicitly reduced, which is responsible for reversal in ranking. Division by mean eliminates the scale bias but not disparity. Sri Lanka has higher scores than Pakistan in a large number of indicators and by a huge margin in absolute as well as relative terms. The difference in ranking occurs even in category-specific component indices. Sri Lanka and China get top positions in terms of efficien- cy and targeting social sectors, respectively by the DM method,leaving Malaysia behind (which is placed at number one in both, by the RE method). Most of the indicators in the two cate- gories have low variation. All the countries have similar values except for telephone charge for Figure 7.2 Aggregate index by DM method for nine Asian countries 2.17 1.37 1.12 0.80 0.79 0.72 0.71 0.67 0.66 0.00 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 Malaysia China Thailand Sri Lanka India Mongolia Indonesia Pakistan Viet Nam 37 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals internet services and computers installed in educational institutions.

It is not the purpose of this statistical exercise to establish the superiority of one method over the other as their suitability would depend on the objectives of the exercise and empirical regular- ities observed in the region under investigation. This discussion makes it clear that change in the methodology of composition can and does bring about significant changes in the values of component indices and can alter even the rank- ing of countries. Issues of value judgment, implicit in the methodology, cannot be dis- missed. It has been demonstrated that the RE method implicitly gives lower weightages to indicators pertaining to availability and a few other aspects of ICT development that are observed to have high disparity.The disparity,in the coun- tries under consideration, has been caused through the process of development, mediated largely through the market, with limited control being exercised by the government.In the earli- er sections it has been argued that ICT is still in the initial stages of development and conse- quently, increase in its availability itself could prompt socio-economic development. Several economic, social and cultural factors are cur- rently inhibiting the process of growth and an increase in the availability ICT will help in giving exposure to policy makers, administrators and the common people to the global information system.Further,this would lead to the establish- ment of better communication networks even within the countries and facilitate decision mak- ing by public and private agencies.Supply of ICT is strongly linked with economic affordability, bringing in high disparity. Also, economic fac- tors affecting affordability will be important in future years as well for the development of ICT. In view of all this,giving importance to availabil- ity indicators does not seem misplaced. National governments in the Asian region have tried to give a direction to the development of ICT by intervening in the market, controlling prices, introducing it in social sectors, fixing pri- orities, strengthening the legal structure for ensuring access to all,etc.Importantly,the cross- country differences in the concerned indicators are not very high as may be inferred from the low coefficients of variation of the indicators (Appendix III) belonging to third,fourth and fifth categories. Irrespective of socio-political struc- tures,each country has taken measures to give a push to the dissemination of technology. There are specific measures adopted by individual governments to direct ICT towards the MDG objectives but it is impossible to generate cross- sectionally comparable data on this. Also, the success of such measures has been limited and uneven across countries,due to the overwhelm- ing nature of markets. This is reflected in sec- torally and spatially unbalanced growth of ICT, evident from the high disparity of the indicators of availability, belonging to the first and second category. Therefore, maintaining the variation of the indi- cators (by making the standard deviation of the original indicator the coefficient of the scale- free indicator) and then giving equal weightage to their variations in the aggregation scheme, appears appropriate. Studies have shown that indicators that play a significant role in the development dynamics of less-developed coun- tries exhibit high disparity in space (Kundu 1984). Undoubtedly, this kind of regularity observed in certain contexts cannot claim uni- versality.However,given the pattern of develop- ment noted through correlation analysis and review of literature in the Asian region, the retention of the variation in availability indica- tors in the process of composition can be justi- fied. This implies giving higher weightage to availability indicators, the rationale for which has been discussed while analysing the devel- opment dynamics in the region. In brief To assess the levels of ICT applications for human development towards achievement of 38 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals MDGs, 22 indicators were identified to capture five dimensions or broad categories of ICT development. Component indices were worked out for each of the categories by aggregating the constituent indicators after eliminating the scale bias. This was done with both the RE method used by UNDP in computing HDI and the DM method. An aggregate index was then computed based on the category-specific com- ponent indices by each method. These indices present the relative position of the nine coun- tries in terms of development of ICT for attain- ment of MDGs.

At the lower end are Mongolia and Viet Nam, though they are fairly high in terms of availability indicators \u2014 way ahead of India or Pakistan. The latter two coun- tries, however, have an advantage in efficiency and targeting social sectors and vulnerable groups.The third South Asian country,Sri Lanka, has fairly high values for availability and occu- pies the top position in terms of ICT efficiency by one method. Indonesia has middle level val- ues in almost all the indicators and figures in category-specific as well as composite aggre- gate indices. An important point emerging from the analysis is that, in assessing the progress of ICTs for achieving any set of socio-economic goals, there would have to be an emphasis on avail- ability indicators. In addition, several efficiency- linked and user-specific indicators would have been included in the analysis. For that, informa- tion must be gathered covering aspects of affordability, access and utilisation of ICT.These should bring in the demand side more strongly and reflect the spread of technology not only across economic and social classes but also regions, sectors and gender categories. Indicators, for example, may be built to articu- late what percentage of households in certain social, economic, rural-urban, vulnerable groups like tribals and other disadvantaged sections are able to make use of ICT for applica- tions relevant to them.Alternatively,one can try to build up \u2018surrogate end points\u2019such as better information flows and better management of education, health and public delivery systems through ICT, for assessing progress towards achieving MDGs. 39 While the quest for empirical evidence on inter- dependencies between ICT and human devel- opment indicators is critical in establishing the impact of ICT on human development,this must be complemented by qualitative research and assessment of effective use of ICT in key areas such as poverty eradication, healthcare, educa- tion and the environment. ICT can act as an enabler with a potential to enhance the achievement of MDGs. ICT, if wisely deployed, can have an impact on almost every sector nudging development budgets, private sector investment and com- mitments from development stakeholders to go that much further in cost effectiveness and reach. It is critical that the focus on ICT as an enabler for development be reflected in national strategies for poverty reduction and human development, as opposed to assuming an ICT sector focus (software, hardware, IT services) where the development gains are likely to be less extensive with fewer spread effects. ICT is able to strengthen the conditions such as transparency, accountability and democra- tisation, required for the achievement of MDGs. ICT can facilitate information sharing and knowledge creation with implications for each of the MDGs. ICT is able to strengthen participatory inputs, demand-driven respons- es and bottom-up implementation. It also supports collaboration and coordination through enhanced networking. The nine country studies provide a wealth of Asian experiences on how ICT has been harnessed for realising the MDGs (UNDP 2003a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i). The role of ICT in the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger ICT can address and improve existing human deprivations worldwide through direct and indirect means.The direct contribution of ICT to poverty reduction,for example,can come either through employment generated by the diffu- sion of technologies into poor rural and urban areas, or through ICT-enhanced returns from economic activities of poorer households. Indirect contribution can come through facili- tating delivery of ICT services and reducing their costs. Increased service delivery either pro- motes wage and self-employment, or helps overcome structural constraints on poverty alle- viation projects. In a situation where the world is becoming a global village,ICT can help the poor acquire liter- acy, marketable skills and other knowledge to alleviate poverty (Chowdhury 2000). Developing countries, in particular the poorer sections, are beginning to recognise ICT as increasingly impor- tant in their effort to escape poverty.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e4aff6b-3b1c-4ad5-b672-c69a1f36fe03": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e4aff6b-3b1c-4ad5-b672-c69a1f36fe03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a6cb5f2a9fd3281ba51d899ef0f945a2644b7ec9f096569c57f53934816592f2"}, "2": {"node_id": "580d9d67-86fd-4631-8b1e-8267775c8197", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c1cdf8c3f9a348ec008f9688a29eb94c9bf214eec9f6a05f95f4eb0a85c0e82e"}}, "hash": "359cd8e3b0b9850f7467261d5ed28b8f143e6303c516d181404c198ad66a1684", "text": "Given the option,they are willing to invest in telecommuni- cations out of their limited resources (UNDP 2003f).ICT has the potential to combat rural and urban poverty and foster sustainable develop- ment (Samiullah and Rao 2000).This can only be achieved if there is an enabling environment, as reflected by the presence of a strong political will, the participation of the private sector and the NGOs, the free flow of information, access by women,and capacity building.

ICT can serve as a critical tool for monitoring and managing the procurement, storage and distribution of essential food grains. Malnutrition is aggravated through inappropri- ate dietary practices arising out of ignorance and misinformation. Here, the dissemination of correct information through ICT can contribute to improvement. Increasing employment and other economic opportunities for the poor Using electronic job marketplaces, employers and employees can match labour skills and availability to satisfy their demands. TARAhaat, an Indian portal designed to serve villages in rural India, provides job opportunity informa- tion on local websites in local dialects. Another country to have harnessed ICT for improved labour market facilitation and direct payment is Mongolia where it is widely utilised for job search, employment and education. The telecentre movement is gaining momen- tum in the developing world, as ICT becomes more affordable. Individual telecentres foster profound developmental outcomes within the communities they serve. As telecentres provide shared access to the communications infra- structure, it becomes possible for many to share the cost of a single connection. An often cited example of successful ICT use in poverty reduc- tion is the Grameen Bank\u2019s Village Pay Phone ini- tiative in Bangladesh (Nyaki Adeya 2002). Pakistan\u2019s Green Revolution and Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) are examples of productivity- enhancing technological packages which have had long-term and continuing positive impact on rural incomes. A village in Thailand, Baan Samka, is using a telecentre operated by chil- dren and youth to serve as a knowledge inter- mediary by broadcasting useful information from the internet to adults via the village audio tower. Currently Baan Samka is ranked as the strongest village in the district in terms of lead- ership, community funds, income, village com- mittee, civic and occupational groups and drug abuse prevention. ICT can make a difference by helping to raise the magnitude and reduce the vulnerability of returns earned by small producers from their economic activities. In a village in South India, where 130 out of 210 families struggle below the poverty line, two solar-powered computers are being used to give villagers a wealth of data. This project has helped the farmers to have a better grip on their local markets as prices are more transparent and the fishermen to get information from satellite images on where the fish shoals are positioned off the Pondicherry coast.In Viet Nam,villages such as Bat Trang and Hoi An have created websites by themselves to sell village goods. Access to credit Access to credit, say, through self-help groups is crucial for micro-enterprises. Microfinance is a substitute for formal sector credit which tends to bypass the poor and women.In countries like India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Indonesia, microfinance institutions have been particularly successful in providing the credit to rural women. But microfinance, even when suc- cessful in reaching credit to the poor and ensur- ing high recovery rates, is characterised by high transaction costs which influence interest rates. India\u2019s Swayam Krishi Sangam (SKS) smart cards project is an example of using ICT to reduce transaction costs and minimise the cost of cred- it provided by self-help groups. Agricultural development Agriculture is also being transformed by ICT. ICT can empower farmers, rationalise supply chains, improve productivity, facilitate research and development,and promote information sharing on agricultural farm extension technologies, market prices, weather information, etc, all of which can enhance food security. India\u2019s net- work of internet-connected kiosks, known as e- Choupals, serves the soybean, cotton, tobacco, and shrimp farmers in its procurement network enabling farmers to get up-to-date weather reports, local and international produce prices and also to buy agricultural inputs and con- sumer goods for daily use.28 China\u2019s Beijing FarmKnow reaches over 100,000 farmers through its website where they can access infor- mation on crop planting, disease control, pest identification and control, seed prices, and mar- ket prices,as well as consult agricultural special- ists by e-mail.29 TaniNet in Malaysia is also a sim- ilar information service toolset.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "398d7767-36d8-4b40-b0d0-775d50fea225": {"__data__": {"id_": "398d7767-36d8-4b40-b0d0-775d50fea225", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8654d7f33d2622ff924a44f05c41f1f0f24db51374dcefb3c4a44de0d5df0ca2"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b43bd31-c5a3-4236-8b51-dd36bc3673a0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f092c469b573e0dac8682f15edeeaa60ada305a82a849fcd71daf722942076e"}}, "hash": "5ad53f0ab390fa1c26283e9e807c2b821776603e59adf98b28a4ab68b66bb2d7", "text": "Community decision making ICT is able to overcome the barriers of social, economic and geographic isolation, increase access to information and education, and 41 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals enable the poor to participate extensively in the decisions that affect their lives.

Poverty mapping ICT helps facilitate consultative inputs, poverty monitoring and mapping and assessments to evaluate impact and enhance support to the poor. ICT such as geographic information sys- tem (GIS) enable poverty mapping that com- bines geographically-referenced survey and census data, generating poverty and inequality profiles at low levels of aggregation. Poverty maps also serve benchmarking, monitoring and evaluation purposes (Flor 2001).Malaysia\u2019s data- base on the poor called SINAR system has been used to centralise the coordination of informa- tion on urban poor and has proven useful to governments and donor agencies. Hunger and food security Asia has the largest number of undernourished persons worldwide. Accurate and timely infor- mation regarding areas of food surplus and shortages can be facilitated through ICT. This contributes to improved food grain manage- ment to combat hunger and promote food security. The Food Insecurity and Vulnerability Information and Mapping System (FIVIMS), is a national and global initiative that aims to raise awareness of food security issues, improve data quality, promote better use of the information to drive action and, on an international level, work with the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) to define common stan- dards, methods and tools for information man- agement and presentation. A number of FIVIMS activities are operational in Bangladesh, Cambodia,India,Papua New Guinea,Philippines and Thailand. Nutrition surveillance and moni- toring can be effectively put in place through the power of technologies since large data can be easily processed and disseminated on a reg- ular basis. Improvement of government services for the poor ICT has been used by governments to help extend and improve their services to the poor. ICT helps governments strengthen internal information flows, accountability and trans- parency, and procurement of goods and servic- es. The Indonesian government has initiated a number of projects, for reducing government bureaucracy and inefficiency, such as the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) which has reduced processing time significantly. In largely rural Viet Nam, there is a trend in the ministries to focus on the creation of databases to support development activities such as economic, agri- cultural and water resource management. Under the Telecommunications Posts Cultural Point for Communes (TPCPC) plan launched in 1998, government aims to provide all com- munes with access to basic telecommunications and postal services. This has special relevance for remote and mountainous parts, within the rural areas. The role of ICT in achieving universal primary education ICT by itself cannot universalise primary educa- tion. It is a tool which can complement invest- ments in education infrastructure and enhance teaching and learning capabilities. It can create new possibilities for reaching the unreached and making life-long education feasible for all. This can be done through appropriate use of ICT as an innovative new delivery mechanism for system-wide provision of education, especially in distance and non-formal education (UNESCO 2000). ICT in education has both short- and long-term potential, facilitating educational reforms and providing connectivity for all edu- cational institutions. Connectivity can con- tribute to better school education management through tracking school infrastructure availabil- ity and resource status, teacher-student ratios, teacher training needs and management. In Asia, governments have realised the impor- tance of integrating ICT in education policies. Across countries like India, Sri Lanka and Mongolia, governments are initiating pro- grammes that promote the use of ICT at all lev- els of education and for all parties involved in the educational process. In countries with vast land areas that make access to education a problem, ICT is proving that it can bring educa- tion to all sectors of society,not just for the liter- ate and the elite. Access to ICT enables traditional or formal edu- cation systems, to adapt to different learning 42 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals and training needs. Computer simulation, telematics, video-audio, computer conferencing and virtual learning, along with educational tel- evision and radio, have greater potential to reach larger audience than in a traditional class- room (UNESCO 2000).

An advantage of ICT is that, as a tool, it does not discriminate against socio-economic factors such as gender, race or age and can help improve the overall standard of education in a country by reducing the gap in quality of edu- cation between schools in urban and rural areas. Realising that India\u2019s explosion of student popu- lation could not be adequately reached through mere classroom education, the Countrywide Classroom was launched in 1984 where satellite television (Doordarshan, India\u2019s national public service television) was used as a means to sup- plement classroom teaching. Indonesia\u2019s Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organisation established the regional open and distance learning centre to supplement conven- tional classroom instructions with online cours- es for senior secondary school students. It also facilitated the training institution personnel, field extension workers and university lecturers, production of web and CD-based multimedia learning to programmes, integration of IT into teaching of mathematics and science and in the education and prevention of HIV/AIDS. Promoting efficiency in education ICT offers alternative classroom conditions as it no longer requires people to congregate at a venue where learning takes place. There is no need for a hierarchic structure where the instructor is the provider of knowledge and there is a predetermined path of academic grades. The curriculum becomes student cen- tred with a self-learning environment, enabling the student to customise his/her own learning experience. The Sri Lankan government runs several key initiatives connecting 92 education centres across provinces, regions and sectors within the ministry, developing computer train- ing centres at 800 selected schools to be com- pleted by 2004, and issuing CD-ROMs to meet the educational requirements of secondary schools. Malaysia\u2019s Smart School concept is a learning institution that aims to foster self- assessed, self-paced, and self-directed learning. The government along with the private sector has set out to develop Smart School Applications comprising of teaching and learn- ing materials and school management systems. Improving the quality of teaching and learning ICT can be used as a tool for training and sup- port of teachers, regardless of their geographi- cal dispersion.Teachers can also use the internet to expand the quantity and quality of teaching resources (Haddad & Jurich 2002a). India\u2019s Goa Computers for Schools Project has been suc- cessful in raising the levels of computer access and literacy among teachers and students. 43 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals Further, the project also allows adults in the community to use computers after school hours to access e-mail and information on income- generating schemes. In Malaysia, the electronic book pilot project studies how the electronic book appliance that stores textbook contents and links users to the internet, can be used to improve teaching and learning. ICT for promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women ICT represents both a challenge and an oppor- tunity for the empowerment of women.

ICT can be used by the disadvantaged women themselves or by organisations that specifically target these women.It allows the information to be transferred across distance without face-to- face contact. As such it offers possibilities for women to engage in e-commerce,distance edu- cation, and e-government. With its power and reach, ICT can be an instru- ment for either promoting or negating gender equality.The way the women are represented in the media, particularly in relation to men, is the key since some representations reinforce their unequal status. Recognising this, sensitivity to gender issues and imbalances should influence ICT content not only in education, but in all sectors. Women\u2019s education Educating women and giving them equal rights is important not only because it increases their productivity, raises their output and reduces poverty but also constitutes an end in itself. It promotes gender equality within households and reduces constraints on women\u2019s decision making. It gives women better control over fer- tility, increased child spacing and maternal health. Educated women can be more informed about the health and nutrition of their children. Equal access to education is an important step towards greater gender equality,but it is not the only one. Even as gender disparities in educa- tion diminish, other differences persist in legal rights, labour market opportunities, and the ability to participate in public life and decision- making.30 ICT can improve women\u2019s opportunities in receiving education and training. Distance edu- cation based on ICT, especially through radio and television broadcasting which contain vari- ous forms of educational and training content, can promote sharing of education resources and offer women wider access to professional training, secondary education, on-the-job edu- cation, and continuing education. Programmes targeted at women help them not only educate and develop skills, but also provide insights into women\u2019s issues and create awareness among women regarding their rights, problems and solutions and choices. This will help equip women to identify and break down barriers that discriminate against them. The Gobi Women\u2019s Project in Mongolia uses the radio to provide non-formal distance education to some 15,000 nomadic women, giving useful instruction on health, commercial skills, family planning, tradi- tional crafts and environmental issues. Since 1985, Indonesia has been developing a programme called \u2018Kelompencapir\u2019, for intro- ducing new methods of growing crops, new varieties of crops or new technology in the vil- lages. This programme, delivered through vil- lage radio, is in the form of discussions between groups of village people and the extension worker who introduces a method or a system. In this programme, one village group will compete with those of other villages in transforming the knowledge into actual prac- tice. The participants in this programme have an almost equal gender distribution. These simple models could be further improved to become more innovative by using the full spectrum of ICT. A community development project on ICT for women\u2019s empowerment is being conducted by the Annisa Foundation,in collaboration with the UNESCO office in Jakarta.The aim of the project 44 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals is to alleviate poverty in West Nusa Tenggara. It is being implemented in two villages; Batu Kumbung and Gegerung in West Lombok. The Annisa Foundation assists eight groups in litera- cy programmes including three groups of female farm labourers for the functional literacy programme, one group of children who are out of school, one group of male teenagers, as well as one group of fathers and two groups of mothers. The literacy programmes consist of teaching of writing, reading and simple calcula- tion.Other activities for women\u2019s empowerment conducted by the foundation include imparting of knowledge related to their health and the environment, and establishing income-generat- ing activities. Sri Lankan women\u2019s groups are increasingly using ICT tools for education and training pur- poses.

The province as a whole is highly gender segregated and the presence of a female SDNP staff member enabled contact to be estab- lished.The aim was to assist women in overcom- ing their fear of technology, to provide basic training on e-mail and web use, and to enable them to oversee family use of the internet.Since mid-2000, 322 participants have attended 13 workshops in Quetta city, and some 760 partici- pants attended a further ten sessions in remote areas, all run from the Quetta office. Older forms of communication technologies such as the radio have a crucial role to play in a society with limited literacy.This is illustrated by the activities of the Kutch Mahila Vikas Sanghtan, (KMVS), an NGO working with rural women in 150 villages of Kutch district in Gujarat,India.After its involvement in communi- ty development work for over a decade, KMVS launched in 2000, a weekly 30-minute spon- sored programme in the Kutchi language on All India Radio\u2019s Radio Bhuj. Titled \u2018Kunjal Paanje Kutch Ji\u2019 (Sarus Crane of Our Kutch), the pro- gramme deals with a range of gender-related issues such as the participation of women in political processes, a girl\u2019s right to education, female foeticide, and harassment of brides for dowry and female suicides. Women\u2019s advocacy A significant positive impact of ICT on women\u2019s empowerment is the enhanced capacity of women\u2019s advocacy and support groups to exchange information, coordinate action, and increase the reach of advocacy campaigns. Civil society and activist organisations routinely receive dozens of e-mails containing informa- tion on emerging areas of concern. The power of ICT has enabled advocacy groups to interact and network even across national boundaries, creating power synergies to highlight gender issues, combat prejudices and stereotypes as well as mobilise action. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has been able to extend its outreach precisely because of e-mail and the internet.An initiative that was critical in making such interaction possible is the con- struction of e-mail lists and list archives on spe- cific issues by the Sustainable Development Networking Programme (SDNP). Indeed, this is among the true success stories of Pakistan\u2019s ICT experience. Employment opportunities for women ICT can provide a number of new job or busi- ness opportunities for women. ICT can allow them to juggle family responsibilities and work commitments by teleworking, which opens up a plethora of productive employ- ment opportunities for women previously constrained by the need to stay at home. \u2018E- homemakers\u2019 is a community project man- aged by homemakers in Malaysia. The project currently involves the management of a com- munity portal, www.myhome4work.net, in three languages and the testing of a virtual office with teleworking staff who all work from home. Two hundred disadvantaged women 45 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals have been trained in information technology (IT) with the aim of preparing them to work from home as teleworkers. Women\u2019s social and political participation ICT can also facilitate women\u2019s participation in government and political affairs. Rural women can gain a new communication platform to exchange their opinions on political issues, using ICT to raise women\u2019s issues to their lead- ers. Female political candidates can also win support from voters in this way, employing ICT in the communication of their political mes- sages to voters.In many countries in Asia,access to information and education is empowering women and has the potential to increase women\u2019s participation in politics. By providing information and knowledge to women, ICT plays a significant role in helping them gain more awareness of their rights, which in turn empowers them to actively defend and pro- mote their interests through political mobilisa- tion, activity and participation. In Malaysia, the use of ICT among political groups is seen to be higher and more comprehensive as compared to non-profit groups.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d08c478-fd2d-4c96-9443-652dec5b0109": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d08c478-fd2d-4c96-9443-652dec5b0109", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6e6bf6571dfad5f76e76e9218683fee86cab127b3568b3fffa1eef8cf6590d11"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b83efdf-529f-44d3-9db6-f7c483d7e82c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68569ab115fd7c233b65b8fac420911315329a65c93b620c95a7125bfdf18866"}}, "hash": "4c2e384e4a49eeb60d1950ec90c829dc7ebaeb8ed51d30f0ad9558b716d071f7", "text": "A major factor for this could be access to better funding.\u2018Puteri UMNO\u2019 (the young women\u2019s wing of UMNO, the domi- nant Malay-based party within the ruling coali- tion) and \u2018Wanita MCA\u2019(the women\u2019s wing of the major Chinese-based political component with- in the same coalition) have secretariates with several permanent staff linked through Local Area Networks (LANs).

ICT can also combat social factors that contribute to child mortality such as female infanticide. While ICT seems to offer critical inputs to reduce infant and child deaths,traditional interventions such as oral rehydration therapy, better drug supplies, trained healthcare professionals and extension of health services to uncovered areas are still primary. Given that resources for infant and child health are finite,governments need to balance investment in ICT with other basic healthcare programmes. The potential impact of ICT in reducing Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Under 5 Mortality Rate (U5MR) needs to be realistically assessed. Governments, NGOs, health establishments and people can have greater access to con- tent on child care and health information through various forms of ICT, for example, radio or television programmes and the inter- net. The local population can access locally- appropriate content on child care and child health in local languages. ICT helps to improve access to locally available resources related to preventive healthcare and child care data or information. ICT can also cus- tomise content to suit local cultural contexts to help overcome beliefs and prejudices detri- mental to child health. ICT provides opportunities for infant and child healthcare providers, researchers and policy- makers to discuss via local or global discussion groups and/or bulletin boards, and to share and consult on child health issues. It can help increase the information exchange on immuni- sation rates and needs of infants and children in rural areas. ICT can also facilitate intra-govern- ment coordination on healthcare and improve government planning, health awareness and disease prevention and control across all sectors and departments, particularly in crisis-affected countries. ICT increases access of rural caregivers to spe- cialist support and remote diagnosis, and reduces the need to transfer patients to a site of medical expertise. It can enhance access by local child healthcare workers to suitable and relevant international information on causes of child mortality and ways to reduce it, adapting the information to local circum- stances as necessary. ICT increases mapping, tracking and information sharing on child- hood and infant diseases to enhance support in the most crisis-vulnerable and affected countries. ICTs can document local child mor- 46 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals tality problems in local languages, propagat- ing locally-suitable approaches through local channels and in local languages. Telemedicine Telemedicine is an active and expanding field of ICT in healthcare,and can play an important role in reducing infant and child mortality through increased options and informed healthcare. Medical consultations include tele-radiology, tele-pathology and tele-cardiology among oth- ers. In Asia, governments, public institutions and the private sector have been promoting ICT for national health systems. In Western China, the Angel Programme uses ICT to establish a tele- medicine network, connecting hospitals at national level.In Malaysia,the Ministry of Health joined forces with the private sector to form Telehealth, with the aim of delivering high qual- ity health content to the public, using ICT. In India, Apollo Telemedicine specialises in provid- ing consultations and second opinions to remote areas where access to quality healthcare for children is difficult. Its rural telemedicine centre caters to about 50,000 rural population. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has demonstrated how satellite communica- tions have been harnessed to extend super spe- ciality medical consultations in remote and inac- cessible locations like the Andaman and Nicobar Islands,Tripura, Leh and Assam. Infant and child healthcare education and training The availability of information to healthcare workers in developing countries is important to help reduce infant and child mortality rates.

Computers are available in most Indonesian hospitals, primarily for record- ing and reporting data of individual divisions: patient admissions, medical records, billing sys- tems,personnel and logistics data. Management of patient health information ICT can play a role in the child healthcare through database storage and retrieval of infor- mation pertaining to the child\u2019s health condi- tion. In Thailand, ICT is used to promote mater- nal and child health through the Perinatal HIV Implementing Monitoring System (PHIMS). Developed by the Office of Health Promotion, Department of Health, the system aims to improve the management of maternal and child health information,starting from data collection at the public hospitals and health facilities, and transmission of such data to the central office. In Mongolia, the Soros Foundation Medical Internet Programme supported a grant to develop a national health and medical informa- tion network that would enable health institu- tions to have e-mail and internet access.A multi- user public-access computer website was estab- lished and connected to hospitals through a computer network. Medical professionals underwent basic and advanced e-mail and internet training programmes. Public health education and awareness Many of the Thai government\u2019s major health promotion schemes have a health-education component where ICT is used to deliver health information to pregnant women and mothers of the newborn, as well as healthcare workers.The Office of Health Promotion also has its own radio programme, which broadcasts health information on AM and FM channels for 30 min- utes each week. About 20% to 30% of the air- time is allocated to maternal and child-related health information. Video cassettes have also 47 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals been used extensively to provide health-related knowledge and distributed to public and com- munity hospitals as well as health facilities. China\u2019s Central Television (CCTV) network has launched a special programme on maternal and child health. In Mongolia, the Health Promotion Department is in charge of health education and promotion; media campaigns; health and behavioural surveys; developing, planning and distributing the information, education and communication materials; and social mobilisa- tion to create a healthy environment. The ESS studio in Mongolia produces and broadcasts TV spots, health advice, health-education pro- grammes and radio promotions, which are received by more than 100,000 people through- out the country.Reproductive health,safe moth- erhood and child health programmes are aired on radio twice a week. In Indonesia,there is no single unit dedicated to the overall child health programmes, and infor- mation on different aspects of a child\u2019s health is managed separately. Information and commu- nication management consequently follows the management structure of child health pro- grammes. Of the total 856 internet search strings reviewed on March 31st 2003, the top 20 search strings had 13.5% access on maternal and child health issues (which is a little over 3% of the total of 856 search strings) that include infant health, nutrition status of children under five, health of pregnant women and anaemia. Other child health-related websites include the Indonesian Society of Paediatricians (www.idai.com) for parents of young children. ICT for improving maternal health Most experiments using ICT in health services delivery and health management have taken place in developed countries. Health initiatives using ICT do reduce the developed country\u2019s healthcare cost substantially but this is of no immediate relevance to countries where the problem is not high cost but inadequate service provision. However, the results of some experi- ments suggest that ICT can be useful even in developing countries (Chandrasekhar & Ghosh 2001). Issues of concern to maternal health in developing countries revolve around early mar- riage, early pregnany, anaemia, child spacing and parity,etc.The use of ICT in enhancing deliv- ery of better information to health service pro- fessionals, women and their families can con- tribute to improving maternal health. ICT can affect maternal health in poor countries through improvements in healthcare manage- ment and communication of knowledge on maternal health issues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "153767ac-7982-4a31-adec-e191aad07675": {"__data__": {"id_": "153767ac-7982-4a31-adec-e191aad07675", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4236081575d2e7fe9c0b758116b7148a972dca43ead8cd3987f85d9279c1ffac"}, "2": {"node_id": "0b9d4920-afe5-4ea3-94c9-f8ead7804065", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b334876652ad285916455fcaba6b6d172ff4768bf8f770e2108df3030e80cad4"}}, "hash": "67cf1ebe96e45f344d48a922a20a20b60d272c30e274ac04215e95a5f8511c97", "text": "ICT has been used to access and link networks of expertise, manage medical information and patient data,automate basic processes of care, enable remote medical assistance, improve public knowledge and awareness on maternal health issues, facilitate maternal health research and training, generate locally relevant content and mobilise volun- teerism.

Managing health information and patient data The interconnectivity feature of ICT can greatly improve maternal healthcare delivery systems by connecting healthcare professionals around the world, including online networks of expert- ise (doctor-to-doctor, doctor-to-hospitals), and by providing access to information about maternal health issues confronting the coun- tries.32 The e-mail discussion list \u2018HIF-net at WHO\u2019 has allowed international debate on the subject of \u2018local health content\u2019 as well as increased awareness of the issue,among a com- mitted group of over 900 individuals worldwide, from publishers to librarians, from community health workers to senior executives in interna- tional health agencies, from NGOs to ministries of health, all working together to improve access to reliable, relevant information for healthcare workers in developing and emerging countries (Packenham-Walsh 2003). For rural healthcare practitioners, ICT can sup- port the capturing and dissemination of infor- mation, for example, in the monitoring of dis- eases and treatments and the dissemination of disease prevention information (Bridges.org 2001). Handheld computers such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and emerging wireless technologies provide healthcare practitioners with unprecedented opportunities to move information out to where it is needed most. They are also powerful tools for data collection and analysis, providing rapid access to informa- tion which policy makers and health planners 48 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals need to respond to and prevent common maternal health problems, practice sound resource management, and track progress.33 India\u2019s Teledoc Project, formerly known as \u2018Handy Vaid\u2019,is a good example of how local and international health and medical information can be stored in PDAs and used by healthcare workers to raise the efficacy of social service delivery in areas where electricity, telephone lines,books and internet facilities are not readily available. Also in Rajasthan, India, the Indian Health Care Project equipped auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) with PDAs and relevant sup- port tools to improve management of patient health information at the village level.The ANMs reported that PDAs had reduced time spent on paper work; increased data accuracy; and ensured data availability at the village level in electronic form, which translated into far more effective healthcare delivery. Automating basic processes of healthcare ICT has made health administration processes more efficient, cost effective and reliable by automating the administrative, financial and clinical aspects of care, for example scheduling systems, ordering of medical supplies and access to lab test results.ICT has enabled proper data storage and retrieval, thus reducing the time and effort spent on healthcare administra- tion and management. The use of ICT has also benefited patients, especially pregnant moth- ers, who find it much easier to make appoint- ments to see their doctors. In Sri Lanka, e-chan- nelling helps patients in remote areas to make appointments with medical specialists in Colombo without the hassle of travelling. Enabling remote healthcare through telemedicine Telemedicine has the potential to bridge the rural-urban divide, providing patients and health professionals in remote areas real-time access to medical knowledge.34 In the long run, telemedi- cine will improve maternal health and lower medical costs. ICT can be potentially used to increase the transparency and efficiency of gov- ernance, thus improving the availability and delivery of public health services. It empowers the poor and improve the delivery of basic health services (Chandrasekhar and Ghosh 2001). ICT can be a formidable and cost-effective develop- ment tool for maternal health (ITU 2002). Telemedicine can impact maternal health by decreasing the relocation costs of health special- ists, thus lowering the cost of healthcare (UNDP 2003b). For developing countries with an acute shortage of health practitioners, telemedicine may be the most practical means to provide good maternal healthcare services to the people. It can also be an effective tool to provide valu- able information on how to address common maternal ailments and concerns like anaemia, care during pregnancy and lactation,diet,age at marriage, etc. In many Asian countries, where women face social barriers in seeking out the information openly on sensitive issues that directly affect their health, telemedicine has the potential to provide scientific information and facilitate the sharing of the experiences on con- traception, child spacing and parity, menstrual and other sexual health issues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "669f4a4c-3a12-47ed-a53b-a0a667abb71d": {"__data__": {"id_": "669f4a4c-3a12-47ed-a53b-a0a667abb71d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "050cebcaa2959cb5f14d125b7afdfbf922a0d1476ef678f38090e20aa27e23c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "87423ac2-efab-411e-ad14-d16bf5420f5d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d510b356fb32ac0e1d710c186a8254a927b7061d5eec2e7f8f1b54dc33dd88e6"}}, "hash": "1d7d77896238f5dbdeb8f9205ff87c5751f510f4d46a4085778ab36c3386f20c", "text": "Telemedicine and telehealth applications are not limited exclusively to expensive,high band- width services.

ICT for the fight against HIV/AIDS,malaria,and other diseases In addressing diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis (TB), ICT can provide opportu- nities for innovative solutions. This is especially crucial for infectious and communicable dis- eases, particularly HIV/AIDS. Given the current and projected impact of the pandemic, reversing HIV/AIDS has become a critical MDG (Bj\u00f6rkman 2002). ICT is seen as a potential tool in the global response to the pan- demic because it offers, at relatively low cost, access to information and knowledge for those working on the problem, for those suffering from the disease or its effects, for those who need to take preventive action, as well as for care givers and other family members. It allows networks that have potential to link partners in 49 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals different spheres and location in their efforts to apply the rapidly increasing knowledge to action (Driscoll 2001). With HIV/AIDS emerging as a broader develop- ment concern, not just a health issue, ICT can also facilitate inter-departmental coordination within the governments, mainstream HIV/AIDS, create health awareness and help prevention through appropriate information dissemination across departments. ICT can be used as a tool for advocacy, aware- ness building, and education not only aimed at preventing transmission of diseases,but also for facilitating support groups, counseling, etc. Public broadcast media like radio and TV have a long history of effectively facilitating the dis- semination of public health messages and dis- ease prevention techniques in developing countries (UNDP 2001). The number of new HIV/AIDS cases in Thailand dropped from 143,000 in 1991 to 29,000 in 2000 due in part to a 48 million dollar education and public health campaign. Led by Meechai Viravaidhya, former deputy prime minister of Thailand and presi- dent of the Population and Community Development Association (PDA), 488 radio sta- tions and 15 TV stations aired HIV/AIDS preven- tive messages for 30 seconds every hour. ICT can be a surveillance tool to examine emerg- ing trends of a disease and identify potential problem areas. It can collect and analyse health information, measure outcomes and dissemi- nate information to relevant audience. The Malaria Research Unit of the Department of Parasitology at the University of Colombo\u2019s medical faculty uses the Geographic Information System (GIS) to monitor the spread of malaria at several selected Grama Niladhari divisions at Badulla and Moneragala districts,Sri Lanka. This GIS database was developed using data collected between 1997 and 2002. Based on this, the Unit prepared a risk map to indicate malaria-prone areas. ICT can support HIV/AIDS research in many ways such as facilitating better response to a disease pandemic through sharing the lessons learnt, treatment practices and guidelines with other healthcare professionals, NGOs, researchers and policy makers during the out- break. ICT can also be used for continuing edu- cation or life-long learning for healthcare work- ers so that they can keep up with the latest developments and knowledge. PakMediNet is an online portal in Pakistan that facilitates research and provides access to Pakistani med- ical journals. So far, it has managed to archive and store 39 medical journals, a phenomenal achievement in the absence of financial sup- port. ICT allows healthcare providers, researchers and policy makers to communicate via local or glob- al discussion groups and/or bulletin boards, which serve as a venue for sharing and consulta- tions on health issues. India\u2019s Saathii (Solidarity and Action Against the HIV Infection in India) is an organisation that seeks to disseminate research, training and funding-related informa- tion on a real-time basis to those with limited access to libraries and the Internet.It publishes a weekly or daily e-newsletter, providing informa- tion on current research advances in behaviour- al, basic science and clinical aspects of HIV/AIDS that are relevant to resource-limited settings.

Additionally, ICT serves as an unparalleled enabler of communicating awareness and infor- mation about the importance of the environ- ment. The greatest advantage that ICT offers in any society and local community is the effec- tiveness of this tremendous tool in exchanging ideas and knowledge with different stakehold- ers to garner support from not only within a nation but also from global resources. 50 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals ICT enables a better understanding of issues such as climate change and biodiversity. The power of ICT as an information and networking medium enables citizens to act as environmental enforcement agents, alerting decision makers to compliance infringements while leveraging on their power to reach and influence public opin- ion. Any programme that provides connectivity has the potential to increase sustainability,given appropriate content and training. Two applica- tion areas key to natural resource management are GIS mapping and land registration. Both are relatively new developments founded on what most call geospatial technologies. ICT can contribute to environmental sustainability by providing public access to information; means of participation by the public for decision making (open forum);information dissemination;account- ability of governments; public awareness; promo- tion of green techniques and technologies;source of alternative livelihoods;and environmental mon- itoring,mapping and management. Training of skilled people and connectivity remain the two major challenges facing Asia. In many countries, although computer infrastruc- ture does exist, key environment institutions have difficulty connecting to the internet. Additionally, limited awareness of the role of ICT amongst decision makers must be addressed. Progress is yet to be seen as national policies have not translated environmental vision into specific goals.Asian countries have not been very successful in articulating a coherent vision which can be facilitated through the potential of ICTs (United Nations 2003b). Geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing GIS and satellite remote sensing have played an important role in collecting information, pin- pointing sensitive and vulnerable forest, water- shed and fragile marine ecosystems which are of critical relevance to the livelihoods of the most excluded sections of the population.They provide essential information on both the quan- tity and quality of forest land, wildlife and marine resources. GIS has also been instrumen- tal in monitoring changes in forest land. In Thailand,\u2018Forest Loves the Water and the Land\u2019 project used satellite images to identify denud- ed forest areas in five northern provinces.36 GIS was applied for India\u2019s rehabilitation of the water distribution system in Mirzapur in the state of Uttar Pradesh.In Sri Lanka, remote sens- ing and GIS techniques were applied for the detection of change in forest cover (UNDP 2003g). In this project, two Landsat Thematic Map (TM) images from 1992 to 1998 were used to determine the deforestation in a selected area in Habarana, Polonnaruwa district, North- Central Province. China used GIS and Remote Sensing Systems to track urban development and arable land decrease in Shanghai between 1996 and 2000;NOVA and Radar images to track forest fires in North Eastern China in 1997; and floods along Dongting Lake in the Yangtze River Basin in 1998. In Mongolia, where herding is a way of life for rural population,satellite data and GIS are used for pasture management. Environmental databases The development of effective environmental databases that can be used for tracking the sta- tus of various environmental indicators and impacts is a key effort in utilising ICT application for environmental protection. China has created many national databases, for land evaluation and management, population, environment and sustainable development; land cover (by coun- ty), soil erosion, cultivated land by slope steep- ness and wetlands. The National Agricultural Research Centre (NARC) in Pakistan,provides the retrospective search facilities of 23 international databases available on CD-ROMs, including those on major agriculture and life sciences. In Sri Lanka, the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), part of the global network known as Consultative Group of International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), is committed to maintaining freshwater resources and irrigation research information in databases and dissemi- nating them through its extensive website.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4bed02ae-2322-4457-8223-7c55c85bb491": {"__data__": {"id_": "4bed02ae-2322-4457-8223-7c55c85bb491", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6ede9e0677fc26f40ecc3172ffbf208e58a1a5fbbe5a4328d2df3ef41e0a49a2"}, "2": {"node_id": "da629982-08a8-4e47-bc8d-b6a6485e2a91", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2afe33d24cb0d1485a2e8fda35c43b7c689dd620eb7b3fab6995fd5cb60848a5"}}, "hash": "3e4b4bf051dc469957e04a0352f4cd6f7b7591531dd89baf6a4918d9534be254", "text": "In Malaysia, ASEAN Review of Biodiversity and Environmental Conservation (ARBEC) provides an on-line platform, www.arbec.com.my, for the effective dissemination of critical research among the members of the Biodiversity Community in Asia and the World.

Municipal solid waste and pollution management One of the interesting applications of the infor- mation revolution is improved solid waste man- agement, including its reduced generation. Inventory management systems, traditionally used for efficient business processes, have been customised to address this important concern. Better calculation of mass demand and customi- sation is possible through the use of ICT.In India, dramatic and immediate service improvement was achieved with a new solid waste collection system for the city of Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh (Gibbons 2003). Solid waste collection depots have been constructed throughout the city in order to eliminate the secondary collection of solid waste. For pollution control, the Self-Monitoring And Reporting Tool (SMART) in Pakistan maintains a database of industrial activity, where the data on the emissions and pollution levels generated by specific industries are available. Environmental sustainability through a knowledge society ICT can help in the diffusion of knowledge,breaking the monopolies of experts and elites and,thus,cre- ating an increased awareness about core environ- mental concerns and issues. Promoting such a knowledge-based society can enhance self-gover- nance where citizens are infused with appropriate value systems that emphasise a sustainable quality of life with best practices that may be replicated for universal benefit. Self-compliance for environmen- tal sustainability reduces the need for external reg- ulation and intervention.Garbage segregation,rain- water harvesting, minimising noise pollution are some examples of this.E-NVIRONMENT Malaysia is a virtual community set up by the Malaysian Nature Society to promote the study,appreciation,conser- vation and protection of Malaysian natural heritage. It has also set up online information kiosks at vari- ous nature locations such as the ones at the Kuala Selangor Nature Park and Boh Tea Estate. The Malaysian Cyber Plant Conservation Project has resulted in an electronic community committed to the conservation of the environment and plant genetic resources as well as the conservation and propagation of indigenous rare species and enhancing environmental awareness about their importance. It is also a virtual learning platform for 20 schools (on a pilot basis) on the importance of conserving the environment.Indonesia\u2019s Ministry of Environment is also working to develop other appli- cations for environmental management that will be accessible to the public. ICT towards a global partnership for development Creating inclusive global partnerships is one of humanity\u2019s central challenges in the 21st Century. Although great opportunities exist in today\u2019s fast changing global economy, many developing nations have been left on the mar- gins,lacking the skills,technologies and financial resources to participate in global developments. The last MDG addresses the ways in which indus- trialised countries can assist developing coun- tries to achieve the other seven goals.This part- nership can be supported through the develop- ment and dissemination of information and communication technologies. Knowledge exchange and sharing of technical expertise can help developing nations in the new information age. Examples from the nine Asian countries reveal how they have used various initiatives that involve global partnerships through ICT. Governance The potential of ICT in addressing development goals and efficiency in government to streamline and improve public service delivery and interac- tions of the private sector and civil society with the government (e-procurement, forms and reg- istrations, etc.)37 can have far-reaching effects. In 1993, China initiated a Golden Customs project intended to create an integrated data communi- cation system connecting foreign trade compa- nies, banks, and the customs and tax authorities.

In India\u2019s Warana project, several government bodies have worked togeth- er to increase computer penetration to a cluster of 70 contiguous villages. Civil society is also collab- orating in this project. In 1984, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) established the International Television Trust for the Environment (TVE International) as a global non-profit organi- sation to raise awareness of environment, devel- opment, health and human rights issues through the media.Another global partnership was estab- lished between the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU) and Sri Lanka to provide skills train- ing, scholarships, and programme exchanges which has raised the broadcasting standards in Sri Lanka (Chanuka, Nalaka & Hasitha 2003). In Mongolia,the Millennium Development Gateway, which is part of the Global Development Gateway, uses ICT for development by sharing knowledge and experiences among 45 countries. Partnerships in education and research ICT tools have linked worldwide research insti- tutions enhancing scientific research and sup- ported the development of innovative projects. The networked communication between uni- versities and research organisations has increased collaborative efforts between institu- tions and countries. In China, educational insti- tutions have been aggressive in establishing partnerships with foreign institutions, which is facilitated by ICT. Indonesia has also been aggressive in using ICT to build partnerships with foreign research institutes to enhance its education sector, through projects such as the Global Distance Learning Network (GDLN) at the University of Indonesia. The Asia Technology Information Program (ATIP) of Tokyo\u2019s effort in global partnership is seen in its High Performance Computing (HPC) Asia conference that promotes accessible HPC activities in Asian countries and Australia, partnership between Asian and Australian universities and research institutions and their partners in the United States and European countries. Global public policy networks Global Public Policy Networks (GPPNs) are inter- national networks and coalitions that can work consensually in developing sustainable policy positions. They have been effective in drawing interest from a wide group of individuals and institutions with similar objectives although operating in different local environments.A good example is RosettaNet which is an international standard that is managed by RosettaNet Global,a non-profit organisation with a membership of more than 400, made up of the world\u2019s leading electronic companies,enabling companies in the supply chain to communicate and conduct busi- ness electronically through common codes for sourcing of parts and components. ICT facilitates the standardisation of formats, systems, stan- dards,codes and protocols which are essential for international collaboration and exchange. ICT as business tool to facilitate international trade The availability of commercial and unrestricted internet and e-mail facilities has radically trans- formed the way business is conducted with for- eign parties.Internet and e-mail have provided an easy and cost-effective means for business firms to communicate with foreign suppliers, partners and buyers. China has established wide public and private networks for global and regional net- working through the internet,such as the interna- tional website for the New Euro-Asian Continental Bridge cooperation,the International Network for Bamboo and Rattan and The Asian City Network. In Sri Lanka, the implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) has also resulted in the set- ting up of MARINET by Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) linking it with the shipping agents and the approval of some of the UN/EDIFACT (EDI For Administration, Commerce and Transport) stan- dards (Chanuka, Nalaka & Hasitha 2003). ICT can provide critical support for small and medi- um sized enterprises to access global markets with limited expenditures, for example, for advertising and overhead expenses. E-mail communication cuts costs and provides an instantaneous mode of communication linking suppliers and purchasers across the globe.

It also, however, highlights significant differences resulting in some countries, for example, Malaysia, China and Thailand, being clearly ahead of others. The analyses of human development and the achievement of MDGs in the nine countries show considerable diversity across countries, and yet demonstrate how ICT can break barriers to human knowledge, participation and eco- nomic opportunities.Although ICT constitutes a relatively recent phenomenon in the Asian land- scape, this study reveals a wide variety of uses and initiatives that have been developed in Asian countries. Towards some of the MDGs, there has been very successful strategic deploy- ment of ICT tools to address development con- cerns with only sporadic and isolated attempts in others.Thus,while there have been numerous innovative and successful experiences in apply- ing ICT for human development there are also significant gaps. The degree to which ICT can influence the achievement of MDGs is condi- tioned by: a) the inherent nature of a particular goal combined with the materiality of infor- mation and communication in achiev- ing it; b) three critical enabling factors \u2014 techno- logical, access-related and human. For example, in respect of the three MDGs on health, ICT contributes in several specific ways like improved healthcare management, patient health information,public health education and awareness and outreach through telemedicine. On the other hand, to combat hunger or make primary education universal, ICT has a more indirect and limited impact. Even where ICT can have a critical influence, its role is largely a facil- itating and complementing one to the more direct forms of intervention and service delivery. However, where ICT plays a strong and critical complementary role,it is essential for stakehold- ers to target ICT applications for achieving human development goals. This report reveals that while small scale and experimental applications of ICT provide ways to explore their potential, their extension and sustainability depends on the commitment and resources that stakeholders are able to mobilise. The success of ICT applications for human development depends on the perceived inter- ests and benefits of stakeholders,including gov- ernments, civil society organisations, the private sector and the individuals. In the context of developing countries, governments continue to be major players in ICT initiatives both in their capacity as policy makers as well as in their role as providers of ICT infrastructure and services.In addition, NGOs are fast emerging as innovative and effective users and purveyors of ICT. As high-cost infrastructure is a prerequisite for ICT IX Conclusion 54 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals development and diffusion, harnessing private sector resources and expertise are also impor- tant. The trend towards deregulation and liber- alisation of ICT industries is also increasing the role and importance of the private sector in the provision of infrastructure and services.As many of the experiences highlighted by this report clearly indicate, the successful harnessing of ICT for human development depends to a great extent on the creation of effective partnerships among all the stakeholders. Use of ICT in accelerating human progress rests, above all, on the will and unwavering commit- ment of nations, businesses and civil society institutions to dedicate themselves wholeheart- edly to the cause of human development and to achieve the clear targets set by MDGs. 55 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realising the Millennium Development Goals Appendices Appendix I: Millennium Development Goals and indicators Goals and Targets Indicators Goal 1: Eradicate Extreme Hunger and Poverty Goal 2: Achieve Universal Primary Education Goal 3: Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women Goal 4: Reduce Child Mortality 13.

In this sense, achievement of socio-political objec- tives would depend not merely on sector, region or gender specific use of the technology but on the overall system of governance.It is,therefore,not possible to determine the appropriate indicators of ICT without bringing in the larg- er issues of governance into consideration. 15 Countries like India and Pakistan are newcomers in the field and the impact of ICT can be expected to materialise on ground only with a certain time lag. 16 Given this perspective, the growth of ICT per se can be taken as desirable for achieving MDG, as it has been done in the existing literature for developed countries, unless of course there is evidence to the contrary.This implies that the importance of supply-side indicators of ICT may not be underplayed in the developing countries. 17 Given the absence of a clear policy perspective in many Asian countries, it may be proposed that each country designs a system of incentives and controls that would lead to the desired social outcome. 18 The institution of hosts has not developed due to different organisational structure and does not affect growth of these technologies. So this indicator is not included in the construction of ICT index. 19 These data are compiled from International Telecommunication Union (ITU), UNESCO and WITSA. See http://www.worldbank.org/data/countrydata/ictglance.htm 20 Ratings range from 1 to 7; the higher the value, the better is the country in terms of ICT diffusion to other spheres of activity. 21 The information on per centage of female workers in IT sector is not available. Hence, this indicator is taken as a proxy. 22 The Bank has also given a ranking of the countries based on the existence of a highly skilled IT job market. However, this may not be very useful in this analysis as its impact in terms of poverty alleviation or meeting other MDGs would be marginal. 23 United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM),\u201cThe", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "708a770b-449c-4c50-9ee4-4527eca2f7ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "708a770b-449c-4c50-9ee4-4527eca2f7ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4cc88e283d018e6ba99a1e911794bbe1ed2555eddb58f532ed9df3d9244546d7"}}, "hash": "4cc88e283d018e6ba99a1e911794bbe1ed2555eddb58f532ed9df3d9244546d7", "text": "World\u2019s Women 2000,\u201dNew York:United Nations,pg. 96. 24 These data are available from Women\u2019s Indicators and Statistical Database,Wistat,Version 4, United Nations. 25 The role of the government is likely to be significant in the context of achieving other MDG goals as well. 26 It is hoped that the Theory of Large Numbers will tend to minimise the bias implicit in the methodology, over a large number of such applications. 27 The mean for each indicator has been obtained by adding up the values of all the countries and dividing the total by 9.The new or scale-free value of each country, obtained through the division by mean, shows its relative position vis-\u00e0-vis the average of the nine countries, on that indicator. 28 e-Choupal at http://www.digitaldividend.org/knwldge_bank/knwldge_bank_01_echoupal.htm. 29 Beijing FarmKnow at http://www.farmknow.com. 30 Millennium Development Goals: Gender Equality 31.

International trade has been the engine of growth for many countries of Asia and the Pacific. The \u2018economic miracle\u2019 of the East Asian \u2018tigers\u2019 is due in large part to their ability to export to global markets and to develop production at a scale, and with the technology, that allows for higher returns. Poverty has broadly declined in the region, and hundreds of millions of people have experienced significant improvement in the quality of their lives. But some are being left behind. Several smaller countries in the region, especially the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), have not yet experienced significant gains from trade. The region\u2019s rural poor have languished from stagna- tion in agriculture, as the new riches of the global marketplace fail to reach the countryside, where most people live. Even in fast-growing countries, trade has led to widening disparities among regions, sectors and households. Many econo- mies, especially in East Asia, are unable to create enough jobs for their growing populations, especially for young people and women. The launch of the 2006 Asia-Pacific Human Development Report, Trade on Human Terms, comes at a critical time, with only a few months left before the end-of-year deadline for the completion of the Doha Development Round. We are at the mid-point of the ten-year Brussels Programme of Action for Least Developed Countries, and have less than a decade to achieve the targets of the Millennium Development Goals. As we see in the Report, daunting challenges remain. The link between trade, human Foreword development and poverty reduction has weakened. Incumbent WTO members have at times made it difficult for developing countries to gain a share in the benefits of globalization.

We expect these annual regional Reports to provide continuing analysis of critical development issues that will prove highly relevant at both the national and international levels. Kemal Dervis Administrator, UNDP vi The analysis and policy recommendations of this Report do not necessarily reflect the views of the United Nations Development Programme, its Executive Board or its Member States. The Report is an independent publication commissioned by UNDP. It is the fruit of a collaborative effort by a team of eminent experts, stakeholders, and the Human Development Unit team of the Regional Centre in Colombo. In Asia and the Pacific, trade has proved that it can provide jobs and higher incomes for millions. At the same time, many people have yet to benefit, including poor farmers margina- lized by trade barriers and distorted agricultural prices; workers who lose jobs in domestic indus- tries due to the reduction of tariffs on competing imports; women, who deserve higher wages and better working conditions but face the risk of displacement following the withdrawal of textile quotas; and overseas workers, who leave their loved ones behind and face discrimination and exploitation in search of jobs that can lead to improved lives back home. The Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006 is by and for the people of the Asia- Pacific region. It seeks to demystify trade-related issues, making them more accessible to a wider cross-section of people, thereby facilitating more informed debate and advocacy. In doing so, it hopes to promote human development in the region, focusing especially on the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. I am proud that this Report is the product of indigenous thinking by hundreds of people in the region; experts, scholars, government officials, representatives of non-governmental organiza- tions, civil society and the private sector, and many people from different walks of life. Preface The Report not only draws on many issue- and country-based studies and papers commis- sioned by UNDP, it also benefits from the feedback on the approach and content obtained from a number of regional workshops, stake- holder consultations and technical meetings. Thus, the process of gathering inputs and ideas from diverse, informed sources in the region has been very full and rich. Questions such as these provided the motivation for the Report: How does trade liberalization affect the conditions of the worse- off sections of the population? Is trade expansion contributing to higher employment and poverty reduction? The conclusion is that these links are not automatic, and will need to be engineered through favourable changes in the international trading regime and appropriate domestic policies. World leaders at the recent Global Summit of the United Nations resolved to spare no effort to free their fellow human beings from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty. We can make an enormous contribution to fulfilling this pledge \u2013 and bene- fiting farmers, women, industrial labourers, overseas workers and others left out so far \u2013 by ensuring that trade is on human terms and promotes a better life for all. Hafiz A. Pasha Director Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific UNDP vii This Report is the outcome of a truly collabora- tive venture. Persons deserving acknowledge- ment are so numerous, and have contributed in so many different ways, that no attempt to fully recognize their contribution can ever do justice. Nevertheless, it is necessary to acknowledge the contribution of as many as possible. Hafiz Pasha inspired and guided the work, and also provided numerous substantive inputs. The Report also benefited from specific suggestions from Kemal Dervis, UNDP Administrator. Colleagues in RCC provided ongoing inputs and support to the process.

In the richer countries of the West, the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century created huge new centres of global economic concentration: now, in the twenty-first century, the balance of power is not so much shifting as being far more widely dispersed. This is raising huge new questions: who will produce what, where and how? Above all, what impact will this have on people\u2019s lives \u2013 on their incomes, their The Asia-Pacific region has embraced free trade, but free trade will not embrace the poor unless countries pursue a bold new policy agenda harnessing economic growth to promote human development. health, their levels of education and their future prospects, on who they are and what they can become? In sum: what will all this mean for human development? Looking at it from the other perspective, what contribution can higher standards of human development make to expanding trade and economic growth? This Report responds to these questions from inside Asia and the Pacific. An extensive process of consultation among policymakers, academics, civil society groups, the private sector and other stakeholders has examined the most recent developments on trade and eco- nomic growth and tried to assess the impact on human development \u2013 more specifically, the effects on the region\u2019s poorest countries and on its poorest people. This is no simple task. This is, after all, a huge region, accommodating more than 60 per cent of the global population. Asia-Pacific countries are also very diverse, ranging from third to 140th out of 177 countries ranked worldwide on the Human Development Index for 2003. Since the pace of social and economic change is so rapid and the processes so complex across one of the most dynamic regions in the world, it is hard to encompass all of these. This Report, therefore, narrows the focus, for although it does consider patterns of trade and economic growth, it is primarily pre- occupied with the effects these are having on human development in the developing countries of the region. But it goes further \u2013 emphasizing Trade on Human Terms Overview Asia and the Pacific is rapidly becoming not just the workshop of the world, but the back office too ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 2 that neither trade nor growth can ever be ends in themselves; instead, they are simply means towards the larger goals of expanded human development and combating poverty and deprivation. Trade can certainly enhance human deve- lopment \u2013 but it can also hinder it. Trade is, after all, a profit-driven activity, and there are many examples from history that demonstrate what can happen when commercial gain takes precedence over human well-being: slavery, colonialism and apartheid are some extreme forms. Today also, the drive to export and import more goods and services typically triggers a series of complex and dynamic processes that produce both winners and losers. For just as trade liberalization can increase the opportu- nities for exports, it also exposes local producers to foreign competition that, particularly in poorer countries, they may be unable to with- stand. So as well as creating new opportunities, especially in the modern sector, it can also destroy the livelihoods of people working in simple manufacturing processes or in agri- culture. Faced with this potential damage, economic nationalists may argue for something close to autarchy \u2013 erecting higher trade barriers and aiming for national self-reliance; why depend on imports when you can make something very similar yourself? This has an emotional appeal but soon runs into practical limits. People in the twenty-first century have social and economic rights that can only be met through interna- tional trade: some exports will always be needed to generate the foreign exchange for essential imports, from pharmaceuticals, to food, to oil. At the other extreme are the proponents of free trade who would opt for no barriers at all \u2013 letting the market dictate the most economically suitable production locations. This may seem more seductive and plausible, but this too is fallacious, for it involves trade between unequal partners, allowing the richest and most powerful countries and companies to set the terms and leaving the poorer and weaker participants to accept what they are offered, while risking further inequalities both between countries and within countries. An Active State It might be thought that the best solution would be a simple division of responsibilities: let free and liberal markets take care of economic growth while requiring governments to address market failure and take responsibility for the implications of rising inequality \u2013 for social concerns and for human development prio-", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab37f682-4851-4f20-a682-fa2860781641": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab37f682-4851-4f20-a682-fa2860781641", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad84a5eee310d0c1c3ff166cacbca6f23099eeaff10d3bf19fe6d4d31c5f567c"}}, "hash": "ad84a5eee310d0c1c3ff166cacbca6f23099eeaff10d3bf19fe6d4d31c5f567c", "text": "rities. However, this division ignores the fact that trade, economic growth and human develop- ment have a symbiotic relationship. Each needs the other. One direct link is through tariff revenue. Removing or reducing tariffs can have a damaging impact on human development since many countries rely on customs and other duties for a high proportion of government income \u2013 in some Pacific Island countries, up to 70 per cent. Trade liberalization may thus demand dramatic cuts in public services as revenues fall. A second link concerns sequencing. Coun- tries may need to achieve certain levels of human development to prepare the ground for liberali- zation. Boosting international trade requires not only capital and technology but also a capable labour force. For this the state needs to take responsibility \u2013 ensuring that the basic capacities are in place to enable the private sector to take full advantage of liberalization. Trade has thus never been a matter for private industry alone; it has always been subject to active intervention from the state. Govern- ments usually recognize the value of the private sector as the main engine for economic growth, but they also know that it needs to be harnessed or guided to some extent if it is truly to serve human development. There are many examples from history that demonstrate what can happen when commercial gain takes precedence over human well- being. Trade has never been a matter for private industry alone; it has always been subject to active intervention from the state TRADE ON HUMAN TERMS: OVERVIEW 3 An Era of Rapid Growth and Trade Liberalization Keeping track of trade and economic develop- ment is a challenging task. These are often fast- moving processes, and Asia-Pacific has been the world\u2019s most rapidly-growing region. During the period 1990\u20132003, GDP grew annually on average by more than 7 per cent. Governments can take some credit for this since much of this rapid economic growth has taken place during a period of steady trade liberalization. In East Asia and the Pacific, liberalization started in the 1970s, and by 2000 average tariffs had fallen to 8 per cent. South Asia was slower to start liberalizing, but did so rapidly during the 1990s so that by 2000 average tariffs had fallen to 18 per cent. The lowering of tariffs has contributed to a rapid growth in trade. During the earlier periods, export growth was faster in East Asia and the Pacific than in South Asia, but in the 1990s it was dispersed more across the region. Thus, between 1990 and 2003, while East Asia and the Pacific continued to power ahead \u2013 and trade as a percentage of GDP increased from 45 to 81 per cent \u2013 the proportion in South Asia also increased: from 20 to 34 per cent. As a result, all Asian economies have become more open. Accompanying the increases in volume of trade have been dramatic transformations in the structure of trade. Some countries have moved on from merchandise exports and are also selling more services. Those exporting primary pro- ducts are now turning more to manufactured goods; and within manufacturing many enter- prises are now climbing the technological ladder towards more sophisticated products, though this is a phenomenon more evident in East Asia than in South Asia. What effect has the rapid increase in trade had on human development? One of the most disturbing outcomes is that for most developing countries in the region a greater engagement with international markets has been accom- panied by a rise in income inequality. On a more positive note, however, there has nevertheless been a substantial decline in poverty: between 1990 and 2001, the number of people living on less than $1 a day dropped by nearly a quarter of a billion. The slowest progress has been in the Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Despite increases in trade, many LDCs have had less success in reducing poverty. While in developing countries of the region the proportion of the population living below the $1-per-day poverty line is 22 per cent, for the LDCs it is 38 per cent. Indeed, across the region there is still evi- dence of extreme deprivation. This is clear from data on food consumption. Liberalizing agricul- tural markets may have helped reduce the price of food \u2013 particularly of crops produced with the backing of agriculture subsidies in the US and the EU. But this does not seem to have led to any consistent improvement in food security. Many more countries now have food deficits, and Asia still has more hungry people than any other region of the world \u2013 over", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8843cd9-6a8c-4ae6-9430-dcf1a68fe889": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8843cd9-6a8c-4ae6-9430-dcf1a68fe889", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea90939446dd7573529dc5d6825fdeafa37c2a19072afc32f4adef89a9a25b8d"}}, "hash": "ea90939446dd7573529dc5d6825fdeafa37c2a19072afc32f4adef89a9a25b8d", "text": "510 million. On the health front, the picture is generally positive. The period of trade-led growth has been accompanied by improvements in health, though these seem to have slowed in recent years. One looming problem, however, is that the WTO- induced agreements on intellectual property rights could start to restrict supplies of essential generic drugs. Trade might have been expected to raise education standards by giving people greater incentives to improve their skills. But here too progress has been inadequate. The greatest problems are in South Asia, where one child in five fails to enroll in primary school. Trade has also had a strong influence on gender relations. East Asia\u2019s export drive in the 1960s and 1970s relied heavily on the mobili- zation of female workers. By being able to earn an independent income, many women thus ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 4 obtained greater personal freedom \u2013 but only up to a certain point. Working women the world over are all too familiar with the double burden of housework and wage work outside the home. Within the workplace they are often second-class citizens when it comes to the management and organization of work, and can also find them- selves exposed to sexual harassment. Expanding the Employment Channel Indeed, for both men and women, the main channel for all these effects of trade on human development, for better or for worse, is through employment. Ideally, more trade should mean more jobs and less unemployment. Unfortu- nately, in recent years this has often not been the case. Although Asian countries created jobs quite rapidly in the 1980s \u2013 337 million in total \u2013 they created far fewer, 176 million, in the 1990s. This has not provided sufficient jobs for a rising population: between 1993 and 2003 in South- East Asia, unemployment increased from 3.9 to 6.3 per cent. Worryingly, the situation is often more serious in some of the most trade-intensive countries: China and Singapore, for example, have seen unemployment rates increase substan- tially. Most of this burden has fallen on young people: in 2004, while those aged 15 to 24 made up one-fifth of Asia-Pacific\u2019s labour force, they constituted nearly half of the unemployed. Women too have lost out: in most countries their unemployment rates are higher than men\u2019s. Why is the region experiencing \u2018jobless growth\u2019? Most of the problems are in East Asia and especially in manufacturing, for although manufacturing output increased by almost 180 per cent in the 1990s, the associated employ- ment increased by only 3 per cent. This is princi- pally because manufacturing has been moving from low-tech, labour-intensive industries, such as garments, to high-tech and more capital- intensive ones such as electronics \u2013 and even within more labour-intensive manufacturing, companies have continued to invest in labour- saving equipment. The employment situation is different in South Asia. Here, despite a slight deceleration in the rate of economic growth, employment has continued to rise, if only modestly. This is because South Asia has yet to experience wide- spread structural change \u2013 continuing to rely on traditional labour-intensive and natural- resource-based industries. This may have led to slower growth, but has at least spread the bene- fits more evenly. The experience of the Asia-Pacific region has thus clearly demonstrated that trade by itself cannot address inequalities; indeed, it may well make them worse. Governments are increasingly recognizing that they must devise complemen- tary policies to ensure that increased engagement with international markets also generates jobs and promotes human development. Making Agricultural Trade Work for the Poor These jobs cannot be confined to the modern urban industrial or service sectors; they must also be generated in the rural areas and in agriculture. While setting their sights on inter- national trade, many governments in the region have been neglecting agriculture and investing far less in rural development. In fact, trade liberalization itself has often undermined natio- nal food production by allowing imports of cheap food; these will benefit low-income consumers, but they can also threaten the live- lihoods of poor farmers and fishing communi- ties, with serious implications for equity. The most striking evidence of rural neglect has been a serious deterioration in the balance of agricultural trade. In the early 1960s, the developing countries had an overall annual agricultural trade surplus of almost $7 billion, but since the beginning of the 1990s they have The main channel for all these effects of trade on human development, for better or for worse, is through employment TRADE ON HUMAN TERMS: OVERVIEW 5 generally been net importers of agricultural products, with a deficit in 2001, for example, of $11 billion.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d221419a-f57b-45b1-acea-b71149526ed4": {"__data__": {"id_": "d221419a-f57b-45b1-acea-b71149526ed4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9980eb0b711051e8082b7926d3d21590b85bdd1e8c59302fa60c128844b4748f"}}, "hash": "9980eb0b711051e8082b7926d3d21590b85bdd1e8c59302fa60c128844b4748f", "text": "Countries in the Asia-Pacific region have contributed to this rising imbalance. True, in global markets they have never been major players. Indeed, of the truly successful Asian exporters only China has earned that success even partly through agricultural exports \u2013 though countries like Malaysia and the Republic of Korea have used surpluses from agriculture to invest in their export sectors. Even today, Viet Nam has agricultural exports as an important source of foreign exchange. More worrying, however, is that a number of countries are not just exporting less. They, and particularly China, are likely to become major importers. As a result, global food supplies could become much tighter. This raises questions of food security. Food is not like any other tradable commodity, and most countries prefer some- thing closer to national self-sufficiency. This will mean, therefore, putting more emphasis on local production and giving greater protection for farmers who find it difficult to compete at world prices, especially when these are distorted by subsidies in the US and the EU that have enabled them to export below the cost of production. Asia and the Pacific has much to gain by promoting equitable agricultural trade gene- rally, but this is particularly true in fish trade. Countries in the region account for more than one-third of global exports of fish and fish products. China is now the world\u2019s largest exporter of fish, while Japan is the world\u2019s largest importer, but the fish trade is important throughout the region. Indeed, the Asia-Pacific region is home to 85 per cent of the world\u2019s fishers and 95 per cent of its fish farmers. In some respects, fishers are in a stronger position than farmers because they sell a larger proportion of their output on a regular and consistent basis. In other respects, however, they can be more vulnerable, whether as a result of natural factors such as variations in the fish catch, bad weather, and exposure to cyclones, or as a result of economic factors such as price fluctuations and variable access to markets. Many fishing communities already have low incomes, but their situation could get worse as stocks are exhausted. Intense competition in open-access fisheries is leading to overfishing in several commercially important fisheries. The Asian fishing sector also faces problems acces- sing markets in developed countries where there are increasing demands for higher standards of food safety. Developing countries face some complex choices for policies on agricultural trade \u2013 deciding to what extent they can rely on imports. Some have chosen to invest outside agriculture, or even within agriculture, but have concen- trated on exportable commodities. This may seem rational from the point of view of econo- mic efficiency, but it may be irrational from the perspective of human development. For while increasing agricultural trade might boost econo- mic growth and benefit poor consumers, it is also likely to depress local prices and undermine the livelihoods of poor farmers. Adjusting to a New Era for Textiles and Clothing Another area of critical importance to many poor households is the textiles and clothing industry, which in so many countries has served as the launching pad for industrial development. In this case the Asia-Pacific region finds itself in the midst of a potential upheaval now that the elaborate quota system under the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA) has come to an end. The MFA deliberately constrained imports from the region\u2019s larger producers, notably China and India, but offered quotas to many other countries such as Bangladesh and Nepal, which used them as the basis for new industries. The outcome was a highly dispersed textiles and These jobs cannot be confined to the modern urban industrial or service sectors; they must also be generated in the rural areas and in agriculture ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 6 clothing industry across the region, providing employment for hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged and lower-skilled workers, most of whom were women \u2013 90 per cent in both Bangladesh and Cambodia and 87 per cent in Sri Lanka. Since that era concluded at the end of 2004, many of these new producers are struggling to adjust to direct competition, particularly with China. Thus far, the outcome for some countries has not been as bad as had been feared. Indeed, Asian producers overall have fared better than those in other regions and have increased their share of exports to the US and the EU. But, as expected, the benefits were unequally shared. The main winners have been China and India; the main losers have been Nepal, Philippines, Thailand and Pakistan. Nevertheless, it is notable that a number of countries that had", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b72a315-8bd8-4df7-8b05-388f0ec0c8be": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b72a315-8bd8-4df7-8b05-388f0ec0c8be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b4fc729a0ac434c02749b216a4372b435a274d6511e8ffe9e427e1a79cd5b0d8"}}, "hash": "b4fc729a0ac434c02749b216a4372b435a274d6511e8ffe9e427e1a79cd5b0d8", "text": "also relied on quotas have been able to maintain or even increase their shares \u2013 Cambodia, Viet Nam, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Even now, however, it is difficult to envisage the future shape of the textiles and clothing trade, since the developed countries have been defending themselves against rising imports with temporary restrictions. What is clear, however, is that the only way to survive in a competitive global market is by upgrading the industry and increasing both the quality and quantity of output. This will also mean improving working conditions, not least because exporters are coming under pressure from fair-trade organiza- tions to guarantee that their goods are not produced under exploitative conditions. Higher levels of trade in textiles and clothing can pro- mote human development, but only if govern- ments and employers take the necessary action. Selling Services Across Borders Asian countries continue to rely on the interna- tional trade in goods. But over the last three decades they have been taking advantage of the opportunities to boost the trade in services, and international trade has consequently become much more complex. Three forms of cross- border services are discussed: either the seller moves, as in international labour migration; or the work moves, as with business outsourcing; or the buyer moves, as with international tourism. All three types of movement have increased significantly. For migration, millions of lower- skilled workers continue to travel abroad on short-term contracts: an estimated 10 per cent of the Philippines labour force and 12 per cent of the Sri Lankan labour force now work overseas. Many labour migrants have improved their standard of life, and even some of the poorest have earned enough to lift their families out of poverty. But they can also work under exploitative conditions and have their home lives severely disrupted. Both source and destination countries can make migration a more productive and fulfilling experience: source countries can ensure that migrants are well-informed, financed and trained before they travel, and destination countries can make migration processes simpler and more trans-parent. Asia has also been a pioneer in the off- shoring of IT and business process services: in some cases IT workers continue to travel over- seas on short-term assignments in developed countries, but advances in information and communications technology, and falling inter- net connectivity costs, have allowed more and more of these services to be delivered remotely \u2013 providing jobs for highly educated young people as well as drawing into the workforce other groups such as retirees. However, this too has human costs: for example, long night shifts can lead to adverse health effects and preclude a normal social life, isolating workers from their communities. Moreover, the rapid growth of the outsourcing industry is also widening regional disparities. Governments will also be concerned that they are not producing enough skilled The only way to survive in a competitive global market is by upgrading industry and increasing both the quality and quantity of output TRADE ON HUMAN TERMS: OVERVIEW 7 people to keep expanding the industry. They do, however, have a range of policy options that can ensure outsourcing makes a stronger contribu- tion to human development, including building infrastructure, training the workforces and ensuring the best regulatory and fiscal envi- ronment. In tourism too, the Asia-Pacific region is one of the global leaders \u2013 increasing its share of global traffic from less than 10 per cent in the 1950s to 40 per cent in 2004. Tourism can offer new sources of employment even to the remotest regions. But here too there are potential costs, for example, of cultural dislocation, and of envi- ronmental destruction. Many of the problems can be resolved or minimized with proper plan- ning and management \u2013 for example, building the appropriate infrastructure, providing training to people working in smaller enter- prises, and ensuring better economic links between larger tourist operators and poor com- munities. Trade Opportunities for the Least Developed Countries All of these trade issues have a particular resonance in the Least Developed Countries (LDCs). For many LDCs, trade represents a significant proportion of economic activity. In fact, their trade-to-GDP ratios are often higher than those in many developing countries, or even developed ones. They also tend to have very open trade regimes, with low tariff or non-tariff barriers. Unfortunately, integrating with interna- tional trade does not seem to have produced a commensurate reduction in poverty. When it comes to integrating into international trade, the LDCs are in a very vulnerable position \u2013 typically they have small economies, difficult topographies, and are located far from international markets in which they are minor and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f04be81-161d-4ef7-92a4-843245b53880": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f04be81-161d-4ef7-92a4-843245b53880", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "20805e937937c098b9a23b748d6a86a9ea6b664f57121ccf475a9c225bb9ff0a"}}, "hash": "20805e937937c098b9a23b748d6a86a9ea6b664f57121ccf475a9c225bb9ff0a", "text": "weak players. In these circumstances, why would LDCs want to gain access to the World Trade Organi- zation and the further liberalization that this implies? Because the likely alternative is worse \u2013 marginalization or bilateral control by one or two major powers. With all its limitations, the multilateral WTO is still a better option if it offers some basic and consistent ground rules. However, later entrents have found the process of accession to the WTO very arduous. They lack the trained people needed to understand the implications of trade agreements. And because the rules for accession to the WTO are vague, the incumbent members have been able to exploit acceding members by imposing onerous conditions \u2013 generally narrowing their freedom of action on issues not just of tariffs but also intellectual property rights, and even on how they should run their economies, for example, on the pace and extent of privatization. The LDCs of the region can engage more fruitfully with the international trading system, but this will need more determined action at both national and international levels. This will mean, for example, giving a higher priority to trade issues, increasing investment and building stronger alliances. But above all, both the LDCs and the developed countries should ensure that trade initiatives and negotiations are based less on reciprocity and more on a human develop- ment perspective, taking advantage of opportu- nities for \u2018aid for trade\u2019. An Eight-Point Agenda How should the countries of Asia and the Pacific respond in a demanding new environment for international trade? Clearly, there can be no standard blueprint, especially for such a huge and diverse region. Nevertheless, there is a way of encompassing this diversity by viewing trade issues through a human development lens. The analysis in this Report suggests eight priorities that have a degree of general application: Asia has also been a pioneer in the offshoring of IT and business process services ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 8 1. Invest for Competitiveness In a globalizing world, public investment needs to take into account both national and inter- national considerations. Generally the type of investment will remain much the same, but it may need adjusting with an eye to international competitiveness. Thus, when looking at basic infrastructure, governments will need to ensure that they have the roads, railways, ports and telecommunications systems that align with national needs and also with the requirement of getting goods and services quickly and cheaply to international markets. But just as important as the physical infra- structure is human capital. The most successful trading countries have invested heavily in the basics of human development \u2013 generating a healthy and well-educated workforce that has the stamina, the skill and the flexibility to cope with a changing trading environment. Educa- tion has to start with strong and universal pri- mary schooling, but nowadays all countries need to make sure they have sufficient people with technical and managerial skills. People with good primary or secondary education can only make use of their potential for international trade if they have the support of others with higher levels of education, for example, in engi- neering, telecommunications, or accountancy. At the same time, many countries will need to invest more in research and development that raises productivity and specifically addresses the needs of poor people \u2013 continually assessing the most appropriate technologies that can capita- lize on national strengths. Some of this can be carried out through public-private partnerships, though most of the research into opportunities specifically for the poor is likely to take place in the public sector. 2. Adopt Strategic Trade Policies In a world of giant global players and fierce competition, no developing country now has the luxury of entering global markets and hoping for the best. Instead, states have to identify a few sectors and industries that have both short- and long-term potential in international markets and guide enterprises towards them. The chosen industries will vary from country to country but should be those with the greatest potential linkages with other industries so that they can also train more people in essential skills and thus offer important spillover benefits for the rest of the economy. Picking \u2018winners\u2019 is not, of course, a simple task. The aim should be to achieve a transparent policy compact between government and the private sector that uses a carrot-and-stick approach. The carrot will include the opportu- nity to operate behind tariff walls until com- panies are strong enough to compete interna- tionally. The stick is that such industries will be closely scrutinized to ensure that they are living up to their side of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3822a0b7-e88b-455f-b31c-70d697413e9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "3822a0b7-e88b-455f-b31c-70d697413e9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "120c50126b9aba833e4ab441a33bd1a7961a9742b6b85c62e5b372dfaab975b0"}}, "hash": "120c50126b9aba833e4ab441a33bd1a7961a9742b6b85c62e5b372dfaab975b0", "text": "bargain and are deve- loping steadily more competitive products and services for export. Enterprises should also be subject to a domestic competition policy designed to prevent them from abusing a monopoly position. The essential requirement for engagement in international trade, however, is that the process should be strategically planned and carefully sequenced. Thus, higher tariffs should be rigidly time-bound: in order to avoid creating cosy monopolies that never mature into vigorous export enterprises, tariffs should automatically be scaled down after a predetermined period. 3. Restore a Focus on Agriculture A trade strategy based on human development has to have agriculture at its core. This is not because agriculture offers export opportunities, but because in many countries farming is still the primary source of income for the poor; so no trade strategy that undermines rural livelihoods can claim to be promoting human development. For food-importing countries in particular, it will The most successful trading countries have invested heavily in the basics of human development TRADE ON HUMAN TERMS: OVERVIEW 9 often, make sense to maintain tariffs on food imports so as to protect poor producers. If this results in higher prices that cause hardship for the poorest consumers, governments will need to prepare appropriate social safety nets. This also has the strategic advantage of preserving national food security in a world that in just a few years could be moving towards higher food prices. As well as protection, farmers also need progress. In many countries investment in rural development has been on a steep downward curve. This has to be reversed \u2013 particularly through investment: for example, in irrigation, in village electrification and in farm-to-market roads. 4. Combat Jobless Growth Most countries that embark on industrialization typically do so with labour-intensive production in industries like garments, textiles and foot- wear that take advantage of ample supplies of low-cost labour. But as industrialization pro- ceeds, they tend to move higher up the value chain and also become more capital-intensive. As a result, the most successful trading coun- tries, primarily in East Asia, are now creating jobs far more slowly \u2013 the phenomenon of \u2018jobless growth\u2019. To some extent this process is understand- able. Less comprehensible, however, is why governments should exacerbate this trend by maintaining low interest rates \u2013 effectively giv- ing capital preference over labour. This may seem like the best strategy for rapid growth but it is storing up problems for the future. By all means allow enterprises to choose the lowest- cost option for production, but this choice should not be biased away from labour: interest rates should, therefore, reflect the real price of capital, not the rate that industrialists would prefer. In a similar vein, states should phase out fiscal incentives to enterprises since these raise the return on capital and again encourage capital-intensive investments. Another reason why enterprises may be reluctant to take on new workers is that labour contracts can be too rigid. This creates a persis- tent duality \u2013 a small and protected group of \u2018insiders\u2019 with secure employment influenced by national regulations, and a large casual, and often exploited, workforce employed on piece rates. Instead, more workers should steadily be absorbed into formal employment but on contracts sufficiently flexible that they can readily be deployed to other sectors or compa- nies as trading conditions change. Governments can assist in this process by providing some support for workers through health insurance and social security and by active labour market policies to encourage retraining and redeploy- ment. 5. Prepare a New Tax Regime Liberalization is a common prescription for economic success, but it has a debilitating side effect \u2013 it means foregoing a predictable and easy-to-collect source of government revenue. Instead governments need to have an alternative tax regime in place before embarking on liberalization. Care will need to be taken, however, to ensure that these new taxes are progressive and do not hurt the poor. Customs duties, for example, are often quite progressive since they are typically highest on the luxury items that are of greater interest to the rich. Corporate taxes too can be levied progressively, though many people escape the net since the lawyers of the largest corporations are skilled at techniques of tax planning, while most enterprises in the informal sector simply evade tax collectors alto- gether. Much the same is true for income tax, which tends to be paid more by middle-income workers in government or the formal sector. Garnering more income from corporate or income tax will mean overhauling the tax codes to close loopholes and also considering other options such as \u2018withholding taxes\u2019.

And the more advanced can adopt value added tax (VAT) \u2013 though this assumes a thoroughly documented economy and needs to be developed with care; in any case, it should exempt food and other necessities of the poor. The key point is that these new sources of revenue should be up and running prior to liberalization or countries face the risk of severe cuts in public services that will harm human development. 6. Maintain Stable and Realistic Exchange Rates One thing that hampers international trade and discourages investment is a volatile exchange rate that makes it difficult for states or enterpri- ses to plan ahead. But it is important too that the rate is realistic: too high and it will jeopardize employment prospects for the poor by penalizing exporters as well as farmers and other local producers who will face increased competition from imports; too low and it will raise the domestic price level and affect the cost of living of the poor. Exchange rates are likely to fluctuate, especially in small and open economies that are powerless against the rise or fall in international commodity prices. With floating exchange rates, these economies are also susceptible to the \u2018Dutch disease\u2019 in which inflows of capital without sufficient investment opportunities to absorb them can appreciate the exchange rate to unrealistic levels. This may happen as a result of rising commodity prices as, for example, with the oil price for Timor-Leste. But it can also be the result of inflows of aid, say, or of the arrival of funds for disaster relief as with the tsunami. Most of the successful Asian trading coun- tries have benefited from long periods of relative exchange-rate stability based on active currency management. For this purpose, during the initial process of liberalization, rather than having freely floating exchange rates, countries that are becoming more involved with international trade can consider \u2018managed floats\u2019 that permit their currencies to depreciate gradually \u2013 since in the early stages of liberalization imports typically rise faster than exports. The overall priority, however, is to ensure that the exchange rate remains stable and realistic. 7. Persist with Multilateralism The slow pace of progress in the Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations has discouraged many developing countries. They can see this \u2018development round\u2019 running into some familiar impediments, especially the resistance from the developed countries over agricultural subsidies. This is leading at best to pessimism and at worst to a crisis of falling expectations that could cause the developing countries to abandon multilatera- lism altogether. Despairing of the WTO negotiations, many countries are also seeking bilateral trade agree- ments with the developed countries. Some would argue that in trade terms these are better because they give preferential access. But in human deve- lopment terms they may impose high costs: bilateral agreements typically involve much deeper tariff concessions from the developing countries and make demands on issues like intellectual property rights that go far beyond what WTO members require of each other, and can threaten the health and livelihoods of the poor. Many countries of the region would do better to resist the immediate temptations of a bilateral embrace and build up slower but ulti- mately more productive multilateral relation- ships that can lead to more durable human development outcomes. 8.

In addition, they dovetail well with the region\u2019s many integrated cross-national production systems and lead to trade creation.

Reaching a Different Frontier With or without new multilateral agreements, globalization will continue to power ahead. And millions more workers in the Asia-Pacific region will find themselves producing goods for people on the other side of the globe as well as buying at lower prices goods their parents could scarcely have dreamed of. The main hazard, however, is that millions of others will fall by the wayside \u2013 abandoned in rural areas whose agricultural economies have drifted into decline, or scratching a living on the fringes of Asia\u2019s megacities as a permanent underclass. Even those currently in work may find themselves later discarded from ever-more sophisticated production systems. This not only denies people their basic rights to decent work and a reasonable standard of living, it also heightens the risk of future unrest: globalization does not just distribute products; it also dissemi- nates new ideas and information that change people\u2019s expectations. The countries of the Asia-Pacific region are renowned for the speed at which they have developed economically. Now they find them- selves at a different frontier \u2013 trying to combine accelerated trade-driven economic growth with equally rapid poverty reduction and, more broadly, human development. In many ways this is a more complex and difficult task, and just as before, they will need to work out their own solutions. Some of these are highlighted in this Report; others will only emerge in the light of experience. One thing is certain \u2013 that Asia and the Pacific will remain at the forefront of global development and will offer fresh lessons to the rest of the world. Asia and the Pacific will remain at the forefront of global development and will offer fresh lessons to the rest of the world CHAPTER 1: USING INTERNATIONAL TRADE TO PROMOTE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 15 The early years of the new millennium have witnessed a robust expansion in world trade. In 2004, global merchandise trade recorded its best performance since 2000, growing in volume by 9 per cent and in value by 21 per cent.1 Manufacturing took the lead: although global manufacturing output grew by only 4 per cent, an increasing proportion of this output is traded internationally, and as a result the volume of manufactured exports rose by 10 per cent. Nevertheless, trade in agricultural products also grew in value, by 15 per cent. At the same time, there was a substantial increase in trade in commercial services, which increased in value by 18 per cent. These figures build on an already creditable growth performance for 2003. An increasingly integrated world has clearly been expanding the opportunities for global trade. But what contribution can trade make to development? The dominant view has been that engagement with international markets is not just unavoidable but also beneficial: that trade can facilitate, promote and sustain the develop- ment process. Indeed, for individual nations trade is seen as a prerequisite for sustained growth. Governments taking that view have therefore devised policies to promote trade, and to shape the nature and degree of national engagement with the international economy. The larger developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region (Box 1.1) have also made the greatest impact, but the smaller ones too have been Deeper integration with international markets can boost economic growth and generate millions of new jobs. But it also brings new risks \u2013 of further marginalizing the Least Developed Countries and undermining the most vulnerable communities. The challenge is to build a trading regime that is not just more balanced and equitable but also actively combats poverty and promotes human development. exploiting new opportunities for trade in services, through tourism, for example, the migration of workers and the outsourcing of business processes. This Report argues, however, that trade need not be \u2013 indeed, should not be \u2013 an end in itself. Rather, it should realize a broad range of human development objectives, and especially in the poorest and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) it should help to alleviate poverty and reduce human deprivation.

Trade can certainly enhance human deve- lopment, but it can also hinder it. Trade is, after all, a profit-driven activity, and there are many examples from history that demonstrate what happens when commercial gain takes precedence over human well-being \u2013 for example, slavery, colonialism and apartheid. Today too the drive to export and import more goods and services typically triggers a series of complex and dyna- mic processes that produce both winners and losers. For just as trade liberalization can incre- ase the opportunities for exports, it also exposes local producers to foreign competition that, par- ticularly in poorer countries, they may be unable to withstand. So as well as creating new oppor- tunities, particularly in the modern sector, it can also destroy the livelihoods of people working in basic manufacturing or in agriculture. These implications and the links between trade and human development are summarized in Figure 1.1. There are three basic building blocks in the diagram: trade, human develop- ment and the links between the two. The hypothesized chain is: trade \u2192 growth \u2192 human development \u2192 trade. There is thus a two-way causation: from trade to human development and back. Balancing Growth and Human Development Trade can fulfil its potential for alleviating poverty and advancing human development, but only if economic structures, domestic and inter- national, are refashioned and governments of both developed and developing countries show the necessary determination and commitment. One of the main tasks is to shape the charac- ter of economic growth. Experience has shown that growth can translate into higher levels of human development. But not necessarily. Much depends on the nature of growth. In some cases the human development outcomes may be limited, or even negative. Indeed, some Asia- Pacific countries that have had high growth driven by trade give cause for concern: industry and services are growing much faster than agri- culture; agricultural workers are being displaced on a large scale; rural-urban and interpersonal inequalities are widening; manufacturing growth is not creating enough new jobs, and much of the existing work is becoming more casual or informal. Most policymakers who seek to change these patterns know that they are not dealing with a static environment. The relationship Figure 1.1: Trade and human development \u2013 a schematic view Trade changes the structure of the economy as well as the rate of growth, which, in turn, has implications for employment both of labour and capital. Trade tends to reward skilled labour more highly than unskilled labour and can lead to the adoption of capital- intensive technologies and thus deepen inequality. However, public policy can be used to ensure that trade benefits human development. There is also a feedback loop from human development to trade, which operates directly or is mediated through the domestic policy framework. Feedback affects work through higher income, higher technical competence and skills or through the power of advocacy on policymakers. Finally, human development can also have a direct influence upon the structure of the economy, the rate of growth and trade itself. Trade can certainly enhance human development but it can also hinder it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3fb05629-7790-4250-809f-a97f4cc57670": {"__data__": {"id_": "3fb05629-7790-4250-809f-a97f4cc57670", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "908b095a9886a23eaeea66fff153f721f0a6c2709953f59d9fe0fac248a95130"}, "2": {"node_id": "bfcad462-3c6d-46b0-890b-dd770a074797", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ff6fec0932b226d908548a726487bf63cf9ec818779aeb487041ae1846c1fcb"}}, "hash": "6d0e368a0952699cef7e5af3bff2b31ead5dae8c43e315312246b74386476f8e", "text": "Trade can certainly enhance human development but it can also hinder it.

On the one hand, economic growth provides the resources to permit sustained improvements in human development; on the other hand, human deve- lopment improvements raise people\u2019s capacities to boost economic growth. But there are two alternative paths \u2013 \u2018lopsided\u2019 and \u2018balanced\u2019.2 Lopsided strategies can prioritize either economic growth or human development. Neither strategy is sustainable. \u2018Human-development-first\u2019 strategies can run into fiscal constraints and balance of payments crises, while \u2018growth-first\u2019 strategies can be constrained by inadequate domestic supply of skilled labour or by political instability. Far better to take a more balanced approach. But of the two lopsided approaches, the \u2018human- development-first\u2019 is the least unsatisfactory, since societies pursuing this strategy at least have a much better chance of weathering economic crises and getting back on track. Pursuing Growth through Trade Even if policymakers accept the need for balanced growth, is boosting trade a good way to achieve this? The answer is typically: \u2018yes\u2019. Proponents of trade liberalization argue that nowadays autarchy is not an option \u2013 that pur- suing a growth strategy that relies on producing local substitutes for imports will eventually run into limits because for many products the national market will be too small to justify local manufacture. Trade liberalization that involves reducing protective tariffs can therefore lead to a more efficient outcome \u2013 by delinking domestic supplies from domestic production. A country aiming for growth may find itself short of capital, for example, or of specific intermediate goods, or of skilled labour that it does not have locally. One way to overcome these bottlenecks is to import the requisite commodity from abroad. But doing so without triggering a balance of payments crisis will require sufficient foreign exchange. Thus, it may be crucial for a country to engage in trade merely to earn the foreign exchange to finance imports. Even China, which has seen rapid increases in exports over a long period, did not until recent years run a trade surplus \u2013 indeed, occasionally recorded deficits \u2013 because it used export revenue to finance its growing import bill, particularly for oil and machinery. Trade liberalization should also enable the poorer developing countries to make better use of their comparative advantage \u2013 an abundant supply of unskilled and inexpensive labour. They can thus at the outset specialize in the production and export of agricultural products and simple manufactured goods such as textiles and clothing. This should also increase the demand and wages for unskilled workers and thus help to reduce poverty. But beyond these \u2018static\u2019 gains from trade liberalization, there should also be more dynamic benefits that become evident over time. For example, enterprises that are more exposed to foreign competition and markets will be forced to increase their levels of efficiency. They can also benefit from foreign investment that might initially be attracted by cheap labour but will also bring with it new technology and produc- tion processes. Ideally, therefore, trade liberali- zation should help to boost productivity, increase exports, stimulate more rapid economic growth, and lead to increases in real wages, especially of unskilled workers. Unfortunately, many countries have fallen short of this ideal. Markets often fail, and in par- ticular, in developing countries they may not be sufficiently flexible to reallocate workers or capi- tal smoothly to the more productive sectors. As a result, liberalization will fail to create the hoped-for export enterprises while risking a flood of cheap imports that put local enterprises out of business. Proponents of trade liberalization argue that nowadays autarchy is not an option ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 18 Moreover, even if the new export industries emerge, there is a risk that these will become steadily less labour-intensive. Enterprises that want to enhance their competitive edge may try to do this by shedding excess labour and use automation to produce high-quality products to international standards. Thus, rather than employing more unskilled workers the export industries may instead further polarize \u2018dual labour markets\u2019 \u2013 consisting of a small formal sector where wages are influenced by govern- ment regulations and collective bargaining, and a much larger informal economy where wages tend to be linked to a subsistence level of income. The Potential for State Action It might be thought that a balanced approach that would enable trade to promote human development could be achieved by a clear division of responsibilities: let free and liberal markets take care of economic growth while governments address market failure and take responsibility for social concerns and human development priorities.

Trade liberalization, for example, will reduce trade- related taxes, which in many countries account for a significant share of government revenue. In South Asia overall, as a proportion of revenue, taxes on trade fell between 1990 and 2003 from 27 to 19 per cent.3 Pakistan is a striking example. During the 1990s, import taxes fell by almost 4 per cent of GDP. This was partially offset by a rise of 1 per cent of GDP in revenue from income tax; nevertheless, the overall loss in tax revenue of 3 per cent of GDP clearly has adverse implications for human development. In the Pacific Island countries customs and other duties can provide up to 70 per cent of government revenue.4 Bangladesh, on the other hand, has been able to offset losses, from reduced tariff rates by rising volumes of imports and by introducing new sources of tax revenue such as VAT (Box 1.2). A second objection to this clear-cut division concerns sequencing \u2013 since human development may be needed to advance economic growth. In the short run, countries may have to devote resources to human development, even at the expense of growth, because they believe that higher capabilities will, in the longer term, lead to more sustainable growth. Successful industrialization requires not only capital and technology but also a capable labour force \u2013 one that can manage that capital and technology and display the discipline demanded by factory production. That capability is directly related to literacy, education, and status of health. In the now-advanced countries, for example, social programmes in health and education helped to buttress industrial development and raise productivity. If growth limits or reverses human BOX 1.2 RECOVERING REVENUE LOSSES FROM TRADE LIBERALIZATION IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh undertook trade liberalization in the early 1990s and over the decade virtually halved its effective rate of import duties. But revenue losses were limited to less than 0.5 per cent of the GDP. There were two reasons for this. First, because as import duties fell the volume of imports increased \u2013 17 per cent annually over the decade, in local currency \u2013 on the back of fast- growing exports, especially of textiles. Moreover, the tax base widened as export industries expanded. Second, Bangladesh developed VAT and supplementary excises which, given a broader tax base, produced rapidly growing revenues. Also, special efforts have been made in recent years to raise revenues from taxes on income and profits, primarily by curbing evasion (Table 1).

Most governments have, therefore, felt the need to intervene in order to achieve trading success \u2013 a process with deep historical roots (Box 1.3). A good outcome from international trade is thought to depend on three kinds of State action. First, the State must create the capacity to engage successfully in trade: enhancing the quality and competitiveness of the domestic labour force; easing the cross-border movement of commodities and services; and investing in the market development that allows for the entry and growth of competitive players. Second, the State needs to protect the vulnerable. Enhanced trade generates both winners and losers: those who get left behind may lose their livelihoods or see their incomes drop or suffer from greater food insecurity. This erosion of human development is not only unacceptable in itself, it may also undermine the social consensus needed to pursue a strategy of enhanced trade engagement. The State must, therefore, also create the safety nets needed to protect the vulnerable. Third, the State should be able to guide industrial strategy. With its broader vision, it should be able to assess the international context and changes in the global production system. It should therefore be able to identify niche areas, encourage entry into these and invest in the Research and Development (R&D) needed to build competitiveness in emerging sectors. These three functions are indeed crucial. But they may not be sufficient. In a developing country, the State may also need to find ways of counteracting the imbalances in international markets. It will need to take account, for example, of the sharp differences in national trading capabilities, the substantial disparities in the size, market presence and reserves of competing partners, and the control", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf770684-6163-49da-99fb-5d6706f01aca": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf770684-6163-49da-99fb-5d6706f01aca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66f25b24671c1d8f7efe8890391e52b75a6a164c069e3965dc83fd9f2c6a388b"}, "3": {"node_id": "1fb08970-ea52-4447-a172-9810706d37b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00c1a3cea1cfc07c777bb603f9938bbe379a4ce4ceffad26272e05f92c09633f"}}, "hash": "9a3f2db1f538512ddcfad9939ad4c911d0976a8f551e8007697e4f9754618575", "text": "exercised by a small group of players from a few developed countries on various frontline technologies. Faced with these imbalances, some govern- ments experiencing \u2018export pessimism\u2019 have retreated from the unequal struggle and concen- trated on producing for the home market behind high tariff barriers. This may have been under- standable, but it is unsustainable; no country can successfully pursue capitalist industrialization while insulated from world markets. Instead, as part of the strategy of growth, developing countries must consciously engage with those markets. A Proactive Approach Engaging with international trade does not mean passively integrating. To address the inequalities in the world trading system, developing countries need to take a more proactive stance. But to do so they need to distinguish between overall policies aimed at a \u2018greater involvement in trade\u2019, such as reduce transport costs, and those concerned simply with \u2018openness\u2019, such as reducing tariff barriers. These pose two different questions. The first is: \u2018does international trade boost economic growth?\u2019, to which the answer seems to be generally \u2018yes\u2019. The second is: \u2018do countries that reduce trade barriers grow faster than others?\u2019 \u2013 a question on which there is considerable controversy over the evidence.5 This suggests a more complex package of measures \u2013 and a more deliberate and less BOX 1.3 STATE INTERVENTION IN TRADE \u2013 AN AGE-OLD PHENOMENON In around AD 60, a trader coming from what is now Dhaka, Bangladesh, arrived in Rome from Jeddah carrying fine muslin. He provoked a near-riot and was plied with coins, gold and silver and was even offered equally valuable horses. The Emperor, Tiberius, became worried because the demand for these goods was annually depleting the Roman coffers by almost 50 million sesterces, the trading bullion. So he banned the sale of \u2018woven air\u2019 \u2013 the finest muslin. Indeed, he was so concerned that he deployed soldiers to keep the fabric out of Rome. The flow of commerce across national borders is an age-old phenomenon \u2013 but so too are State policies to control trade for public purposes. Source: Bandyopadhyay 2005. Most governments have felt the need to intervene in order to achieve trading success ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 20 haphazard approach to removing trade barriers (Box 1.4). One of the most important objectives should be to encourage and protect domestic producers in certain strategic sectors \u2013 affording them the time and space to expand production for the domestic market while strengthening their capacity to compete internationally. This strategy, which is essentially the one previously followed by Western countries, will typically mean limiting the import of some finished goods while allowing imports of crucial capital, raw materials, and intermediate goods that will allow local producers to match the foreign competition. Countries pursuing this type of strategy will, therefore, need to resist pressures to converge their tariffs, either across commodi- ty groups or between themselves and the rest of the world. At the same time, the State can apply appropriate antidumping duties and ensure that, wherever possible, it procures its own require- ments from national producers. It will be impor- tant, however, to ensure that such protection does not simply breed slothful domestic mono- polies geared to skimming the domestic market. Then the State needs to encourage expor- ters. Exports cannot constitute the only basis for growth, but in an interdependent world they are vital for financing essential imports. Initially countries will look to fairly simple manufactured goods that take advantage of lower wage costs \u2013 and perhaps of a less codified legal framework or where labour rights are more restricted, as in export trade zones (Box 1.5). All the successful late industrializers, including the \u2018newly indus- trialized economies\u2019, pursued this kind of \u2018mercantilist\u2019 strategy \u2013 pushing out exports at whatever cost to establish footholds in inter- national markets. Measures to promote national industries also need to be accompanied by a degree of discipline. When offering industrialists incen- tives, the State must be in a position to enforce compliance and, where appropriate, to be able to influence the choice of product \u2013 for example, the technology used, the scale of production and the prices of goods.

Each country will have a different industrial development strategy consistent with its inherited natural and factor endowments, geographic location, and governance capabilities. The heavy hand of the government of the Republic of Korea in imposing export obligations on favoured enterprises is well known. Singapore relied heavily on FDI, but never tied its development to the performance of any particular multinational. Successful countries applied strategic liberalization of imports at specific phases of development to improve access to intermediate inputs and technology and to create competitive pressures. Some countries directed the allocation of credit and inputs to the preferred sectors. CHAPTER 1: USING INTERNATIONAL TRADE TO PROMOTE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 21 output but also to restructure and modernize the production base. A convenient measure of progress in this direction is the \u2018investment rate\u2019, which is the ratio of investment to national income; higher investment should lead to a higher rate of economic growth. One analysis of the experience of 25 deve- loping countries over the period 1968-88 found a close correlation between the investment rate and the growth in output.6 In addition, the same study found a close correlation between the investment rate and the growth in exports.7 Why should greater investment lead to a higher volume of exports? For developing countries, this is primarily because they can use investment to reform the structure of production and exports \u2013 moving from commodities, in which world trade is fairly stagnant, to manufactured goods, in which trade is growing more rapidly. The higher the investment ratio, the faster the transformation of the production \u2013 structure and hence, the greater the ability to participate in the more dynamic end of world trade. As well as encouraging investment, however, the State also needs to act as a coordinator, ensuring that investment is directed to priority areas where it can be used to increase levels of technology and achieve economies of scale, and thus enhance international competitiveness. Economies like Japan, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan (China), though in different ways, followed this type of strategic industrial policy \u2013 anticipating future opportunities and guiding investment in the most promising directions. Interestingly, it was only when they were dis- mantling these industrial policy frameworks that they ran into financial crises. Macroeconomic Policies and Exchange Rates Strategic intervention may also be required in the realm of macroeconomic policy, and in As well as encouraging investment, the State also needs to act as a coordinator ensuring that investment is directed to priority areas BOX 1.5 EXPORT PROCESSING ZONES Export processing zones (EPZs) have played a significant role in creating productive and remunerative employment in several Asian economies, including Taiwan (China), Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, and more recently in China, Viet Nam, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. In China, EPZs account for more than 55 per cent of total exports and have created 40 million jobs (Fong 2006). In Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, EPZ-created employment now accounts, respectively, for 6 per cent and 10 per cent of manufacturing employment. In January 2006, UNDP undertook a primary survey of three of the largest EPZs in India \u2013 Mumbai, Noida and Chennai \u2013 interviewing 229 workers. The survey and related secondary data indicate the following (Aggarwal 2006): Women. Women constitute only about 46 per cent of the workers in Indian EPZs, a share that is on the decline as EPZs embrace more advanced technologies. Training.

While living conditions of workers in EPZs have improv- ed, the impact on poverty reduction has been marginal because backward linkages with the rest of the economy were very weak. Surveys in Pakistan and Sri Lanka in 2006 had broadly similar findings (Kemal 2006; Marga Institute 2006). ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 22 particular for managing the exchange rate. The world is now experiencing rapid cross-border flows of capital. In periods of economic boom, rapid capital inflows can push up the exchange rate and undermine competitiveness, while rapid outflows, even if they do not lead to a full- fledged currency crisis, can result in a liquidity crunch. In the initial stages of liberalization, the balance of trade is likely to worsen because, typi- cally, imports rise faster than exports. Trade liberalization should, therefore, be supported by a number of complementary reforms, including management of domestic demand and the exchange rate. Rather than having a freely floating rate, developing economies are more likely to benefit from a managed float. In the early stages of liberalization, the rate should, if necessary, be allowed to depreciate. This will curb demand for imports and stimulate exports; it also forestalls a precipitous fall in government revenue and can broaden the tax base, even if it lowers the effective tax rate. This should improve the trade balance \u2013 though the overall effect on the economy will depend on other factors such as the export supply response, structural rigidities and sound fiscal and monetary policies. The exchange rate experience of a number of countries in the region is summarized in Box 1.6. Multilateral, Regional and Bilateral Action Governments can take many of the choices on trade liberalization unilaterally: ultimately, the BOX 1.6 THE REAL EFFECTIVE EXCHANGE RATE: REGIONAL EXPERIENCES In the initial stages of liberalization, the balance of trade is likely to worsen because imports typically rise faster than exports. Trade liberalization should, therefore, be supported by management of the exchange rate. In fact, the empirical evidence suggests that, rather than having a freely floating exchange rate, developing countries are more likely to benefit from a managed float. A number of countries in the region have followed a variant of this strategy. South Asia. Based on the data in Annex Table 4.4, it appears that the real effective exchange rates of most South Asian countries have, more or less, moved in synchrony with each other, but the cycles seem to be getting shorter \u2013 that is, the real effective exchange rate (REER) has moved up or down more frequently. Thus, the REER for Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka appreciated during the first half of the 1990s and then depreciated until 1998. Thereafter, cycles appeared shorter: the REER depreciated during 2000 and 2001and then appreciated during the next two years. India is an exception, with a real depreciation of the currency for most of the decade of the 1990s. Fluctuations in the REER appear to be a reflection of underlying changes in the balance of payments position. Averaging over the cycles, the long-term trend is one of depreciation of the REER in India, Nepal and Pakistan, appreciation in Sri Lanka, and stability in Bangladesh. East Asia. During the financial crisis of the late 1990s, most countries in East Asia witnessed significant depreciation of their currencies except Malaysia, which implemented a fixed exchange rate regime in the post-crisis period. Nevertheless, since trade fundamentals remained sound, depreciation quickly improved the trade balance, stabilized the balance of payments and enabled countries in the subregion to recover in a relatively short time from the financial crisis. The subsequent switch to a managed float has allowed the currencies of these countries to depreciate at a faster rate compared to previous periods.

Between 2001 and 2003, the extent of appreciation in REER was 7 per cent in China, 34 per cent in Indonesia, 10 per cent in Malaysia and 15 per cent in Thailand. The relatively limited appreciation of the Chinese yuan in the presence of a massive buildup in foreign exchange reserves has raised the question: Is the Chinese currency undervalued? In July 2005, China ended its hard peg to the US dollar. The yuan immediately appreciated by 2.1 per cent, and since February 2006 has been appreciating (against the US dollar) at an annual rate of 4 per cent. At this rate, the currency could attain a realistic and sustainable level by the end of 2008. Accumulating reserves too rapidly carries certain risks. It raises the fiscal costs of sterilizing the implied increases in money supply, fuels speculation in real estate and may exacerbate weakness in the banking system. Steady appreciation, on the other hand, will prevent a continuing large increase in foreign exchange reserves while avoiding shocks to employment if exports fall too drastically. CHAPTER 1: USING INTERNATIONAL TRADE TO PROMOTE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 23 decision to raise or lower tariff or other barriers to trade is a national one. Indeed, the majority of liberalization measures from developing coun- tries have been the product of unilateral action, even if under the aegis of IMF-led or other programmes of structural adjustment. Nowadays, however, most of the attention has shifted to reciprocal relationships \u2013 as countries agree multilaterally or bilaterally to reduce trade barriers to their mutual advantage. The principal multilateral forum is the World Trade Organization (WTO) and its ongoing Doha Round of negotiations. Initially there were grounds for optimism since the developed coun- tries appeared to recognize the specific needs of developing countries and duly characterised this as the \u2018Doha Development Round\u2019. Since then, ambition seemed to have been scaled down substantially. Many people feel that the WTO has not proved as favourable to poor countries as promised8 \u2013 indeed, that it puts greater demands on developing countries and narrows their options for pursuing their own human development objectives. Faced with the potential failure of the Doha Round, a number of developing countries have been looking for alternatives. In many cases they have reached bilateral agreements, typically with the developed countries. Thailand, for example, has signed bilateral agreements with Australia, Japan and New Zealand, and has also been conducting lengthy negotiations with the United States. Whether bilateral agreements are superior to multilateral ones from the point of view of human development is open to doubt since they often demand even greater concessions than multilateral ones while providing greater access. At the same time the countries of Asia and the Pacific have been promoting trade between themselves through a series of regional trade agreements (RTAs). This is part of a global phenomenon: nearly all countries in the world belong to at least one type of RTA (Box 1.7). Between 1990 and 2005 the number of agree- ments notified to the GATT/WTO increased from 27 to more than 180 and the figure seems likely to rise further. Both bilateral trade agree- ments (BTAs) and RTAs are likely to become increasingly important, for a number of reasons: Doubts about Multilateralism. Many countries are looking for alternatives to multilateral agreements. Regional ones are easier to achieve, and they and BTAs may also serve as a threat to force unwilling parties to negotiate in earnest at the multilateral level. The Domino Effect. Once an RTA starts to become effective, neighbouring non-members will be attracted to join, so as not to be excluded from trade flows. Market Access for Developed Countries. The developed countries are competing for market access in developing countries. The European Union (EU) was the first to do so and has already signed several agreements with Eastern European, Mediterranean, African and Asian countries.

It should be clarified here that in most cases countries do not abolish trade barriers completely even within FTAs. Most agreements tend to exclude sensitive sectors. A Customs Union is seen as ensuring deeper integration than an FTA because unlike FTAs, where member countries are free to maintain their individual level of tariff barriers for goods imported from non-member countries, in a CU member countries also apply a common external tariff (CET) on goods imported from outside countries. The CET can vary across goods, but not across union partners. Overall, however, PTAs, FTAs and CUs are identified as \u2018shallow integration\u2019 arrangements in the trade literature.

Deve- loping countries are also contributing to this by seeking asymmetric deals with onerous commit- ments, for example in IPRs, in return for prefe- rential treatment for limited export interests. Reactions to Regionalism Elsewhere. Asian exporting countries worry that they are becom- ing increasingly vulnerable to the discriminatory practices of trade agreements in other regions \u2013 in the EU, for example, or the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas. They are thus res- ponding with greater integration within their own region. Opportunities for Deeper Commitment. Deve- loped countries can use BTAs to achieve greater influence over partner countries than is possi- ble with the WTO. They can thus both choose their partners and also require higher invest- ment, labour, environmental and competition standards. Some people argue that RTAs form the building blocks for subsequent multilateral agreements. Since RTAs can be negotiated more quickly, they offer government officials the opportunity for \u2018learning by doing\u2019 and pioneer new ideas that can later appear in multilateral treaties. Others see them more as stumbling blocks that do not promote additional trade but simply divert existing flows, strengthening protectionist lobbies that will then oppose multilateralism. They can also divert the energies of overstretched officials who have to cope with a \u2018spaghetti bowl\u2019 of overlapping tariff schedules and rules. However, the consensus seems to be that regionalism and multilateralism could be complementary.

These include the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) and Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA) (Box 1.8). The Human Development Imperative Many countries in the region are thus deeply engaged in trade issues. But too often the dis- cussions are restricted to the economic implica- tions. Instead, the countries of the region need to consider trade through a wider-angle, human development lens. Decisions on trade need to be considered not just on economic criteria but on what the implications are for human develop- ment \u2013 for improving people\u2019s lives and widening their choices. Some questions of interest are:9 Are the benefits sustainable? From the viewpoint of their environmental implications, to what extent, for example, does trade increase the pressure for marketization of agriculture and fisheries? Could this lead to intensive cultivation and mono-cropping? More broadly, to what extent can the benefits be sustained over time, in view of, for example, technological change, dynamic comparative advantages or intergene- rational considerations? Are the benefits equitable? Do some have more opportunities than others? Which groups benefit more than others? Are there losers, and if so, are they the relatively worse off? Does trade contribute to reducing or widening of inequalities? How do Least Developed Countries and those that face trade-related vulnerabilities fare? When people and countries at different starting points engage in trade, do the better-off benefit more? Do policies and institutions have to be \u2018unequal\u2019 to promote equity, for example, through special and differential treatment provisions? Are the implications empowering? Does the \u2018agency\u2019 of some groups get compromised or enhanced? Can people lead more dignified and empowered lives, say, through better or new employment opportunities, for example, through the offshoring of business processes? To what extent does more open trade destroy jobs, say, for farmers or garment workers of Asia? Are the new ideas and experiences empowering? Are there productivity effects? Does the exchange of goods, services, money and ideas contribute to technology improvements? Does this happen more in the already more profitable sectors, as against in sectors that employ lower- end workers? Does more income in people\u2019s hands lead to better health, with less absen- teeism, less down-time? Do people invest more in education as they see its benefits? Are educational choices influenced by market opportunities? Sustainability \u2013 Equity \u2013 Empowerment \u2013 Productivity. Does human development \u2018SEEP\u2019 to the bottom? There are also tradeoffs, between productivity, for example, and equity. While these dimensions do not encompass all of human development, they serve as a tool to assess inter- national trade on human terms. In these circumstances, the market alone cannot deliver a trade regime that promotes human development. The State needs to inform, guide and protect. But this should not just be a matter for ministries of trade or commerce; trade should receive close attention from most depart- ments of government: First, because more productive trade will require stronger human capabilities \u2013 hence, the need to involve social sector ministries, such as health or education. Second, because the repercussions of more libe- ralized trade are felt across all sectors and will demand actionfrom different ministries, whether to provide safety nets for those who lose their livelihoods or to reshape education and training systems to meet the needs of a new economic structure. At the same time, the State needs to gather broad public support from both the private ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 26 sector and from civil society. Governments need to build a stronger political consensus for trade reform. Many individuals and organizations, at both national and international levels, have become more aware of the implications of new trade regimes and will oppose measures that disadvantage the poor. The Contours of the Report The following chapters in this Report examine these and related issues in greater depth \u2013 looking at the evidence and identifying the kinds of policies that promote a positive relationship between trade and human development, while also protecting those who are likely to lose out from the disruption caused by new trade regimes.

CHAPTER 2: TRADE AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT: THE ASIA-PACIFIC EXPERIENCE 29 Over recent decades, Asia-Pacific has been the world\u2019s fastest-growing region. As indicated in Table 2.1, during the period 1990\u20132003 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew annually on average by more than 7 per cent. As a result of population expansion, growth of per-capita GDP was somewhat slower \u2013 around 5 per cent \u2013 but still far higher than the 3 per cent in the OECD countries. Trends in International Trade Much of this rapid economic growth has taken place during a period of steady trade libera- lization \u2013 initially transforming import quotas into tariffs, and then consolidating tariff rates into narrower ranges. At the same time, most countries in the region have reduced or removed subsidies and export taxes. In East Asia and the Pacific, liberalization started in the 1970s; by 1990, the average import tariff in these countries was already down to 20 per cent and by 2000 had fallen to 8 per cent (Figure 2.1). In Malaysia, for example, most goods can effectively be imported duty- free. In the Pacific Island countries, however, the rates remain high (Table 2.2). South Asia was slower to liberalize. In the early 1980s, average import tariffs were around 60 per cent, and were still around 47 per cent by the end of the decade. But during the 1990s they Globalization is leading to a rapid expansion in international trade \u2013 and one of the engines of growth has been the Asia-Pacific region. This has helped boost economic growth and offered employment to millions of people, but the only real test of success or failure is its impact on human development. This chapter identifies the main trends in international trade and examines what it has meant for some of the region\u2019s poorest people. fell more rapidly, and by 2000 average tariffs in South Asia had fallen to 18 per cent \u2013 with the process having gone furthest in Sri Lanka.

Rapid Growth of Trade The lowering of tariffs has contributed to a rapid growth in trade. Available evidence indicates The Asia-Pacific region has steadily increased its exports of manufactured goods. The region now accounts for around 30 per cent of world exports and in 10 years time could account for 50 per cent. Of this around 97 per cent comes from East Asia. Asia now accounts for 55 per cent of world trade in office and telecommunications equipment, 45 per cent in textiles, 47 per cent in clothing and 35 per cent in personal and household goods. The largest single category of exports is office and telecommuni- cation equipment, which is also the fastest growing group of products in international trade.

CHAPTER 2: TRADE AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT: THE ASIA-PACIFIC EXPERIENCE 31 GDP growth, had a much lower trade-to-GDP ratio, indicating that growth had taken place with a much lower level of engagement in trade. But trends changed drastically in the 1990s \u2013 with signs of a growing dispersal of trade across the region. Thus, between 1990 and 2003, while East Asia and the Pacific continued to power ahead \u2013 and trade as a percentage of GDP increased from 45 to 81 per cent \u2013 the propor- tion of South Asia also increased, from 20 to 34 per cent.2 These figures relate only to merchan- dise trade. If earnings from remittances, tourism and outsourcing are added, the differences between the subregions are smaller, and the overall increase is even more impressive. Asia is rapidly developing as the factory for the world (Box 2.1). There has also been a rapid growth in imports. Indeed, in the period 1985 to 1995 the annual growth rate of import volume surpassed that of exports, reaching 10.5 per cent, though it slowed in the latter half of the 1990s, to 5.5 per cent. As a result, from a global perspective the region\u2019s share of imports rose from 13 to 21 per cent between 1973 and 2003 (Figure 2.2). Merchandise exports of East Asia and the Pacific, which on average had been growing at 9 per cent annually in the 1980s, were growing by 13 per cent in the 1990s (Table 2.3). Among other factors, this was a consequence partly of earlier efforts at liberalization that had prepared the ground by exposing firms to international competition. A favourable investment climate had also encouraged substantial inflows of foreign investment. As a result, by the 1990s East Asia \u2013 with more efficient and productive industries \u2013 was poised for a takeoff in export- led growth. China was the biggest beneficiary; it had a large and skilled labour force, available at relatively low wages. It also had special export zones that offered fiscal and other advantages, attracting many transnational companies, which during the 1990s invested over $300 billion.

ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 32 Other export success stories in East Asia include Malaysia and Thailand. Indonesia and the Philippines have also been performing more strongly of late. But coming up fastest is Viet Nam, whose exports have been growing by 20 per cent annually since the early 1980s \u2013 promis- ing to make this East Asia\u2019s next major middle- income economy. More surprising, perhaps, has been the per- formance of some of South-East Asia\u2019s Least Developed Countries (LDCs). A number of these have been keen globalizers. Starting from a low base, Cambodia, for example, has had pheno- menal growth in merchandise exports \u2013 37 per cent per annum \u2013 mostly of textiles and clothing. Lao PDR and Myanmar have also done well, with export growth rates of 18 per cent and 19 per cent. The situation is different in South Asia. Here Coming up fastest is Viet Nam, whose exports have been growing at the rate 20 per cent annually since the early 1980s the growth in merchandise exports has been less impressive. India, the subregion\u2019s largest expor- ter, has been slower to cut tariffs and redirect production from import substitution to export markets. Some of the smaller countries, however, have done better, notably Bangladesh and Nepal in textiles and clothing, though this was largely due to the quota regime, which has now been phased out. South Asia as a whole has also done much better on service exports, with a growth rate in the 1990s higher than that for East Asia. India is the leader here, offering outsourced services, particularly in the IT sector, to many of the OECD countries. The growth pattern has been similar for imports (Table 2.4). Rates of importing have also been rising, partly because tariff reductions have made imports cheaper relative to home- produced goods, thus displacing some import- substituting industries. But some imports are required as inputs to exports, reflecting the more integrated networks of global production, as different locations contribute different parts to the chain of value added. Exports and imports can thus be closely linked: in South Asia in par- ticular, the rising exports, by alleviating foreign exchange constraints, have enabled import liberalization. Nevertheless, imports have generally been growing more slowly than exports, particularly in South Asia. The main exception is China, whose buoyant demand for imports, growing at 17 per cent annually, has pushed East Asia and the Pacific\u2019s share of global imports from 4 to 7 per cent. South Asia\u2019s share, however, has remained more or less the same. The combination of rising exports and imports means that virtually all Asian economies have become more \u2018open\u2019. The degree of \u2018openness\u2019 of the economy, measured as the ratio of international trade (goods and services) to GDP, has risen steadily, as seen above, both, in East Asia and South Asia between 1990 and 2003.

CHAPTER 2: TRADE AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT: THE ASIA-PACIFIC EXPERIENCE 33 Figure 2.3: Balance of trade, East Asia and the Pacific, and South Asia, 1980s and 1990s Source: World Bank 2005. The Balance of Imports and Exports The dynamism in international trade in the 1980s and 1990s has also brought a shift in the balance between imports and exports. The results are summarized in Figure 2.3. In East Asia and the Pacific, the balance in merchandise trade has switched from negative to positive \u2013 causing the total balance to move from minus 0.5 per cent to plus 1.9 per cent of GDP. South Asia has also made progress now and has a positive balance in services; overall, the balance is still negative, but is moving in the right direction, from minus 3.7 per cent to minus 1.9 per cent. The experience of the Asia-Pacific countries can also be set in the context of other developing countries. UNCTAD, for example, has studied the impact of trade liberalization on the balance of trade in 16 countries across different regions over the period 1970 to 1995, and concluded that, especially in the early stages of the process, there is a tendency for the balance of payments to deteriorate.3 Another study of 22 developing countries concluded that for a one-percentage- point reduction in duties, exports grew on an average by an extra 0.2 per cent, while imports rose between 0.2 and 0.4 per cent \u2013 and overall liberalization worsened the trade balance by 2 per cent of GDP.4 These findings are more or less confirmed by a further UNCTAD study.5 By these standards, therefore, the region overall has had a more positive experience since the balance of payments position seems to have improved. East Asia has done particularly well: in the early 1990s it had a trade surplus of around 2 per cent of GDP, which by the late 1990s had risen to 4 per cent \u2013 resulting in an extraordinary buildup of foreign exchange reserves. South Asia too has improved its position, even if the balance of trade remains negative \u2013 with two-thirds of the improvement coming from manufactured goods. Why has the result Accompanying the increases in the volume of trade, there have also been dramatic transformations in the structure of trade of liberalization been more muted here? The answer probably lies with domestic private investors, who have responded slowly to changing profitability signals. Despite the trade reforms, levels of private investment in manu- facturing have remained low, and investors have been moving only gradually towards the export- ing sectors. Pakistan illustrates the point. During the 1990s, the export growth had actually declined \u2013 from 9 to 5 per cent. Private investment remained depressed partly because the country witnessed considerable macroeconomic instabi- lity over this period. Investors were also inhi- bited by the process of structural adjustment during an IMF programme that had caused growth to stall. Subsequently, however, invest- ment recovered, especially for modernizing the textiles sector, and exports have been growing by 20 per cent. The Changing Structure of Trade Accompanying the increases in the volume of trade, there have also been dramatic transformations in the structure of trade. This has occurred at three levels: first, within both exports and imports, there have been shifts between merchandise and services; second, ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 34 merchandise exports have risen from 86 to 88 per cent of exports (Figure 2.4). Within merchandise exports, there have also been major structural changes, most notably a shift in exports towards manufactured goods, which in East Asia and South Asia by 2000 accounted for 80 and 78 per cent of merchandise exports respectively (Table 2.5). Two other notable features concern agricultural goods and oil. Not only have agricultural exports been declining, a number of countries have also become large-scale food importers. China, for example, was a net agricultural exporter of $2 billion worth in 1990. By 2003, this had been transformed into net imports worth $14 billion \u2013 a rising demand that has major implications for future world food prices (Box 2.2). Regarding fuels, there has been a decline in exports in East Asia and the Pacific, though countries like Malaysia have emerged as net exporters. Indonesia, which is the region\u2019s major OPEC member, has had decline in exportable surpluses of petroleum and oil products.

Within manufactured exports, there has also been a significant move up the technological ladder towards sophisticated products, though this is more evident in East Asia and the Pacific than in South Asia (Figure 2.5). In East Asia and the Pacific between 1990 and 2000, the propor- tion of exports based on natural resources and labour-intensive, low-tech goods fell from 53 to 37 per cent, while the proportion based on high- tech goods rose from 24 to 41 per cent \u2013 much of this from the higher-middle-income countries like Malaysia and Thailand. These countries are increasing their output of products like electro- nics, office machines and telecommunications equipment \u2013 which are also responsible for the fastest growth in world trade. In South Asia, on the other hand, around 85 per cent of merchan- dise exports are still of resource-based products or labour-intensive goods.

Shifts in the balances between exports of goods and exports of services have been most noticeable in South Asia, particularly following India\u2019s boom in outsourced IT services. As a result, 26 per cent of South Asia\u2019s exports are now of services. In East Asia, however, the movement has been in the other direction as Figure 2.4: Composition of merchandise exports and imports Source: World Bank 2005. Within manufactured exports, there has also been a significant move up the technological ladder towards sophisticated products CHAPTER 2: TRADE AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT: THE ASIA-PACIFIC EXPERIENCE 35 Growth or Trade \u2013 Which Comes First? The Asia-Pacific region has thus experienced significant economic growth and a rapid rise in exports, especially in East Asia and to a lesser extent in South Asia. But have the exports have triggered this growth, or is it the other way round: are rising exports an outcome of econo- mic growth? This is a question on which there has been extensive discussion.6 One view is that the main driving force is growth: as output rise, there is a surplus that can be exported. If, for example, a small developing country has a good harvest that produces a food surplus, then it can sell in international markets \u2013 and do so at the prevailing world price since the quantities will be relatively small. The alternative view is that growth needs exports. A country that has a small domestic market can only achieve sustained growth by selling into larger world markets. This view is supported by empirical research.7 This is illustrated in Figure 2.6, which for a sample of the larger low-to-middle income economies of Asia and the Pacific plots GDP growth over the 1980s and 1990s against export growth. This suggests a largely positive relationship. How- ever, this scatter diagram has some outliers: China, for example, in the 1980s had only a BOX 2.3 THE OIL SHOCK Although Indonesia and Malaysia, as net exporters, have benefited from the rise in oil prices, many others are suffering from an \u2018oil shock\u2019. The extent of the shock can be measured by considering the rise in the import bill expressed as a percentage of the country\u2019s liquid foreign exchange reserves. Assuming, say, a 50 per cent rise in crude oil prices between 2004 and 2005, then among the larger countries the most vulnerable would be Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam, where the shock would exceed 20 per cent. Pakistan, for example, which has foreign exchange reserves of just under $10 billion, faces extra costs of $2 billion. China too faces a rapidly rising import bill \u2013 an increase of $24 billion \u2013 but the shock is smaller because of its extraordinarily high level of foreign exchange reserves. Oil shock of the magnitudes sustained by Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam will not just be felt in one year;", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5dab18f-63f7-462d-b0bb-47f328c6aab5": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5dab18f-63f7-462d-b0bb-47f328c6aab5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6575522fc6ce9e19260d66667eac6776681d7bef7593937a99befdc12fdf7121"}, "3": {"node_id": "7028f401-33c6-422d-9586-4da58dd3732a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c29b74fae1be8f96ac562cd16950a1f82e45da986847bde339aba3b2113e4895"}}, "hash": "5933695b0d32b5b44b89e21ace482444e31d16f23be04c02898272d69d610878", "text": "they will persist for some time, depending on structural rigidities and other factors.

Viet Nam, on the other hand, had a rapid growth in exports but only a modest economic growth. It is also possible to group countries accord- ing to their performance in the 1990s in relation to the 1980s: ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 36 1. Acceleration in export and economic growth \u2013 China, Malaysia, Philippines, Viet Nam, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka 2. Acceleration in export growth but decele- ration in economic growth \u2013 India and Indonesia 3. Deceleration in both export and economic growth \u2013 Thailand and Pakistan Countries falling into the second category can be considered special cases since they do not follow the expected pattern. India has several factors that would have contributed to this result. First, it needs to be borne in mind that the export sector is only a small part of India\u2019s eco- nomy and will thus have less of an impact. Second, overall growth was slowed due to a poor performance in agriculture.8 A third contribu- ting factor could have been a surge in imports following liberalization that undermined import substitution industries. In Indonesia, on the other hand, the principal factor seems to have been the East Asian financial crisis, which hit the country particularly hard, causing the GDP to plummet despite a rapid growth in exports. For the region as a whole, it is also interesting to note that no country combined slower export growth with faster economic growth. Thus, there does seem to be a broad relation- ship between export growth and economic growth \u2013 and the relationship gets stronger when there is a high degree of export orientation. However, it can also be affected by domestic factors of demand and supply, and the outcome can be ambiguous if faster export growth is offset by faster import growth. In East Asia and the Pacific, most of the impetus for export-led growth seems to have come less from agriculture and more from the non-agricultural sector, especially from manu- facturing, which was growing annually by almost 11 per cent in the 1990s (Table 2.6). This was the outcome of policy decisions in these countries to move away from agriculture, first Figure 2.5: Composition of manufactured exports, 1980-2000 Source: UNIDO 2004.

Agriculture has also suffered over this period, growing at less than 3 per cent; some of this would have been due to liberalization and the opening up of the agricultural market, which caused agricultural imports to increase by almost 150 per cent. The Energy Crunch All countries have to rely on trade to be able to finance imports \u2013 and for most of them, and especially the poorest, the largest bills are for oil. World oil prices have been rising steeply: in 2002 Brent spot prices averaged $25 a barrel; in 2003 they rose to $29; in 2004, $43; and in mid-2006 they approached the $75 mark. What does this surge imply? The pessimistic and more alarmist interpretation is that the world is close to the point of \u2018peak oil\u2019: the maximum production before output declines as the resource is depleted. A more optimistic view is that, after adjusting the nominal prices for changes in the prices of other commodities, oil prices are still relatively low. In 1980, for example, Arabian Light was $36 a barrel, which in inflation- adjusted 2005 amounts to $84 per barrel \u2013 and thus in real terms higher than recent prices. But even if today\u2019s real price is short of its previous peak, the rising price has serious impli- cations. Overall, the Asia-Pacific region remains a large net importer of oil, and rapid growth, especially in the manufacturing sector, has led to a continually rising demand. As a result, in spite of higher prices many countries of the region since 2004 have substantially increased fuel imports. Only a few of the faster-growing coun- tries, such as Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore, spent less on fuel in the latter half of the 1990s. Unlike during previous oil shocks, many countries have clearly been able to finance rising oil imports without much difficulty. China, for example, can keep sucking in oil because of the consistently high increase in its export earnings; India manages because of its large information technology-related revenues; and some other developing countries are able to stay afloat with TABLE 2.6 GROWTH RATES BY SECTOR AND GDP GROWTH RATES 1980s 1990s East Asia & Pacific Agriculture 5.1 3.3 Industry 8.0 11.0 (Manufacturing) (8.6) (10.9) Services 8.9 7.1 GDP 7.4 8.2 South Asia Agriculture 3.5 2.9 Industry 7.0 5.6 (Manufacturing) (7.4) (5.9) Services 6.2 6.8 GDP 5.7 5.2 Source: World Bank 2005. The structural transformation of the East Asian economies has not yet been completed, and agriculture still accounts for almost half the labour force ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 38 assess across such a huge region, which accounts for nearly 60 per cent of the world\u2019s population. It is also very diverse, with some dramatic contrasts in wealth: per-capita income in the richest country is more than 30 times that in the poorest. Within countries, too, there are striking contrasts between the richest and the poorest, both in income and in quality of life. However, there do seem to be some trends common across a number of countries. Rising Inequality One of the most general conclusions is that, for most developing countries in the region during the 1990s, a greater engagement with interna- tional markets was accompanied by a rise in income inequality. This is clear from trends in the conventional inequality measure, the Gini coefficient, which ranges from zero (absolute equality) to 1 (one person gets everything). The faster-growing economies, like China, have seen a large increase in inequality \u2013 though some countries, such as the Republic of Korea and Thailand, experienced a fall (Table 2.7). Poverty Despite increases in inequality, there has nevertheless been a substantial decline in poverty. Between 1990 and 2001, the number of people living on less than $1 a day dropped by nearly a quarter of a billion. This is usually attributed chiefly to sustained growth in China and the acceleration of growth in India. But progress has actually been quite widespread across the subregions: over the same period, the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day declined from 41 to 31 per cent in South Asia, and from 30 to 15 per cent in East Asia and the Pacific.9 But probably the most rapid changes have been in North-East Asia, where export-led growth was accompanied by a substantial the help of remittances from migrant workers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e3ab67c-f45c-4939-9654-8bf7347362f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e3ab67c-f45c-4939-9654-8bf7347362f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c7e939109dd569d84d10218f78b41a15d9b7268d3ef59bd151de3f0d96331127"}, "2": {"node_id": "f20d86e1-7405-45f8-9368-9a4fb6d16075", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ecca7a56f0bc1bfac5af188364d9e4fa2294efd4bbaa091fbb96a976ed3809e"}}, "hash": "99ac75a1046b4ebf4ff2bec4d5da31917f0cb9c7dee635f6a7bc00a2540c2619", "text": "The better-off countries also have access to liqui- dity in the form of debt, portfolio investment or foreign direct investment, which has helped cushion the effects of rising oil prices.

Between 1990 and 2001, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, measured by the headcount ratio, fell from 33 to 17 per cent. East Asia, therefore, Despite increases in trade, many LDCs have had less success in reducing poverty stands out as a successful case of high growth, high trade and high human development. Income poverty also declined, if less dramati- cally, in South-East Asia \u2013 though one of the best performers was Malaysia (Box 2.4). The situation has been different in South Asia. During this period, trade ratios were relatively low and average growth rates, even if creditable, were also lower. Income poverty did come down, though more slowly, and remains quite high (Figure 2.7). This points up the significance of growth for poverty reduction: growth may not be sufficient on its own to reduce poverty, though it does appear to be a prerequisite. BOX 2.4 TRADE AND GROWTH IN MALAYSIA\u2019S SPECTACULAR POVERTY DECLINE Malaysia is an example where trade liberalization, accompanied by pro-poor domestic policies, led to a remarkable reduction in poverty. Malaysia adopted two broad interrelated strategies for eradicating poverty. The first focused on economic growth through the pursuit of open trade policies. The second highlighted the role of public policy in promoting pro-poor growth strategies, providing the social and physical infrastructure required for a growing economy, and indirectly assisting specific target groups among whom poverty rates were highest. Malaysia progressively liberalized its trade and has achieved sustained, albeit variable, economic growth. On an average, over the period of 1970\u20132005 the Malaysian economy grew in real terms in excess of 6 per cent a year.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a72f032b-2cc4-436c-9ae0-d83a426212f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "a72f032b-2cc4-436c-9ae0-d83a426212f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8af3e95b0256af7405bd4ec586f05b7e0d0ada0c7a91b394a4f238d4548efd17"}, "2": {"node_id": "1d45c24f-f561-49e2-b35a-b983e2ad4022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "267f502b8f96a4b5669d5e9d7ae61f1b39c02805a44cab14bb8143b4a9c7f29b"}}, "hash": "988026ff0d9197fd4e3c1ee3a33a389d6e009478bc3922197bcf646dac669698", "text": "This has changed the country from a raw material-based to a manufacturing-based one: the most dynamic sector is electronics, and Malaysia is now one of the world\u2019s major exporters of semi-conductors and electronic components.

The Malaysian experience suggests long-run economic gains for all from trade liberalization, although there are short-term winners and losers and the poor can be vulnerable. So domestic policies need to be in place to help the vulnerable deal with the transition costs of adjustment and to benefit from the new, open trade regime. Trade liberalization in Malaysia was, therefore, accompanied by pragmatic social policies and macro-economic management, as well as investments in human capital, especially health, education and women\u2019s empowerment.

But there is a caveat: the contrasts between the two subregions may be overdrawn. In particular, it should be emphasized that economic growth and human development have a two-way relationship. So while South Asia and ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 40 East Asia chose different paths, they may reach the same destination. South Asia, especially before the 1990s and starting from much lower levels of human deve- lopment, and pursued strategies based more on protecting the domestic market with tariffs and quantitative restrictions. This produced slower growth. It also resulted in slower advances in human development, but these nevertheless helped ensure that modest liberalization in the 1980s and accelerated integration in the 1990s were accompanied by a higher trend rate of economic growth. East Asia, on the other hand, started with a considerably more favourable level of human development, and in particular an educated population, and was able to capitalize on this to achieve export-led economic growth. Both experiences underscore the fact that favourable human development conditions \u2013 education, long and healthy lives, equal access to opportunities, and a strong and pro-develop- ment public sector, including good governance \u2013 provide the preconditions not just for economic growth per se but also influence its pattern and quality, which can further contribute to enhanc- ing the quality of life and widening people\u2019s choices. The Experience of the Least Developed Countries Advances in the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), however, have been slower. Despite increases in trade, many LDCs have had less success in reducing poverty. Like the developing countries of the region, they have increased trade as a proportion of GDP \u2013 from 20 per cent in the 1980s to 33 per cent in 1990\u20132002 (Figure 2.8). Moreover, this expansion of trade has enabled the LDCs of Asia-Pacific to achieve faster growth than the LDCs of other regions (Figure 2.9) and to narrow the human development gap with the developing countries of the region \u2013 though the gap is still significant. Nevertheless, poverty rates in many of the LDCs have not declined very rapidly and while in developing countries of the region the proportion of the population living below the $1-per-day poverty line is 22 per cent, for the LDCs it is 38 per cent. Food Insecurity Despite reductions in income poverty, the region continues to suffer from extreme deprivation.

While South Asia and East Asia chose different paths, they may reach the same destination CHAPTER 2: TRADE AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT: THE ASIA-PACIFIC EXPERIENCE 41 This is evident, for example, in food consump- tion. Liberalizing agricultural markets may have helped reduce the price of food \u2013 particularly food produced with the backing of subsidies in the US and the EU.

Health Trade might be expected to improve health by increasing employment and income. There is now the threat that due to the TRIPS agreement, the price of drugs might increase, though this has yet to take effect. Generally, the period of trade- led growth has been accompanied by improve- ments in health, though this seem to have slowed in recent years. The most rapid progress has been in South-East Asia, where between 1990 and 2003 the under-five mortality rate per 1,000 live births fell from 78 to 46. In North-East Asia it fell from 48 to 37. There has also been progress in the South Asia from 126 to 90, but the rate remains high. A number of subregions also have high rates of maternal mortality: in 2000 these stood at 540 per 100,000 live births in South Asia and 210 in South-East Asia, though a creditable 55 in North-East Asia.14 Education Trade might have been expected to raise education standards by giving people greater incentives to improve their skills. But progress has also been inadequate. The greatest problems are again in South Asia, where one child in five fails to enrol in primary school. Since 1990-91, when the net enrolment ratio in primary education was 73 per cent, the ratio has increased, but by 2001-02 had still only reached 79 per cent. Moreover, a high proportion of children who enrol do not complete the full course of primary education. Enrolment rates tend to be higher in the other subregions, but even here they may be slipping: in South-East Asia over the same period, enrolment declined from 92 to 91 per cent and in North-East Asia from 97 to 95 per cent.15 Children in these two subregions also do better for completion: in South-East Asia 90 per cent of those enrolled reach the final grade of primary school, and in North-East Asia all children reportedly complete their primary schooling.16 As in most other areas, the shortfall is far greater for girls than boys. In South Asia, between 1990-91 and 2001-02 the number of girls enrolled in primary school per 100 boys rose from 76 to 85, but still falls far short of parity. For South-East and North-East Asia, however, the ratios are more impressive \u2013 increasing over the same period from 96 to 97 and from 93 to 100 respectively. At the secondary-school level, patterns of enrolment In 2003 in South-East Asia malnutrition was still sapping the strength of close to one-third of children, and in South Asia of nearly half ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 42 were similar: in 2001-02 for the three sub- regions, the numbers of girls per 100 boys were 79, 98 and 93 respectively.17 Some of the more direct impacts of trade on education can be seen, however, in greater speci- alization \u2013 as, for example, in India, where the demand for outsourcing personnel has led to a mushrooming growth of IT training institutions. Gender Gender differences that start at school tend to persist and sometimes even widen as children move to adulthood. This is evident, for example, in women\u2019s share in non-agricultural wage employment which, between 1990 and 2003, increased by only a few percentage points: from 13 to18 per cent in South Asia, 37 to 39 per cent in South-East Asia and 38 to 40 per cent in North-East Asia. The fastest increase, in South Asia, is attributable to rising exports of textiles and clothing. Earlier, East Asia\u2019s export drive in the 1960s and 1970s also relied on the mobilization of female workers. By being able to earn their own income independent of their families, many women thus obtained greater personal freedom \u2013 though they often had limited opportunities to participate in decisions on their working condi- tions and are still often considered as second- class citizens when it comes to the management and organization of work (Box 2.5). Moreover, for women the world over going out of the home to work adds to their double burden and exposes them to the risk of sexual harassment at the workplace.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be73c277-a656-4b6c-b28a-ba029f56a989": {"__data__": {"id_": "be73c277-a656-4b6c-b28a-ba029f56a989", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d646ccef7baeb3b1c7188da2989d8b4a2cc232d64367039e465405fc304ef82"}, "2": {"node_id": "87d6dc91-16a3-4ba5-bbd1-198eba6a8f63", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f7a6f0d347ebdd4e40636ba98834821bab76975e24103f4f343e6626003b912e"}}, "hash": "16139609f54875eab4da930579f8b8736811bdd294f52e80fa6bd76dda18cbb5", "text": "The Socio-Political Impact Besides boosting household incomes, trade can also promote other aspects of human deve- lopment.

Bhatt, Founder, Self Employed Women\u2019s Association (SEWA), Ahmedabad, India Why are poor women not more fully included in the globalization process, which is encompassing everyone and everywhere? One reason is that poor women are highly dispersed. They are spread across rural and urban areas, across sectors of economy, across levels of access to formal financial services, and across the range of industrial processes. Another reason is that they do not know their markets directly. For example, those who have their own small ready-made gar- ment businesses do not know who buys the garments they pro- duce, what price their products fetch in global markets or how long this design or fabric will be in demand. As a result, their understanding of global markets is filtered through middlemen. The first thing that women need to do is to organize \u2013 to associate themselves with people in similar occupations and with similar skills. This will enable them to access credit, information, market links and emerging technologies, taking advantage of one or more of these in combination \u2013 in packages that are suitable and affordable and that they can select and manage for themselves. Even these will only allow women to catch up, but not necessa- rily to move forward. Poor women, therefore, need reforms that provide a possibility for partnerships with governments, and the financial institutions: 1. Put poor women in the centre of any economic reform, especially in the key five areas: basic services, banking, labour, insurance, and trade. 2. Recognise \u2018work\u2019 as central to any economic reform that addresses poverty. For the poor, work is absolutely central to their lives. 3. Invest adequately in those poor women\u2019s initiatives that have the potential to grow. 4. Develop and spread social security systems that perform in a holistic way for the poor and women. 5. Build the capacity of poor self-employed women to enter global markets by building new marketable skills and knowledge, individually as well as institutionally. These changes are tough and demanding, but possible. They have worked for SEWA to a significant extent and for many more institutions across India. Some of these institutions work at loggerheads with the local government, while others work with them, but they all share a common concern for the poor and a commitment to foster change. Poor people have demonstrated the change that they have brought by their collective efforts. Women are still often considered as second-class citizens when it comes to the management and organization of work CHAPTER 2: TRADE AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT: THE ASIA-PACIFIC EXPERIENCE 43 class. This new workforce had a significant social and political impact. Workers may have been dissociated from the ownership of the instruments of production, but they were nevertheless free to choose their occupation and to earn an income independent of the patronage of the elite. Trade can thus be seen to have facilitated the emergence of an independent electorate and to have enriched democracy.18 The Employment Channel The main channel for all these effects of trade on human development is through employment. Ideally, more trade should mean more jobs and a decline in unemployment. But, often there has been no improvement: between 1993 and 2003, a period of rapid expansion in trade, unemploy- ment rates for global regions fell only in the industrialized economies; in all other regions they remained largely unchanged (Figure 2.10). Young women and men aged from 15 to 24 bore the brunt of rising unemployment. While youth made up one-fifth of Asia-Pacific\u2019s labour force in 2004, they constituted nearly half of the region\u2019s total jobless population. Youth unemp- loyment stood at a particularly high 17 per cent in South-East Asia. Women\u2019s unemployment rates have increased in recent years and are higher than men\u2019s in most countries of the region. As the labour force grew rapidly in the 1990s, by 24 per cent in South Asia and 15.4 per cent in East Asia and the Pacific, unemployment pressures rose. Now, those who are in the labour market are finding jobs scarcer. This is evident from unemployment rates in South-East Asia, which between 1993 and 2003 increased from 3.9 to 6.3 per cent. Indeed, since 1990 some of the most trade-intensive countries, such as China and Singapore, have seen unemployment rates increase substantially. Asian countries created jobs quite rapidly in the 1980s \u2013 337 million in total. However, they created far fewer, 176 million, in the 1990s. Why was employment generation virtually halved? Most of this shortfall reflects developments in East Asia.

In the 1990s, however, despite accelerating economic growth, countries of the subregion added only 104 million jobs and, as a result, the unemployment rate rose again. In South Asia, on the other hand, there was a small increase: the subregion created 64 million jobs in the 1980s and then, despite some decline in the overall rate of economic growth, added 72 million in the 1990s. To look more closely at what is happening, it is useful to consider the \u2018elasticity\u2019 of employ- ment with respect to growth, which is obtained by dividing the growth rate in employment by the growth rate in output. The region\u2019s experience is summarized in Table 2.8. In East Asia, there was a precipitous decline in employment creation: between the 1980s and the 1990s, despite an acceleration in output growth, employment growth fell from 4.2 to 1.2 per cent \u2013 a fall of 3 percentage points. This is reflected in a drop in employment elasticity from 0.56 to 0.15. These data can then be used to \u2018decompose\u2019 Figure 2.10: Regional unemployment rates, 1993 and 2003 Source: ILO 2005a. Asian countries created jobs quite rapidly in the 1980s far fewer in the 1990s ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 44 Most of this change in the subregion is caused by what was happening in the industrial sector \u2013 and particularly in manufacturing, for although manufacturing output increased by almost 180 per cent in the 1990s, the associated employment increased by only 3 per cent, what has been called \u2018jobless growth\u2019. As Table 2.8 shows, employment elasticity in industry fell steeply \u2013 from 0.59 to 0.07. Employment generation in East Asia was also weak in the services sector. In this case, however, this was due to both a deceleration in output growth and due to deterioration in the employment elasticity: the fall in the rate of growth of employment from over 5 to around 3.5 per cent is shared equally by the two effects. The worst outcome, however, was in agri- culture. Here too there was both a deceleration in output growth and a deterioration in employ- ment elasticity. Indeed, in agriculture employ- ment fell even in absolute terms. The Changing Composition of Manufacturing Overall, therefore, most of the inadequate employment growth in East Asia has been due to the elasticity effect. What caused this? And in particular, why has manufacturing failed to provide sufficient jobs to absorb people moving from the agricultural sector? The answer lies in the manufacturing sector\u2019s changing composi- tion. First, manufacturing has been moving from low-tech, labour-intensive industries such as garments to high-tech and more capital-intensive ones such as electronics. Table 2.10 indicates this process for China and Malaysia, both of which saw a sharp decline in labour-intensive produc- tion. Second, even within more labour-intensive manufacturing, companies have continued to invest in labour-saving equipment: one survey of 28 industries in Malaysia, for example, found a significant decline in labour intensity in 13 industries.

Incomes generated in the manufacturing sector also stimulate consumer demands for services. Table 2.11 shows that while there has been significant growth in the service sector, employment has not kept pace. In East Asia and the Pacific, the employment elasticity of growth has in fact been falling for all sub-sectors except finance and insurance. In South Asia, on the other hand, the employment-generating capacity of all sub-sectors has expanded. This pattern of jobless growth is evident in virtually all the economies in East Asia (Table 2.12). China, for example, whose buoyant exports have contributed to an exceptionally high rate of economic growth \u2013 approaching 10 per cent \u2013 had employment growth of only 1.1 per cent in the 1990s. The employment situation is different in South Asia. Here, despite a deceleration in the rate of economic growth, employment growth remained fairly constant, albeit at a relatively modest rate of about 1.6 per cent \u2013 implying an increase in the employment elasticity, including that for industry (Table 2.8). This is because in South Asia there has been relatively little structural change: during the 1990s traditional labour-intensive and natural-resource-based industries maintained and even increased their shares in value added. In India, for example, the proportion of manufacturing value-added contributed by labour-intensive production remained constant between 1990 and 2000 at 29 per cent (Table 2.13). Increasingly, the employment burden in India has been taken up by the large informal sector \u2013 the residual employer \u2013 which has created work for people who could not find work in agriculture and have left the rural areas.

Overall, however, employment growth in India has been fairly low, at around 1 per cent. The situation is somewhat better in other countries in the subregion. In Bangladesh, for example, employment growth has increased significantly, primarily because of the expansion in the labour-intensive garment export industry, and there has also been some improvement in Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

CHAPTER 2: TRADE AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT: THE ASIA-PACIFIC EXPERIENCE 47 shown a respectable growth of 2.5 per cent in TFP. In Thailand, however, TFP has been stagnant, and in the Philippines it has been falling. These changes in productivity also have an effect on wages. In countries that have relatively tight labour markets and low unemployment, rising productivity is likely to lead to increases in real wages. In East Asia real wages have indeed been rising rapidly: 7 per cent annually in Malaysia, 11 per cent in China, and 12 per cent in Indonesia. In South Asia, on the other hand, where productivity rises have been smaller and unemployment is higher, there was little change in the 1990s: a marginal improvement in Bangladesh; flat in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka; and a small decline in Pakistan.19 There have also been changes in the skill levels of the workforces across the region. This can be seen from the education levels of the unemployed, which tend to be lower as countries move to higher levels of technology. As Figure 2.11 illustrates, in both Indonesia and Thailand, the proportion of the unemployed who were more highly educated fell between 1990 and 2000. This is not surprising given the shift towards medium- and high-technology indus- tries and modern formal-sector services like telecommunications, banking and insurance, which tend to utilize skilled workers more. In India and Sri Lanka, on the other hand, the proportion of the more educated among the unemployed has risen \u2013 giving rise to the pheno- menon of graduate unemployment. There are also differences between the subregions on the employment of women. In East Asia female participation rates are high, close to 80 per cent, but women are more likely than men to be unemployed (Figure 2.12). In South Asia the participation rates are lower, 30 to 70 per cent, but there tend to be smaller disparities in the unemployment rates. Indeed, in Bangladesh the rate in the 1990s was significantly lower for women \u2013 a result in part Figure 2.11: Education level of the unemployed Source: World Bank 2005.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ff86a91-8c8c-4990-8e71-ea190d4791fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ff86a91-8c8c-4990-8e71-ea190d4791fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c3f3d3f819b9351b48e37a26dd47c193fc2dac822994294658c29c4678b3822"}, "2": {"node_id": "5bfcdc3c-030d-4a48-aa17-10a0b970813b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b5554fd9e056a49a47654e2510852ee9a7e69bd2b65174190c1a867d724c74a"}}, "hash": "7f8790b81529d8f5b5afeb249b52c2b041552db181349c7b4239e66876836784", "text": "Figure 2.12: Unemployment rate by sex, 1990s Source: ILO 2005a. of their opportunities for work in the garment sector. Conclusions The above discussion demonstrates that there were fundamental differences between East Asia and South Asia in the 1990s in the linkages between trade, growth and employment. Looking at South Asia, the process of trade liberalization really got under-way during the Many enterprises have become more capital- intensive Male Female ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 48 decade. Exports, both of merchandise and services, responded positively, but there was also an upsurge of imports, including those of agricultural products. The overall growth rate fell somewhat, with the export stimulus being neutralized possibly by the displacement effect of imports on industry and agriculture. However, the rate of employment growth, albeit modest, remained unchanged, owing primarily to three factors: first, stability in the industrial structure sustained by continued reliance on labour-intensive manufactured exports; second, buoyancy of labour-intensive services owing again to the rapid growth of service exports and role of the informal sector", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "935854bc-c50b-4325-b5cd-61eb5fec5466": {"__data__": {"id_": "935854bc-c50b-4325-b5cd-61eb5fec5466", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f81852da6d2b89ef88f222ec68a2ada2dcafc740af633f25fe33d61a7cf20378"}}, "hash": "f81852da6d2b89ef88f222ec68a2ada2dcafc740af633f25fe33d61a7cf20378", "text": "and; third, limited changes in the choice of techniques within industries in the presence of high real interest rates, which raised the cost of capital, and relative stagnation in real wages. The impact of trade on poverty was adverse when judged from the viewpoint of the fall in growth, especially of agriculture. However, it was positive from the viewpoint of faster export growth in labour-intensive manufactures and services, and some improvement in conditions in the labour markets for relatively unskilled and female workers. By the beginning of the 1990s, the process of trade liberalization had been under-way for some time in most East Asian countries. Conditions were ripe for a takeoff to higher rates of export-led growth. This is what happened: exports showed a double-digit growth rate, the balance of trade improved substantially and the economic growth rate went up appreciably, primarily in the manufacturing sector, but agri- culture lost some of its dynamism. There were big changes also in the composition of exports. The share of agricultural products fell, while that of manufactured goods rose sharply. As East Asia moved up the international division of labour, the share in manufacturing output and exports of high-tech, skill-intensive products rose, while that of labour-intensive products declined. Simultaneously, the choice of technique in individual industries shifted towards greater capital intensity. These developments were facilitated by low real interest rates and rapid increases in real wages, primarily due to increased labour productivity. The consequence was that the employment growth rate plummeted, even in the presence of faster growth in output. There was \u2018jobless growth\u2019 both in agriculture and manufacturing. The overall unemployment rate increased, and labour market conditions probably deteriorated for unskilled workers. The rising gaps between urban and rural income, between capital and labour income and between the incomes of skilled and unskilled workers have led to sharp increases in inequality. The failure of employ- ment to rise and the growing income disparities imply that the \u2018trickle down\u2019 effect of fast trade and income growth on human development and poverty reduction is limited. Overall, the linkage between trade and growth is strong in East Asia, while the linkage between growth and employment is weak. In South Asia, the relationship between trade and growth is weaker, while that between growth and employment is stronger. It is interesting to note that in spite of the contrasting experience of relatively lower growth but more pro-poor growth in South Asia in relation to East Asia, both regions have shown virtually the same rate of decline, of about one percentage point per annum, in the incidence of poverty in the second half of the 1990s. The basic lesson is that while growth matters, the nature of this growth also matters. CHAPTER 3: MAKING AGRICULTURAL TRADE WORK FOR THE POOR 51 Economic transformation typically focuses on modernization in the urban areas, but in the poorest countries most people actually live in the countryside. Progress in human development will, therefore, be shaped by what happens to rural communities, whether engaged in agricul- ture or fisheries. The lives of the urban poor too will depend on achieving greater food security. Agriculture is important throughout the region, but its significance varies considerably from country to country. As a proportion of GDP, agriculture\u2019s contribution in 2002 ranged from 6 per cent in the Republic of Korea to 52 per cent in Lao PDR (Table 3.1). It also varies in its share of total employment \u2013 in 2000 this ranged from close to 70 per cent Viet Nam and India to less than 1 per cent in Singapore and Hong Kong, China (SAR) (Table 3.2). Generally, agriculture is more important for the poor countries. Food Insecurity in Asia When agriculture is weakened, this also has a serious effect on food security. Asia is already home to 65 per cent of the world\u2019s food insecure \u2013 over 510 million people around the region. There was some progress in the first half of the 1990s, but since then in most countries \u2013 the exceptions being China, Viet Nam and Thailand \u2013 the number of hungry people has increased. At the turn of the century even the Republic of International trade in agriculture can be a mixed blessing \u2013 on the one hand, benefiting low-income consumers by allowing the possibility of cheap food; on the other hand, threatening the livelihoods of poor farmers and fishing communities. Policymakers in Asia and the Pacific have to balance these and other considerations if they are to ensure that agricultural trade promotes human development.

Korea and Malaysia saw their number of under- nourished stagnate or rise.1 Between 1990 and 1995, India, for example, made significant gains, reducing the total number of hungry people by 13 million, but in the second half of the 1990s, despite economic growth, the number of hungry increased by 18 million.2 Indeed, South Asia as a whole has one ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 52 of the highest proportions of undernourished \u2013 22 per cent \u2013 second only to Sub-Saharan Africa. Malnutrition has profound implications \u2013 damaging health and leading to lifelong physical or cognitive disabilities that reduce chances of survival. It can also be passed from one genera- tion to the next: malnutrition hits particularly hard at women, and when undernourished women give birth to underweight girls, they too may grow up to be malnourished mothers, sus- taining an intergenerational cycle of malnutri- tion. In India and Bangladesh, more than 30 per cent of all children are born under-weight. Malnutrition not only denies people their right to health; it also has serious economic implications. Malnourished children are less able to concentrate in school, and malnourished adults are less able to work effectively \u2013 thus undermining productivity and economic growth. On top of this there are the costs, personal and public, of dealing with poor health: in Bangladesh malnutrition is thought to cost up to 8 per cent of GDP. In India, the costs of iron deficiency alone total more than $30 billion.3 The Effects of Trade In these circumstances a greater engagement in international agricultural trade is likely to have a major impact \u2013 positive or negative \u2013 on the lives of the poor. On the positive side, increasing agricultural exports should stimulate agricul- tural employment and incomes and have second- order multiplier benefits for the associated supply and service industries. This optimistic scenario may not, however, be realized. For one thing, efforts at boosting exports could be frustrated by protectionist policies of the importing countries. And even if exports do increase, they could be more than offset by a rise in imports, which could put a different group of people out of work. Nor do export industries necessarily benefit other parts of the economy: if they lack connections to rural enterprises, the economic \u2018multiplier\u2019 could be quite low. The government\u2019s revenues too may be smaller than expected: if it had to reduce tariffs to encourage trade, its income could indeed fall. Other factors might also cause trade libera- lization and export increases to yield disappoint- ing results. If, for example, exporting countries concentrate on primary commodities such as coffee or tea, then increasing the volumes could flood world markets with these goods and cause prices to fall. Some countries may be able to escape this trap by diversifying to higher-value crops, but the poorer countries may not have the necessary capacity or the infrastructure. Another possibility is that most of the benefits from a rise in exports could be captured by transnational trading and manufacturing companies, leaving few gains for the cultivators. The Pattern of Global Agricultural Trade Though trade in agricultural goods has been growing, it still only accounts for a small proportion of total agricultural output \u2013 most of which is still consumed nationally. For staple food crops, only for wheat is global trade consistently above 10 per cent of total world production (Table 3.3).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a1f57b1-95fd-4616-80ef-4634428680e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a1f57b1-95fd-4616-80ef-4634428680e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ac4b12c24926e962566696ca911e24ebb61a07bcd67cf1eeef35d9f9c098b5d"}, "2": {"node_id": "97596e20-e5f6-4286-8cb9-6fbbc504e697", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72e5cc7bcd8ac2cf175a6bac9c351359a0bfbd15cdd5616f2118e66f7a6e1486"}}, "hash": "4e6f1f9129ffbeb824d6d14e9f6f1e531918eb2df9fd937cbfd6b8e89b8aae6a", "text": "The proportion tends to be higher for plantation crops, but even for these Malnutrition not only denies people their right to health; it also has serious economic implications TABLE 3.3 SHARE OF WORLD PRODUCTION OF SELECTED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS TRADED ACROSS BORDERS 2005 Commodity Proportion traded internationally (%) Coffee 68 Tea 40 Soybeans 34 Sugar 21 Bananas 20 Cotton 18 Wheat 17 Feed grains 11 Rice 7 Source: FAS/USDA 2005.

In recent years they have also suffered a deterioration in the balance of trade between exports and imports: in the early 1960s, they had an overall annual agricul- tural trade surplus of almost $7 billion, but by the early 1970s their trade surplus fell to about $1 billion, and by the end of the 1980s it had disappeared. Indeed, since the beginning of the 1990s developing countries have generally been net importers of agricultural products, with a deficit in 2001, for example, of $11 billion.4 The deficit has been caused by rising imports of food. In 2001, globally the Least Developed Countries imported $4.8 billion worth of food, corresponding to 10 to 12 per cent of national calorific intake. The \u2018net food-importing deve- loping countries\u2019 were even more dependent. In the same year, they imported $10.1 billion worth, corresponding to 35 per cent of calorific intake. The value of imports may be consider- ably lower than the peak reached in 1996 (Figure 3.1), when food commodity prices were at cyclical highs, but in real terms, in recent decades it has been increasing by more than 6 per cent annually. The change was most drastic for the LDCs. From being net food exporters, they became net food importers. Indeed, by the end of the 1990s their imports were more than double their exports. And for both groups of countries this trade gap seems destined to widen further. Between 1970 and 2001 developing countries as a whole saw their food imports rise by 115 per cent, but by 2030 their annual imports are expected to reach $50 billion. The developed countries too have seen an increase over the same period, though only by around 45 per cent.5 Not only have the developing countries experienced a growing food trade deficit, they have also suffered a deterioration in the terms of agricultural trade. Although commodity prices overall have been falling for the past 40 years, they have fallen most steeply for the type of exports that mostly come from developing coun- tries, such as raw materials, tropical beverages, oil crops and cereals \u2013 rather than for the goods exported mostly by the developed countries: horticultural, meat and dairy products. Some developing countries have responded by shifting from tropical beverages and raw materials \u2013 coffee, tea, cocoa, sugar, cotton and tobacco \u2013 to higher-value crops. But this is more difficult for farmers in the LDCs, most of whom lack the funds to invest. As a result, for the LDCs between the 1960s and 1999\u20132001, the propor- tion of their exports accounted for by raw materials and tropical beverages increased from 59 to 72 per cent. The Food-Trading Countries For food crops \u2013 principally cereals, rice and meat \u2013 developing countries that trade interna- tionally fall roughly into one of three categories: Figure 3.1: Commercial food import bills Source: FAO 2003a. Not only have the developing countries experienced a growing food trade deficit, they have also suffered a deterioration in the terms of agricultural trade ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 54 1. The natural exporters. These countries have favourable geographical conditions, sparse populations, or specific experiences that have encouraged an extensive low-cost agri- cultural sector that delivers substantial sur- pluses of food staples.6 In Asia, these include Thailand (rice and poultry) and Viet Nam (rice). 2. The self-sufficient countries. These are the majority of developing countries, which have been largely self-sufficient in food. When they do trade in global markets, they are more likely to buy than sell, but can usually finance necessary imports by export- ing other agricultural products, typically tropical plantation crops. 3. The net importers. These, many of which are also among the world\u2019s poorest countries, are chronically dependent on imports for basic food supplies. And their numbers could increase following trade liberalization if cheap food imports encourage farmers and businesses to switch to more profitable commercial crops. The developed countries might be classified in similar groups. Thus, Australia, Canada and the United States are also natural exporters of staple foods. Europe also has significant exports, of sugar for example, but EU countries might better be termed as \u2018unnatural exporters\u2019 since their surpluses are largely sustained by subsidies. Many other countries are net food importers but have no difficulty in financing this through exports of industrial products.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99e80291-63a5-4654-9add-9d3c3dcdb462": {"__data__": {"id_": "99e80291-63a5-4654-9add-9d3c3dcdb462", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "70ab477da2768c5fb7443b4a955be869e68500418769d9be259e668120302057"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3df4285-2d84-461b-8a75-73414cd7920d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa4043e6dd8c26cdb85fb7a4c4bb55bde5aeb5f8f50cb7e059d15eb3d09b9bda"}}, "hash": "ee019f6a2f3da080a7235e902e9cd17caf51adf0ebdf21b58125e88e088fe08c", "text": "The overall balance of food trade between developed and developing countries varies between different products.

Agricultural Trade in the Asia-Pacific Region Countries in the Asia-Pacific region thus have a vital interest in the trade in agricultural pro- ducts. In global terms, however, they are hardly major players. Even the region\u2019s largest exporter, China, ranks only at number 9, with 3.3 per cent of global trade (Table 3.4).

CHAPTER 3: MAKING AGRICULTURAL TRADE WORK FOR THE POOR 55 greater weight in other areas of international trade, particularly manufactured exports. This is illustrated in Figure 3.2, which plots countries according to their ranks as merchandise expor- ters and agricultural exporters. Thus, Japan ranks second in terms of merchandise trade but only eighth in agricultural trade; indeed any country below the 45-degree line is more impor- tant in merchandise exports than it is in agricul- tural exports. On the other hand, Australia, Thailand, Indonesia and New Zealand rank higher for agricultural trade. Of the leading exports of either category, only China has the same ranking in both. The principal route to success for most Asian countries seems to be the more productive non-agricultural sector \u2013 though countries like Malaysia and the Republic of Korea have largely developed their export sectors by investing the surplus of their agricultural output in them. Even today, Viet Nam has agricultural exports as an important source of foreign exchange and will suffer from any distortions in trade. More worrying for the future is the prospect of food shortages. Now that China has become a major food importer, global food supplies could become much tighter, with serious impli- cations for the major food importers. Food is not like any other tradable commodity, and a number of countries in the region may, therefore, become more preoccupied with national food security and will want to move closer to national self-sufficiency \u2013 which will imply greater pro- tection for farmers who find it difficult to compete at world prices, especially when these are distorted by subsidies in the US and the EU. Protectionism in the North One reason why developing countries have limited representation in global agricultural markets is that they face determined and unfair protectionism. Many developed countries, despite their promises to reduce trade barriers, continue to shield their farmers from foreign competition.7 There was some progress in the 1990s. For the OECD as a whole, between 1986\u201388 and 1995\u201397, the level of producer support as a proportion of farm receipts fell from 37 to 30 per cent.8 Unfortunately, it has stayed around this level ever since. In 2004 this was worth $279 billion, and taking into account support for general services to agriculture such as research, infrastructure, inspection, and marketing and promotion, total support to agriculture was equivalent to 1.2 per cent of OECD GDP. There may have been some change in the composition of this support \u2013 substituting measures that are considered trade-distorting with those that are supposedly not, but the overall level remains much the same and is particularly high for products that are critical to Asia \u2013 rice, sugar, milk, wheat and meat. As a result of these subsidies the producers of a whole range of products \u2013 including corn, wheat, rice, soy, dairy, meat and cotton \u2013 can dump these on world markets, making it very difficult for developing countries to compete. In the Agreement on Agriculture from the 1986\u20131994 Uruguay Round of trade negotia- tions, the developed countries committed them- selves to reducing the extent of their domestic support.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2dbbaff8-a8d2-41e7-90d7-025f71703390": {"__data__": {"id_": "2dbbaff8-a8d2-41e7-90d7-025f71703390", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5190da329fe00e57fcadb0837e80d357f61a010134db17e299ccf6dc80a63b67"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd3c75da-d168-451f-8ba8-89958d41be53", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c067427935fa53b27a75130af5cf29b56e941ae49c4c1abb46d0e911bfc9440f"}}, "hash": "0911ef46149a12353800e80d5fd9fd50a5bb0e58a7cf038ca5be7cbeb50df7cf", "text": "However, the rules are so skewed that although they prevent middle-income develop- ing countries from using subsidies, they have enabled the EU to continue giving such support (Table 3.5), and the US to increase it.

Rice subsidies in the US, for example, which enabled it to main- tain exports even during the 1990s when world prices were falling, have affected rice farmers all over the region, but especially in Thailand, Viet Nam and India. Maize subsidies have also driven prices down, affecting farmers in the Philippines and China. Soy subsidies have similarly under- mined the livelihoods of 2.5 million Indonesian farmers. Collapsing prices have meant that many producers in the region have been unable to sell even in their own domestic markets, creating rural unemployment and increasing poverty. Tariff Barriers The OECD countries offer a great deal of protection to their farmers through subsidies. On the face of it, their protection through tariffs might seem quite low, or at least lower than in developing countries \u2013 since applied tariffs on TABLE 3.5 EUROPEAN UNION \u2013 ESTIMATES OF SUPPORT TO AGRICULTURE, $ MILLIONS 1986\u201388 2002\u201304 2002 2003 2004* Farm-gate value of 211,407 245,289 242,506 242,428 250,933 production Total support estimate 106,372 113,401 109,972 117,223 113,007 (TSE) Transfers from 82,142 55,343 53,684 57,550 54,795 consumers Transfers from 25,747 58,960 56,676 61,059 59,146 taxpayers Budget revenues \u20131,517 \u2013903 \u2013388 \u20131,386 \u2013935 TSE share of 2.82 1.20 1.20 1.26 1.16 GDP (%) Notes: European Union refers to the EU\u201315 countries in 2004. * provisional.

But, a high proportion of tariff lines in agriculture \u2013 44 per cent for the EU and 43 per cent for the US \u2013 are non-ad valorem duties, which when converted to ad valorem equivalents are much higher. Moreover, these are averages across all tariff lines. For certain commodity groups that are of particular interest to developing countries, the rates are very high. For the OECD countries as a whole, these amount to around 350 per cent for tobacco, 277 per cent for chocolate, 171 per cent for oilseeds, and 134 per cent for poultry.13 The other form of protection is through tariff escalation \u2013 setting low tariffs for raw materials but steadily escalating the rates as commodities are converted to finished goods. Escalation is particularly pronounced on com- modity sectors important to the poorest deve- loping countries: meat, sugar, fruit, coffee, cocoa, hides and skins.14 The US, for example, has tariff rates of zero, 0.2 and 15.3 per cent on raw cocoa, intermediate products", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78316d14-4aaa-4d78-af27-b23e2b57ad63": {"__data__": {"id_": "78316d14-4aaa-4d78-af27-b23e2b57ad63", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28710a33c068762355e4762363f0c56a998ce902666ee16a8e04cde4a9203691"}}, "hash": "28710a33c068762355e4762363f0c56a998ce902666ee16a8e04cde4a9203691", "text": "and final pro- ducts respectively. Moreover, these are weighted averages and mask very high peaks: the maxi- mum tariff on final products is 186 per cent. The situation is similar for the EU with respect to fruit, for example. The tariff rates are 9.9, 18.5 and 18.0 per cent on raw, intermediate and processed fruit products, with a maximum for fruit products of 98 per cent. Again, many of these rates are non-ad valorem, so the percen- tages underestimate the full scale of the tariffs.15 Tariff escalation will reduce a country\u2019s chances of exporting processed products. How- ever, the developed countries seem to be more successful at overcoming this obstacle; overall, they get 68 per cent of their agricultural export earnings from processed products, while for developing countries the proportion is 57 per cent and for the LDCs only 20 per cent.16 As a result of their selective protection methods, the developed countries overall apply higher tariffs to goods from developing countries than they do to goods from other developed countries. As is clear from Figure 3.3, the rates are highest for goods from East Asia and South Asia. Transnational Companies and Small Farmers Market distortions are the result not just of subsidies and tariffs, but also of the power of a few vertically integrated transnational compa- nies that dominate the entire food chain \u2013 from distributing seeds to placing products on super- market shelves. For soybean crushing, for example, more than 70 per cent of the US market and around 80 per cent of the European market is controlled by just three companies.17 Similarly for grains: at the global level, trading, storage, processing and milling are dominated by a few big companies. This is worrying for a number of reasons. First, large corporations prefer to deal with a few Figure 3.3: Tariffs levied by developed countries on imports from each region (%) Source: FAO 2004a. Subsidies have enabled OECD countries to export a number of commodities at prices below the cost of production ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 58 large producers, rather than with a multitude of small suppliers, thereby squeezing many small producers out of the market. Second, they greatly influence, or even determine, world prices \u2013 affecting not only food traded interna- tionally but also the prices of products that appear in the smallest village markets. This control is most visible to consumers in the spread of supermarkets. Globally, the top 30 supermarkets control almost one-third of grocery sales, and they have been expanding at a remarkable pace in the Asia-Pacific region. In East Asia, for example, over the past decade the supermarkets\u2019 share of retail food sales has ballooned from less than 20 to more than 50 per cent. Supermarkets want to deal with a small number of reliable suppliers who can deliver on schedule large volumes of high-quality produce \u2013 which for farmers generally requires substan- tial investments in irrigation, greenhouses, trucks, cooling sheds and packing technology. This is a tall order for small farmers, though some have made a success of contract farming.18 Distorted Trade and Human Development All these distortions in global agricultural trade can adversely affect farmers \u2013 eroding their means of livelihood and their security. As a result, even countries that are successful agricul- tural exporters do not necessarily achieve higher standards of human development. Thailand, for example, is Asia\u2019s largest food exporter, but its small farmers have gained little from its increased exports of rice. Since 2001, Thailand has exported more than 7 million tonnes annually \u2013 about 30 per cent of world rice exports \u2013 yet about 40 per cent of rural households live below the poverty line. The government has prioritized commercial rice production, while millions of small farming families have fallen into debt and lost their lands, partly because of low prices for their crops: about 4.7 million of the 5.7 million farming families have no land, or inadequate land to sustain themselves. Malnutrition is increasing: in 2000, 18 per cent of Thai households were malnourished. Thailand appears to be feeding the world on the backs of its poor rice farmers. Similarly, the World Bank found that since China\u2019s accession to the WTO in 2001 and its subsequent liberalization of agriculture, the poorest rural households have suffered a 6 per cent drop in their living standards due to the combined effects of a drop in real wages and an increase in the prices of consumer goods.19 The study also found that liberalization has widened rural-urban income gaps: since 2001, most urban dwellers have seen their incomes rise, while rural households have on average seen their", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2e53cff-a082-4cbd-8de8-f3bcfb80ef77": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2e53cff-a082-4cbd-8de8-f3bcfb80ef77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1188d91352b572b4ca98cc834d210724bb780b2e0524083076427fabbc801a5b"}}, "hash": "1188d91352b572b4ca98cc834d210724bb780b2e0524083076427fabbc801a5b", "text": "incomes drop, with the poorest being most seriously affected \u2013 a fall that is raising the prospect of some discontent in the rural areas. Not all these are effects of distorted interna- tional trade patterns. Many are linked to libera- lization measures associated with structural adjustment and the conditions imposed by World Bank and IMF lending. Indeed, these programmes have often required liberalization on a scale even more sweeping than those required under the Uruguay Round. They have also required a number of other measures \u2013 such as privatizing state-run enterprises, eliminating subsidies and price controls, and abolishing marketing boards (Box 3.1). Why should liberalization damage the interests of poor farmers? There seem to be a number of interrelated factors.20 These include: \u2022 Falling prices. Liberalization opens local markets to imports and thus to low world prices. Farmers could respond by switching from food to commercial crops, though they would not necessarily do any better, since the prices for these too have fallen as more countries enter the market. \u2022 Rising cost of inputs. Farmers now have to pay more for inputs such as fertilizers \u2013 partly because the world prices for these Market distortions are the result not just of subsidies and tariffs, but also of the power of a few vertically integrated transnational companies CHAPTER 3: MAKING AGRICULTURAL TRADE WORK FOR THE POOR 59 have been rising, but also because govern- ments have been withdrawing subsidies. \u2022 Withdrawal of state services. The removal of services for irrigation, post-harvest facilities and farm-to-market roads in the Philippines, for example, has meant that small-scale farmers are unable to improve productivity levels or get their products to market at prices that cover costs. \u2022 Land consolidation. Trade liberalization can make some land more valuable for mecha- nized farming of certain crops. This leads to land consolidation. Whilst the concentration of farms can increase productivity and competitiveness, it also drives tenants and small farmers from their land, and in the absence of safety nets adds to unemploy- ment and poverty.21 In Cambodia, for example, following trade liberalization, land was concentrated into fewer hands, and between 1983 and 2003 the proportion of rural households who were landless rose from 3 to 20 per cent. \u2022 Rising gender inequality. Prior to libera- lization, many women sold their produce to parastatals. Now they have to sell to traders, who may take a greater cut. Women are also affected disproportionately by the elimina- tion of subsidies, the drying up of credit and the surge of food imports. \u2022 Unsustainability. The international food market encourages farmers to devote large areas to single crops, with excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides, which can cause damage to both land and water supplies. Trade liberalization does, of course, have positive effects. Not only does it lower prices for consumers, it can also enable rural communities, and especially women, to engage in non- agricultural activities through micro- and small enterprises, for example. However, the positive effects are often far outweighed by the negative. Making Agricultural Trade Work for the Poor Neither economic growth nor an expansion of trade will necessarily benefit the poor; indeed, it may harm them. What would it take to make trade work for the poor? Changing international trade rules will be important, but national governments can also take measures to change the context within which trade liberalization operates. BOX 3.1 AGRICULTURAL TRADE LIBERALIZATION IN INDONESIA Following the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the IMF imposed sweeping trade liberalization conditions as part of its multimillion-dollar loan to Indonesia. These included lowering tariffs as well as the deregulation of BULOG, the state food purchasing and distribution agency, thus providing the major agricultural exporters, such as the US, with access to a large market for their agricultural surpluses. Indonesia\u2019s applied tariff rates were brought down to 5 per cent or less even on staple products. The tariffs on soy and rice were set at zero and on corn at 5 per cent. Only after social and political chaos and rioting was the rice tariff adjusted to 30 per cent (Kwa 2004). Before deregulation, BULOG had sole control over imports of the major food commodities coming into Indonesia, and hence was able to regulate food supplies and domestic prices. This role has been dismantled almost completely. BULOG no longer controls the quantities being imported, and private traders have total freedom in this regard. BULOG\u2019s previous role in ensuring distribution of rice and other staples between regions has also been severely limited. The results of liberalization have been dramatic. During the 1980s Indonesia was at times self-sufficient in rice, but over the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2d5a4b3-4dd2-482c-ab65-430f3d7188c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2d5a4b3-4dd2-482c-ab65-430f3d7188c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ad2d267c72a1bc0e7b9afc04e957af515019808754d535de9cc24bed2a5bfdd"}, "3": {"node_id": "2aad546f-fed0-4634-82fb-3c375e4164bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b5619b75158c12dbe1339344797a5b24d95afe11f5b82a936bab581089b85bd3"}}, "hash": "48f283b9332f6009c4dfa2c94089d405b9085f625b192e78f9c30035be4eb774", "text": "period 1988\u20132002 it imported on average 10 per cent of national needs. The US has been the clear winner in this market-opening exercise. US exports to Indonesia, amounting to $411 million in 2000, climbed to $720 million in 2001. Since then, imports have increased even further (Setiwant 2003). The impact on rural employment is clearest in soybeans. Where there were 5 million soybean producers in 1996, by 2001 there were only 2.5 million. Taking one producer to be supporting a family of four, 10 million people\u2019s lives have been affected. Whilst some soy farmers may have switched to rice or corn, the more likely scenario is that they would have left farming altogether. ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 60 1. Promote Agricultural Development Although more than half the region\u2019s population depend on agriculture for their livelihoods, relatively little has been done to promote productivity and employment. Indeed, public expenditure on agriculture has been declining. Between 1990 and 2001, public expenditure on agriculture as a proportion of GDP in four South-East Asian countries fell from 8.4 to 3.8 per cent, in three South Asian countries from 1.9 to 1.2 per cent, and in two countries of the South Pacific from 1.0 to 0.8 per cent.22 India is an example where the government in the past decade has largely neglected the agricultural sector. Though most of India\u2019s poor live in the countryside, investment in agriculture has been in serious decline, between the 1980s and the 1990s falling by 29 per cent. Just as important is the shortage of agricultural credit. While consumers can take loans to buy a house or a car at interest rates of 9 to 11 per cent, farmers wanting crop loans can be charged 17 per cent. Even then, most farmers cannot even access government loans and have to rely on moneylenders who can charge them rates of several hundred per cent. If governments want broad-based and equitable development, they will need to invest more in agriculture \u2013 particularly for capital formation \u2013 while providing price support, affordable loans, assistance with irrigation and marketing, and help with storage, processing and distribution facilities. 2. Carry Out Land Reform Governments serious about agricultural deve- lopment will need to make more serious efforts at land reform. In Asia, one-third to one-half of smallholders subsist on less than one hectare. In Bangladesh, for example, 78 per cent of rural household are classified as land-poor. In India the proportion is 71 per cent. Elsewhere, the proportions may be smaller but still significant: more than one-third in Indonesia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. If anything, the problem seems to be getting worse as the concentration on export agriculture and the growth of cities and industry combine to push more poor families off their land. Land ownership is particularly difficult for women. In Nepal, for example, even though two-thirds of agricultural labourers are women, until very recently they were permitted to own land only as part of a married couple, and when couples separated the land rights went to the husband. While women can inherit property since 2002, it reverts back to the natal family upon marrriage.23 Recent attempts at land reform have not got very far. In the Philippines, for example, the government\u2019s Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Programme (CARP) has never really been implemented. The Philippines has also attempted \u2018market-assisted land reform\u2019, which involves helping the landless procure land directly from landowners. However, the beneficiary only gets help if he or she presents a farm plan that is geared towards commercial cash crops. The programme does not, therefore, promote small- scale farming. Also, the current landholders object strongly, and given the scarcity of land are unwilling to sell. The farmers\u2019 movements are also opposed, because of the unequal bargaining positions of the landholder and the farmer. All in all, the programme has not been very successful. 3. Address Relative Prices Trade liberalization also alters relative product prices, and therefore, its net impact on poverty reduction depends also on the direction of price changes and how they affect input and factor prices and farmers\u2019 incomes. If the price changes are pro-poor, then they will tend to reinforce any positive growth effects of trade reform on the Governments serious about agricultural development will need to make more serious efforts at land reform CHAPTER 3: MAKING AGRICULTURAL TRADE WORK FOR THE POOR 61 poor.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2aad546f-fed0-4634-82fb-3c375e4164bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "2aad546f-fed0-4634-82fb-3c375e4164bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ad2d267c72a1bc0e7b9afc04e957af515019808754d535de9cc24bed2a5bfdd"}, "2": {"node_id": "a2d5a4b3-4dd2-482c-ab65-430f3d7188c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "48f283b9332f6009c4dfa2c94089d405b9085f625b192e78f9c30035be4eb774"}}, "hash": "b5619b75158c12dbe1339344797a5b24d95afe11f5b82a936bab581089b85bd3", "text": "However, the outcome also depends on complementary policy changes, specifically on whether or not they: \u2022 Create new markets that are pro-poor; \u2022 Stimulate the poor to respond to altered prices and new market opportunities; \u2022 Provide second-round spillover effects that are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c2a1234-a367-4185-a4ee-4ee8da231930": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c2a1234-a367-4185-a4ee-4ee8da231930", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae0a80e63514fc6f4322aa1e40805930f190105ccb8ad9819c8770ef3873dfc9"}}, "hash": "ae0a80e63514fc6f4322aa1e40805930f190105ccb8ad9819c8770ef3873dfc9", "text": "pro-poor; \u2022 Minimize any transitional unemployment that concentrates on the poor; \u2022 Raise government revenue that leads to pro- poor public expenditure; and \u2022 Reduce the vulnerability of the poor.24 4. Offer Protection to Poor Producers At present many poor farmers find it difficult to compete. Governments will, therefore, need to find ways of protecting small farmers who are viable food producers but are threatened by low world prices either through higher tariffs, prices support or subsidies on inputs. Agricultural Trade Policies of Developing Countries Given their different patterns of agricultural trade, individual developing countries will also have different interests, depending on whether they are exporters or importers. Producers of tropical beverages and raw materials will aim for access to global markets and a steady income. They want to avoid price volatility and ensure that they are not persistent losers in the shifting terms of trade between tropical pro- ducts, food and non-agricultural products. Thus, they would benefit by coordinating their produc- tion programmes so as to maintain steady supp- lies, for example, while also establishing effective insurance systems in case demand dips tempo- rarily. Food exporters too would welcome stability in terms of access and prices; they would also want to adjust their own patterns of production to reduce dependence on imports. The most significant dilemma for develop- ing countries, however, concerns the impact of international trade on the prices of staple foods. Should governments aim to maintain prices to provide decent livelihoods to farmers, or should they lower prices so as to help poor urban consumers? This is a major issue for Indonesia, for example, which is a large domestic producer of rice but is not self-sufficient and has to import to meet the rice gap. Selling imported rice at low world prices could harm local producers and, therefore, Indonesia applies tariffs on imports. Some, including the World Bank, argue that these tariffs should be removed or should be as low as possible since the poorest Indonesians spend 30 per cent of their incomes on rice.25 Others argue that a cheap rice policy is counter- productive. If Indonesian farmers get low farm- gate prices, they are unable to improve their situation and are less able to invest in education, which means that Indonesia will remain with an unskilled, low-wage and low-productivity eco- nomy.26 Continuing rural poverty also depresses local purchasing power and the demand for other domestic products and thus hampers national development, sustaining a high degree of dependence on foreign markets.27 In practice, the trend in agricultural trade is towards greater liberalization. In some cases this is because countries have entered into bilateral, regional or multilateral agreements that require more open trading. In others, however, countries have either liberalized unilaterally or have been required to do so by international agencies on which they rely for capital inflows to cover balance of payments deficits. Unfortunately, much of this liberalization has been asymmetric. Developing countries have liberalized their agricultural trade far more than the developed countries, which have maintained significant levels of subsidies to national food producers as well as using technical non-tariff barriers. This asymmetry has been accentuated by the Uruguay Round agreements on Trade- Developing countries have liberalized their agricultural trade far more than the developed countries ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 62 Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), within which the clauses on Geogra- phical Indications have so far mostly been exploited by the developed countries. The deve- loping countries could, however, also use these as a lever to advance their human development agenda. The Current Negotiations The current Doha Round of trade negotiations offers an opportunity to correct these inequities. But they do not seem to be going in the right direction \u2013 particularly with respect to the \u2018Green Box\u2019, which refers to support that can be unrestricted, and the \u2018Blue Box\u2019, where there are more restrictions (see Notes 9 and 10). Early in the negotiations, the US and the EU managed to ensure that they could continue to misuse Green Box support measures and even maintain and extend the Blue Box measures that should have been phased out at the end of the Uruguay Round.28 There have been some gains. The meeting of the General Council of the WTO in July 2004 led to a framework agreement that required the developed countries to reduce and eventually eliminate direct and indirect subsidies to agricul- tural exports. It also obtained a promise of a substantial reduction of domestic support to farmers.29 However, the text allows for some exemptions \u2013 notably, through a provision for lower cuts for an \u2018appropriate number\u2019 of \u2018sensitive products\u2019.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b8f0728-fe87-46b8-8dbf-9f298f092c26": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b8f0728-fe87-46b8-8dbf-9f298f092c26", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f77588b6fafa70ccf8f588fc2e11688b127b9e265e5b09c9492da629351d95e3"}}, "hash": "f77588b6fafa70ccf8f588fc2e11688b127b9e265e5b09c9492da629351d95e3", "text": "This will, for example, allow the US to protect uncompetitive products such as sugar. Even so, the developing countries have made some gains. The agreement explicitly recognized the need for \u2018special and differential treatment\u2019 for developing countries in terms of the scale of tariff reduction, the number and treatment of sensitive products and the length of the imple- mentation period. In particular, just as the deve- loped countries can designate certain \u2018sensitive products\u2019, the developing countries can identify an appropriate number of \u2018special products\u2019 that will be eligible for more flexible treatment and not subject to tariff reduction commitments \u2013 based on their contribution to food security, for example, and rural development needs. The framework also provided for \u2018special safeguard mechanisms\u2019 against disruptive imports, import surges, or sharp price declines in specific agri- cultural products. How much has really been achieved? The eventual elimination of export subsidies would of course be welcome, but these should already have been phased out, even under current WTO rules. The main change is that the EU, which is the primary user of such direct subsidies, has made its reductions conditional on parallel re- ductions on the more indirect subsidies, such as export credits that are primarily used by the US. The main sticking point, however, is not on support for exports but on direct support to domestic producers. Developed countries have so far offered very little on this, which makes up the bulk of agricultural support. This framework agreement was largely ratified at the December 2005 WTO meeting in Hong Kong. The EU accepted at this meeting that it would phase out export subsidies by 2013, though this only corresponds to the reduction already envisaged in the reform of the EU Common Agricultural Policy that was to be completed by 2013. On other agricultural issues, the Hong Kong Declaration reiterates the need to work out ways to reduce tariffs and domestic support and says that the greatest reductions will be expected from countries giving the most domestic support and applying the highest import tariffs. However, these seem unlikely to result in any significant cuts in support. For developing countries, Hong Kong has, therefore, produced three limited gains: the EU commitment to phase out export subsidies by 2013; the opportunities to designate certain \u2018special products\u2019 that will not be subject to tariff CHAPTER 3: MAKING AGRICULTURAL TRADE WORK FOR THE POOR 63 reduction commitments, and the \u2018special safe- guard mechanism\u2019 to deal with import surges or sharp declines in prices. Intellectual Property Another contentious feature of the international trade regime instituted through the Uruguay Round was the agreement on TRIPS. This aims to protect the rights of individuals and compa- nies that have invested in research and develop- ment \u2013 giving them the opportunity to recoup their costs on the grounds that, without such protection, they will have little incentive to make similar investments in the future. Others argue, however, that such protection is unnecessary \u2013 that the period in which compe- titors try to match their innovations already offers sufficient opportunities to recoup R&D costs. And in some respects nowadays there should actually be less need for protection, for as modern products become more complex, the capital costs increase, which poses barriers to entry and alleviates the risk of failure \u2013 thus deterring competitors. Moreover, many of the innovations for new products lie less in the pro- ducts themselves than in the way they are produced; the process of technological change is thus embodied in the firms, which further under- mines the position of potential competitors. There are also many problems with ambi- guous definitions. At what point, for example, does an increment in human knowledge warrant being described as an innovation? And how does one take into account the fact that much inno- vation builds on common property, for example, drugs derived from natural products? If the innovator is allowed to charge, should the country or community that provided the original material not also have similar rights? Despite these and many other objections, the developed countries have been demanding stronger international patent protection, and in particular have been pressing it through the trade regime via the TRIPS agreement. This brings a number of advantages: first, because it creates an opportunity for enforcement; coun- tries that do not respect intellectual property rights (IPRs) would face retaliation through trade sanctions. Second, it creates an interna- tional body, in the form of the Dispute Settle- ments Panel of the WTO, to which IPR violations can be referred. Third, it passes the responsibility for policing the rights to national governments, who would not want to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9403efe-2a53-45ab-b277-0e324cd05c73": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9403efe-2a53-45ab-b277-0e324cd05c73", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "406e7b80db91af32beffe8519f00625e1b8c8d532b866fd96727c79e69f8162b"}, "3": {"node_id": "e2d8d729-cad7-4d6a-9977-daa1abe21b7b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f27e7938335a52a9e5831226b4936e8921bce4d2fbbc45a23b7bc912c2efbcfa"}}, "hash": "fb36df64383006fa88e6024ae2e96c843642f4fc5be88f5729f4ddaa05aa1dd9", "text": "see all exporters penalized for infractions by a single enterprise. The Uruguay Round agreement thus not only forced countries to recognize IPRs, it also created a workable mechanism for enforc- ing those rights. Until recently, the main implications of this for agriculture would have been for inputs like fertilizers, pesticides and machinery. Matters have changed because of two kinds of techno- logical development. First, since the years of the Green Revolution many companies have been producing hybrids or varieties generated through scientific research. Second, more recently, researchers have been using genetic engineering and biotechnology to manipulate genes to produce crop varieties that have higher yields and greater pest resistance, and are more appropriate for particular conditions of climate, soil and moisture. Transnational corporations hope, therefore, to apply patents to \u2018plant variety protection\u2019, arguing that this will ensure further research. This is doubtful, since in most of the developing world such research is mainly financed by governments, and commercial varieties generally offer cosmetic differences using lines or strains based on research provided by public insti- tutions. In fact, some forms of protection will inhibit future research. This was evident even during the Green Revolution, when seed multinationals such as Monsanto and Pioneer Hi-Bred Inter- national Inc managed to get patents for plants Developing countries can rightly claim that transnational companies are plundering their resources ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 64 that prevented farmers from saving the seeds of the resulting crops. This meant that, when the International Centre for Maize and Wheat Improvement in Mexico developed semi-dwarf improved varieties of wheat for developing countries, it could not offer these to India, where they were covered by a utility patent in America. As a result, the Green Revolution in India did not boost the production of maize. Conse- quently, patent protection can create new obstacles to agricultural improvement. Companies can also reinforce this legal form of protection with a technical one by engineering varieties whose \u2018terminator seeds\u2019 do not germi- nate, or in which during natural reproduction a certain quality collapses or cannot be trans- mitted through seeds. They can also tailor plants to ensure that they will not express a particular trait, such as herbicide resistance, unless they are sprayed with specific chemicals that activate the right gene. Developing countries can rightly claim that transnational companies are plundering their resources. Tropical countries are oceans of bio- diversity and provide most of the original species as the basis for research in the developed coun- tries. This has been referred to as \u2018biopiracy\u2019, when foreign companies steal and then patent biological resources and traditional knowledge from the developing countries. The US patent on the use of turmeric for healing wounds is a well- known case in point. But there have also been other cases where biotechnology and patenting are damaging deve- loping countries in a more insidious way. Thus far, generations of plant breeding in different countries have produced distinctive and valuable varieties. Biotechnology can take these varieties and engineer them so that they will also grow in other places \u2013 as has happened with basmati rice, for which the commercial plant breeder, RiceTec, built on traditional knowledge without having to pay for it, and managed to differentiate its product to render it \u2018novel\u2019 enough to be consi- dered for a patent. But what constitutes novelty is generally an arbitrary judgement. Geographical Indications Despite these implications, it has been argued that developing countries could, even if partially, exploit the TRIPS agreement in their favour. For example, by using the system of Geographical Indications (GIs). These are indications \u2013 words, phrases, symbols or images \u2013 that identify a good as originating in a territory, where a given quality, reputation, or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geogra- phical origin.30 Geographical Indications are thus unlike patents in that they do not protect new creations but simply recognize existing ones. The idea originated in Europe and most GIs refer to products from developed countries, such as Champagne, Cognac, Roquefort cheese, Napa Valley wines and Scotch whisky.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2d8d729-cad7-4d6a-9977-daa1abe21b7b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2d8d729-cad7-4d6a-9977-daa1abe21b7b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "406e7b80db91af32beffe8519f00625e1b8c8d532b866fd96727c79e69f8162b"}, "2": {"node_id": "e9403efe-2a53-45ab-b277-0e324cd05c73", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb36df64383006fa88e6024ae2e96c843642f4fc5be88f5729f4ddaa05aa1dd9"}}, "hash": "f27e7938335a52a9e5831226b4936e8921bce4d2fbbc45a23b7bc912c2efbcfa", "text": "Examples of GIs in Asia include: Basmati rice, Phu Quoc fish sauce, Long Jing tea, Himalayan waters, Alphonso and Sindhri mangoes, Hunza apricots, Bhutanese red rice, Mongolian Cashmere, Pakistani Shu (windproof woollen fabric) and Ajrak (designs from Sindh), Jasmine (Hom Mali) rice and Thai silk, Lao Agar fragrance, Sumatra Mandheling coffee, Shaoxing alcohol, Maotai, Xuancheng art paper; and Ceylon and Darjeeling teas.

Asian nations have a wide range of distin- guished products, but only a few are globally known \u2013 which means there is a tremendous scope to publicize them at home and abroad. Once a Geographical Indication is recognized, communities and enterprises in the designated area can stop other people from using it. They are also in a position to charge a premium for what have effectively been certified as \u2018authentic\u2019 products. It might be argued that raising prices would disadvantage poor consumers, but GIs in most cases are not usually staple items of basic needs and consumption; they are generally special products, with high value that are not much used by the poor. There are also indirect benefits. GIs are often linked with popular tourist regions \u2013 which widens economic opportunities for local people through micro-enterprises and could attract additional investment into the region to develop the place and the product, such as in Viet Nam\u2019s Phu Quoc island. As well as being valuable for protecting local products, GIs also provide a way of protecting local knowledge and natural endowments. The developing countries in Asia and Africa are home to 90 per cent of the biological resources that are a source of plant-based drugs. In 2004 the market value of pharmaceutical derivatives from indigenous people\u2019s traditional medicine was estimated at $60 billion.32 In recent years, some Western pharmaceutical companies have attempted to seize control of this knowledge through patents \u2013 as for example, with the natu- ral fungicide in the bark of the Indian neem tree. There are also examples of attempts by outsiders to tap the anti-diabetic properties of the banana plant in the Philippines. These have the potential to generate direct, equitable revenue-based benefits to the poor and the marginalized. The TRIPS Agreement and GIs The TRIPS agreement offers some protection for GIs. But it has its limitations. It forbids countries from registering a trademark that suggests the product originates in a place protected by a GI, but only if it does so in a way that misleads the public. Thus, if a sauce were described as a Phu Quoc \u2018kind\u2019, \u2018type\u2019, \u2018style\u2019 or even \u2018imitation\u2019, it would be allowed. This creates areas of ambiguity \u2013 since producers can free-ride on the reputation of a product without necessarily misleading the public, and there can also be uncertainty in deciding whether or not the public is misled. Moreover, the burden of proof lies with the GI holder. The only exceptions to this are products of particular value to the developed countries: wines and spirits. Thus, a company that wanted to market, say, a \u2018Beaujolais-type wine produced in Viet Nam\u2019 would not be prevented from doing so on the ground of misleading the public, but it would be caught by a further clause that offers stronger protection for wines and spirits against even this kind of encroachment.33 GI Regimes in Asia Asia has in practice had many GIs for hundreds of years, though only recently have countries considered protecting them through an intellec- tual property regime. Even today, most countries do not have a separate legal sui generis instru- ment. Instead, they provide some, though often inadequate, protection through two main channels: trademark laws or business practice laws such as those for unfair competition, con- sumer protection or food standards. Often, however, in response to a threat they have tried to produce more specific legislation \u2013 as in India, Thailand and China (Box 3.2). Nevertheless, Asians still have a long way to go when it comes to presenting their cases. In negotiations the Geneva-based delegations of Asian countries favour short-term tactical bargaining, rather than substantiating their positions with solid research and information.

In the late 1990s, India fought a well-publicized battle to rescind some US patents on Basmati rice, but it was not until 1999 that it belatedly passed the Geographical Indications of Goods (Protection and Registration) Act, which only came into effect on 15 September 2000. This defined GIs more specifically than TRIPS: in addition to agricultural goods bearing geographical names, it covers natural goods like coal and bauxite, as well as manufactured goods, like Kanchipuram sarees and Kohlapuri slippers. It stipulates that one of the activities of either production or of processing or preparation of the goods concerned should take place in the territory, region or locality. The Indian system is quite elaborate though the alternative of protecting GIs through the trademark system is said to be even more prohibitive and inadequate (Thual 2003). Either system could be daunting to individual and small-scale producers who want to protect their products. Thailand. Thailand too sprang into action only in self-defence, when a variant of its famous Jasmine rice was patented in the US as Jasmati. A sui generis Act on GIs was finally passed and came into force in April 2004. Known popularly as the \u2018Champagne Law\u2019, it has standard procedures for registration and penalties for misuse: a fine of up to $5,000. It also provides for cancelling GIs if, for example, they are contrary to peace and order, good public morals and national policy (Chuenjaipanich 2004). Thailand is using this system as part of its \u2018One Tambon, One Product\u2019 programme. Launched in 2003, this has selected 60 community products for upgrading and quality certification, with the aim of first expanding the domestic market and later exports. China. There are two distinct regimes of GI protection. The first, which has operated since China joined the Paris Convention in 1985, is through the China Trademark Office (CTMO), and the first regulations were introduced in 1993. As of November 2003, 100 GIs had been registered with 233 applications pending. The second regime is sui generis, through the Administration for Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ). In 1999, for example, in cooperation with the French Government, this recognized GIs for Shaoxing Yellow Wine. As of November 2003, 123 GI applications had been made to AQSIQ, of which 49 had been approved and 41 were under examination (Li et al. 2003).

Fisheries are 4 per cent of GDP, and Thailand exports more than three- quarters of its production. But fisheries can be even more significant for smaller developing countries such as Cambodia, where fish accounts for 4 per cent of GDP, and especially small island developing states, such as Fiji and the Maldives, where it contributes 9 per cent of GDP. Employment in Fisheries Fishing, both for home markets and for the export trade, employs many millions of people. Indeed, the Asia-Pacific region is home to 85 per cent of the world\u2019s fishers and 95 per cent of its fish farmers. Although marine capture is still the biggest employer, aquaculture is fast catching up in some of the major fish-producing countries. Marine capture fishing usually employs men, but aquaculture, fish processing and marketing employ large numbers of women. \u2022 Viet Nam.

There are over 250,000 fish- workers. Around one-third are employed as workers in large-scale fisheries, another one- third are owner-operators in large-scale and small-scale operations, and most of the rest are aquaculture farmers. In some respects fishers are in a stronger position than farmers because they sell a larger proportion of their production on a regular and consistent basis.39 In other respects, however, they can be more vulnerable, whether as a result of natural factors such as fluctuations in the fish catch, bad weather, and exposure to cyclones, or as a result of economic factors such as market price fluctuations and variable access to markets. This vulnerability was underscored by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which badly affected the livelihoods of fishers in Indonesia, India and Sri Lanka. Incomes in fisheries can also be more equit- ably distributed than in other sectors. In capture fisheries, for example, earnings are typically shared between the owners of the boats, equip- ments and the crew. Also, fishers working for the export market can earn more than those working for the domestic market. Export species fetch a higher price than non-export species, and those workers on board fishing vessels targeting export species receive a higher share of the catch than for non-export species. On the other hand, the input costs are generally higher for catching or rearing high-value species. Nevertheless, many fishing communities The region accounts for more than one- third of global exports of fish and fish products \u2013 7 million tons annually.

Most full- and part-time fishers in the artisanal and small-scale sectors are completely dependent on fisheries for their livelihood, and nearly 6 million of them, over 80 per cent of whom live in Asia, are believed to be earning less than $1 per day.40 Of a further estimated 17 million income-poor persons engaged in aquaculture and other related activi- ties (boat-building, net-making, marketing and processing), over 14 million are to be found in Asia. Globally, then, around 23 million income- poor people work in the fishery sector; of these, 19 million are from Asia. As a result, fishing communities can have lower levels of human development. In the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, for example, fishing communities have a literacy rate of 65 per cent compared with a state average of 74 per cent. Many live in poor housing conditions. Popula- tion growth is also more rapid here than else- where. Sustainability Many fishing communities already have low incomes, but their situation could get worse as stocks are exhausted.

But in fact, the reverse seems to be true. The emergence of cul- tured shrimp in many parts of the region has not only caused considerable environmental damage but also had knock-on effects in marine capture fisheries. This is partly because the volume of cultured shrimp on international markets has depressed prices for wild harvested shrimp \u2013 forcing many trawlers to switch over to high open-bottom trawls, which catch all species of fish. This, in turn, has undermined the liveli- hoods of other non-trawling fishers. In addition, the collection of shrimp fry from the wild gathers not only shrimp fry but other marine fish larvae \u2013 further reducing fish stocks. The Impact of Tariff Measures The Asian fishing sector also faces problems accessing markets in developed countries. At first glance, the barriers do not appear high. The EU, Japan and the US extend preferential tariff treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). For unprocessed fish, frozen fish, crustaceans and molluscs, most developed countries apply fairly low tariffs: Japan, which is the world\u2019s biggest market for fish and fish products, has a tariff of about 4 per cent. The US has a nominal tariff of just 1 per cent for fish imports. The EU, on the other hand, applies tariffs on primary shrimp products of 12 to 18 per cent and has an average tariff of 10 per cent. Tariffs are much higher, however, for processed fish and fish products. Japan, for example, applies a tariff rate on fresh/chilled/ frozen tuna of 3.5 per cent, but for processed tuna the rate is 9.6 per cent. The developed countries also typically apply quotas \u2013 with higher tariff rates for deliveries beyond the quota: the US, for example, applies a 6 per cent rate to processed Thai tuna within the quota but 12.5 per cent for deliveries beyond it. For the EU, tariff rates on processed tuna can reach 25 per cent. Even for unprocessed fish, there can be further hurdles. The EU discriminates against imports of fish and fish products from countries Many fishing communities already have low incomes, but their situation could get worse as stocks are exhausted CHAPTER 3: MAKING AGRICULTURAL TRADE WORK FOR THE POOR 69 that have not met with their obligations under multilateral environmental agreements. There can also be protests against the arrival of large volumes of particular products. Viet Nam, for example, between 1999 and 2002 increased its exports of frozen catfish fillets to the US from 5 million to 34 million pounds. The Catfish Farmers of America, a group representing catfish growers and processors, lodged a dumping complaint, and in 2003 the US International Trade Commission ruled that Viet Nam\u2019s exports had hurt the US catfish industry and imposed tariffs of 37 to 64 per cent. As a result, fishermen in Viet Nam suffered a sudden fall in prices and a sharp decline in income. In addition to tariff barriers, the developed countries can also restrict imports via non-tariff barriers. These include food safety standards, environmental measures such as ecolabelling and certification programmes, and requirements for compliance with multilateral environmental agreements. Food Safety Standards As a result of the globalization of the fish trade and the increasing demands for consumers for safe fish of high quality, developed countries now have much more systematic procedures assuring food safety, using a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system.41 Processors who export to the EU and the US markets in particular have to comply with tight import regulations or face rejections that they can ill afford (Box 3.3). These standards vary from one market to another: the US, for example, requires that levels of histamine in canned sardines, mackerel and anchovies should not exceed 50 parts per million (ppm), while the EU generally permits up to 150 ppm in canned fish. Technological advances in seafood analysis are now such that pesticide and pharmaceutical residues can be detected at the parts per billion (ppb) level, and in some cases at the parts per trillion (ppt) level. The EU, for example, uses a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method that can detect antibiotics such as chloramphenicol at 0.3 ppb and nitrofuran at 1 ppb levels.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "349b5f38-e9fe-489e-8af6-773229d2822c": {"__data__": {"id_": "349b5f38-e9fe-489e-8af6-773229d2822c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57613cb73739f666182e9b82995173f9ad829b279d827f16a0978d6a1201ce36"}, "2": {"node_id": "5288cbc9-4dda-4aa7-aec1-7778d6bc6849", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21e14636dc1466035e36804f8d27faeb4419d0e69c6e91048b90aa8145c00006"}}, "hash": "54162dca7293e1719215626eaf32e55cdabedca5955ec03824f3b9c02dc7ec1f", "text": "At this level of sensitivity, a \u2018safe\u2019 product can suddenly become \u2018unsafe\u2019.42 On a number of occasions, the EU has rejected Asian shrimp imports, having detecting traces of prohi- bited carcinogenic antibiotics like nitrofuran and chloramphenicol as well as other bacterial inhi- bitors such as aminoglycosides and macrolides.

In the case of the US, the individual exporter has to demon- strate an ability to produce seafood according to the US regulations. Meeting these regulations and complying with the International Organization for Standar- dization\u2019s requirements, especially ISO 9002 for fish processing plants, adds significantly to the costs for exporters \u2013 who have to pay for consul- tants, personnel, record keeping and training. At BOX 3.3 FOOD SAFETY STANDARDS AND SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES From a small-scale fisheries perspective, in addition to the cost aspects, one of the main problems in adopting a HACCP plan would be the difficulty in implementing it at the point where fish is caught, especially for beach landing fishing units like kattumarams and canoes in countries like India. According to EU and the US standards, fish has to be stored in ice or kept in frozen storage as soon as it is harvested. Storage of fish in iceboxes would be difficult on board traditional fishing craft like kattumarams, which are made of lashed logs. Yet many kattumarams using long lining and bottom set gillnets are engaged in catching fish for the export market. Strict implementation of HACCP plans would result in their forced exit from that market. The fish handling standards of many import markets require that fish is not exposed to beach sand. Because many of the fishing villages that harvest fish, shrimp and cephalopods for the export market have only the beach for landing their catch, it would be difficult for them to comply with a HACCP plan unless they invested in iceboxes and maintained them in a hygienic manner. Processors who export to the EU and US markets in particular have to comply with tight import regulations or face rejections that they can ill afford ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2006 70 2002 prices, an HPLC measuring system, for example, costs around $220,000 per unit. Even complying with HACCP is difficult for small- scale operations (Box 3.3). These rising certifi- cation costs are then reflected in falling profits \u2013 as reflected in the \u2018unit value realization\u2019: for shrimp, for example, this rose from $1 in 1961 to $9 in 2001, but by 2002 had fallen back to $7. The high standards required for export markets also have implications for domestic markets. Most exporting countries do not have national standards for food safety. India, for example, does not have a quality standard for seafood for its own domestic consumers. Under the WTO Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosani- tary Measures, however, members are required to establish equivalence in the regulations and regulatory processes between importing and exporting nations. For the developed importing nations, this does not represent a problem, since the requirements for importing are normally just an extension of their domestic standards. Many developing countries will, however, need to introduce new systems. Developing such systems is a national responsibility. But poorer countries should also be able to count on support from the developed countries. This commitment is embodied in Millennium Development Goal 8, which aims to develop global partnerships for development and especially to help build trade capacity towards greater market access, particularly for the LDCs. Ecolabelling In an effort to ensure that fish and fish products originate from sustainable fisheries, a number of countries are now encouraging, or requiring, systems of ecolabelling. Japan, for example, uses ecolabelling to control imports of tuna for the lucrative sashimi market. This aims to prevent imports that come from illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing vessels. The EU and the US are also in favour of ecolabelling and certifica- tion. As yet, however, there are no multilateral agreements on this issue, and it is not yet clear to what extent such labelling systems come under the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade. Developing countries are worried that even voluntary ecolabelling requirements would effectively exclude imports from artisanal and small-scale fisheries. They have a number of concerns: \u2022 Costs. Ecolabelling will add to the expenses for the fishing industry, with no guarantee that these increases will be offset by higher incomes for certified products. \u2022 Loss of autonomy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b44dd9be-ffe5-4b47-86aa-64539cb57859": {"__data__": {"id_": "b44dd9be-ffe5-4b47-86aa-64539cb57859", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "414b6d59812a38166968b6d96ba666db1a31618771786d9afe2cbc27bbfde491"}, "2": {"node_id": "1cd27969-9dd0-47e7-a529-61b46b579eb2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e12f98c30e78526d495f736d451a95615ef91731da39fa1aa6f7f1d7c7a96424"}}, "hash": "15be55da03e9f66c160ed58b6a52c6c76baeea65b54a3b4b8764a63735538962", "text": "\u2022 Loss of autonomy.

In fact, one of the main problems in Asian fisheries is the conflict between bottom trawlers and other small-scale, passive-gear groups who compete for the same space and resources. Cooperation across fisheries is hard to achieve. Even if ecolabelling systems could be app- lied, they might have perverse outcomes. If, for example, certified fish commanded higher prices, this could intensify catching of those fish \u2013 espe- cially in fisheries where it is difficult to impose limitations on fishing effort.43 On the other CHAPTER 3: MAKING AGRICULTURAL TRADE WORK FOR THE POOR 71 hand, things could work in the other direction: fishers unable or unwilling to comply with the requirements in a certified fishery might then be diverted to uncertified, or uncertifiable, fisheries where they could over-exploit fish stocks. In practice, given the poor state of fisheries management in many developing countries, ecolabelling is a long way off. Some fairly homo- genous fisheries, like the tuna industry in the Maldives, might be able to cope. But else-where, preparing an industry for certification will be more complex and expensive. The lobster fishers of Ceara, Brazil, for example, supported by a private foundation, applied for precertification. However, the pre-assessment showed that certi- fication was impossible in the short term since the fishery was in such a bad condition.44 The EU, Japan and the US are unlikely to require ecolabelling, but at some point they may insist on proof that the fishery at least has a management plan. Developing countries would, therefore, be well advised to start preparing standards for sustainable harvesting of fisheries, resources along with standards for food safety and better living conditions for workers. Multilateral Environmental Agreements and Fisheries A number of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) have implication for the trade in fish. The 1982 Law of the Sea Convention, for example, includes measures \u2018to protect and preserve rare and fragile ecosystems as well as the habitat of depleted, threatened or endangered species and other forms of marine life\u2019 (Article 194). Other MEAs that contain potential trade measures in fisheries and agriculture include: the 1972 Wetland Conven- tion called the Ramsar Convention; the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endan- gered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora; the 1980 Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources; the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity, and the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement.45 An example of a multila- teral environmental agreement hindering shrimp farmers is presented in Box 3.4. It is quite likely that in the future MEA obligations could play a major role in seafood exports. The fish trade is fast emerging as an area with potential conflicts between MEA obligations and trade rules. Fisheries Subsidies and the WTO However, an immediate development that could potentially affect market access of many deve- loping countries is the ongoing debate on fishe- ries subsidies. The Doha Round of WTO for the first time speaks of fisheries subsidies and their uses for \u2018achieving legitimate development goals\u2019. It also takes into account the demand from developing countries that certain subsidies be treated as \u2018non-actionable\u2019, including those on technology, research and development BOX 3.4 CITES, THE SHRIMP-TURTLE DISPUTE AND INDIAN FISHWORKERS The shrimp-turtle dispute at the WTO between the US and several Asian countries is the first case that involved an MEA. The 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) considers all species of sea turtles to be threatened with extinction and bans their international trade. Sea turtles also appear on the Red Data List of threatened species of the Interna-tional Union for the Conservation of Nature. The US will import shrimp only from countries having a marine turtle conservation programme comparable to that of the US. This means that shrimp fishing vessels are required to add a turtle excluder device (TED) to the belly of their trawls. In response, the Indian state of Orissa in 2001 made TEDs mandatory for all trawlers in Gahirmatha, Devi and Rushikuly and distributed 500 fully subsidized TEDs to trawler operators.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e45b207-2d4a-43ee-ae31-9482d0e05669": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e45b207-2d4a-43ee-ae31-9482d0e05669", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2006: Trade on Human Terms", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82a2c26bb8cb79d2e00d17835fbc60115a46d6476f775ca935a45429a51de440"}, "2": {"node_id": "d1789e6a-e7b1-489c-9885-9b11c23fb6d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2006-trade-human-terms", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ece0bfe5fbc271fd6b0c2ae3c971c0fae5d2f2ad062635436735f78c7c76e396"}}, "hash": "ea2f2d985d93d17d3fcc24f758ec82cc82f39dfa23e494c32cbf772c144e994e", "text": "However, the trawler operators are reluctant to use TEDs \u2013 arguing that 20 to 30 per cent of their catch would be lost through the escape hatch provided for turtles.
