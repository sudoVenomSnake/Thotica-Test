people, especially children and women, who are now confronted by one of the gravest financial, economic and social threats in our lifetime. 3.8. There is a clear need for policy prioritization. The ADB notes: \u201cTrying to do too much on the public policy front is like building two houses when there is only enough building materials for one\u2014in the end there will be no house no matter how noble the intention.\u201d159 Given the limited resources to formulate and then implement improved public policy as well as the diversities across the Pacific, our goal here is not to detail specifics for each country, but instead to highlight how crisis-response and recovery policies can be made more child- and women-focused. In Part 3, we advocate for and offer advice on: (1) real- time monitoring of the social impacts of the economic crisis; (2) the management of social sector budgets within a short-term response; and (3) social protection (safety net) mechanisms in the medium-term response to the current crisis, to aid recovery of any lost economic and social development, and to lessen the impact of future crises. Securing at least these three initiatives will be vital if the Pacific\u2019s response to the current crisis and subsequent economic downturns is to be effective in protecting the poor and especially the poorest. 156 ADB (2009) Taking the Helm.

We recognize that there are a variety of economic crisis transmission channels and other measures of vulnerability that could be considered (e.g., percentage of household budgets spent on food, the extent of a society\u2019s monetization, women\u2019s access to and reliance on microfinance, the proportion of national budgets spent on health, education and social welfare services, the quality of these services, the coverage of existing social protection schemes, levels of child abuse and exploitation, HIV prevalence, etc.). Table 6, however, provides a preliminary framework to identify countries where many children and women are likely to face the greatest challenges due to the crisis. To get a sense of the likely impact on women, we have added recent data on contraceptive prevalence rates, adolescent birth rates (both MDG 5\u2014improve maternal health indicators), and considered data on the share of women in wage Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises: Working Edition One for advocacy, debate and guidance 33 employment in the non-agricultural sector (presented in Table 8). We have also included national percentages in access to improved water and use of improved sanitation. As a crude measure of sub- national disparities, we have added rural versus urban differentials (R:U) in access to improved water and use of improved sanitation. Differentials under \u201c1\u201d suggest that rural areas have less access to improved water or less use of improved sanitation. A differential of around 1 indicates more-or-less equal access/use between rural and urban areas. Differentials over 1 suggest that urban areas have less access to improved water or less use of improved sanitation. 3.11. For children in particular we have judged the \u201cimpact\u201d in terms of both the number of children affected and the number of child poverty parameters affected. In terms of child poverty parameters, we take the multi-dimensional definition of child poverty as used in the January 2007 UN General Assembly statement on child poverty and as followed by UNICEF\u2019s ongoing Global Study on Child Poverty and Disparity.160 In other words, if the response is ineffective, the crisis is likely to worsen children\u2019s and especially poor children\u2019s access to: shelter (children living in a dwelling with five or more people per room or with no floor material); sanitation facilities (children with no access to a toilet facility of any kind); safe drinking water (children using surface water such as rivers, ponds, streams and dams, or who it takes 30 minutes or longer to collect water (walk to the water, collect it and return)); information (children above 2 years old with no access to a radio or television or telephone or newspaper or computer (i.e. all forms of media)); food (children who are more than three standard deviations below the international reference population for stunting (height for age) or wasting (height for weight) or underweight (weight for age)); education (children above 6 years old of schooling age who have never been to school or who are not currently attending school); and health (children who did not receive immunization or who did not receive treatment for a recent illness involving an acute respiratory infection or diarrhoea). 3.12. While it is important that all governments protect budgets for children and women, and that donors maintain their Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) commitments, ODA will be most effective if it is focused on countries which face the greatest vulnerability. Some children and women in all countries are likely to face difficulties and vulnerabilities will vary according to national contexts thus the actual order of countries in Table 6 should be viewed with caution. It is probable, however, that if the crisis response is ineffective in Solomon Islands and Kiribati\u2014both countries with minimal economic growth predictions, high economic crisis vulnerabilities, relatively large child populations, the highest under-five mortality rates and poverty indices, among the lowest contraceptive prevalence rates and highest adolescent birth rates, and among the lowest national percentages and highest rural:urban differentials in access to improved water and use of improved sanitation\u2014a large number of their children and women are likely to face extreme challenges.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3f6774d-e054-432e-b214-c5c774cf0f5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3f6774d-e054-432e-b214-c5c774cf0f5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting Pacific Island Children & Women during Economic and Food Crises", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a86031315d5b534e3145cf1217a36827a7df37c436cdd8aba1a514fcbccba378"}, "2": {"node_id": "a5ab0605-ec7b-4df2-bf0a-eb737dbdf587", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1bb258056dd52be599ddb76dd01c92b52ca6e3c9cdfa247bbb9b21b7f33e4819"}}, "hash": "6b60dfddb2a353b95739ad1de2489c5d3af971d5cd6da4d23a3a04f8f1f19ef9", "text": "Many children and women in the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji Islands, the Republic of Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Tonga, and Samoa are also likely to face substantial challenges should responses be ineffectual.

If the response is ineffective, some children and women in Nauru will be at further risk. The same could be said for children and women in Palau and Cook Islands though there are minor differences in some of their indicators. Both Niue and Tokelau, with very small populations of children, are reasonably buffered through their current relationship with New Zealand, and there is insufficient secondary data from Tokelau to derive a definitive prediction; impacts on some children and women in these two countries, however, cannot be discounted if the crisis response is unsuccessful. 3.13. Invest in real-time or just-in-time monitoring. Devoting resources and energies to new real-time data collection during a crisis may seem to be a low priority, especially given the link between data collection and policy-making is often tenuous even in good times.161 Nevertheless, the impact of the crisis is still unfolding and existing monitoring (e.g., financial and MDG-monitoring) is generally backward looking and suffers long lags between data collection and policy uptake (e.g. Census, Household Income and Expenditure Surveys, Demographic Health Surveys, etc.). Many Pacific Island countries have education management information systems (EMIS) in the Ministry of Education and health information systems (HIS) within the Ministry of Health, but these systems are generally not designed for monitoring unexpected changes in education or health indicators during times of crisis. A growing number of Pacific Island countries are also conducting household surveys, but besides being retrospective and suffering long lags, these surveys tend to be episodic and complex. So far, the information and evidence available 160 UNICEF (2007) Global Study on Child Poverty and Disparities 2007-2008. GUIDE. Global Policy Section, Division of Policy and Planning.

One could say that existing poverty and social sector information and monitoring systems are proving somewhat unfit to serve the needs of policy-makers in responding to the crisis.162 Furthermore, this type of data is proving difficult to compile and analyze. Improving capacity for better informed policy-making is not a step that is usually pursued with vigour in emergency situations, but a sound foundation for policy-making is more important than ever when resources are scarcer. It is essential that economic crisis contingency planning, crisis response packages, short- and medium-term policy development and rigorous post-crisis policy evaluation be based on real-time data. Data not only must be solid, but also must be timely and readily fed back to policy-makers and stakeholders alike. Effective and consistent monitoring will also enhance understanding and reduce uncertainty as to how and when to act (early warning). Disaggregated and real-time data from the local level will be particularly important to determine sub-national disparities such as gender inequalities and urban-rural divides. Real-time tracking is especially important given that the poverty impacts may be worse than previous crises because of the global nature of the current crisis (e.g., export-led poverty reduction will be difficult); because the current crisis follows household shocks in food and fuel prices (with major poverty impacts already); and because aid and public expenditures are under threat (with major poverty implications). For Pacific Island countries contemplating expansion or initiation of social protection programs (see 3.41-3.91), regular collection of household data will be important to develop targeting measures, track the effectiveness of social protection, and measure their impacts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fcbd61f6-ab4f-46bd-a247-16e764f4e825": {"__data__": {"id_": "fcbd61f6-ab4f-46bd-a247-16e764f4e825", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting Pacific Island Children & Women during Economic and Food Crises", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f4e31bcc4a07586c44c9094152c9447643e91886da420fed46597e50b2b651f3"}, "2": {"node_id": "5ce37ddd-6d39-463a-b43c-a2d486e15546", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9c511f61ceff6e16e1bc07496f9f572cc938712cef78a7c325ca6c476581235"}}, "hash": "4238f02d6914467e811c0c55ec793cfa9e386a2cbb142a6fa4e81778723be4ab", "text": "Ravillion (2008) notes: \u201cAn important part of crisis preparedness is having made the investments in data and evaluative research (both quantitative and qualitative) that are needed to have a reasonable idea of which public programs will need to be protected; naturally that investment brings benefits for policy making at normal times.\u201d163 A new, more robust social impact monitoring framework is required but before we discuss a framework for real-time monitoring and policy action, we present some general considerations (Box 6).164,165,166,167,168,169 3.14.

National action plans and budget symposia, including social partners to design government anti-crisis measures, are strongly advised. \u2022 If not already implemented, governments should urgently task an existing multi-sector committee such as the National Millennium Development Goal Task Force or National Committee for Children and/or Women (usually inter-Ministerial) to take on a clear advisory role in relation to crisis-response budgeting, ODA allocation and policy. This \u201ccrisis response\u201d committee should consider real-time information, rapidly explore strategic options and discuss (when needed) the technical feasibility and political economy of potential practical measures. The committee should also address the reorientation of activities and the reallocation of resources as much as possible, to ensure that core activities are protected and pro-child, pro-women, pro-poor measures are increased or extended. Management of the crisis-response role of this committee should be tight and technical while governance of resources associated with the committee should be open and strategic. \u2022 The committee may itself serve as or be served by a highly qualified crisis monitoring team or task force. Such a monitoring team should have a clear and simple mission statement and multi-year mandate (commence monitoring from 2009 until at least 2012). It is also recommended that the monitoring team include representation from inter alia Ministers of Finance, Planning, Health, Education, and Women and Social Welfare/Justice, as well as NGOs, and UN agencies on the ground. The monitoring team\u2019s mission should be to collate and analyse social impact information in the form of periodic (e.g., quarterly) high-level reports and where necessary be supported by \u2018champion\u2019 partners such as Non-Government organizations capable of delivering nationwide know-how, data and interpretation. An electronic database of relevant monitoring indicators and a Virtual Resource Centre (where all reports and studies will be made available for all counterparts and public) should be established with different access privileges granted to different users. \u2022 Additional expertise that can be found in partner organisations on specific monitoring methodologies and policy should be mobilized as appropriate. There will be a need to clarity of roles in data collection and analysis, and ensure horizontal (across sectors and Ministries) and vertical (through levels of government and society) coordination. \u2022 Keep stakeholders informed. Based on monitoring data, Governments should develop arguments to support advocacy efforts with other countries and donors while national government departments, should draw up well delineated \u201canti-crisis\u201d packages. \u2022 Social sector ministries in particular, should improve direct lines of dialogue inside the government, however good they may already be, and maintain especially close links with the Ministry of Finance. They should advocate for protecting social sector budgets and for the inclusion of social sector investments, especially cost-reducing investments, in economic recovery plans. 3.16. Sentinel sites. Production of quarterly monitoring data will rely on setting up at least 2-3 sentinel monitoring sites in the most vulnerable areas of each country covered by the initiative including both urban and rural settings. Each sentinel site is defined as \u201ca vulnerable area where services such as health centres, schools, pharmacies, other social services, and communities will be monitored.\u201d Vulnerable areas in countries will be defined locally but may be determined, for example, by comparative concentrations of some of those already considered to be facing hardship across most Pacific Island countries (see Box 1): (i) the young; (ii) the old; (iii) people living with disabilities; (iv) those who had no source of regular income; (v) those with no access to adequate land on which to grow food for consumption and/or sale; (vi) households headed by women and the elderly; (vii) the urban poor who rely on purchasing their food; (viii) small-holder farmers; (ix) front-line workers if their salaries are either reduced or not adjusted to keep up with higher commodity prices; (x) non-citizens and ethnic minorities; and (xi) populations displaced due to environmental degradation or disasters; and (xii) low-skilled workers and immigrants. 3.17.

Roll-out and maintenance. This proposed social impact monitoring system should be established immediately and maintained until at least the end of 2011 given lag times between global and local economies. UN agencies can provide technical and operational support for Pacific Island governments to roll out and maintain such a monitoring system. It is recommended that each Pacific Island government coordinate the process of data generation and use at the national level (e.g., retrieval or/and collation of administrative data and policy formulation) as well as steer the process of data collection at the community level. 3.19. Mobilizing society. In several Pacific Island countries there are networks of volunteers and committees in many of the poorest communities that could be mobilized to provide community vigilance to observe children, women and families at risk, recognize signs of potential risk to children and women, and report to local government services if they are in a position to respond appropriately. Where such networks do not exist, they should be put in place if possible or alternative child- and women-focused groupings\u2014scouts, guides, youth clubs, faith-based organizations, sports clubs\u2014could be considered for an enhanced role in protecting children and women. Routine visits by health workers, teachers, youth workers, social workers, police, and mother and baby clinics and post-natal visits (in both cases, staff can also check on other children in the family) could be used to monitor families at risk. Where resources and capacities allow, crisis hotlines or other novel reporting mechanisms (e.g., SMS, email) could be established if considered useful.174 3.20. Monitoring social expenditures (inclusive of health, education, and welfare) will be vital. In every past episode of financial and economic crisis, when Governments have limited fiscal space, they tend to cut down on the least politically resistant\u2014social spending. Close monitoring of fiscal expenditure is vital to avoid this tendency. A simple measure would be to benchmark the overall annual budget\u2019s strategic intent as regards social expenditure\u2014to \u201cincrease\u201d, \u201cmaintain\u201d or \u201creduce social spending\u201d. More demanding measures to track social expenditure include comparing fiscal budget years for sectors and/or data on total national disbursements and planned and actual expenditures by type of transfer. Even more demanding measures will be to monitor social safety net programs (where these exist) through examining records of numbers of beneficiaries and disbursements by type at some sub-national levels. National Health Accounts (NHAs) represent an excellent tool for financial tracking in the health sector. For example, NHAs are already producing monthly account data in Samoa and Tonga, and are being institutionalized over the next year or so in Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji Islands, and Vanuatu. Public expenditure tracking surveys, public expenditure reviews, and specialized population surveys (Household Income Expenditure Surveys, Demographic Health Surveys, etc.) used to assess social expenditures are underway in several Pacific Island countries but are only periodic and somewhat resource intensive.175 Again, UN agencies and other development partners are likely to be in a position to provide technical and operational support for governments to track social expenditures. 3.21. Towards a Pacific Hardship Alert System. From the past, we know that the better our ability to track and understand the shifts in poverty at a micro-level, the better we are able to respond. But tracking poverty alone is not enough. For each poverty indicator we can propose a corresponding vulnerability indicator.

Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises: Working Edition One for advocacy, debate and guidance 37 difference for children and women. Just as there have been calls for an early warning system for the economy at the International Monetary Fund, the Pacific Hardship Alert System could provide real-time social impact information along the lines proposed in 3.14-3.18. Such an early-warning system does not exist right now. As a result, governments and development partners in the Pacific and around the world are making decisions based on a fragmented, patchwork of information. The joint UN initiative outlined above will be thoroughly tested and refined over the next two years, and if governments and other partners continue to be supportive, could evolve into the Pacific Poverty Alert System. The objective of a Pacific Hardship Alert System could be to provide early indications of how an external shock, like the current economic crisis, is affecting the economic, social and political welfare of the most marginalized populations and countries within the Pacific. By analyzing both exposure and resilience of Pacific Island populations to the changing environment, the Pacific Hardship Alert System might also have the capability to signal emerging vulnerabilities. Such as system would also help to galvanize both national policy-makers and communities to ensure the poorest and most vulnerable were protected in a time of crisis. Once operational, such a Pacific Hardship Alert System could produce regular Pacific Hardship Alert products (e.g., Pacific Social Impact Monitor Reports similar to the Pacific Economic Monitor Reports released by the ADB).176 To maintain such a system within the Pacific will require resources and collaboration between organizations with complementary fields of expertise but start-up resources have already been mobilized and collaboration has already commenced. 3.22. A Community-Based Monitoring System. The Joint UN initiative to support real-time social impact monitoring is exchanging ideas with the Poverty and Economic Policy (PEP) Research Network. Supported by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC)-Canada and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the PEP Research Network has developed the Community- Based Monitoring System (CBMS).177 Since the early 1990s, the CBMS has provided policy-makers in several countries with information to track the impacts of various economic reforms and policy shocks on vulnerable groups. It uses freeware customized for CBMS-data encoding, processing and poverty mapping designed as an organized process of data collection, processing, validation, and integration of data in local development processes. CBMS generates a core set of indicators (that can accommodate other measures) to capture the multidimensional aspects of poverty to determine the welfare status of the population. To date, CBMS has been used in 12 countries including Bangladesh, Benin, Cambodia, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Lao PDR, Pakistan, Philippines, Tanzania, Viet Nam and Zambia with related initiatives in Burkina Faso, Nepal, Senegal, and Sri Lanka. Its principle applications include improving local planning and budgeting, designing poverty reduction and related development programs, focused targeting, localizing the MDGs, program-impact assessment, and economic crisis early warning. Some Pacific Island countries may wish to explore the application of CBMS.178 Protect social budgeting for children 3.23. Social sector budgeting. National economic slowdown will likely deepen the degree of deprivation of the existing poor as well as the large numbers of Pacific Islanders clustered just above their national poverty lines who are particularly vulnerable to economic volatility and temporary slowdowns. Social budgeting could be defined as the process by which society\u2019s goals and priorities as well as the rights of all of the population are better reflected throughout the budgeting process. When countries are hit by different shocks, including climatic, it is very common for governments to reduce spending on social services. However, this can establish poverty for future generations, is a lost investment in human capital and possible future growth, and can derail efforts to achieve the MDGs, particularly if spending on child priorities is reduced. International organizations, donors, and national governments need to work together to ensure that recommendations for dealing with the economic crisis do not include, or result in, reduced spending on child priorities (such as basic healthcare, nutrition, social protection, clean water, and education). Faced by fiscal constraints and the chances of significantly increased bilateral aid flows unlikely, many Pacific Island countries will need to rationalize spending and increase their efficiency to create fiscal space for protection of social and MDG-related spending. As we highlighted in Part 2, although households could adopt some coping mechanisms in the short-run, some of their actions may have negative long-term consequences, especially on", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b91058c-4886-4c85-a661-faa2668c9ac5": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b91058c-4886-4c85-a661-faa2668c9ac5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting Pacific Island Children & Women during Economic and Food Crises", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e96ee9e061f25f6f06ac89407293762c4a1ea980ac8f18808e4195d214f2750b"}, "3": {"node_id": "3dffa9e2-2490-466c-a651-e2ed0ad92b1c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "258dc5fd76d7e7e8afac3f39b974dd50c5d27fbae1f07d64da7b19b79f5181c4"}}, "hash": "351b63b0abc822f0da8264b91da6704890d4fc000ecc6827e2be11d45a8d6646", "text": "women and children, such as reducing the number of meals, eating less nutritiously, selling assets, or taking children out of school.

The challenge is to support constructive coping mechanisms and seek to discourage unconstructive ones.179 3.24. Governments have at least three options as regards social budgeting during the current crisis: \u201cincrease\u201d, \u201cmaintain\u201d or \u201creduce social expenditure\u201d. In some Pacific Island countries a combination of these options may be possible\u2014advancing investments in children in some policy areas, maintaining existing budget in others, and trimming expenditure in yet others. Some Pacific Island countries may believe they have no choice but to reduce social expenditure. Donors will play a critical role whichever option or set of options is pursued (see 3.89-3.90). In every policy deliberation, it must be remembered that the central lesson learned from every previous economic crisis is that the poorest people in developing countries suffer the most and that not enough is done to help them. The response to this present crisis in the Pacific must be different. We must do more to help poor people, especially children and women, so that they can emerge from this crisis with their health, their education, their livelihoods, and their assets. It is worth repeating that only by putting in place measures that raise the levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of public services, will governments be able to pursue policies that protect children and women. Most Pacific economies can locate expenditures or revenue leakages in their budget that can be cut back and allocated to better uses or where better returns on investments can be made. Option A: Increase investments in children 3.25. A bold, innovative move. There is widespread agreement that counter-cyclical public spending in areas such as health, education and social security, as well as transfers to poorer households provides a means of reviving economies and lifting consumption spending. The challenge is to ensure that spending is genuinely pro-poor and that, where possible, it has a positive impact on children and women. Infrastructure investments provide one route, but other opportunities for safeguarding lives and income can also be identified (Box 7). This crisis presents an opportunity for Pacific Island countries to address long- standing barriers to progress for children. Box 7: Effective government responses in previous economic crises 180,181,182 Despite the financial crisis in Ecuador which began in 1999, improved social budgeting resulted in social spending increasing by almost 14% by 2006. As a result, 1.3 million families had their income protected and new healthcare funds were made available. In response to the Indonesian financial crisis of 1998, the government put in place scholarships for poor schoolchildren. Evaluations have shown that service use fell less among recipient households than they would have without the program. In Ghana, primary school enrollments rose by 14% after user fees were abolished in 2005 as part of a broader program to dampen the economic effects of fuel price reform. Many of the current crisis stimulus packages, not only aim to protect spending in social sectors, especially on education and health, but also take steps to increase these. China, for example, introduced a $123 billion package in January 2009 to improve its health care system. All packages have strong measures to bolster social safety nets and provide income support to low-income households. 3.26. Ministries of Finance need strong arguments that demonstrate the economic benefits from investment in children.

Similarly, investment in quality early childhood development programs can generate high returns to individuals and families and considerable cost savings for governments and society, for example in reduced costs of welfare and crime.194 In the USA, analysis of four early childhood and pre-school programs indicates benefit-cost ratios ranging from a minimum of 3.8 to 1 to a high of 17 to one.195 A study by UNICEF and its partners found that about 219 million children in the world under the age of 5 fail to reach their full potential in cognitive development due to poverty, poor health and nutrition and deficient care. This human development gap implies an economic development gap: had these children developed to their full potential as adults, their average incomes would be about 20% higher.196 3.28. Further evidence is provided by Baldacci et al (2008) who examined the links between social spending, human capital and growth using panel data on 118 developing countries during the period 1971-2000, and found evidence that increased social spending could help achieve the MDGs and at the same time boost countries\u2019 long-run growth and reduce poverty.197 If education spending is increased by 1% (as a share of GDP) a country\u2019s net enrollment rate could increase from 90% to 99%, and child mortality rate could diminish from 76 to 65 per thousand from 2000 to 2015. Furthermore, per capita growth could also increase by about 0.5 percentage points per year on average during this period, and the initial poverty headcount could decrease by about 17% over the entire 15-year period.198 3.29. This combination of relatively low financial costs and high returns\u2014in terms of human lives as well as economic productivity\u2014makes a strong case for paying particular attention to children in economic policy and fiscal budgets in times of economic hardship, as well as in times of growth. Pacific Island countries should consider investments listed in Table 7. It is essential also to focus on other major irreversabilities: if children are subject to neglect or violence and/or pushed into work, they live with the consequences for their whole life, sometimes passing the consequences onto their own children.199 Promoting a protective environment for children through improved legislation, strengthened social welfare services and justice systems, and societal behaviour change is fundamental.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "962c10a4-2502-4d7c-91e0-d842e4fea644": {"__data__": {"id_": "962c10a4-2502-4d7c-91e0-d842e4fea644", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting Pacific Island Children & Women during Economic and Food Crises", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b987ca1f3999171aeab37ab7a7ad097a815a3e1792b8c7d729414f5283608a68"}, "2": {"node_id": "398c6a54-57cd-40af-bcf6-9aac6692216c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a9d962fa93c4d673b4b90abaee70f83959985f5bcde4dae2c2a212469ddb785b"}}, "hash": "7eafc63f163800795a2534a2bac2be888ce25b8f34e3fd93badf70c3827aeb07", "text": "Many Pacific Island countries have policies and mechanisms that are delivering some if not most of these programs and interventions and some have been able to show signs of progress.200 The question now is whether these programs and interventions can be expanded or reinforced to cope with the effects of recession in varying contexts and with scarce resources. Pacific Island countries should also consider additional responses in the form of social protection schemes (social safety nets) focused on the most vulnerable as appropriate to ensure the protection of children and other highly affected groups in society.

Government expenditures per capita in real terms may still decline substantially due to overall declines in GDP and/or overall declines in total government expenditure.205 Within this option, the focus should be to help finance a specific set of services for the poorest and vulnerable people, protect expenditures on a per capita basis and in real terms, and where possible, fund existing, well-targeted and sustainable social safety nets (see 3.74-3.75).

As in any period of tight fiscal constraints, rationing decisions may be unavoidable. Inadequately analyzed reductions in public spending on social infrastructure and services are likely to hurt poor households and children most.

In countries that have had trouble attracting enough qualified teachers, worsening labour market conditions will make teaching more attractive as a profession to higher- quality candidates. If education systems can focus on creating the conditions that will induce these new entrants to remain in the profession even after the crisis, the long-term quality of the system should improve. In countries where teaching already attracts enough qualified applicants but performance is an issue, the focus should be on aligning teacher incentives with education goals. In a weak labour market teachers may be more willing to accept pay structures that base a part of their compensation or progression on performance. \u2022 Reduce expenditure leakages in health and education systems through better oversight of budget and procurement processes and through the implementation of sanctions against the misuse of public resources. In a time of diminished fiscal resources, there is likely to be stronger political support for more responsible management within government. In Thailand, for instance, the Ministry of Public Health launched the \u201cGood Health at Low Cost\u201d strategy in the post-crisis period. This involved drug management reform (procuring a higher proportion of essential drugs, and support for greater use of generic drugs as currency devaluation increased the relative price of the more expensive patented formulations), and savings from a reduction of operating/capital costs and material costs. As part of the reformulation of the health budget, capital costs were reduced from 38.7% of the total budget in 1997 down to 11.5% in 2000. At the same time, budgets were protected for essential services and programs such as HIV and AIDS. Box 8 continued next page 203 Mendoza, R.

Geneva: World Health Organization. Focus on girls and women 3.33. Women have been negatively affected by past financial crises and neo-liberal policy responses, such as Structural Adjustment Programs. Restricting women\u2019s access to work, education and health services, especially in times of crisis, comes at significant economic costs. The Asia-Pacific region is already losing US$42\u201347 billion a year because of restrictions on women\u2019s access to employment opportunities\u2014and another US$16\u201330 billion a year because of gender gaps in education. Those are just the economic costs\u2014added to them are social and personal costs.207 Most Pacific Island countries have achieved gender parity or close to gender parity at the primary school level (Table 8). Cook Islands at 0.88, Papua New Guinea at 0.80, Republic of Marshall Islands at 0.91, Palau at 0.92, Samoa at 0.93, Solomon Islands at 0.89, Timor-Leste at 0.92, Tonga at 0.90, and Tuvalu at 0.88 are more below gender parity than others. Papua New Guinea at 0.67, Niue at 0.87 and Solomon Islands at 0.77 are noticeably below gender parity at the secondary school level. Among the greatest gender challenges in the Pacific are the low percentage of women in wage employment in the non-agricultural sector and the low representation of women in decision-making, especially at political level. Latest available data suggest Pacific Island women share only 37.4% of wage employment in the non-agricultural sector, a regional figure which has changed little from the 1990 MDG baseline of 31.1%.208,209 We noted earlier that the main casualty of the current economic downturn so far is the \u201cflexible\u201d labour force\u2014low-skill, temporary, casual workers\u2014in which women constitute the majority of the workers. Only 5% of seats are held by women in national parliament. The crisis calls for creative solutions to address gender gaps. Similar to our observation about investing in real-time social impact monitoring, strengthening gender-based policy- making is not a step vigorously pursued in emergency situations, but sound gender-based policies are more important than ever when resources are scarcer. 207 UNESCAP (2007) Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 2007.

Macro-economic policy calibration and analysis assumes that policies are gender-neutral but they are usually gender-blind.210 The current crisis is an opportunity to drive new ways of thinking on economic and social policies as Pacific Island countries search for new economic growth drivers. Studies have shown that women tend to: spend more than men on building the capabilities of family; have greater intergenerational altruism than men; and are more risk averse, making investments on stable assets.211 The returns from educating women are higher than those for men, going beyond personal gains to inter-generational benefits. It is well known that literate women invest more in children\u2019s health and education. It is simply smart economics to invest in women\u2019s income earning power in times of crisis. Policy responses which build on women\u2019s roles as economic agents and their preference for investing resources in child well-being can go a long way towards mitigating the negative effects of the current and future economic crises. These responses are good for women and for development\u2014 they yield high returns in terms of containing current and future poverty\u2014and should be enacted quickly.212 3.35. A lot could be achieved with fairly low-cost, high-return interventions\u2014but it requires the vision and commitment at the highest political level. Some of these interventions include making secure access for girls to schools, providing separate toilets and wash areas for girls, and allowing more women to enter the teaching profession. Providing free lunch at school for children and special nutritional packages for pregnant women will go a long way in improving their health. Mobile clinics in remote areas and community-based emergency transport could drastically reduce maternal and infant deaths.213 Educating girls yields some of the highest returns of all development investments. The Copenhagen Consensus ranked girls education as the eighth best and placed providing support for women\u2019s reproductive role and microfinance to poor women borrowers amongst the top 30 most economical development investments.214 Micro-credit schemes are a lifeline for women and need special protection. Pacific Island countries, for example, could make sure that (i) state owned banks provide 210 Rao, M.G. (2004) Macroeconomic Policies and Gender Budgeting.

Work sites close to home, on-site child care, maternity leave allowances, and equal rates for men and women are some of the gender design features that can be considered in public works initiatives. Furthering poverty alleviation through the construction and repairs of farm-to-market roads, post-harvest facilities, irrigation systems, portable water systems and other farm projects, will provide long-term advantages to a large percentage of women in agriculture, in particular those in vulnerable employment. It will also serve to provide opportunities for those migrants returning to rural areas and working as subsistence farmers.217 Agriculture is one of the main livelihoods of women in the Pacific. While the agriculture sector received considerable attention in 2008 amidst rising food prices, faced with the global financial crisis and reduced inflationary pressures, policy attention has been shifted to other issues. At a national level, the long-term neglect of the rural economy warrants correction. Efforts to raise rural productivity can help keep poverty reduction on-track by keeping food prices low while supporting rural incomes. Empowering farmer organizations, diversifying the rural economy, and improving economic infrastructure in rural areas should receive attention. In order to reduce the likelihood that commodity price crises will occur in the future, it is important to promote energy efficiency and investment in renewable sources of energy. Securing energy supplies and speeding up the transition to a low-carbon energy system needs decisive action by governments at the national and local levels to encourage households and businesses to economize their use of fuel and energy suppliers to invest in developing and commercializing low-carbon technologies. Appropriate gender-sensitive financial incentives and regulatory frameworks are needed to support both agricultural development and renewable energy goals. 3.37. Engender labour and trade policies. It is important to recognize the labour market disadvantage that women face and to consider explicit employment growth targets for women.218 To reduce any discrimination against women in recruitment, wages and promotions, Governments should take the lead with the public sector acting as a role model. Initiatives directed towards education and healthcare (discussed in 3.26-3.32) would also inject financial and human capital into fields with high female employment, and ultimately provide much-needed services for children, the elderly and the sick. There remains a huge untapped labour potential of women and efforts must be made to provide every woman with the opportunity of decent employment.219 Strengthening employment placement services for women and investing in training women for non-traditional occupations, such as \u201cgreen jobs\u201d, are other supportive measures. Implementing time- and cost-efficient methods to identify current and future skills demands becomes crucial. It is also important to look at the effect of trade liberalization through the prism of gender, focusing on its effects on overall growth, labour markets, and access to credit.220 3.38. There are also legal frameworks that should be considered during this critical period. This is an appropriate time to increase the ratification and improve the application of international instruments regarding gender discrimination. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), adopted in 1979 by the UN General Assembly, has been ratified or acceded to by 16 Pacific Island countries (including Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste). Nauru, Tonga and Palau have yet to ratify CEDAW. States that have accepted CEDAW are committed to an agenda for national action, including to: incorporate the principle of equality of men and women in their legal system, and abolish all discriminatory laws and adopt new laws that prohibit discrimination against women; establish tribunals and other public institutions to ensure the effective protection of women against 215 Sirimanne, S.

In addition, there are four key ILO gender equality Conventions that deserve strong attention.221 3.39. Place more emphasis on gender budgeting. In the Pacific some progress has been made in introducing gender budgeting into formal budget processes. The gains made on this front need to be protected during the current crisis. It is especially important to make sure that fiscal stimulus measures are additional and do not divert funds already set aside for gender budgeting initiatives. Public finance management systems and practices need to support principles of participatory and gender-responsive budgeting. Strong and effective public expenditure monitoring systems are needed to ensure that budgetary allocations do reach the intended groups. Uganda, one of the first developing countries to successfully implement a public expenditure tracking system, saw a dramatic rise in allocated funding to education actually reaching schools\u2014from 13% before setting up the tracking system to 80-90% after.222 3.40. Place more emphasis on information and analysis. We noted earlier that empirical evidence on the impacts of financial crises on women is limited. Likewise, little is known about the gender dimensions of macro-economic policies, borrowing and tax policies, and expenditures that benefit women. Ritualistic preparation of gender budgets will not suffice. Much more information needs to be gathered and analysis work needs to be done. Better metrics are needed to quantify the \u201cgirl and women effect\u201d on development. New indicators must be developed to measure the impact of gender inequality on economic growth. The economic value of women\u2019s unpaid work needs to be measured and performance indicators need to be developed to measure progress in introducing and implementing gender-responsive approaches to public finances.223 Budget for social protection 3.41. This document concludes by highlighting a relatively new public policy option for Pacific Island countries\u2014social protection. Broadly defined, \u201csocial protection\u201d is a set of policy initiatives that transfer income or assets to the poor, protecting vulnerable people against livelihood shocks, and seeking to enhance the social status and rights of the marginalized.224 Social protection typically includes measures such as conditional or unconditional cash transfers, direct distribution of food or nutritional supplements, school-based feeding programs, childcare support, maternal/paternal benefit payments, disability allowance, education bursaries, fee waivers, pensions, unemployment benefits, price subsidies, agricultural inputs, public works programs, health insurance, asset insurance, life insurance, and microfinance. Social protection policies address not only chronic poverty and the adverse effects of different shocks, notably to household income, but also social vulnerability, thus taking into account the intergenerational transmission of poverty. 3.42. Our discussion on social protection is not intended to be comprehensive. Instead, our aim is to contribute to the growing interest in this development policy area across the Pacific which, at this time of economic crisis, must be a priority consideration\u2014the more severe the downturn, the greater the consideration. It is crucial to note that social protection policies have emerged as core elements of long- term poverty reduction strategies, rather than ad hoc crisis-driven initiatives. In this final section, we offer some answers to a series of questions, including: What is social protection? Why should it be considered? What are some of the key lessons learned about social protection around the world? What are some of the characteristics of existing social protection programs in the Pacific? Where formal social protection is weak or does not exist, how could it be initiated? How can social protection be made more child-centred? How can social protection systems be financed? How can social protection become a major new contributor to crisis mitigation and broader economic development across the Pacific? And what role can development partners play in supporting social protection? 221 The four key ILO gender equality Conventions are the Equal Remuneration Convention (No. 100), Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention (No. 111), Workers with Family Responsibilities Convention (No. 156) and Maternity Protection Convention (No. 183). Conventions 100 and 111 are also among the eight fundamental Conventions of the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. 222 UN Economic Commission for Africa (2003) Economic Report on Africa 2003.

Differing definitions of social protection. A range of organizations from the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) to the Asian Development Bank have offered definitions of social protection (Box 9). Box 9: Social protection defined \u2022 Provide income (cash) or consumption (food) transfers to the poor; protect the vulnerable against livelihood risks; enhance the social status and rights of the socially excluded and marginalised. (IDS) \u2022 Public actions taken in response to levels of vulnerability, risk and deprivation which are deemed socially unacceptable within a given polity or society. (Overseas Development Institute) \u2022 Collection of measures to improve or protect human capital, ranging from labour market interventions, publicly mandated unemployment or old-age insurance to targeted income support. Social protection interventions assist individuals, households and communities to better manage the income risks that leave people vulnerable. (World Bank) \u2022 Provision of benefits to households and individuals through public or collective arrangements to protect against low or declining living standards. (International Labour Organization) \u2022 A set of transfers and services that help individuals and households confront risk and adversity (including emergencies), ensure a minimum standard of dignity and well-being throughout the lifecycle, and that especially aim to protect the rights of the most at-risk, vulnerable or chronically poor. (UNICEF) \u2022 A set of policies and programs designed to reduce poverty and vulnerability by promoting efficient labour markets, diminishing people\u2019s exposure to risks, and enhancing their capacity to protect themselves against hazards and interruption or loss of income. Policies and programs include\u2014labour market policies and programs to promote \u201cdecent work\u201d; social insurance programs to cushion against the risks of unemployment, ill health, disability, and others; social assistance and welfare service programs targeted at the vulnerable groups (including targeted cash transfers); programs that deal with natural disasters; and child protection programs (ADB) 3.44. Long considered a privilege of developed countries, it is now generally agreed that social protection is an essential element of pro-poor growth. Definitions of social protection, however, vary not only amongst development agencies, but also across countries in the Asia and Pacific region.225 In some societies, social protection is seen as an entitlement based on citizenship rights as enshrined by Article 22 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: \u201cEveryone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization, through national effort and international cooperation and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality\u201d. In others, social protection is seen as a response to the needs of the \u2018deserving\u2019 poor. \u201cSocial security\u201d is also commonly used but in most cases refers to government guaranteed benefits including sickness and invalidity benefits, maternity allowances, children\u2019s or family allowances, disability allowances, unemployment benefits, retirement and survivors\u2019 pensions, and death benefits.226 The expression \u201csocial safety net\u201d is also used. A social safety net has been defined as policies and programs that provide short-term income support and access to basic social services to the poor during economic crises and possibly other adverse events.227 But others use \u201csocial safety net\u201d interchangeably with \u201csocial protection\u201d, focusing on the value of social interventions for crisis response and within longer-term poverty reduction strategies.228 Others view social protection according to the roles such policies and programs can play\u2014Protection, Prevention, Promotion and Transformation (Table 9). While the definitions may differ, at its most basic level, social protection is associated with \u201cprograms that directly involve cash or in-kind transfers to households or vulnerable groups\u201d and it is this rudimentary definition that we take into the following discussion. 229 225 ADB (2007) Formulating a country-based social protection index for monitoring vulnerability. http://www.adb.org/PRF/knowledge-products/REG-Social-Protection-Index.pdf 226 Naidu, V. and Moharty, M.

Over the last decade there has been significant growth in the number of social protection programs around the world. Some countries have adopted social protection as part of their national poverty reduction strategy. For example, Mexico started a social protection program (Progresa later renamed as Oportunidades) on a modest scale, but by 2002, Oportunidades was reaching over 25 million people and is now the core of the nation\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. Oportunidades has repeatedly shown statistically significant impacts on poverty incidence and poverty gaps amongst beneficiaries compared to those not yet part of the program.230 The key to Oportunidades\u2019 expansion and success was the use of compelling evidence to persuade donors and politicians from all parties. A strong constituency was developed with high-level political leadership in successive governments.231 Others countries have established social protection in response to crises such as natural disasters and the recent food and fuel price rises. For example, the Government of Indonesia quickly introduced a 230 For further information, see: World Bank (2009) Conditional Cash Transfers: Reducing Present and Future Poverty.

The results are impressive with the poverty rate reducing from 33% in 1998 to 12% in 2002. Evidence suggests that without the program, recovery in this timeframe would not have been possible. The Government of Indonesia, with no previous experience of implementing social protection, improved the program as they went along and demonstrated the importance of responding quickly and boldly.232 3.50.

These achievements\u2026represent powerful proof that well-designed public programs can have significant effects on critical social indicators.\u201d233 Social protection policies also play a role in stabilizing macro-economics when downturns occur by stimulating domestic aggregate demand, thereby boosting local production and employment levels, though debates continue on the extent to which social protection measures can themselves stimulate growth by injecting resources into the hands of the poor, and therefore their purchasing and production power.234 What are some of the key lessons learned about social protection around the world? 3.51. There have been many experiences and lessons learned across the world on social protection. We highlight just four perspectives: the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Finance Ministers\u2019 conclusions on the use of social protection in the Asian (1997-99) and Latin American (1994-95, 1999) crises; the Institute of Development Studies international analysis of social protection; the World Bank\u2019s recent assessment of conditional cash transfers (one of the most versatile and popular social protection measures); and the Overseas Development Institute\u2019s study of social protection responses to the current economic crisis in 10 countries. We also examine some of the advantages and disadvantages of specific social protection mechanisms. 3.52. Between 1999 and 2001, APEC Finance Ministers established a Working Group to draw lessons from the Asian (1997-99) and Latin American (1994-95, 1999) crises that could help guide policy formulation and implementation of social protection more generally. The APEC Finance Ministers concluded that: (1) social safety nets should be in place before a crisis occurs since they can address the needs of the poor in good economic times and be adaptable to combat the effects of crisis; (2) pre-crisis planning is essential to effectively address the social effects of crises and includes the availability of reliable and timely information on the poor and frequent evaluation of safety net programs; and (3) countries can select from a wide range of available instruments depending on their administrative capacity and target populations. In selecting the appropriate instruments, governments should ensure that the measures: provide adequate protection to the poor; promote efficient targeting; avoid creating a culture of dependency among recipients by limiting size and duration of benefits; are consistent with economic incentives and overall targets of fiscal and macro-economic policy; and encourage transparency and accountability in the design and implementation of programs and in the use of resources.235 232 Sumarto, S et al (2008) \u2018Indonesia\u2019s Social Protection During and After the Crisis.\u2019 In Barrientos, A and Hulme, D (eds.)

NREGA is an example of a self-targeted program, characterized by low administration costs and high accuracy in reaching the targeted population. By guaranteeing income support to anyone willing to participate in unskilled manual labour at low wages, and only for 100 days in a year, the program ensures that only the neediest will apply.237 \u2022 Indonesia\u2014As one of its policy responses to the Asian financial crisis, Indonesia implemented the Jaring Pengamanan Sosial (Social Safety Net Scholarships) program which provided up to 1.6 million scholarships intended primarily for poorer children during the 1998-1999 school years. While the targeting of the program could have been improved, it nevertheless helped to reduce lower secondary school dropouts in Indonesia by 24%.238 \u2022 Mexico\u2014Mexico\u2019s Oportunidades program offers cash transfers to poor mothers, conditional on their children using health facilities on a regular basis and attending school. This program has helped negate much of the impact of shocks such as unemployment of the household head or natural disasters in the locality of program recipients. One study focusing on the 1998-2000 period estimates that, had Progresa not been in place, a natural disaster would typically reduce school enrollment by 3.2 percentage points whereas an unemployment or illness shock for the household head would reduce the child\u2019s probability of enrollment by an average of about 2 percentage points.239 Children born to beneficiary families were also 25% less likely to be anaemic and grew by about 1 centimeter more based on another study.240 Progresa therefore helped to mitigate the impact of these shocks on children\u2019s education, and thus also helped to preserve their lifetime earnings prospects. One study estimates that through the impact of Progresa on education, it helps to raise an individual\u2019s annual earnings by roughly 8% and narrows the education gap between rich and poor children.241 \u2022 Natural disasters\u2014Cash and voucher programs have been used in a variety of humanitarian emergencies, such as in response to the Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004 (e.g. in Thailand, Indonesia, India and Sri Lanka) and the South Asia earthquake in 2005 (e.g. in Pakistan). Recent evaluations of these programs found evidence that under certain conditions, these did not result in price inflation and instead generated local multiplier effects; and that beneficiaries also largely spent the cash on necessities such as food, clothing and school fees and expenses, rather than on non-essential items. Cash programs were also found to be 20-50% cheaper to administer than food or in-kind programs, hinting at their greater cost-effectiveness.242 \u2022 Food and fuel price rise crisis\u2014From Senegal to Lesotho, many developing countries provided a safety net in response to the recent food price crisis. In Bangladesh, as many as two thirds of families were forced to take their children out of school in the aftermath of the food crisis\u2014but in areas where school feeding programs were in place, the drop out rate in primary school was significantly lower. Other successful examples of countries scaling up safety net programs to address the food and fuel crisis include Brazil increasing the benefits of the Bolsa Familia conditional cash transfer, Chile increasing the level of the winter heating allowance, the Kyrgyz Republic increasing the benefits of its Unified Monthly Benefit cash transfer program, Yemen doubling the value of its cash transfer benefit, and Egypt increasing the ration of food it subsidizes, as did some states in India. 236 Galasso, E. and Ravallion, M.

The Institute of Development Studies has also deduced a number of key lessons on social protection, in particular that social protection programs must pay attention to underlying structural constraints if intergenerational transmission of vulnerability is to be interrupted and that establishing or expanding social protection is a highly political and contextual process where ideas and ideology may matter more than data (Box 11).243,244 Box 11: Some international lessons on social protection \u2022 Social protection can help poor and vulnerable people to reduce or manage their risk and vulnerability. \u2022 By maintaining and building human capital and reducing social risk, social protection promotes long- term human capital development, livelihoods, employment and economic growth. \u2022 By providing poor people with a stake in the economy, they promote social cohesion and facilitate the implementation of other necessary reforms. \u2022 Social protection should respond to specific, identified vulnerabilities in specific local contexts based on solid analysis of the poor and the most vulnerable\u2014there are no blueprints. \u2022 Social protection should be protective, preventive, promotive and transformative. \u2022 Compensatory social transfers can not solve structural failures of weak markets, institutions or bad policies. Transformative social protection is particularly important to tackle underlying structural and political constraints and to interrupt intergenerational transmission of poverty and vulnerability. \u2022 Interventions should be determined by beneficiary preferences, not by donors\u2019 assumptions. \u2022 Social protection should be predictable, sustainable, and guaranteed by accountable duty-bearers. \u2022 When advocating for social protection, use triangle assessment (political will, government capacity and commitment, and resources available) and apply child-centred principles. \u2022 Food crises, climate change, disasters, and other shocks should be seen as entry points to promote comprehensive and transformative social protection. \u2022 Social protection is about building the consensus on what is a socially acceptable/desirable level of minimum welfare. \u2022 Political institutions/society (party, party system, local political brokers, etc.) matters more than civil society and government. Structural forces and historical development are central. Ideas and ideology matters, more than data. 3.54. The World Bank has recently completed a major assessment of conditional cash transfers (CCTs) and the impact such social protection schemes have on poverty, education, health, and nutrition outcomes. CCTs are programs that transfer cash, generally to poor households, on the condition that those households make pre-specified investments in the human capital of their children. Health and nutrition conditions generally require periodic checkups, growth monitoring, and vaccinations for children less than 5 years of age; perinatal care for mothers and attendance by mothers at periodic health information talks. Education conditions usually include school enrollment, attendance on 80-85% of school days, and occasionally some measure of performance. Most CCT programs transfer the money to the mother of the household or to the student in some circumstances. The World Bank\u2019s assessment draws heavily on a large number of carefully constructed impact evaluations of CCT programs (Box 12).245,246 243 Davies, M. and McGregor, J.A.

Virtually every country in Latin America has such a program. Elsewhere, there are large-scale programs in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Turkey, and pilot programs in Cambodia, Malawi, Morocco, Pakistan, and South Africa, among others. Interest in programs that seek to use cash to incentivize household investments in child schooling has spread from developing to developed countries\u2014most recently to programs in New York City and Washington, DC. \u2022 CCTs have increased consumption levels among the poor. As a result, they have resulted in sometimes substantial reductions in poverty among beneficiaries\u2014especially when the transfer has been generous, well targeted, and structured in a way that does not discourage recipients from taking other actions to escape poverty. \u2022 Because CCTs provide a steady stream of income, they have helped buffer poor households from the worst effects of unemployment, catastrophic illness, and other sudden income shocks.

Transfers generally have been well targeted to poor households, have raised consumption levels, and have reduced poverty\u2014by a substantial amount in some countries. Offsetting adjustments that could have blunted the impact of transfers\u2014such as reductions in the labor market participation of beneficiaries\u2014have been relatively modest. Moreover, CCT programs often have provided an entry point to reforming badly targeted subsidies and upgrading the quality of safety nets. \u2022 Evidence of CCT impacts on final outcomes in health and education\u2014achievement and cognitive development rather than school enrollment, child height for age rather than growth monitoring\u2014is more mixed. CCTs have increased the likelihood that households will take their children for preventive health checkups, but that has not always led to better child nutritional status; school enrollment rates have increased substantially among program beneficiaries, but there is little evidence of improvements in learning outcomes. \u2022 To maximize their potential effects on the accumulation of human capital, CCTs should be combined with other programs to improve the quality of the supply of health and education services, and should provide other supporting services. They also suggest the need to experiment with conditions that focus on outcomes rather than on the use of services alone. \u2022 An important challenge for the future is better understanding what complementary actions are necessary to ensure that CCTs have greater impact on final health and education outcomes. Even the best-designed and best-managed CCT program cannot fulfill all of the needs of a comprehensive and transformative social protection system. CCTs therefore need to be complemented with other interventions, such as workfare or employment programs and social pensions. Even more important are complementary policies that improve the coverage and quality of the supply of health and education services; and policies that help promote healthier and more stimulating environments for children in their homes. 3.55. In a recent study on how 10 countries (Bangladesh, Benin, Bolivia, Cambodia, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia) are dealing with the current economic crisis, the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) noted that in all countries, social protection has low coverage, tending to be inequitably distributed, assisting only a small percentage of the poor and offering disproportionate support to those in formal employment, particularly government employees. Only Cambodia and Bangladesh reported significant social protection program expansion in 2008 and 2009, although in the case of Bangladesh this expansion was planned prior to the onset of the crisis. Key factors determining the nature of the social protection response across these countries included: (1) the extent to which actual and anticipated state revenue contraction has constrained budgets; (2) whether governments are willing to tolerate an increasing deficit in order to support social protection provision; (3) whether they are able to access alternative sources of income to address the fiscal deficit; (4) the relative priority given to social protection and social sector programming; and (5) the extent to which increased impoverishment arising from the crisis has been recognized and identified as a priority concern. The ODI study concluded that prospects for extending social protection coverage significantly on the basis of domestic resources are meagre. For these countries, only a large-scale increase in levels of donor funding would enable prior poverty and the impoverishment resulting from the crisis to be addressed to any significant degree through social protection.247 3.56. Experience suggests that within the range of possible social protection responses and given the importance of choosing policy responses based on country context, some measures offer distinct advantages over others (Table 10). 247 ODI (2009) The global financial crisis and developing countries: Synthesis of the findings of 10 country case studies.

Targeted Cash Transfers \u2022 Some countries may be able to expand existing targeted safety net programs with broad coverage of poor. The level of transfer and/or the coverage of poor households could be quickly expanded (or indexed). \u2022 If transfers are in cash then these may be less administratively costly to deliver and do not distort prices. \u2022 Transfers can be conditioned on household investments in human capital (e.g. attendance at school, training, health clinics, agricultural extension programs) \u2022 These require an administrative capacity to design and implement well targeted programs. \u2022 Often not easy to scale up coverage of these programs in very short term. \u2022 Takes time and resources to design and implement or to expand coverage.

Unconditional and conditional cash transfers (CCTs) can assist poor households in overcoming the direct and indirect costs of basic social services and some have been shown to have an important effect on children\u2019s access to nutrition, health and education services, especially girls.248,249 But if transfers are to effectively increase the use of services, there must be an adequate supply of quality services.250,251 In many low-income countries, this access is highly inadequate. A growing number of countries are implementing conditional cash transfer programs\u2014 but where conditional cash transfers do not exist, establishing a new program to reach substantial numbers of poor citizens can be a very challenging, time-consuming and administratively complicated process, entailing considerable data-collection and monitoring capacity which may be difficult to mobilize 248 Grooten, S.

Consequently, in low-income countries where poverty is widespread and administrative capacity limited, unconditional transfers could be considered as a way to enhance universal social protection.253 3.58. Cash or in-kind transfers. A careful assessment of whether to opt for cash transfers or in-kind transfers has to be made. Risk analysis of the potential negative consequences of cash transfer systems will be important. Cash cannot necessarily replace essential items necessary for child survival such as therapeutic foods and long-lasting insecticidal bed-nets. In areas where markets are functioning poorly, it may be more cost effective to provide food or inputs directly to families instead of cash.

In Malawi, for example, a program called Inputs for Assets distributes vouchers only to those who participated in a public works project. This approach provides some self-targeting because wealthier farmers were less likely to participate in these projects. Vouchers were redeemable with local input suppliers, strengthening effective demand for inputs and increasing sales and profits of private distributors.254 Expanding the coverage of other targeted measures, such as targeted food distribution or school lunch programs, can also be effective in reaching vulnerable households. Agricultural subsidy programs can help if they are carefully designed and focus on increasing the productivity of small farmers. 3.59. Targeted or untargeted social protection. Targeted transfers may be an option where social protection systems are already in place. Targeted transfer programs can reach the poor efficiently and effectively, but implementation can be difficult, with information gaps making targeting very costly and beyond most administrative capacities, to name but a few challenges.255 Ravillion (2008) goes on to note that: \u2018\u2026it is far from clear what is so \u201cperfect\u201d about \u201cperfect targeting.\u201d\u2026 Empirical research has confirmed theoretical arguments that finer targeting is not necessarily consistent with a greater impact on poverty, and may even have perverse effects, such as when fine targeting undermines political support for the program. Sustainability depends on having broad political support, which can be at odds with fine targeting. Also coverage of the poor is often weak in finely targeted programs. Avoiding leakage to the non-poor often requires that help is severely rationed even amongst those in obvious need. Furthermore, better targeted programs are not necessarily more cost-effective. A recent study of a large transfer program in China found that standard measures of targeting performance (including those widely used by the [World] Bank) are uninformative, or even deceptive, about the impacts on poverty, and cost-effectiveness in reducing poverty. In program design and evaluation, it is better to focus directly on the program\u2019s outcomes for poor people than to rely on prevailing measures of targeting\u2026 It must also be acknowledged that conventional assessments of \u201ctargeting performance\u201d typically rely on rather narrow definitions of household \u201cconsumption\u201d or \u201cincome,\u201d based on survey data. While they may accord well with how an economist would define these concepts given the available data, it is quite possible that policy makers have a different and broader concept in mind, reflecting (say) living standards over a longer time period or the assets held by the household. The program\u2019s apparent \u201cmis-targeting\u201d could simply reflect the fact that the survey-based measure of \u201cincome\u201d is not a sufficient statistic for deciding who is really \u201cpoor\u201d.\u2019256 3.60. Badly designed targeted assistance can give rise to \u201cpoverty traps\u201d when people are encouraged to \u201cstay poor\u201d by the availability of assistance.257 Targeted cash transfer schemes also tend to be relatively unresponsive to changes in the need for assistance. When a previously ineligible household is hit hard by, for example, unemployment of the main breadwinner, the household may not find it easy to get help from 252 IDS (2008) Voices from the South: the impact of the financial crisis on developing countries. http://www.ids.ac.uk/go/financial- crisis-impact 253 Devereux, S. and Pelham, L.

Eligibility re-assessments may need to be implemented in the wake of a crisis.258 Generalized or non-targeted interventions such as universal cash transfers or food subsidies are often viewed as a stop-gap measure to be used until more cost-effective transfer instruments can be developed.259 Nevertheless, even universal social protection schemes may take a while to develop and implement (e.g., 2010 school fees may already be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c84cc3f-5337-4675-b3a8-c2d42c80bc6e": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c84cc3f-5337-4675-b3a8-c2d42c80bc6e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting Pacific Island Children & Women during Economic and Food Crises", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "753550d621e6843e2642995ec668af1a9e1f35f86f4da16ae8a606ef1f52a33c"}, "3": {"node_id": "735def91-2b21-4cfa-b7ce-ddbc3af8ef9e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a3a3ebb519709603b1fd5fba056f7f39e74bed2fec7009f50667625ea117d6b"}}, "hash": "ee94c2a27c2d17afb4db834acbcd11c98c550d18917434614a329a488d495d40", "text": "paid by the time a school subsidy program is put in place). Time is required to gather and analyse the necessary data required to underpin program design and other implementation issues (e.g., cash for works programs may be contrary to minimum wage legislation). Too much haste may lead to poorly designed programs that may become a drain on fiscal positions.260 Nevertheless, the success of Indonesia\u2019s National Safety Net Program, highlighted earlier, demonstrates that it is possible for governments to launch a massive social protection response rapidly and improve it as the program proceeds. 3.61. If we were to summarize some of the international experiences with and lessons learned about social protection they might be as follows: \u2022 Social protection can help poor and vulnerable people to reduce or manage their risk and vulnerability. \u2022 Social protection arrangements can be a direct way of dealing with crisis, but should also be seen as part of longer-term efforts to reduce poverty which positively contribute to the economic and social development. \u2022 There is a wide range of available instruments from which governments can choose depending on their administrative capacity and target populations. \u2022 Ideally, social protection should be in place before a crisis occurs since it can address the needs of the poor in good economic times and be adaptable to combat the effects of crisis, but there are examples where countries have used a crisis as an entry point to initiate social protection. When a crisis hits, it is important to seize these moments for progressive social protection initiatives. \u2022 Existing social protection programs that target the structurally poor (i.e., those poor before the economic crisis) do not always have a clear mechanism to deal with the \u201cnew poor\u201d (i.e., those near poor pushed into poverty by the economic crisis). It is important that social protection programs remain responsive to changes in the need for assistance. \u2022 Single schemes such as conditional cash transfers, even if well designed and managed, are most effective when part of a comprehensive and transformative social protection system. Basic social services must be improved where they are weak, legislation that promotes children\u2019s and women\u2019s rights must be strengthened where these rights are denied or compromised, and societal attitudes and practices must be changed where they are harmful to children and women. \u2022 Establishing social protection programs can depend on the relative priority given to social sector programming in general and the extent to which poverty is recognized and identified as a priority concern. \u2022 Starting and sustaining social protection programs is a highly contextual process where ideas, ideology and politics may matter more than data. What are some of the characteristics of existing social protection programs in the Pacific? 3.62. Research by the ADB has led to the development of a Social Protection Index (SPI) for the region. The SPI is a summary measurement tool that systematically quantifies national level social protection activities thereby providing: an initial diagnostic baseline of social protection programs; a means of monitoring changes in social protection over time; and a benchmark for international comparisons of social protection provision.261 The SPI is generated from four summary social protection indicators that each represents a different facet of a country\u2019s social protection system (Table 11): \ufffd Expenditure\u2014% of GDP spent on social protection activities. \ufffd Coverage\u2014the combined % of seven target populations (the unemployed/under-employed, the elderly, the sick, the poor, people living with disabilities, and children with special needs) who receive some social protection. \ufffd Poverty targeting rates\u2014the % of the poor in each country that receive some social protection transfers or other social protection benefits. \ufffd The amount of social protection expenditure going to the poor\u2014derived by applying the poverty targeting rates to the total expenditure on each social protection program. 258 Ravillion, M.

To limit the SPI\u2019s complexity, the following definition of social protection was used: \u201cThe set of policies and programs that enable vulnerable groups to prevent, reduce, and/or cope with risks, AND that: are targeted at the vulnerable groups; involve cash or in-kind transfers; and are not activities which are usually associated with other sectors such as rural development, basic infrastructure, health and education.\u201d Social protection activities whose costs and impacts are not amenable to quantification such as legislation relating to labour standards, women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights, or advocacy and empowerment projects) were excluded. Micro-credit and micro-finance programs were included when they targeted the poor, but mainstream rural credit programs were not. 3.64. Based on these four indicators, Pacific Island countries (within this ADB study) on average spend 4.5% of their GDPs on social protection and achieve an overall coverage level of 22% across the seven key target populations. The average proportion of the poor who receive some social protection is 35%, but the actual social protection expenditure going to the poor is relatively low\u2014equivalent to only 11% of the poverty line suggesting that the impact of social protection expenditure on the poor is not substantial. While these figures mask variations between countries (for example, see footnote f in Table 11), in general, Pacific Island countries in this study, spend slightly higher proportions of their GDP on social protection than some countries in East and South Asia, but achieve on average, less coverage across the seven key target populations (Table 12), and direct less social protection specifically to the poor than countries in Asia. We present the overall SPI for each of the eight Pacific Island countries in a short while.

The first feature to notice in Table 13 is the number of government-run schemes each of these countries have\u2014averaging 15 types of social protection (this does not include civil society-run protection programs). It is also worth noting that governments in all of these five countries: fund some form of micro-enterprise development; provide some disability benefits, survivor benefits, work injury insurance; and maternity benefits; offer some form of social assistance in the form of medical rehabilitation, disaster victim assistance, and subsidized medical treatment; facilitate micro loans; and manage child vaccination programs. Lastly, none of these five countries have unemployment insurance, social health insurance, or engage in cash transfer schemes (apart from family assistance allowance in Fiji). Only Fiji provides social funds, child maintenance, and scholarships for the disadvantaged. Only Samoa offers state-run sickness insurance and aged care programs. Only Fiji and Samoa provide assistance for the homeless and nutrition programs for children; while only Fiji and Solomon Islands offer some form of assistance for homeless young people. 262 Naidu, V. and Moharty, M.

Naidu and Moharty (2009) note that across these five countries, National Provident Funds (NPFs) are the most common type of social security system but NPFs only cover workers in the formal employment sector, meaning that the majority of workers employed in the informal economy are not covered. As the majority of workers in the formal employment sector are men (see Table 8), this means there is a large gender disparity in who has access to NPFs. Across these five countries, only a small proportion of workers have retirement income coverage (ranging from 47% in Fiji to only 18% in Vanuatu), and there is very limited coverage of maternity benefits, with Fiji reaching just under 50% of the workforce despite having one of the lowest number of dependents per household ratios (Table 14).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99d26852-76bb-4649-af4f-6f805c0f620c": {"__data__": {"id_": "99d26852-76bb-4649-af4f-6f805c0f620c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting Pacific Island Children & Women during Economic and Food Crises", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "931e68b73e4b3e63bb8dce0ea0001cc885f0cf0d3cf585596fa8e9942e3c4a17"}, "2": {"node_id": "e13cf817-02a5-4ef8-ac8a-e9d8f82dbf0a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3eb30ef2e5ca672d19925f76e72866429b59bc9e405e9985ac944fe04b2dc5f8"}}, "hash": "87a42144111cde184f992d552afa162ccc324c47352d046fce77d971fdc048f3", "text": "Table 14: Comparative coverage of social protection for workers in five Pacific Island countries Country Total formal sector workers, 2005 % worker with retirement income coverage % workforce covered by maternity benefits No. of dependents per household Fiji Islands 164,564 47 47 4. 5 Kiribati 9,447 19 10 6. 7 Samoa 17,164 23 10 5. 0 Solomon Islands 57, 472 23 10 6. 3 Vanuatu 15,000 18 10 5. 1 Source: Naidu, V. and Moharty, M.

Besides the low coverage of existing social protection programs in the Pacific, there is also opportunity to improve program design and operation. Box 13 illustrates the World Bank\u2019s preliminary assessment of Fiji\u2019s Family Assistance Program (FAP).263,264 Box 13: Fiji\u2019s Family Assistance Program \u2022 Fiji\u2019s Family Assistance Program (FAP) is administered by the Department of Social Welfare (DSW). Potential beneficiaries who are eligible are (i) the elderly over 60 with no support, (ii) the chronically ill, (iii) the permanently disabled, (iv) the widowed (where the breadwinner has died), (v) deserted spouses, (vi) single parents, and (vii) dependants of prisoners. \u2022 FAP is means-tested based on family income, and benefits vary within the range of F$60-F$100 (around US$22-37) per household per month with an average of F$64 (around US$24) per beneficiary household. Beneficiaries are paid through a 6-monthly voucher which can be cashed at post offices or authorized local shops, and more recently, deposits into bank accounts. \u2022 In 2007, the elderly, the chronically ill and the widowed each account for about a quarter of beneficiaries. About 56% of beneficiary households are Fijians and about two-thirds of the beneficiaries are households where women are the primary applicant. \u2022 As of June 2007, the FAP covered more than 26,000 households or more than of 15 percent of the total population of Fiji. The DSW noted that the program has generally been oversubscribed with around 1,800 households on the waiting list in 2007 that have been turned away apparently for lack of funds. \u2022 There are a number of concerns with the program including the targeting performance (means-tested in principle but carried out imperfectly in practice), selection of eligible beneficiaries (based on first come first served basis and rolled over several years, with no clear system of verifying continued eligibility\u2014although DSW recently terminated 3,000 cases of recipients who no longer meet the criteria), out-dated household income ceiling for claiming the FAP (F$144 per week has not been increased since 2005, so it has fallen about 15% in real terms. Although this was originally broadly in line with the income tax threshold, the new threshold means that this has now doubled the FAP income ceiling). The DSW has prepared a Cabinet paper to review the selection criteria and level of assistance for different categories. \u2022 Any donor-supported conditional cash transfer program to alleviate the impact of higher food and fuel prices and the current economic crisis in Fiji could potentially piggy-back on the Family Assistance Program and/or other social protection programs but it would be important to address the current concerns of the FAP to improve its effectiveness and performance, and address any adverse incentive effects of the program. 263 Note from World Bank, July 10, 2008. 264 See also: Miskelly, R.

Returning to efforts to develop and measure a Social Protection Index, Table 15 presents the summary SPIs for the 8 Pacific Island countries involved in the ADB\u2019s study as well as a Total Pacific SPI. Table 15 also presents an SPI for all the Asia countries included in ADB\u2019s study, and specifically Japan and Korea, countries with the highest SPIs in the Asia-Pacific region. The Pacific Island country with the highest SPI is Cook Islands with 0.55. The lowest is Papua New Guinea with 0.01. The ADB has classified Cook Islands in an \u201cabove average category\u201d (alongside Asian countries such as Azerbaijan, Kazahkstan, and Mongolia).

A low HPI means that there is less vulnerability to death at an early age, more adults are included in the world of knowledge, there is greater access to basic services, and there is less food poverty (for information on the HPI see 1.30). As one would expect, there does appear to be an association between the SPI and Human Poverty Index (HPI) (Figure 7).

Countries with a high SPI tend to have a low HPI (e.g., Cook Islands and Republic of Marshall Islands), whereas countries with a low SPI tend to have a high Human Poverty Index (e.g., Papua New Guinea). Yet some SPI/HPI comparisons reveal unusual results. Nauru has a relatively high SPI despite having only a moderate Human Poverty Index, suggesting the need to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of existing social protection programs and to assess the sustainability of the current level of 265 Wood, J.

Tonga, despite having only a marginally lower HPI than Cook Islands, has a much lower SPI, implying that Tonga may benefit from a thorough performance review of its social protection system. Likewise, Tuvalu appears to be using social protection slightly more efficiently than Fiji, with a higher SPI but around the same HPI. Results for Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea suggest their social protection programs urgently need a larger proportion of GDP, greater coverage of target groups, and stronger targeting and expenditure specifically focused on the poor if social protection is to make any inroads on their respective poverty levels. Is strengthening formal social protection in the Pacific an option at this time of crisis? 3.72. Traditional social safety nets under stress. Pacific Island countries are well known for their informal, community or family-based systems of social support and reciprocity such as Kerekere and Solevu in Fiji, Fa\u2019a Samoa, and Wantok mechanisms in Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Through such systems, Pacific communities have developed resilience to adversity. Traditional safety nets, however, may well break down when confronted by a large external shock. For example, research on the impact of the 1995 \u201cPeso crisis\u201d in Mexico (resulting in a 9% decline in GDP in that year) revealed that many of the normal coping strategies of poor households failed during this large macro shock.266 Field research in Vanuatu and observations in Fiji suggest traditional support mechanisms are indeed weakening in the face of the crisis, especially amongst the urban poor.267,268 Remittances from family members living overseas, which form a major part of these informal safety nets, are also declining.269 Even before the current economic crisis erupted, commentators noted that traditional support systems in a number of Pacific Island countries were being eroded by the trend towards urban and Westernized living.270,271,272,273,274 3.73. Even if informal systems were not being damaged, their important existence should not stall earnest consideration of establishing formal social protection systems and urgent efforts to improve those programs that already exist. Prospects for an early global economic recovery are unlikely and a long and deep recession or even a depression cannot be discounted. We noted in Part 1 that even prior to the economic crisis, one in four households and almost one-in-three of the population in the Pacific are below their respective national poverty lines. We need to truly understand what such numbers imply. These families face a daily struggle to obtain even a basic diet and are continuously confronted by difficult choices on how to spend their limited cash resources. Many of these families are frequently, and some families, constantly in debt.

Nevertheless, it would appear that there are ways to improve aspects of existing social protection in Pacific Island countries, especially in response to the crisis: \u2022 The first enhancement that needs to be made is to increase the quality of existing formal social protection programs and especially to improve social protection access to and specific expenditures on the poor. \u2022 Second, current systems of formal social protection in the Pacific could be made less fragmented. A rapid country-specific diagnosis could contribute to working out how best to reduce fragmentation and expand existing social protection programs to help protect vulnerable groups. The international development community should help in the conduct of such diagnoses as well as provide sound policy and programmatic advice on how to quickly scale-up and strengthen existing social protection for vulnerable households. Diagnoses would include questions such as: Which sectors of the economy are particularly vulnerable to shocks transmitted from the global economy? Which groups of the population will be most affected by these shocks and amongst these which groups are particularly vulnerable to adverse effects from the shocks? How will vulnerable households be particularly affected by the impact and how might we expect them to attempt to cope with the shock? \u2022 Third, traditional social protection mechanisms need to be better understood and strengthened where possible.

An integrated approach to social protection means applying a holistic approach to strengthen ministries that are responsible for a range of benefit programs and services. \u2022 Fifth, better coordination between governments, the private sector, civil society and other development partners is needed to ensure linkage between policies that, for example, stabilize commodity prices, provide for basic health services, help people find decent work, and keep children in education. \u2022 Sixth, in many contexts, lack of public knowledge on entitlements can be a major barrier to uptake of social protection programs.

What could be the role of corporate social responsibility and private regulation? Where formal social protection is weak or does not exist, how could it be initiated? 3.75. When a crisis occurs, the need for a fast response means that adapting existing programs may be more effective than creating new ones. Where adequate social protection programs exist then their coverage should be expanded and their targeting improved in the short term through the adoption of simple targeting methods focusing, for example, on: (i) geographic characteristics; (ii) family size and housing conditions; and (iii) categories of the most vulnerable populations such as those living with disabilities and elderly living alone (see Box 1).277 The departure point for many Pacific Island countries, however, will likely be from a weak or non-existent social protection system. There will also be few poverty profiles or maps detailing what types of households and places will be most vulnerable, though vulnerability predictions can still be made using the best data and analytic tools available. Establishing real-time social impact monitoring (as we discuss above) will also enhance national capacity to set up better information systems for designing and monitoring social protection programs now and when future 277 Grosh, M., del Ninno, C., Tesliuc, E. and Ouerghi, A. with the assistance of Milazzo, A. and Weigand, C.

Where political leadership is strong, the current economic crisis provides an opportunity to create social protection from scratch. It should be remembered, however, that crises have triggered some of the worst \u201csocial protection\u201d policies, as well as some of best. Governments have sometimes initiated generalized food and fuel subsidies at a huge fiscal and economic cost, but which have had only modest impact on poverty at best and are difficult to reverse when the crisis subsides. On the other hand, some of the best social protection programs have emerged from crises, for example, the famine relief programs created in India in late nineteenth century and the \u201cNew Deal\u201d in post-depression USA (and see Box 10 for more recent international experiences). 3.76. Some ideas to get started. Table 10 has listed the advantages and disadvantages of various social protection mechanisms that could be considered.

Poll transfers can be more cost-effective than ad valorem subsidies tied to consumption of normal goods and can even have more impact on poverty at a lower costs than a well-targeted cash transfer scheme with high administrative expenses and other deadweight losses (such as income foregone or other costs associated with complying with conditionalities in more sophisticated conditional transfer schemes).279 A basic income also preserves incentives to work.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "611d08f2-30b4-42dd-bb14-36442d51aac2": {"__data__": {"id_": "611d08f2-30b4-42dd-bb14-36442d51aac2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting Pacific Island Children & Women during Economic and Food Crises", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8eb8b289e383a1c8859bbdb47e1b4b639fabed9858cdd2b8ab09a357e6f13227"}, "2": {"node_id": "a13b9447-bd01-4c24-9b10-42ba8a299abc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "70a84ba223a52f7f93e8eb93bb776ee515f144a8125850b2676c75897e4a4073"}}, "hash": "248ebc183083228a4c87f86255bfc18495d574b3ee9ca21c7c76dbdd2d9eacbf", "text": "The administrative cost for a Poll Transfer is usually low but not zero given that some form of personal registration system is needed to prevent \u201cdouble dipping\u201d and to assure that larger households receive proportionately more.

Critical questions that can guide the decision to have a CCT program (and other social protection schemes listed here) include: What the levels of poverty and inequality? What is the availability of resources? What are the efficiency costs and benefits of redistribution? Are there agency problems (e.g., large gender differences in human capital)? What externalities exist (e.g., high incidence of crime in poor neighborhoods)? Does a cash transfer scheme already exist targeting the poor, even on a small- scale? How can eligibility criteria for social assistance be made as transparent as possible? What are the society\u2019s views on distributive justice? 280 \u2022 Workfare Programs (also called \u201crelief work\u201d or \u201cpublic works\u201d programs; \u201cfood for work\u201d programs also fall under this heading)\u2014the essential idea is that those seeking relief must work to obtain support, and the work is used to help affected areas rebuild after the disaster, or to develop badly needed public works. Provided Workfare Programs are designed and implemented well, they can be responsive to differences in need\u2014both between people at one date and over time for a given person. Public spending on labour-intensive public works projects, such as building rural roads, combines the benefits of an aggregate fiscal stimulus with those of income support for poor groups. Workfare Programs can also have broader social benefits, such as building more schools and clinics. Gender requirements must be heeded as we note in 3.36, especially for programs targeting informal workers. Focusing such programs on young people in the Pacific would be particularly valuable given the large numbers of unemployed youth in many Pacific Islands (see 2.28). Workfare Programs were a key element of the New Deal introduced by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 in response to the Great Depression. Introduced in British India around 1880 in response to the famine, Workfare Programs continue to play an important role in India\u2014the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) mentioned in Box 10 is a classic example. Workfare Programs have also been used to respond to famines in Sub-Saharan Africa, the East Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s (e.g., Indonesia, the Republic of Korea and Thailand), Mexico\u2019s 1995 \u201cPeso crisis,\u201d the 1998- 2001 recession in Peru, and the 2002 financial crisis in Argentina. Models of employment entitlement programs such as those offered by the Self Employed Women\u2019s Association in India or the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, can help provide much needed social protection to vulnerable groups in times of crisis. Research has shown that Workfare Programs can impact on both poverty and unemployment, including providing work to displaced, retrenched or returning migrant workers, with 278 Ravillion, M.

Local community groups would send proposals (documenting what exactly will be done, at what cost, and how many workers will be employed) to a central agency that assesses if they qualify under the rules of the Workfare Program, with full public disclosure. The central agency should only contribute to the non-wage costs if the community putting up the proposal is a designated poor area, as indicated by a credible \u201cpoverty map\u201d or best available information; non-poor areas should finance their own non-wage costs. \u2022 Assistance should be provided to communities to both set up community groups and in designing projects. If the project is in a poor areas then the central agency can also help in securing any extra funding needed for non-wage costs beyond that available through the Workfare Program; this might come from other public programs or the private sector. \u2022 Employment-intensive investments need to go hand-in-hand with efforts to promote skills development. Consider including training in basic literacy, numeracy, and financial skills for adults, together with appropriate specialized knowledge, such as flood-avoidance lessons for farmers. The wage rate for training should be set somewhat lower than other work. \u2022 Budget allocated to such a scheme must be sufficient to assure that anyone who wants work at that wage rate and is signed up to a viable community works project will get the work. The attraction of a workfare program as insurance will be lost if the work must be rationed. \u2022 A rapid expansion of demand for relief work is a good signal that other transfers need to kick in as well, targeted to specific groups who either cannot work, or should not be taken out of other activities (notably school) to join relief work. \u2022 When the crisis is over, the Workfare Program will no longer be needed for the majority of workers and (provided the wage rate is not set too high) they will automatically return to regular work. However, when the wage rate for relief work is too high or the assets created are of too little value then a cash transfer program is probably a better option. Sources: Ravallion, M.

Washington, D.C.: World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 4763. 3.77. We noted earlier that single schemes such as CCTs or Workfare Programs, even if well designed and managed, are most effective when part of a comprehensive and transformative social protection system. A comprehensive system will likely require a combination of transfers (in cash or food) and relief work. As Ravillion (2008) notes: \u201c[Workfare] helps the working poor while a complementary set of transfers in cash or food can be targeted to specific groups who either cannot work (due to physical incapacity, including poor nutritional status) or should not be taken out of other activities (notably school) to join relief work.\u201d But just getting started may require Pacific Islands with weak or no formal social protection programs to adopt a phased approach, perhaps starting with a Workfare or social transfer program (cash or in-kind), and bringing further schemes on stream when real-time monitoring indicates and the situation allows. We must also remember that for comprehensive social protection programs to be most effective, basic social services must be improved where they are weak, legislation that promotes children\u2019s and women\u2019s rights must be strengthened where these rights are denied or compromised, and societal attitudes and practices must be changed where they are harmful to children and women.

There is overwhelming evidence that vulnerabilities facing children differ from those facing adults.

Children and young people will constitute a large section of the population for some time to come. Recognizing the ways on which deprivation and poverty are transmitted across generations and across time requires that social protection programs take the long view, tackling multiple deprivations through protective as well as transformative agendas (Box 15). Box 15: Why child-centred social protection is so needed Child poverty and wellbeing are multidimensional. Children experience complex physical and intellectual development as they grow, and are more vulnerable to malnutrition, abuse and exploitation that adults. Their dependency on adults to support and protect them means that loss of family care is a significant risk\u2026 Intra-household discrimination can also result in hunger, lack of access to services, and abuse and exploitation of certain children. These risks may increase in situations where women\u2019s access to independent livelihoods is lower and the distribution of power and resources is highly inequitable, since women bear the greatest responsibility for childcare and protection. Inequality in physical strength and in information also means that children can be more easily exploited. Finally, by virtue of their age and \u2018minor\u2019 status in society, children are practically and legally less able to claim their rights. Source: Sabates-Wheeler, R., Devereux, S. and Hodges, A.

Child-centred social protection strengthens families\u2019 capacities to provide a protective environment for children and enhances access to basic services for the poorest and most marginalized. Likewise, making social protection more child-centred has the potential to benefit not only children, but also their families, communities and national development as a whole. Social protection does not have to explicitly target children in order to benefit them; applying the following child-centred principles to social protection can make a huge difference for children: \u2022 Avoid adverse impacts on children, and reduce or mitigate social risks that directly affect children\u2019s lives; \u2022 Intervene as early as possible where children are at risk, in order to prevent irreversible impairment or harm to children; \u2022 Consider the age and gender specific risks and vulnerabilities of children throughout the life-cycle; \u2022 Mitigate the effects of shocks, exclusion and poverty on families, recognizing that families raising children need support to ensure equal opportunity; \u2022 Make special provision to reach children who are particularly vulnerable and excluded, including children without parental care, and who are marginalized within their families or communities due to their gender, disability, ethnicity, HIV and AIDS or other factors; \u2022 Consider the mechanisms and intra-household dynamics that may affect how children are reached, with particular attention paid to the special circumstances of women; \u2022 Since the most at-risk children usually live outside family care, make social protection systems responsive to this vulnerable group as well as to children facing abuse or discrimination at home; and \u2022 Include the voices and opinions of children and young people themselves in the understanding, design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of social protection programs. 3.80. Child protection and social protection. In Part 2, we highlighted that levels of violence against children and child neglect tend to rise at times of crises. Accordingly, integrating child protection mechanisms into social protection packages at a time of crisis is vital. Possible synergies include: (i) integrating child protection issues (e.g. no tolerance of child labour) into cash transfer conditionalities; (ii) using interactions with program beneficiaries to raise awareness about child protection vulnerabilities; (iii) supporting the development of a single registry system so that the wellbeing outcomes of children receiving transfers can be better monitored and supported by cross-agency services; and (iv) linking child abuse referral systems to the implementing office of cash transfers or workfare programs, etc. Although the idea of integrating social protection and child protection systems is still very new, there are already some examples of good practice, such as Ghana\u2019s Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) program, which makes program participation conditional on families\u2019 refraining from using child labour or 281 Sabates-Wheeler, R., Devereux, S. and Hodges, A.

How can social protection systems be financed? 3.81. In countries hard hit by the crisis, there is a strong case for the expansion of appropriate forms of social protection to minimize the impact on the poor. When contemplating the cost-benefit of investing in social protection, at least three critical points are worth recalling: \u2022 The central lesson learned from all previous economic crises is that the poorest people in developing countries suffer the most and that not enough is done to help them. \u2022 Partly due to the inadequacy of national and international responses, many crises have had lasting social and economic impacts that proved difficult to reverse. Impacts on children can last a life-time and even extend across generations. \u2022 There is clear evidence that well designed social protection programs do play a crucial role in alleviating social hardship in good times as well as in bad. 3.82. But how can social protection be financed? As we noted earlier, most Pacific Islands have only limited resources to formulate and then implement improved public policy. Governments must focus on macro-economic fundamentals to create fiscal space to fund social protection. Establishing new or expanding existing social protection programs may also be an area where donors can provide valuable support. At this time, donor funding for social protection will depend on how the crisis affects aid although the IMF, the World Bank, the European Commission, and the ADB appear to be in a good position to help. Tax-based social protection, as practiced in many Latin American countries, may become a viable option for Pacific Island countries to pursue in the longer-term. 3.83. The World Bank\u2019s decision to launch a new Vulnerability Finance Facility to help mobilize more funding to protect the poorest is welcome and represents recognition of the need for global responsibility and cooperation.283 The Vulnerability Finance Facility, which could channel resources not only through the Bank but also through other agencies, should help those countries without the resources to respond to the crisis by funding investments in three key social protection areas: \u2022 Infrastructure projects that would help put people in developing countries back to work while building a foundation for future growth and productivity. \u2022 Safety net programs, such as conditional cash transfers that make it possible for people to keep their children in school, get adequate nutrition and seek health care. \u2022 Financing for small and medium-sized businesses and microfinance institutions to help the private sector create jobs. 3.84. It is important to note that the budgetary cost of establishing permanent social protection programs need not be very high and could well bring longer-term efficiency gains to the economy. Most social protection programs constitute a small proportion of national Gross Domestic Products (GDPs). The ADB\u2019s recent study to develop a Social Protection Index revealed that eight Pacific Island countries spend around 4.5% of their GDP on social protection but have scope to become far more cost- effective. A comprehensive review of 87 developing and transition countries\u2019 spending on social safety nets by the World Bank found that mean spending on such programs account for about 1.9% of GDP. About half of the countries studied spent only between 1-2% of their GDP on safety net programs, whereas this figure would be about 2-4% of GDP in industrial countries.284,285 Cash transfer programs such as those in Brazil and Mexico cost about 0.5% of GDP, which is a mere fraction of total public spending in these countries.286 Research on past crises also suggests that the shift in public spending needed to compensate the poor in a crisis need not be large.

Cost-benefit analyses also reveal that some social protection programs could actually pay for themselves. For instance, there is evidence that Ecuador\u2019s Bono de Desarollo Humano (Human Development Bond) program could produce education benefits that are more than twice its total cost. This estimate does not yet consider parallel improvements in child health and nutrition that are also likely to result from this program.288 While there are few cost-benefit studies of developing country programs, those focusing on industrial countries\u2019 social protection programs indicate similar positive results. The ADB\u2019s study shows that domestic resources in the Pacific, if made more cost-efficient and effective, should be sufficient to cover the modest demand of social protection programs in normal years. How can social protection become a major new contributor to crisis mitigation and broader economic development within the Pacific? 3.86. The Pacific Island countries will have to manage their economies over 2009, 2010, and into 2011 in turbulent conditions and with unusually high levels of uncertainty. Although short-term measures to mitigate negative consequences of the crisis are urgent, a longer-term perspective is also needed to make Pacific Island nations more resilient in the future. 3.87. Thinking beyond the current crisis, even a highly successful effort to protect the living standards of the Pacific\u2019s poorest will leave a reality in which poor people face multiple risks on a daily basis, well after the crisis has subsided. It is also important to remember that the current global economic crisis is not the only risk facing the region\u2014notably there is the ever present risk of natural disasters. Periods of stability are the exception rather than the rule and we can expect aggregate shocks to be an increasingly common feature of the global economic landscape. Therefore, designing policies to protect vulnerable families and children from shocks should be central rather than merely palliative, ad hoc, and peripheral to development strategies. Social protection mechanisms can prevent transient poverty in times of crisis. Recent experience in some Asian countries has shown that a social protection system can mitigate the impacts of crises by means of automatic stabilizers\u2014measures of support that automatically increase during times of crises or increased household vulnerability. 3.88. Policies to promote broad-based economic growth are fundamental to overall social development, but the benefits of growth do not automatically reach the poorest and most marginalized families; direct interventions are still required to reach the socially and economically excluded. Increases in national expenditure on the social sector and social protection in particular do not impede economic growth. On the contrary, if strong government investment is made in high return interventions (see Table 7) alongside well-designed social protection programs, this investment can boost economic growth and improve its pro-poor quality. It is sometimes said that social progress can be served by economic progress, but the reverse is equally true\u2014economic growth can be spurred on by advances in social policy. Pacific Island country policymakers need to seize this opportunity to build political support for initiating new or widening the coverage of existing social protection programs and embed them within national budgets. Although countries in the region differ in their needs and in their technical and fiscal capabilities, there is much to be gained by exchanging information about various experiences and creating opportunities for technical cooperation in the design and implementation of social protection programs that transcend national borders. Social protection systems should become permanent features, dealing simultaneously with crises as well as taking on a central role in national poverty-reduction strategies. Such a move recognizes that most of the impacts of external shocks are exacerbated by deeper structural problems of under- development. Developing such social protection systems is akin to investing in projects to enhance the long-term sustainability of economic growth. Consequently, creating and strengthening social protection systems should be an important priority for governments, donors, regional and UN agencies, the private sector, and civil society partners in the Pacific. Social protection can also build strong social foundations, making societies more crisis-resilient. Pacific Island governments can use this crisis to jump-start a reorientation of the development paradigm, with social protection at the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ed43db5-4037-40e4-833b-34f4f530800a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ed43db5-4037-40e4-833b-34f4f530800a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting Pacific Island Children & Women during Economic and Food Crises", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e7f5d2bc90170a9bd3505c556bd2faee7354744ec64eba2fc5f8b191dde5abcd"}, "3": {"node_id": "f8f6f11d-85aa-493c-bfc6-a66016fc177f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "463072d4580135614a472a7bb60f36ac0069b893effebca65472ba5505f1d547"}}, "hash": "42d7daf4c333cb2cb2011b5068c301361d5d9c082b0d3e2497dc63bb931b8aba", "text": "heart of a more inclusive and sustainable pattern of economic growth in the region. 287 Lokshin, M. and Ravallion, M.

Development partners play a vital role\u2014sustain aid flows and improve aid quality. The primary response to the current must be from Pacific Island countries themselves. Important domestic policy responses include targeted spending to protect the poor, exchange rate flexibility to facilitate adjustment, and vigilant financial supervision. But some countries may be too overwhelmed by the deterioration of fiscal and external balances. For such countries, aid-led response packages will play a critical role in avoiding severe hardship. However, effective assistance requires more than just cash; stronger national capacities for aid management are also essential as are donor commitments to the principles of the Paris, Pacific, and Accra aid coordination agenda. To be effective, such resources need to be delivered quickly and with flexibility. Maintaining aid flows will be critical in order to enable governments to increase or maintain their budgets for basic services and the protection of children and women. National governments that maintain aid commitments can help mitigate the negative effects of the economic downturn in the Pacific, prevent countries from slipping into poverty traps, and ensure progress towards national and Millennium Development Goals. Regional institutions such as the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community can be a powerful force in providing advice as well as bringing countries together. 3.90. Within such an aid environment, there is a real danger that children\u2019s rights to survival, development and protection will become less visible.289 In entering into new aid packages (loans, grants, etc.), Pacific Island countries must ensure that they continue to prioritize the basic services that their children and women need. The international development community must come forward and offer technical and financial assistance to ensure that the best interests of the child and women are protected. Donors should consider setting conditions, for example, requiring that governments protect core social expenditures for children and women (perhaps on a multi-year basis). The European Union\u2019s linking of human rights, including child rights protection to preferential trade status agreements, is a possible model of good practice to ensure that children\u2019s rights are sufficiently prioritized in aid packages.290 In addition, budget support provided could appropriately include sunset clauses, so that from the outset it is regarded as a temporary, specific response to the global economic crisis.291 3.91. The role of community-based and civil society organizations and the private sector, as service providers and advocates, comes to the fore particularly at times of crisis. Governments should recognize this role and use the assets they provide to the full. We noted earlier that networks of volunteers and committees in many of the poorest communities could be mobilized to monitor children, women and families at risk and report to local government services if they are in a position to respond appropriately. Scouts, guides, youth clubs, faith-based organizations, sports clubs, etc. could be considered for an enhanced role in protecting children and women. Non-Government Organizations that operate in the donor arena can also assist the relief efforts by developing awareness campaigns, securing additional funding to meet the challenges, and continuing their vital work to provide both development and humanitarian assistance. The private sector through protection of labour, skills training programs, involvement in workfare initiatives, enhanced corporate social responsibility and private regulation should be seen as a vital crisis response partner. 289 Harper, C. et al.

A strong policy response may not avoid all the negative consequences, but it can mitigate the impact. The future of Pacific Island countries depends critically on whether and to what extent children, young people and women are protected from adverse shocks and human capital is strengthened. Social budgeting and social protection will be critical in order to: (i) shield poor households and vulnerable children and women from the worst effects of these shocks; (ii) prevent the gains already made from being eroded; (iii) help to break the cycle of poverty; and (iv) to safeguard Pacific Island countries\u2019 future economic growth and human development. There is a strong moral imperative to advance children\u2019s rights. Empirical evidence also suggests that investments in children and women in good times as well as to protect them during periods of economic volatility and crises are eminently affordable and provide strong social and economic returns. Social budgeting and social protection need serious rethinking not just in light of the present crisis but also to prepare for future aggregate shocks which are sure to come. 3.93. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The survival, protection and development of all Pacific Island children and their potential to lead quality lives ultimately depend on us prioritising their needs and ensuring that the environment can sustain their basic human rights as they grow to adulthood. By 2015, an additional 5,600 Pacific children under five could have died if the crisis persists; about the same number of all reported child deaths in all natural disasters occurring in the Pacific since 1950 (excluding Timor-Leste). We respond energetically and passionately to natural disasters that take young Pacific lives. We are about to be confronted by an economic tsunami that could claim just as many if not more children\u2019s lives as well as cause irreparable damage to the social fabric of Pacific Islands for years to come. The future of Pacific Island children and women hangs in the balance. Summary 3.94. Part 3 has promoted a framework for real-time monitoring of the social impacts of the economic crisis in Pacific Island countries and outlined immediate action that can be taken in the health, education, and social welfare sectors. It concluded by considering social protection to help aid recovery and to mitigate the impacts of future crises on Pacific Island children and women. The following points can be summarized: \u2022 If ever there was a time for Pacific Island governments to improve their leadership, governance, and resource management, it is now. Only by putting in place measures that raise the levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of public services, will governments be able to pursue policies that adequately protect children and women. \u2022 While each country must pursue a policy framework relevant to its own context, the broad regional focus will likely need to be at least threefold: maintain macro-economic fundamentals; protect social budgeting and budget for social protection; and undertake strategic long-term investments in physical and human capital. \u2022 Although there are a number of countries that could take action alone to overcome the worst of the crisis, no one country can comprehensively address and recover from this economic downturn on its own. Policies that enhance regional coordination and enable the Pacific region to become progressively crisis-resistant are needed. \u2022 There is a clear need for policy prioritization. Given the limited resources to formulate and then implement improved public policy as well as the diversities across the Pacific, existing crisis- response and recovery policies can be made more child- and women-focused. \u2022 While it is important that all governments protect budgets for children and women, and that donors maintain their Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) commitments, ODA will be most effective if it is focused on countries which face the greatest vulnerability. Based on a combination of indicators, should the crisis response be ineffective, it is probable that a large number of children and women in Solomon Islands and Kiribati are likely to face extreme challenges. Many children and women in the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji Islands, the Republic of Marshall Islands, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu are also likely to face substantial challenges should responses be ineffectual. Some children and women in Cook Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau and Tokelau will also be at further risk if crisis responses are unsuccessful.

Investment needs to be made in better early warning Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises: Working Edition One for advocacy, debate and guidance 68 poverty and vulnerability data systems for rapid release of quantitative and qualitative indications of the impacts of the crisis on poor people. The first purpose of real-time social impact monitoring should be to identify the most vulnerable children and women before they are exposed to further risks that will affect their well-being. The second purpose should be that monitoring leads to just-in- time policy formulation and program action followed by timely feedback to policy-makers. A monitoring framework (see Annex 1) is proposed to help identify adverse changes happening at the community level with a focus on the most susceptible groups across health, food and nutrition, education, and other social dimensions. \u2022 In several Pacific Island countries, there are networks of volunteers, committees and community- based groups in many of the poorest communities that could be mobilized to provide community vigilance of children, women and families at risk. Routine visits by government staff could be used to monitor families at risk. Where resources and capacities allow, crisis hotlines or other novel reporting mechanisms (e.g., SMS, email) could be established if considered useful. \u2022 Monitoring social expenditures (inclusive of health, education, and welfare) will be vital. A simple measure would be to benchmark the overall annual budget\u2019s strategic intent as regards social expenditure\u2014to \u201cincrease\u201d, \u201cmaintain\u201d or \u201creduce social spending\u201d. \u2022 Just as there have been calls for an early warning system for the economy at the International Monetary Fund, an early-warning system\u2014a Pacific Hardship Alert System (linked to the proposed Global Impact and Vulnerability Alert System (GIVAS))\u2014could be considered to provide real-time data so that governments can act in time to make a real difference for children and women. The objective of a Pacific Hardship Alert System could be to provide early indications of how an external shock, like the current economic crisis, is affecting the economic, social and political welfare of the most marginalized populations and countries within the Pacific. By analyzing both exposure and resilience of Pacific Island populations to the changing environment, the Pacific Hardship Alert System might also have the capability to signal emerging vulnerabilities. To maintain such a system within the Pacific will require resources and collaboration between organizations with complementary fields of expertise but start-up resources have already been mobilized and collaboration has already commenced. \u2022 International organizations, donors, and national governments need to work together to ensure that recommendations for dealing with the economic crisis do not include, or result in, reduced spending on child priorities (such as basic health care, nutrition, child protection, clean water, education, social protection schemes). Governments have at least three options as regards social budgeting during the current crisis: \u201cincrease\u201d, \u201cmaintain\u201d or \u201creduce social expenditure\u201d. \u2022 Increasing investments in children is a bold, innovative move. This crisis presents an opportunity for Pacific Island countries to address long-standing barriers to progress for children. Ministries of Finance need strong arguments that demonstrate the economic benefits from investment in children. At least three points can be made: o First, programs to invest in children and policy interventions to protect them during periods of economic volatility provide strong social and economic returns on investment. More than 50 analysts including eight of the world\u2019s most distinguished economists and five Nobel Laureates have produced a list of the top 30 most economically productive investments to solve major development challenges. Fourteen out of the 30 directly relate to children and women: micronutrient supplements for children (vitamin A and zinc); micronutrient fortification (iron and salt iodization); expanded immunization coverage for children; deworming and other nutrition programs at school; lowering the price of schooling; increasing and improving girls\u2019 schooling; community\u2010based nutrition promotion; providing support for women\u2019s reproductive role; malaria prevention and treatment; rural water supply; conditional cash transfers; HIV combination prevention; total sanitation campaign; and microfinance. It is essential also to focus on other major irreversabilities: if children are subject to neglect or violence and/or pushed into work, they live with the consequences for their whole life, sometimes passing the consequences onto their own children. Promoting a protective environment for children through improved legislation, strengthened social welfare services and justice systems, and societal behaviour change is fundamental.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8203f47b-c97f-4acd-88f3-a2f2e0ded10c": {"__data__": {"id_": "8203f47b-c97f-4acd-88f3-a2f2e0ded10c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting Pacific Island Children & Women during Economic and Food Crises", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "790c8d3daabf110938a5b28bcff7447002b20794559ae885ce7fe81d502b018c"}, "2": {"node_id": "570a3f38-5b67-443e-ad75-d341b6d25ab6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5cd0148e30a34f33aeb2e6b35e91f4caf463e9caeaee9681745b6a076b0e30fa"}}, "hash": "513443742abe8cfb32ee26638cedcb3a25780495438aac031fed810fa1a475e7", "text": "Many Pacific Island countries have policies and mechanisms that are delivering some if not most of these programs and interventions.

If they can, these responses are good for children and for development\u2014they yield high returns in terms of containing current and future poverty\u2014and should be enacted quickly. o Second, the resources needed for scaling up interventions for children are moderate. For example, UNICEF, the World Bank and UNESCO estimate that for no more than $2,200 per child, we could not only save a young child from death, but we could also help him or her Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises: Working Edition One for advocacy, debate and guidance 69 complete basic education by the age of 13, with better earnings accruing to families in the long-term and large benefits to society as a whole. o Third, investing in children to help them realize their full human potential in times of economic growth and in times of crisis is a moral imperative. Access to health care, education, water, sanitation, nutrition, protection from violence and abuse, is an entitlement in its own right. \u2022 Maintaining social sector budgets is a steady, pro-child move. Programs that support and protect children through basic health care and nutrition, clean water, basic education and child protection services should be maintained to avoid planting the seeds of poverty for future generations. Efforts to maintain government social expenditure as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), or as a proportion of total government expenditure, do not guarantee that pro-poor services will be protected. The focus should be to help finance a specific set of services for the poorest and vulnerable people, protect expenditures on a per capita basis and in real terms, and where possible, fund existing, well-targeted and sustainable social protection programs. \u2022 Reducing social expenditure is a conservative but potentially reformative move. The crisis may create opportunities to initiate and lock in reforms that will improve the performance of the public sector over the long term. Most Pacific economies can locate expenditures or revenue leakages in their budget that can be cut back and allocated to better uses or where better returns on investments can be made. Rationing decisions may be unavoidable but inadequately analyzed reductions in public spending on social infrastructure and services are likely to hurt poor households and children most. Ministries need to identify and agree on core areas, services and activities to be fully protected. Greater efficiency should be seen as a stimulus for smarter, more effective ways of working, not as another word for \u201ccuts\u201d. \u2022 There is a need to focus on girls and women. Restricting women\u2019s access to work, education and health services, especially in times of crisis, comes at significant economic costs. Among the greatest gender challenges in the Pacific are the low percentage of women in wage employment in the non-agricultural sector and the low representation of women in decision-making, especially at political level. The crisis calls for creative solutions to address gender gaps. Sound gender-based policies are more important than ever when resources are scarcer. \u2022 Macro-economic policy calibration and analysis assumes that policies are gender-neutral but they are usually gender-blind. Policy responses which build on women\u2019s roles as economic agents and their preference for investing resources in child well-being can go a long way towards mitigating the negative effects of the current and future economic crises. These responses are good for women and for development\u2014they yield high returns in terms of containing current and future poverty\u2014and should be enacted quickly. \u2022 A lot could be achieved with fairly low-cost, high-return interventions\u2014but it requires the vision and commitment at the highest political level. Some of these interventions include making secure access for girls to schools, providing separate toilets and wash areas for girls, and allowing more women to enter the teaching profession. Providing free lunch at school for children and special nutritional packages for pregnant women will go a long way in improving their health. Mobile clinics in remote areas and community-based emergency transport could drastically reduce maternal and infant deaths. Educating girls yields some of the highest returns of all development investments. Micro- credit schemes are a lifeline for women and need special protection. \u2022 There remains a huge untapped labour potential of women and efforts must be made to provide every woman with the opportunity of decent employment. Fiscal stimulus packages as well as labour and trade policies need to be engendered. Large public infrastructure and public work projects are common features in all stimulus packages and should incorporate gender dimensions. It is important to look at the effect of trade liberalization through the prism of gender, focusing on its effects on overall growth, labour", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7723f130-fbdb-4743-a1e5-9e94560afcb4": {"__data__": {"id_": "7723f130-fbdb-4743-a1e5-9e94560afcb4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting Pacific Island Children & Women during Economic and Food Crises", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5b195c5b0a88bc4365dccac1269c60bf9122e8cadd335b7039bc2561ebe5396"}}, "hash": "d5b195c5b0a88bc4365dccac1269c60bf9122e8cadd335b7039bc2561ebe5396", "text": "markets, and access to credit. Appropriate gender-sensitive financial incentives and regulatory frameworks are also needed to support both agricultural development and renewable energy goals. \u2022 This is also an appropriate time to increase the ratification and improve the application of international instruments regarding gender discrimination such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the four key ILO gender equality Conventions. \u2022 Pacific Island countries are well known for their informal, community or family-based systems of social support and reciprocity. Pacific communities have developed resilience to adversity through such systems. Traditional safety nets, however, can break down when confronted by a large external shock. Some researchers suggest these support mechanisms in the Pacific are indeed weakening in the face of the crisis, especially amongst the urban poor. Remittances from family members living Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises: Working Edition One for advocacy, debate and guidance 70 overseas\u2014a major part of informal social protection\u2014are also declining. Even if informal safety nets were not being damaged, their important existence should not stall earnest consideration of establishing state-run social protection systems and urgent efforts to improve those formal programs that already exist. \u2022 It is now generally agreed that formal social protection\u2014broadly defined as a set of policy initiatives that transfer income or assets to the poor, protecting vulnerable people against livelihood shocks, and seeking to enhance the social status and rights of the marginalized\u2014is an essential element of pro-poor growth. Several robust evaluations have demonstrated that if well designed, social protection plays a crucial role in alleviating social hardship. \u2022 Faced by the economic crisis, climate change impacts including decreasing food security, and the threat that high food and commodity prices may return, perhaps the question is not whether the Pacific can afford to support social protection initiatives; rather whether the region can afford not to? Social protection must be a priority consideration in this current crisis; the more severe the downturn, the greater the consideration. It is crucial to note that social protection policies have emerged as core elements of long-term poverty reduction strategies, rather than ad hoc crisis-driven initiatives. \u2022 There is a wide range of available social protection instruments from which governments can choose depending on their administrative capacity, resource availabilities, and target populations including: conditional or unconditional cash transfers, direct distribution of food or nutritional supplements, school- based feeding programs, childcare support, maternal/paternal benefit payments, disability allowance, education bursaries, fee waivers, pensions, unemployment benefits, price subsidies, agricultural inputs, public works programs, health insurance, asset insurance, life insurance, and microfinance. \u2022 Ideally, social protection should be in place before a crisis occurs since it can address the needs of the poor in good economic times and be adaptable to combat the effects of crisis, but there are examples where countries have used a crisis as an entry point to initiate social protection. \u2022 Existing social protection programs that target the structurally poor (i.e., those poor before the economic crisis) do not always have a clear mechanism to deal with the \u201cnew poor\u201d (i.e., those near poor pushed into poverty by the economic crisis). It is important that social protection programs remain responsive to changes in the need for assistance. \u2022 Establishing social protection programs can depend on the relative priority given to social sector programming in general and the extent to which poverty is recognized and identified as a priority concern. Starting and sustaining social protection programs is a highly contextual process where ideas, ideology and politics may matter more than data. \u2022 The Pacific region does have some experience with formal social protection programs. The Asian Development Bank has developed a Social Protection Index (SPI) and recently assessed eight Pacific Island countries to determine their SPI.292 The Pacific Island country with the highest SPI in the ADB study is Cook Islands; the lowest is Papua New Guinea.

Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises: Working Edition One for advocacy, debate and guidance 71 \u2022 Where adequate social protection programs exist then their coverage should be expanded and their targeting improved in the short term through the adoption of simple targeting methods focusing, for example, on: (i) geographic characteristics; (ii) family size and housing conditions; and (iii) categories of the most vulnerable populations such as those living with disabilities and elderly living alone. \u2022 The departure point for many Pacific Island countries, however, will likely be from a weak or non- existent social protection system. Where political leadership is strong, the current economic crisis provides an opportunity to create formal social protection from scratch. \u2022 If starting from scratch and depending on national and sub-national administrative capacities and resources, some social protection schemes to consider are: In-kind Transfers (e.g., therapeutic foods, long-lasting insecticidal bed-nets, etc.), School Feeding Programs, Poll Transfers (targeted or untargeted), Conditional Cash Transfers (targeted or untargeted), and Workfare Programs (for young people in particular). Single schemes such as these, even if well designed and managed, are most effective when part of a comprehensive and transformative social protection system. Basic social services must also be improved where they are weak, legislation that promotes children\u2019s and women\u2019s rights must be strengthened where these rights are denied or compromised, and societal attitudes and practices must be changed where they are harmful to children and women. Just getting started may require Pacific Islands with weak or no formal social protection programs to adopt a phased approach, perhaps starting with a Workfare or social transfer program (cash or in-kind), and bringing further schemes on stream when real-time monitoring indicates and the situation allows. \u2022 Too much haste may lead to poorly designed social protection programs that may become a drain on fiscal positions and can give rise to \u201cpoverty traps\u201d when people are encouraged to \u201cstay poor\u201d by the availability of assistance. Nevertheless, the success of Indonesia\u2019s National Safety Net Program demonstrates that it is possible for governments to rapidly launch a massive social protection response in a crisis and improve it as the program proceeds. \u2022 There is a strong case to be made for children to be put at the centre of formal social protection systems. Reaching the most vulnerable children will be critical in the effectiveness of policies to break the cycle of poverty. In the Pacific, children (under 18 years of age) comprise almost half of the population and are over-represented among the poor. Children and young people will constitute a large section of the population for some time to come. Children are practically and legally less able to make these vulnerabilities visible and to claim their rights without support, and unable to take legal action in the case of abuse. A number of principles that can be applied to make formal social protection more child-centred. \u2022 Integrating child protection mechanisms into social protection packages at a time of crisis is vital. Possible synergies include: (i) integrating child protection issues (e.g. no tolerance of child labour) into cash transfer conditionalities; (ii) using interactions with program beneficiaries to raise awareness about child protection vulnerabilities; (iii) supporting the development of a single registry system so that the well-being outcomes of children receiving transfers can be better monitored and supported by cross-agency services; and (iv) linking child abuse referral systems to the implementing office", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f55af7ed-7311-4ae0-a037-74813c6e394c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f55af7ed-7311-4ae0-a037-74813c6e394c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protecting Pacific Island Children & Women during Economic and Food Crises", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/protecting-pacific-island-children-women-during-economic-and-food-crises", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0313b6e840bc7570bdc991c244e87ce9ce913bf4357a15b61f1342c128a17d6b"}}, "hash": "0313b6e840bc7570bdc991c244e87ce9ce913bf4357a15b61f1342c128a17d6b", "text": "of cash transfers or workfare programs. \u2022 Governments must focus on macro-economic fundamentals to create fiscal space to fund social protection. Establishing new or expanding existing social protection programs may also be an area where donors can provide valuable support. Tax-based social protection may become a viable option for Pacific Island countries to pursue in the longer-term. The World Bank\u2019s decision to launch a new Vulnerability Finance Facility to help mobilize more funding to protect the poorest is welcome. The budgetary cost of establishing permanent social protection programs need not be very high and could well bring longer-term efficiency gains to the economy. A recent ADB study showed that eight Pacific Island countries currently spend around 4.5% of their GDP on social protection but have scope to become far more cost-effective. Cost-benefit analyses also reveal that social protection programs could actually pay for themselves. \u2022 Although short-term measures to mitigate negative consequences of the crisis are urgent, a longer- term perspective is also important in order to make Pacific Island nations more resilient in the future. The current global economic crisis is not the only risk facing the region\u2014notably there is the ever present risk of natural disasters. Periods of stability are the exception rather than the rule and we can expect aggregate shocks to be an increasingly common feature of the global economic landscape. Recent experience in some Asian countries has shown that a social protection system can mitigate the impacts of crises by means of automatic stabilizers\u2014measures of support that automatically increase during times of crises or increased household vulnerability. \u2022 Policies to protect vulnerable families and children from shocks should be central rather than merely palliative, ad hoc, and peripheral to development strategies. Increases in national expenditure on the Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises: Working Edition One for advocacy, debate and guidance 72 social sector and social protection in particular do not impede economic growth. On the contrary, if strong government investment is made in high return interventions alongside well-designed social protection programs, this investment can boost economic growth and improve its pro-poor quality. Pacific Island country policymakers need to seize this opportunity to build political support for initiating new or widening the coverage of existing social protection programs and embed them within national budgets. \u2022 The primary response to the current must be from Pacific Island countries themselves but some countries may be too overwhelmed by the deterioration of fiscal and external balances. For such countries, aid-led response packages will play a critical role in avoiding severe hardship. However, effective assistance requires more than just cash; stronger national capacities for aid management are also essential as are donor commitments to the principles of the Paris, Pacific, and Accra aid coordination agenda. Within such an aid environment, there is a real danger that children\u2019s rights to survival, development and protection will become less visible. In entering into new aid packages (loans, grants, etc.), Pacific Island countries must ensure that they continue to prioritize the basic services that their children and women need. The international development community must come forward and offer technical and financial assistance to ensure that the best interests of the child and women are protected. The European Union\u2019s linking of human rights, including child rights protection to preferential trade status agreements, is a possible model of good practice to ensure that children\u2019s rights are sufficiently prioritized in aid packages. \u2022 The role of community-based and civil society organizations and the private sector, as service providers and advocates, comes to the fore particularly at times of crisis. Governments should recognize this role and use the assets they provide to the full. 3.95. The negative impact of the global economic crisis on Pacific Island children and women is not inevitable. A strong policy response may not avoid all the negative consequences, but it can mitigate the impact. The future of Pacific Island countries depends critically on whether and to what extent children, young people and women are protected from adverse shocks and human capital is strengthened. Social budgeting and social protection need serious rethinking not just in light of the present crisis but also to prepare for future aggregate shocks which are sure to come. 3.96. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The survival, protection and development of all Pacific Island children and their potential to lead quality lives ultimately depend on us prioritising their needs and ensuring that the environment can sustain their basic human rights as they grow to adulthood.

We are now confronted by an economic tsunami that could claim just as many if not more children\u2019s lives as well as cause irreparable damage to the social fabric of Pacific Islands for years to come. The future of Pacific Island children and women hangs in the balance. We must place them at the centre of our concerns. Pacific Island governments can use this crisis to jump-start a new development paradigm, one in which social expenditure on children and women is at the heart of a more inclusive and sustainable pattern of economic growth in the region. Unquestionable evidence exists that investing in children and women is very, very smart economics. Protecting Pacific Island children and women during economic and food crises: Working Edition One for advocacy, debate and guidance 73 Annex 1: Some guiding principles of real-time social impact monitoring and a possible indicator framework Box 16: Principles of real-time monitoring of social impacts on children and women in the Pacific \u2022 Relevance to national context\u2014indicators and data sources should relate to crisis impact transmission channels and specific child- and women-vulnerabilities as known in country. \u2022 Direct linkage to policy action\u2014data and analysis must inform policy response and assist with policy evaluation. Within resources and capacities available, there must be rigorous analyses to refine policy needs and identify additional data/information needed. It will be important for governments to continue, if not, strengthen existing policy and program monitoring and assessments to make sure policies and programs are working and not increasing risk or having negative effects. \u2022 Use existing systems/datasets\u2014wherever feasible, reliance on existing administrative systems, social service staff networks, and sub-national and national capacities should be encouraged. Where these systems, networks and capacities are weak, they should be supplemented and strengthened. Using or adapting existing systems can: reduce the risk of misunderstandings in interpretation of results and policy responses; reduce risk in project initiation costs and delay; provide cost-effective long term as well as short term outputs for policy development and evaluation; can provide for future scaling up and down as circumstances change; and can build local capacity for future similar situations. To function in crisis monitoring mode, it may be that existing monitoring systems/ datasets simply require: more analysis and reporting of current data; speeding up in the development, enumeration, and output cycle; expanded content; and/or increased data collection frequency. The problems of using existing systems/datasets, however, need to be carefully balanced against the benefits. There may be costs involved in dovetailing or augmenting existing systems. For example, all available resources (staff, capacity, time and funds) may already be committed. There will be a need to manage expectations with emerging new poverty measures (the same is true if new monitoring systems are to be established)\u2014especially in early implementation period (e.g., communities may expect new services or additional support that cannot be delivered). There may be reservations about the need to rework existing policy or revise previous trends based on the new data. And it must be remembered that even large administrative data systems and representative sample surveys (existing or new) are not universal in coverage and can and will miss hot spots. Existing data platforms, however, can be used to build a sensible sampling frame for constructing an insightful picture of the impact of the crisis. They also provide valuable baseline information against which to compare real-time monitoring indicator levels. \u2022 If a new monitoring system is needed, consider existing pilot schemes\u2014if there are pilot social impact monitoring systems already in place (such as Community-Based Monitoring Systems (see 3.22), food security monitoring, periodic labour surveys, youth health surveys, etc.), these should be investigated to see if they can be taken to scale or their frequency increased to provide useful policy input as necessary. If a new source of monitoring data is deemed necessary, then it must be: clear in what it adds to the existing system; very quick and relatively easy to initiate and sustain; and be positioned relative to existing/ alternative measures to limit confusion and increase acceptance of policy decisions. \u2022 Use of existing institutions\u2014wherever feasible, national statistics offices, social data focal points in Ministries, and national research institutions should be directly involved (including a role in accelerating retrieval of information), and if not, their technical or managerial oversight function should be formally established. \u2022 Credibility\u2014within the resources and capacities available, real-time monitoring should use valid and reliable methodologies, draw upon informative if not representative sampling strategies, and provide timely data for policy action purposes.

July 2008 ii Solomon Islands: Analysis of Poverty from 2005/2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence This analysis of the household income and expenditure survey has been undertaken with the support of technical assistance provided by the UNDP Pacific Centre in Fiji. The report and analysis is one in a series of national poverty reports that are being compiled cooperatively between national statistics offices, SPC, ADB and UNDP Pacific Centre based on recent Household Income and Expenditure Surveys (HIES). The work in Solomon Islands benefited from support and technical inputs from the Solomon Islands Government Statistician, Nick Gagahe, who guided the analysis. In the National Statistics Office the primary collaborators were Willington Piduru, Deputy Government Statistician; Douglas Kimi, Chief Statistician (Social); Dever Reggie, Chief Statistician (Surveys and Census); Joachim Gaiafuna, Chief Statistician (Economics); Andrew Kakate, Principal Statistician (Economics); and Anna Luvu, Senior Statistician (CPI) who were responsible for coordinating and supervising the general conduct of the surveys and the processing of survey data. It was a pleasure to work with these staff of the National Statistics Office and the analysis has benefited from their insights, technical support and dedication. The support and encouragement of the Hon Minister for Finance and Treasury and the Permanent Secretary for Finance (Economic Reform, Budget and Statistics), Shadrach Fanega, is acknowledged with appreciation. Technical support was also provided by staff of the Statistics Programme at SPC, notably by Graeme Brown and Gerald Haberkorn, Regional Statisticians, as well as Chris Ryan and Greg Keeble and Kim Robertson, SPC/ADB Consultant to the Regional Poverty Programme. Valuable inputs and comments have been provided on working drafts of the paper by UN colleagues, notably Jean-Louis Rallu of UNFPA, Fiji and my colleagues at the UNDP Pacific Centre, especially Carol Flore, Jeff Liew, Roderic Evers and Kai Carter. The analysis also benefited from the insights of Michelle Llegu, Coordinator of the SPC/ADB Participatory Poverty Assessment. However, none of those who have contributed their advice and insights are responsible for any errors in the analysis presented here. This report and analysis of the poverty lines is not the end of the story; it focuses only on the \u201cheadline\u201d poverty lines and indicators and the broad characteristics of those in the lowest expenditure deciles. Further work is needed to make estimates of the poverty incidence of US$1 and US$2 per day for monitoring MDG 1. This is being done with assistance of both SPC and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It is hoped that this national poverty report and analysis will lead to further and more detailed investigation of some of the broader socio-economic aspects of the survey data enabling greater policy substance to be added to the key poverty indicators and characteristics. It is hoped that this will also further develop the various conclusions and hypotheses relating to poverty in Solomon Islands which are covered in this report.

Poverty as measured by national poverty lines is a relative measure of hardship. It assesses the basic costs of a minimum standard of living in a particular society and measures the number of households and/or the proportion of the population that are deemed to not be able to meet these basic needs. The costs and basic-needs for individual households may differ across the country from the urban to the rural areas. It is therefore necessary to analyse each of these specific regions to provide an understanding of the relative costs and standards of living of households and people living in the different parts of the country. 2. Poverty analysis is primarily concerned therefore with identifying within each society who the poor are, where they live and what are the characteristics that set these poor households apart from those that are better-off. In order to be able to develop targeted pro-poor poverty reduction or alleviation strategies it is necessary to try to understand why some are poor and others are not. Is the lack of education a common characteristic? Is the age, gender or employment status of the head of household a common factor? By analysing household income and expenditure data it is possible to begin to gain a better understanding of these issues and how they might be addressed in order to reduce hardship and poverty. 3.

Every country experiences some incidence of poverty, but the levels of incidence measured by national poverty lines are not directly comparable across countries. Thus two countries may have similar levels of relative poverty measured by national poverty lines but might have very different levels of absolute poverty. 5. The measurement of absolute poverty, enabling cross-country comparisons of the extent of poverty, is usually done through the estimating of the US$1 or US$2 per day PPP values used in Goal 1 of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Presently this measure of poverty cannot be estimated for Solomon Islands or Pacific Islands generally as the necessary PPP indices are not yet available; however estimates should be available in the near future enabling a more detailed cross country analysis to be made. Food and Basic Needs Poverty Lines 6. The Food Poverty Lines (FPL) for Honiara, provincial-urban and rural Solomon Islands households/families were calculated from the actual diary food expenditure patterns recorded for households in the lowest three-deciles of per capita adult-equivalent expenditure (p.c.a.e.).1 For Honiara HH, Honiara market prices were used to cost local foods, either own produce or purchased items. In the provincial urban and rural areas costs/values for local foods were based on householders\u2019 estimates of their worth. This resulted in the costs of local foods outside Honiara being much lower than in Honiara, by a factor of at least half, and in some cases by two-thirds. This reflects the fact that in the rural areas a far greater proportion of food is home grown and markets, as such, do not really exist. The food consumption costs so generated were then checked against the notional costs of the two minimally 1 1 For an explanation of this and other terms used in the analysis refer to the main report. 2 Solomon Islands: Analysis of Poverty from 2005/2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence nutritious, low-cost diets for Solomon Island rural and urban households originally developed by the SPC Nutrition Programme and the Solomon Island\u2019s Ministry of Health. 7. The weighted average Food Poverty Line (FPL) in 2005/06 for the country as a whole was estimated to be SBD182.87 (SBD32.59 per capita adult equivalent (p.c.a.e.) per week. For a Honiara household the weekly food poverty line was estimated to be SBD446.40 (SBD62.17 per p.c.a.e.) per week. For provincial urban households the corresponding food poverty line was SBD249.04 (equivalent to SBD42.33 p.c.a.e.) per week and for rural households SBD156.17 (SBD27.48 p.c.a.e.) per week. 8. The Basic Needs Poverty Line (BNPL), which includes an allowance for essential non-food expenditure has been estimated as a national average expenditure of SBD265.77 per household (SBD47.37 p.c.a.e.) per week, and SBD998.32 per week for a Honiara household (SBD139.04 p.c.a.e. per week). For provincial urban households the corresponding basic needs poverty line was SBD465.41 (equivalent to SBD79.11 p.c.a.e.) per week and for rural households SBD225.02 (SBD39.59 p.c.a.e.) per week. The amounts spent by households on non-food essentials varies widely between the regions. In Honiara households spent 24% more on non-food items each week as they did on food. In the rural areas in contrast food was the most important item in the budget (accounting for almost two-thirds of expenditure) with non-food basic needs expenditure amounting to only 44% of food expenditure. Thus, basic needs costs vary widely depending on household circumstances and are much higher in urban than in rural areas. The weekly per capita adult equivalent poverty lines are summarised in table ES1. Incidence of Poverty 9. The Incidence of Poverty has been estimated by calculating: a) the proportion of households, and b) the proportion of population which reported weekly per capita adult equivalent (p.c.a.e) expenditure less than the relevant food or basic needs poverty lines, see Table ES2 and Section 5. 10.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "108382e1-9b41-4aa3-95f3-008710f3a6b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "108382e1-9b41-4aa3-95f3-008710f3a6b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Solomon Islands Analysis of the 2005/06 HIES", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b44f0480fa1a765deb5fe4c7a1693e7b2c8eef25742becc4af78e40187d7d9d6"}, "2": {"node_id": "9e72687e-4467-4fc1-8bb9-e8f34c4ec1dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5d964fe8ea5e30b16d7bae4780e1db8b245797f8e4da8146be742071516155ce"}}, "hash": "7769a697ced5da92e0a760e710f2fd26cb708734d00b79b4f781fa53c32cbb0f", "text": "10. The average incidence of basic needs poverty, as measured by the Head Count Index (HCI) over all households, is estimated at 18.8%, accounting for 22.7% of the population.

In terms of population, the incidence of basic needs poverty is estimated to have affected 32.2% of the Honiara population and 13.6% of the provincial urban population. For the rural areas the rate of basic needs poverty was equivalent to 15.2% of households and 18.8% of the population. 11.

There are however many more households and individuals who have expenditure only just above the basic needs poverty line and who are therefore vulnerable. It is estimated that the approximately 18,500 rural people and 3,885 people in Honiara have expenditure no more than 10% above the rural and Honiara BNPL respectively. With rising prices and/or declining incomes/expenditure these people are highly vulnerable to slipping below the poverty lines. 12. Analysis of the provincial data suggests that the provinces with the highest proportion of poor households were Choiseul, Malaita, Makira and Temotu; essentially either those which are most remote or are the most densely populated. 13. On average, rural Solomon Islands households provided substantially more of their own food (58.6%) than those in both provincial urban areas (16.7%) and Honiara (8.5%). The greatest difference is found among HH in the lowest expenditure quintile: amongst rural families the proportion was 69% compared to 14.5% and 6.9% of provincial urban and Honiara HH, respectively. These figures reflect both the greater subsistence production and the levels of food security of rural households, as well as the general lack of organised markets in these areas; it also signifies the greater need for cash for food purchases in Honiara and the provincial-urban centres. 14. Households that appear to be the least disadvantaged in terms of the poverty line are those in provincial-urban centres, following are rural area households. Honiara on the other hand displays a much higher incidence of poverty. Figures suggest that although Honiara is a source of work and employment for many, there are, nevertheless, many households whose expenditure cannot cover the basic-needs costs of a reasonable minimum standard of living in the urban, cash-based environment. Depth and Severity of Poverty 15. The Poverty Gap Index (PGI), measuring the depth of poverty in Solomon Islands has been estimated at 7.5, which is similar to Tonga and Samoa and less than that estimated for Fiji or FSM. The Squared Poverty Gap Index (SPGI), which is a measure of the severity of poverty being experienced, is at 3.5 nationally. This suggests that Solomon Islands experiences a similar level of poverty severity as other regional countries including Fiji, FSM and Tonga, for which SPGI indices have been estimated in a similar manner. Income Distribution and Inequality 16. Figures indicate that inequality in Solomon Islands is relatively low within each of the three regions of Honiara, provincial-urban centres and the rural areas. The national population Gini Coefficient, which measures inequality by per capita income, averages 0.31 within each of the three regions. However, this measure is higher at the national level (0.39) as there are wide differences between expenditure levels in Honiara and rural areas which distorts the aggregate picture.

Educational Attainment 19. In rural areas 21.5% of household heads in the lowest three deciles have no education as compared with only 7.3% of those in the highest three deciles. In comparison, only 4.7% of the poorest HH and 1.7% of those in highest three deciles in Honiara have no education. In the poorest three deciles almost three-quarters of HH heads had no attainment beyond primary level. Of those HH heads with only primary level education there was little difference between the lowest and highest three deciles; in both groups the proportion was around 52%. In Honiara there was, however, a significant difference with 43.5% of the lowest three deciles and only 9.4% of the highest three deciles reaching only primary level. 20. Data suggests that the poor in Honiara are only one- third as likely to have post primary education as the better-off. Even against the overall average of Honiara HH the poorest are only half as likely to have progressed beyond primary level. In rural areas, the poorest HH are only half as likely to have gone beyond primary level compared with the average for all HH. Not surprisingly, the highest proportion with post-secondary education are found in the highest three deciles of urban HH heads. The rural areas are clearly disadvantaged in terms of attainment at post-secondary levels; even amongst the highest three expenditure deciles the proportion of HH heads attaining this level is only 11.6%. Economic Activity 21. Employment is a critical factor in being not-poor in Honiara, where 78.8% of all HH heads are in some form of full or part time employment; and even in the lowest three deciles the proportion is 75.6%. In contrast, in the rural areas 5 Solomon Islands: Analysis of Poverty from 2005/2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence only 16.6% of HH heads are in employment. This proportion falls to 9.5% for those in the lowest three deciles. This suggests of course that many of those in employment are earning less than the poverty line and may be described as the \u201cworking poor\u201d. The recent increase in the minimum wage to SBD4.00 per hour for non-agricultural workers and to SBD3.20 per hour for agricultural workers acknowledges these issues. 22. The lack of employment opportunities in the rural areas is reflected in the one-third of all HH heads engaged in production for home consumption (46.4% of those in the lowest three deciles). This compared to 2.3% in total and 4.6% of the lowest three decile HH heads in Honiara who were similarly engaged in home production. This validates the conclusion concerning the very low level of own consumption by Honiara HH, and despite the lower unit-values of rural own production, the much higher total value of own food production in the rural areas. 23. The level of unemployment is especially high in the rural areas where one-third of all males and all females in the lowest three deciles reported as being unemployed. In contrast only 4.9% of rural males and 1.5% of rural females reported as being in full time employment. In Honiara 32.0% of males in the lowest three deciles reported as working full time, as did 19.3% of all Honiara females. Energy Use 24. In both Honiara and rural areas, an open fire is the most popular form of energy use for cooking. Although gas and electricity are available in Honiara, 57.3% in the lowest three decile HH and 32.7% in the highest three deciles use open fires for cooking. This suggests that the cost of purchased fuel is a deterrent from its use and that firewood is easily accessible, either in markets or from own-collection. In the rural areas there is very little use of energy sources other than firewood and virtually all cooking is done this way in the poorest HH. Amongst the lowest expenditure households, in both Honiara and rural areas, kerosene is the most widely used power source for lighting. Water and Sanitation 25. Overall, an average 23.5% of HH in Solomon Islands use unsafe or unprotected water sources.

For inland rural HH, pits and many other \u201cnot improved\u201d forms are commonly used and therefore are a source of potential health problems. In Honiara many of the low decile households do not appear to have a satisfactory sanitation system with 50% using either a household pit or bucket. While around 40% of the lowest three deciles have access to a septic tank, for the very bottom decile the proportion is only around a quarter. Thus in Honiara there must be serious health concerns that in the lowest decile a significant proportion of households have neither safe water nor safe sanitation. These are likely to be in the peripheral squatter areas where conditions of living are poor and consequently health risks are high. Conclusions 27. Poverty in the Solomon Island context does not mean hunger or destitution, but rather struggling to meet daily/ weekly living expenses, particularly those that require cash payments. Families constantly have to make choices on a daily or weekly basis between the competing demands for household expenditure and the limited availability 6 Solomon Islands: Analysis of Poverty from 2005/2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence of cash income to meet that expenditure. Trade-offs are made between one bill and another, food or school fees, utilities or bus-fares. Households deemed to be experiencing basic needs poverty are therefore facing hardship on a daily basis. They struggle to pay bills and purchase adequate and suitably nutritious food. They borrow regularly from \u201cloan-sharks\u201d, who charge very high interest rates, for small unsecured loans to meet family commitments and community obligations. They are thus frequently, and occasionally constantly, in debt. 28. Urban drift, leading to higher levels of unemployment and growing numbers of people living in squatter settlements and sub-standard housing conditions, result in a deteriorating social environment. Many of the poor live in low-quality housing without proper access to water, sanitation and other basic services. Poor housing conditions lead to poor health, poor employment prospects, and poor education attainment. Children frequently miss school due to ill-health or because school fees have not been paid. Adults are frequently poorly educated and thus unable to get anything but the lowest paid and often casual employment, if such employment is even available. The cycle of poverty can therefore be perpetuated. 29. This analysis seeks to provide government with clearer, evidence-based indications of the extent and nature of poverty in Solomon Islands. It suggests policy issues and possible policy options to address these. Increased opportunities for employment or economic opportunity, not only in the urban centres but also in the rural areas, together with improved basic education are amongst the critical.

It also estimates indicators of the depth (Poverty Gap Index, PGI) and severity (Squared Poverty Gap Index, SPGI) of poverty in Solomon Islands and levels of income/consumption inequality through the Gini Coefficient. 3. It further provides an analysis of the broad characteristics of low-expenditure households in terms of their socio- economic status, demographics and level of household access to basic services. Together with the poverty indicators these provide a good indication of which households are the most disadvantaged in Solomon Islands, what common characteristics they might share and why they might be in this situation of disadvantage and hardship. Such information will be useful for government to define targeted policies and interventions to assist in alleviating their poverty and hardship. 4.

This report presents the first attempt to establish national poverty lines for Solomon Islands. It is therefore a benchmark analysis that provides a basis for both identifying policies and monitoring the impact of targeted pro- poor policies and strategies in the medium term development framework. Solomon Islands is a signatory to the Millennium Declaration and has endorsed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as key development targets for achievement by 2015 and support for which is an overarching goal of all the agencies that have contributed to this analysis. The better understanding of hardship and poverty in Solomon Islands afforded by this analysis will therefore help to integrate the core poverty reduction focus of the MDGs in to national strategies. The information and data contained in the HIES and in the analysis will contribute to an improved ability to monitor progress towards the goals. 8 Solomon Islands: Analysis of Poverty from 2005/2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence 6. This analysis of poverty and hardship in Solomon Islands is one of a series of national poverty reports being compiled cooperatively by national statistics offices, SPC, ADB and UNDP Pacific Centre based on the recent round of household surveys. These national reports benefit from a standard methodology as agreed at the SPC coordinated Regional Heads of Planning and Heads of Statistics Meeting held in Noumea in September 2007 and a subsequent technical workshop held in November. 2. Introduction 2.1 Defining Hardship and Poverty in the Solomon Island Context 7. Traditional Solomon Island society, as well as Pacific societies generally, embraces caring for and sharing with family and clan. As a result, there is a continuing belief that poverty cannot and should not be a part of normal life in the Pacific region. The suggestion that there might be poverty in some form is not, therefore, something that many people have been prepared to readily accept. Indeed, the usual images of poverty (starving children, landless peasants, and men and women toiling with ox ploughs) do not immediately spring to mind in relation to the Pacific or Solomon Islands. 8. While Solomon Islanders might not be well off in financial or material terms, their strong family and community ties have traditionally provided social safety nets for the most disadvantaged and vulnerable. However, the increasing monetisation of Pacific economies, the impact of television and internet, and increasing rural/urban migration leading to greater urbanisation, have begun to undermine these traditional structures. 9. As a consequence poverty and hardship, as now defined and understood in the Pacific, (see Section 2.2), are being increasingly accepted as concerns which need greater attention", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea4a8363-fd06-4406-a608-aa73661178b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea4a8363-fd06-4406-a608-aa73661178b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Solomon Islands Analysis of the 2005/06 HIES", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ec3e4b7f896fca8dd5530ab4065c3e44ff3de3b59b474b3159d5c27c6b86464"}}, "hash": "5ec3e4b7f896fca8dd5530ab4065c3e44ff3de3b59b474b3159d5c27c6b86464", "text": "from the development community. Some countries in the Pacific region, including Fiji Islands, Papua New Guinea (PNG), and Timor-Leste, have fully embraced the need to deal with increasing levels of hardship and poverty and their societal implications. Other countries, though perhaps not yet acknowledging hardship and poverty as serious issues, are nevertheless accepting that there are growing numbers of disadvantaged people who are being left behind as economic and social structures change in response to both external and internal developments. However, poverty and hardship must be seen as issues that are best dealt with before they become serious. 10. What does poverty mean then in the Solomon Island context? In so far as an internationally recognised \u201cofficial\u201d definition exists it is widely accepted as the US$1 per capita per day of Millennium Development Goal 1. But, as yet, this figure is not available for Solomon Islands (or Pacific countries generally) because the \u201cpurchasing power parity\u201d indices on which this definition is based are still being developed for the Pacific situation. Instead, for an income or expenditure based poverty indicator, we need to look at national basic-needs poverty lines. 11. National basic needs poverty lines are estimated from the cost of a minimally-nutritious, low-cost diet which delivers a minimum of 2100 calories (Kcal) per day plus adequate additional nutrition to provide a sound and balanced, but basic, diet. To this is added an amount for essential non-food expenditure (e.g. housing, transport, education, clothing, utilities) which is required to provide an overall basic needs standard of living. Households which have per capita incomes or expenditure below the basic needs poverty line are then deemed to be living in poverty. 9 Solomon Islands: Analysis of Poverty from 2005/2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence 12. Poverty is therefore measured at the household level; it is not possible to disaggregate poverty on an intra- household basis. Thus if the average per capita expenditure/income of a household falls below the poverty line then all members of that household are deemed to be equally poor, similarly if a household has an average per capita income/expenditure above the poverty line then none of the members are considered to be poor. 13. Data for estimating national basic needs poverty lines at the household level are becoming available as more surveys and analysis are undertaken to quantify the extent of hardship and poverty in Pacific societies. From the work which has been done to date it is estimated that, on average across the Pacific region, approximately one- in-four households have per capita expenditure/incomes below what would be considered as the basic needs poverty line in their respective countries. On this measure poverty is estimated to be highest in PNG (37.5%, 1996), Fiji (28.8% in 2002/03), Tuvalu (29.2% 2005) and in Port Vila, Vanuatu (27.2%, 2006) compared with the lowest in Tonga (22.3%, 2001), Samoa (20.3%, 2002), and Cook Islands (12.0%, 1998). 14. But poverty and hardship need to be defined in ways which are more easily understood in Pacific societies. Poverty means different things to different people at different times and in different places. This has given rise to much misunderstanding and confusion. Poverty can be either absolute as in the US$1 per day situation or it can be relative where people are disadvantaged compared to their neighbours in terms of national or localised regional poverty lines. This latter is the nature of hardship and poverty being estimated in this paper. In the Pacific it is often said that everyone is poor but no-one suffers poverty. In the sense of experiencing absolute poverty and destitution this is generally true. But within every society there are those who are more disadvantaged and poorer than others. 15. Poverty and hardship may be temporary and widespread because of the impact of a natural disaster or the affects of conflict situations. In the Solomon Islands these circumstances may have arisen as a result of the displacement of many people during \u201cthe tensions\u201d or during the recent tsunami in Western Province. It has also occurred in Fiji where many people have been displaced and suffered hardship as a result of the non-renewal of leases on their sugar-cane farms. Poverty and hardship may also be long-term, personal and chronic due to causes such as unemployment, sickness or disability. 16. Most discussions of poverty centre on its most extreme manifestations: absolute poverty and destitution. There are, however, many other ways in which people can be poor or can suffer hardship. Indeed people can be reasonably well fed and moderately healthy but still live in relative poverty and suffer varying degrees of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de456240-f710-4c13-abda-49ec2f4a2d43": {"__data__": {"id_": "de456240-f710-4c13-abda-49ec2f4a2d43", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Solomon Islands Analysis of the 2005/06 HIES", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49c26a57aeb8fbd643c8e9096edcb80b2fd9e0efbe63d64595ed5be366c0c995"}}, "hash": "49c26a57aeb8fbd643c8e9096edcb80b2fd9e0efbe63d64595ed5be366c0c995", "text": "hardship. Their incomes might be insufficient to meet their food and other basic needs. Additionally, they might lack access to basic services, such as water and sanitation or health and education facilities, freedom of choice, or socio- economic opportunities. This \u201cpoverty of opportunity\u201d 4 is just as important in defining the extent of poverty and hardship in a society as the lack of income. In fact, often the conditions and circumstances that give rise to poverty of opportunity (poor access to, or standards of, service delivery, poor governance, limited employment opportunities, and social exclusion) are the underlying causes of income poverty. 17. However defining poverty by level of cash income, or level of cash expenditure, alone might not be appropriate in the Pacific where most economies include high levels of subsistence production and own consumption, particularly in the rural areas. The current analysis takes account of this subsistence production/consumption by valuing it as part of both income and expenditure, thus providing a better picture of overall well-being, see Section 2.4. 4 First used in the Pacific context in the UNDP 1999 Pacific Human Development Report, defined as \u201cthe inability of people to lead the kind of lives they aspire to.\u201d 10 Solomon Islands: Analysis of Poverty from 2005/2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence 18. Household survey data on subsistence production also provides a sounder basis for estimating the non-monetary sector in national accounts. Historically in many countries, calculating the value of such subsistence production in the national income (gross domestic product) has not been complete; it may have been inadequately assessed in GDP estimates or occasionally it is missing entirely. The data now available from the HIES will help to rectify this situation to provide a better understanding of the importance of subsistence agriculture to livelihoods and to food security. 19. Overall in the past, data from censuses and HIES has often not been collected with poverty and hardship in mind, or has not been fully analysed for poverty indicators. There might also have been a lack of community participation in assessing poverty and hardship, and the socio-cultural aspects may have been ignored. This is now changing. There is a growing recognition of the importance of the data generated by HIES, both in terms of the information it can provide on poverty, but also the importance of accurately capturing subsistence production and consumption for national accounts purposes. 2.2 Poverty = Hardship: A Pacific Definition of Poverty 20. Recognising the importance of obtaining a \u201cpeople perspective\u201d on issues of hardship and poverty a series of Participatory Assessments of Hardship (PAH)5 were conducted by ADB in ten PICs, including Solomon Islands, over the period 2001 \u2013 2006. These involved extensive consultations with traditional leaders, focus groups, local CSOs and individuals throughout the various countries. Through these consultations a working definition of Pacific poverty, or perhaps more correctly \u201cHardship\u201d, was defined in Human Development terms as: An inadequate level of sustainable human development, manifested by: - a lack of access to basic services such as health care, education and clean water; - a lack of opportunities to participate fully in the socio-economic life of the community; and - a lack of access to productive resources and income generation support systems (rural credit ,capital, markets, skill) to meet the basic needs of the household, and/or customary obligations to the extended family, village community and/or the church. 21. The findings of the participatory assessments highlighted hardship and poverty as real issues in the lives of many people in both urban and rural areas, and on outer islands and atolls. The concerns of the people showed remarkable consistency not only between the urban and rural areas within each country, but also across the region. In other words, despite the wide differences in geography and resource endowments, and culture and ethnicity among the atoll states of Micronesia and the high islands of Melanesia and much of Polynesia, the concerns of the people were very similar. 22. The causes of hardship and poverty centre around the need for income, a reasonable standard of basic services, and skills to meet opportunities and challenges as they arise. These are the challenges which face governments and policy makers in framing national, sector and community level interventions aimed at alleviating the causes of hardship and poverty and achieving the MDGs. 23. Progress is now being made as planners, policy makers and statisticians come to realise the importance and benefits of both sound evidence-based policy making and the engagement of communities in the policy process. 5 RETAs 6002 , 6047 and 6157 covering FSM, Kiribati, Fiji, PNG,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27df3545-35c2-463c-b8bf-e2244eafb704": {"__data__": {"id_": "27df3545-35c2-463c-b8bf-e2244eafb704", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Solomon Islands Analysis of the 2005/06 HIES", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "44d8b71ea769020d7409b302d3b5c15da4b5f8a65699f7aaf782c2941dd244f1"}, "3": {"node_id": "f778c608-0468-4272-9b3c-0f0da916ba2b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "16dea518881663a5ef42760522d00401b131d1c258ec46017a456d6d576cd521"}}, "hash": "55f607ac493d0053d6a85870270d1f0c50c1c0aa519a84dfe3908b0baef9b1c8", "text": "RMI, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga ,Tuvalu and Vanuatu 11 Solomon Islands: Analysis of Poverty from 2005/2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence 2.3 What is the Poverty Line 24. The estimation of poverty lines and the incidence, depth and severity of poverty in society is not an exact science. There is considerable academic as well as empirical debate about the \u201cbest\u201d methodology. Box 1 summarises the view of the World Bank, one of the leaders in the debate on global poverty, its measurement and the development of policies and strategies to alleviate the hardship experienced by those who are poor. 25. Not withstanding the issues raised by the World Bank, the \u201cCost of Basic Needs\u201d method has been used in undertaking this analysis. This method has been used on similar analyses in other Pacific Island countries6 and elsewhere in the world and provides a sound and well-tested methodology. 2.4 Estimating the Poverty Line for Solomon Islands 26. Following the \u201cCost of Basic Needs\u201d methodology the estimation of poverty lines and, from them, the extent or Incidence of Poverty (IP) in Solomon Islands is a four step process: a) calculating the Food Poverty Line (FPL); b) estimating a non-food basic-needs component; c) combining the FPL with the non-food basic needs component gives an estimate of the Basic Needs Poverty Line (BNPL) ; and finally, d) estimating the Incidence of Poverty against the BNPL benchmark from the HIES data gives the Head Count Index (HCI) and other poverty indicators measuring inequality and the depth and severity of poverty between households. 27. The Basic Needs Poverty Line is therefore made up of two components: a) the cost of food and, b) the amount of expenditure required for essential non-food basic needs. It is therefore intended to represent the minimum expenditure per week, month or year that is required by an individual, household or family; firstly, to provide a basic, low-cost, minimally nutritious diet, (measured in terms of the minimum daily calorie intake required for basic human survival, which is internationally benchmarked at an average of around 2100 calories/day per capita7), termed the \u201cFood Poverty Line\u201d (FPL), and secondly, an additional amount which is required to meet the costs of purchasing essential non-food basic needs (e.g. housing/shelter, clothing, utilities, school fees, other education We define a poverty line as the monetary cost of achieving a standard of living above which one is not deemed to be poor. A poverty comparison assesses which of distributions (of an agreed indicator of living standards among members of a group) has more poverty on average. The groups can be regions or sectors of a country, the same population at different dates, or the same population observed with and without a policy change. A special case of a poverty comparison is a poverty file, in which groups of households defined by some characteristic (such as where they live) are compared at one date. The guiding principal in making a poverty comparison to inform policy is that it should be consistent with the policy objective. When that objective is to reduce poverty by increasing people\u2019s command over basic consumption needs, any two individual (at one date or at different dates) with same command over those needs should be treated identically. This requires that the poverty line should have a fixed purchasing power over relevant commodities. The cost-of-basic-needs method The cost-of-basic-needs method bases poverty lines on purchasing power over basic consumption needs. This achieves the desired consistency for the purposes of Bank Poverty Assessments. But putting this method into practice with imperfect data can be difficult. Once \u201cbasic needs\u201d are defined, we need to able to measure their cost over time and location. Setting basic needs requires and inherent value judgement, which often leads to disagreements. Also price data are often inadequate.

Those with expenditure below the BNPL are deemed to be in \u201cbasic-needs\u201d poverty. 29. In the Pacific region as a whole, many households, particularly in the rural areas, are able to provide a high proportion of their daily food needs from their own subsistence production (Tables 6 & 7); this is certainly true in Solomon Islands, see section 3.2.2. However, their ability to generate cash income for non-food basic needs is often very limited, albeit that in the rural areas the need for non-food expenditure may itself be low due to lack of access to shops and services. This, as the following analysis will attempt to illustrate, means that low rates of incidence of severe poverty (income/expenditure below the food poverty line) are seen along side quite high levels of basic-needs poverty. 30. Linked to this an analysis of dietary patterns and levels of reliance on either own-produced or purchased food between the urban and rural areas highlights important issues for consideration in relation to nutrition and food security. 31. The depth and severity of poverty between households and population in the different regions (Honiara, provincial- urban, and rural areas) can be estimated by using the Poverty Gap Index (PGI) and the Squared Poverty Gap Index (SPGI), Section 6.4. Estimates of inequality are made using the Gini Coefficients and expenditure distributions, Section 6.5. 3. The Household Income and Expenditure Survey 3.1 Survey Methodology 32. The 2005/06 HIES comprised a total of 3,822 households made up of samples8 of 433 Honiara HH, 486 provincial- urban HH and 2,903 rural households. These sample households represented a total of 86,734 households comprising 9,984 Honiara HH (4.8% sample), 2,505 provincial-urban HH (19.4% sample) and 74,246 rural HH (3.9% sample). 33. The survey results indicated a total estimated population of around 533,672. This was made-up of 69,189 (13% of total) in Honiara, 16,308 (3.0%) in the provincial-urban centres and 448,173 (84.0%) in the rural areas. This compares with the most recent 1999 population census of 409,042 and implies an average annual increase of around 10%. However, it is widely believed that there was significant under-counting in the 1999 census.9 34. Information was collected on both household income and expenditure, and included information on the production and consumption of home produced foods and other commodities. In the survey the value of subsistence production/consumption was valued in two ways. For the urban centre of Honiara the \u201copportunity 8 A stratified probability proportional to size (PPS) sample selection methodology was used based on national enumeration areas, see details in Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2005/06, National Report, Solomon Islands Statistics Office. 9 See Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2005/06; National Report (Part One) section 2.1, Solomon Islands Statistics Office, Honiara, September 2006 13 Solomon Islands: Analysis of Poverty from 2005/2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence cost\u201d of producing for own consumption was valued at the price recorded in the Honiara Consumer Price Index (CPI). For the rest of the country the value of production for own consumption was estimated on the basis of householders\u2019 valuations of what the items might be worth if sold locally. Since there are few organised markets in the rural areas, and thus no established price mechanism (and produce is often exchanged rather than sold), this tended to result in significant variations in estimated values between households. 35. A review of the rural valuations suggested that on average local produce has an \u201copportunity cost\u201d or \u201cshadow price\u201d of between one quarter and one half of the Honiara market price.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e9e0465-0e61-441d-86bc-312e6550344a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e9e0465-0e61-441d-86bc-312e6550344a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Solomon Islands Analysis of the 2005/06 HIES", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc9f0c3d0d14d7c378045e33c5d38296c4eef8a6b525d50a642769c931fef6f5"}, "2": {"node_id": "19bcda09-150f-40d9-ac8a-adf70d08b8b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4230638f726960664c46a80bc80e1d5d4dc130e150469752c034a9ad88495933"}}, "hash": "978c400dfaca0acd4e1d45b3d8f8ef3a81a3ac05d3c47572eabfd9c1080f2b2c", "text": "This had implications for the overall value of household expenditure between the Honiara and other regions and is reflected in the different levels of the food and basic-needs poverty lines between the regions. 36.

Support was provided to the conduct of the survey by SPC. 38. Whether data on income or expenditure is used as the basis for the calculation of the poverty line and incidence of poverty depends primarily in the perceived accuracy and reliability of the two data sources. In most cases expenditure data is usually regarded as the more reliable, see Box 2, although the choice between income and expenditure may rest primarily on the reliability criteria. In the Solomon Islands survey much more detail was available on expenditure and, in addition, recorded income was generally lower than recorded expenditure. This analysis therefore uses per capita household expenditure, adjusted for adult equivalence, 11 as the basis for the estimation of the poverty lines and incidence levels. All analysis in this paper, unless otherwise indicated, is therefore based on a household\u2019s adult equivalent per capita (p.c.a.e) weekly expenditure as recorded in the survey. 39. The detailed calculation of poverty lines and the estimation of poverty incidence has therefore been conducted on the basis of adult equivalent per capita household expenditure and the proportion of households and population deemed to have adult equivalent per capita expenditure below the food and basic needs poverty line levels. For the broader analysis of poverty characteristics the lowest three deciles of households has been used as the basis for detailed scrutiny. 3.2 Overview of HIES Results 3.2.1 Household Size and Adult Equivalence 40. In the survey the overall national average household size was reported as 6.2 (4.9 a.e). However for poor, low- expenditure households (for this purpose those with expenditure in the lowest three deciles) the average HH size was 7.0 (5.6 a.e), see Table 1. The largest average household size was found in Honiara where the lowest quintile HH had an average of 9.3 persons (7.6 a.e). 10 Analysis of Health Indicators from 2005/06 HIES, Ministry of Health & Ministry of Finance, Honiara, 2007. 11 Adult equivalents are derived from \u201cequivalence factors\u201d where children under the age of 15 years are counted as half an adult, thus a household with two adults and two children would be equivalent to 3 adult equivalents. This methodology has been adopted to take account of the downward bias that would otherwise occur in households with more children. 14 Solomon Islands: Analysis of Poverty from 2005/2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence 41. The table illustrates that over the three areas of Honiara, provincial-urban centres and the rural areas, the size of family and the number of children per HH declines with expenditure. This is a finding that is consistent with the situation in other parts of the Pacific region. Urban poor HH tend to be the largest and most disadvantaged, rural HH tend to be smaller, and better-off HH in all areas tend to be smaller in overall size and number of children. The characteristics of low-income/expenditure and poor households is discussed in more detail in Section 7. 3.2.2 Household Expenditure 42.

Where choice is available, researches have normally preferred consumption to income on the basis that the former is a better indicator of permanent income and standard of living of people due to consumption smoothing through savings and insurance opportunities. It has also been argued that it is easier to collect information from respondents on consumption that on income. Once a poverty line has been set and survey data are available, it is a simple matter to determine how many households or people are poor.\u2019 Unfortunately, the setting of poverty lines always involves some element of subjective methodological choice. The poverty line refers to a minimum level of living necessary for physical and social development of a person. A minimum level of living defined in monetary terms comprises both food and non-food components of consumption. An objective approach could, in principle, be adopted for computing minimum food expenditure, the dominant component in the total consumption bundle of the poor. However, non-food expenditure is clearly affected by social needs and the minimum on this count obviously differs from one society (or region) to another. \u2026. it is difficult to consider even the physical component of minimum needs entirely on an objective basis. Despite such problems, recent literature has grown substantially to define the absolute poverty line on a reasonably, although not completely, objective basis. Once the poverty line is defined, data are required on size distribution of income or consumption to compute the number and proportion of the population below the poverty line. Household income or consumption expenditure surveys are the principle source of such data\u2026.. ADB 2004b, pp 7 & 8 \u2026. Poverty lines are defined either in terms of income or consumption. In practice, this choice is restricted by the availability of household survey data since most countries collect data on either household income or consumption. A few countries \u2026 collect data on both income and consumption. Income is a better measure of opportunity for consumption than actual consumption in the case of households that save. But consumption might be a better measure of opportunity for poor households that save little or in fact dis-save. Most practitioners also prefer to define poverty in terms of total consumption expenditure because income data collection faces a wider range of measurement problems. Consumption is less affected by short-term fluctuations due to the consumption smoothing opportunities available to a household. Hence, total consumption expenditure is thought to be a better indicator of the permanent income of a household, particularly in an agrarian economy\u2026.. ADB 2004b, p 41 Box 2: National Poverty Lines; Income or Consumption The ADB Perspective 15 Solomon Islands: Analysis of Poverty from 2005/2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence for the poorest quintile is only one-tenth of that of the highest quintile HH. This captures the wide difference between urban and rural expenditure levels. The average weekly HH expenditure for Honiara amounted to SBD1443.32 (SBD254.17 p.c.a.e.) compared with only SBD449.29 (SBD94.70 p.c.a.e.) in the rural areas. For HH in the lowest three deciles the corresponding figures were SBD782.76 (SBD109.02 p.c.a.e.) for Honiara HH, SBD487.60 (SBD82.88 p.c.a.e.) for provincial-urban HH and only SBD207.62 (SBD36.53 p.c.a.e.) for rural HH. Within each of the three areas the ratio of expenditure from highest to lowest quintiles is lower than the national level average of 10.0, being 6.8 in Honiara, 6.3 in the provincial-urban centres and 8.3 in the rural areas. 43. Although rural HH p.c.a.e. expenditure is significantly lower than that in the Honiara and other urban areas, this does not necessarily translate directly into the poverty indicators. The lower rural expenditure is primarily a function of the lower valuation of own production/ consumption as described above. It is also reflected in the estimates of \u201crelative\u201d poverty within the regions rather than \u201cabsolute\u201d poverty between regions. 44. The pattern of expenditure between households in the urban and rural areas, discussed in Section 4 below, is also significantly different, indicating that the overall cost of basic needs for rural households is less than that experienced by Honiara households in particular.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a512f213-c571-4356-92a4-df1300d020e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "a512f213-c571-4356-92a4-df1300d020e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Solomon Islands Analysis of the 2005/06 HIES", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "414770322c123bdc3c7ffde10721bf7437951a2fb8062253226fceebd00b9c24"}, "2": {"node_id": "e4052122-85c0-4436-b5a5-b711229524fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5cc0125d29c5882ca0c1413bb9e974e212458f7cb6aad058d4be375a562a187f"}}, "hash": "7ca37e34895c3a88df101c69b4fe50647ab6fafdd98a76d9c3e83da11050a309", "text": "This is due to the lower non-food expenditure needs of rural households; often \u201cessential\u201d items such as power, communications, housing and transport costs will be much lower (or non-existent) for rural households than compared to their urban counterparts. 45.

For non-food expenditure rural households average weekly p.c.a.e. expenditure amounted to SBD37.06, but for those in the lowest three deciles it amounted to only SBD11.18. This compared with the weekly average p.c.a.e. non-food expenditure for Honiara HH of SBD167.91, and for the lowest three deciles, SBD60.27. 47. For non-food expenditure items therefore, the average Honiara HH spent 4.5 times as much on non-food items as the average rural HH. For the lowest three deciles the gap was even wider at 5.4 times, with Honiara HH spending an average of SBD60.27 p.c.a.e. weekly on non-food items compared to only SBD11.18 for rural HH. This is a reflection not only of the higher costs of urban living, but also the lack of access to services in the rural areas. 48. The patterns of food purchases and food produced for own consumption are shown in tables 5, 6 and 7, and in Chart 1. These tables and Chart provide greater detail on the composition of household food expenditure patterns, and clearly demonstrate the importance of home production for rural households. Conversely it also illustrates the weakening food security situation for those living in the urban centres. If imports of food are disrupted, or supplies from the rural areas into the urban markets are curtailed, a severe food shortage could rapidly eventuate. 49.

Table 7 and Chart 1 show the proportion of own production in food consumption for the three regions and the overall national average. The difference in the level of the contribution of own production to food consumption between the rural and urban areas is striking. More so perhaps when also considering that the \u201cfarm- gate\u201d prices used in estimating rural food values are much lower than those used in valuing home production of Honiara households. 52. The relative proportions of food and non-food expenditure are shown in Table 8 and Chart 2. This illustrates very clearly the changing pattern of food and non-food expenditure in total expenditure between rural and urban HH and between the differing levels of expenditure as discussed in the previous paragraphs. 53. This pattern of higher proportional food expenditure in the rural areas compared to the urban areas is to be expected and is common to other regional countries. Urban living inevitably involves greater non-food expenditure; many rural households will not have power, water or communications bills to pay. They will often spend less on transport and housing costs. Thus their need for non-food expenditure is less. Moreover, since rural cash incomes are lower, the resources available for non-food expenditure is less. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 National Honiara Provincial - Urban Rural Average all Households Lowest Quintile Lowest Three Deciles Highest Quintile % of food expenditure Chart 1 Proportion of Own Production in Food Consumption Table 8 Proportion of Household Food Non-Food Expenditure National Honiara Provincial - Urban Rural Areas % of total expenditure Food Non-Food Food Average all Households Lowest Quintile Lowest Three Deciles Highest Quintile 40.2 Basic Needs Factor 0.45 1.24 0.87 0.44 59.8 24.1 75.9 25.1 74.9 53.3 46.7 68.8 31.2 44.7 55.3 53.5 46.5 69.4 30.6 68.4 31.6 44.6 55.4 54.9 45.1 68.3 31.7 59.9 40.1 38.1 61.9 38.6 61.4 60.9 39.1 Non-Food Food Non-Food Food Non-Food 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Food Average all Households Lowest Quintile Lowest Three Deciles Highest Quintile % of total expenditure Chart 2 Proportion of HH Food & Non-Food Expenditure Non-Food Food National Honiara Provincial - Urban Rural Areas Food Non-Food Non-Food Food Non-Food 18 Solomon Islands: Analysis of Poverty from 2005/2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence 4. The Food Poverty Line 4.1 Low-Cost Diets 54. The first step in measuring poverty is the calculation of the Food Poverty Line (FPL). Two methods are typically used to derive food poverty lines: either using \u201cmodel diets\u201d or using actual food expenditure and consumption patterns of the lowest three decile p.c.a.e households from the daily expenditure diaries. The one method can be used to validate the results of the other since they approach the same issue, a basic diet, from different perspectives. The model diets approach from the nutrition perspective, while the other approaches from actual consumption patterns. From the FPL we need to be comfortable that actual food expenditure could meet basic nutrition needs. 55. For Solomon Islands, the food poverty line was derived, therefore, from the actual food expenditure and consumption patterns of the lowest three expenditure decile p.c.a.e households as recorded in the daily expenditure diaries. This is the preferred approach as it gives a better reflection of local consumption preferences than the model diets. The derivation of the FPL using this method is described in the following section. 56.

Within the household the \u201caverage\u201d adult equivalent benchmarks implicitly recognise that food energy needs and other basic needs differ from child to adult and across gender, but average out over households. 58. For the \u201cmodel\u201d menu approach diets were developed by the SPC nutritionists and the respective ministries of health which met the requirements of being both low-cost and minimally nutritious for each geographic region (or for other important sub-groups such as different ethnic groups). Typically the urban menus contained a greater proportion of purchased items compared with rural menus, reflecting observed patterns of household expenditure on purchased and own account food consumption, as shown in Tables 5 & 6 above. To obtain the FPL the menus are then priced according to CPI prices where available, and according to average recorded diary prices for other areas where CPI is not available and where home production was more significant. An average adult in a low-expenditure family living on either of these menus would therefore receive an adequate level of nutrition. 59. The model diets or menus are representative baskets of items and a similar estimating technique is used to that used for calculating the CPI. The basket of goods used for the CPI does not represent any individual family\u2019s actual consumption, but rather an average or is symbolic of what is consumed overall, see Boxes 3 and 4. The menus do not necessarily represent what low-income families actually eat, (often the diets of low-income households are very poor in nutrition), but rather what such families could eat in order to stay healthy if they are only able to afford a low-level of food expenditure. Box 3: The Food Poverty Line The food component of the poverty line is almost universally anchored to nutritional requirements for good health. This does not generate a unique monetary poverty line, since many bundles of food goods yield the same nutrition. In practice, a diet is chosen which accords with prevailing consumption patterns, about which one might expect to arrive at a consensus in most settings.

\u201cbasic needs\u201d food bundle. This is a normative judgment, though some judgments are more defensible than others. Nutritional requirements for good health are a widely accepted anchor for determining basic food needs. A defensible approach is to set the food component of the poverty line according to the local cost of a bundle of food goods that meet the pre-determined minimum food-energy requirements in a way that is consistent with prevailing food tastes. How should food-energy requirements be determined? Nutritionists have estimated requirements for maintaining body weight when a person is resting, processing food, and doing various activities. The food-energy requirements needed to maintain each person\u2019s actual activity level should not be considered binding when setting poverty lines. The poorest are often underweight, which often constrains their activity levels. In such a setting, incorporating existing differences in activity levels (and indeed weights) into sub-group poverty lines will bias the poverty comparison, in that the poverty lines need not be clearly anchored to a fixed standard of living. A better practice is to use the average food-energy requirement for each age group.

The food expenditure from the diaries of HH in the lowest three deciles in each of the regions was analysed, Tables 9 Honiara, 10 Provincial Urban and 11 Rural. It was observed that approximately 90% of food expenditure was accounted for by around 50 or so items in each of the regions. The top ten items of consumption by households in the lowest three deciles for Honiara and rural areas are illustrated in Charts 3 & 4. 61. The top 50 or so items together with their share in food intake are shown in columns A, B and C of the tables. To get the daily per capita a.e Kcal value and per capita a.e daily cost of these diary expenditure items as the basis for the calculation of the FPL, the following steps were taken: \u2022 the diary amounts were grossed up to the total recorded expenditure for the three deciles by the appropriate factor, (C1) to give a notional total food expenditure based on the listed items, column D; \u2022 each item was priced using the Honiara CPI for all purchased items, and either the Honiara market CPI price for all Honiara local produce or an average of the observed diary prices/values for HH in the provincial-urban or rural areas, columns E & F; \u2022 the Kcal (energy) value from the South Pacific Food Composition Tables was applied to each food item, column G; \u2022 the daily Kcal value represented by each item was then calculated, column H; and finally \u2022 the daily cost of each item according to its share in the overall daily food intake was estimated, column I. 62. Summing the daily Kcal values of the three expenditure patterns (J) shows that Honiara HH were notionally acquiring an average of 1,627 kcal per capita a.e per day, provincial urban HH 2,194 kcal per capita a.e per day and rural HH 1,932 kcal per capita a.e per day. In order to get to the minimum kcal daily food energy intake (K) these values must be grossed-up to 2100 Kcal by the ratio of the recorded Kcal value to the minimum (L). 63. The notional estimated daily cost of the food items (M) is then grossed up also by the factor (L). This gives the adjusted daily cost of acquiring the minimum 2100 kcal per day from the listed items. 64. Finally, the daily cost is converted to a weekly value (O). Thus the cost of acquiring a minimum adult equivalent diet in Honiara is estimated at SBD8.96 per day and SBD62.17 per week.

The Basic Needs Poverty Line 5.1 Non-Food Basic Needs Expenditure 66. The FPL is the core of the BNPL calculation. However in practice, even a low-income (low-expenditure) family cannot be expected to survive on food alone; there are always other minimum costs of basic needs for survival. Therefore an allowance for non-food basic needs expenditure is added to the value of the Food Poverty Line to arrive at the \u201cBasic Needs Poverty Line\u201d. The allowance for basic non-food expenditure is estimated from the HIES based on the non-food costs reported by households. The costs of non-food basic needs might include expenditure for housing/shelter, essential transport and communications, school fees, medical expenses and clothing. 67. There are a number of generally accepted methods of calculating non-food expenditures for the poverty lines. The World Bank suggests that a \u201cnon-food factor\u201d should be applied to the Food Poverty Line based on the proportion of non-food expenditure actually incurred by households which have an average total income equal to or less than the Food Poverty Line, see Box 5. This is intended to represent the bare minimum additional expenditure required to meet non-food basic needs. Households whose total income is equal only to the Food Poverty Line have to choose very carefully between food and non-food items; any expenditure on non-food items can be seen as being an essential trade-off between basic food and basic non-food. 68. Alternative methods may be to calculate an absolute amount of non-food expenditure for a particular category of households. This could be for the lowest income quintile, the lowest three deciles or for any particular decile as may be chosen. The higher-up the income deciles that the reference point is chosen, so the greater will be the level of expenditure on non-food items. 69. For this analysis, and to be consistent with other analyses undertaken for Pacific Island countries, the average non-food expenditure for HH in the lowest three deciles is taken as the basis for the non-food factor. For Solomon Islands the factor is given in Table 8 above. For Honiara the non-food factor is 1.24, meaning that p.c.a.e. non-food expenditure accounts for 1.24 times the amount of food expenditure. For the provincial-urban and rural areas the factors are 0.87 and 0.44, respectively. The national average of 0.5 is dominated by the weight of the number of rural HH. 70. Applying these factors to the respective FPL gives the cost of non-food basic needs for Honiara as SBD76.87 p.c.a.e Box 5: The next problem is making an allowance for non food consumption. In principal, one could proceed the same way for non-food goods--identify a normative bundle of such goods, and cost that bundle separately in each region, sector or date. However anchoring the nonfood part of the poverty line is pften difficult. There is even less agreement on the normative standard (comparable to food requirements). And comparable data on nonfood proces are rarely available. Consistency with the consumption behaviour of those who are found to be \u2018food poor\u2019 is a defensible guide. A \u201cbasic nonfood good\u201d cab be defined as one that a person wants enough to forgo a \u201cbasic food\u201d. One can thus measure the nonfood component of the poverty line as the expected value of nonfood spending by a household that is just capable of affording the food component of the poverty line.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a7d4034-aaf3-4665-b46e-ea8f4c608c15": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a7d4034-aaf3-4665-b46e-ea8f4c608c15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Solomon Islands Analysis of the 2005/06 HIES", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "78db748c3e128c5cef4cf34f71ee807d2c0fb058ad73d876c024fbd99a63c70c"}, "2": {"node_id": "d23874e5-abea-49cc-8e18-4ecd8d909f29", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1d92e5d1b656005efe1be2b36c554a457d4953ddd26d90d7f1d2f5e4544b3b5"}}, "hash": "e117f8e184661861cf0f0a480f7da130c9300a6c61b4ca60f8187f9411bd326b", "text": "This value constitutes the minimum allowance for nonfood goods consistent with being able to afford the bundle of food goods needed to reach food-energy requirements by prevailing diets.

Nationally, the weighted average for non-food basic needs costs is estimated at SBD14.78 p.c.a.e. per week. These non-food costs are shown in Table 13. 71. The need for higher basic-needs non-food expenditure in urban centres is an extremely important factor in determining relative poverty. For instance, a rural household with a relatively high level of expenditure might be relatively poor with the same expenditure in an urban situation where there is a need to meet a wide range of non-food essentials, often unavailable in the rural areas. It is therefore important to remember that national, and more particularly regionally based poverty lines, measure relative poverty in a specific set of local circumstances; locally derived food costs and specific, and available, non- food \u201cessentials\u201d. The benchmark poverty lines will therefore vary depending on these circumstances. Thus, care must be taken when interpreting the \u201cnational\u201d figure since HH with identical consumption patterns (food and non-food) will have higher expenditure levels in Honiara than in the other two regions as a result of the differences in local produce valuations. 5.2 Basic Needs Poverty Lines 72. The actual average non-food expenditure recorded by households with adult equivalent per capita expenditure in the lowest three expenditure deciles provides the essential non-food basic needs component which is added to the food poverty line to give the Basic Needs Poverty Line (BNPL). 73. The BNPL is calculated by adding the estimated non-food basic needs expenditure to the food poverty line. It may be seen from Column D of Table 13 that there are wide variations between the BNPL across regions. These reflect differences in household size between Honiara and rural HH, especially those in the lowest three deciles. 74. Nationally from Table 13 it is seen that the estimated BNPL amounted to SBD47.37 p.c.a.e. per week (equivalent to SBD265.77 adult equivalent for the average size low expenditure HH). For Honiara the weekly a.e HH expenditure required to meet the BNPL was SBD998.32, and for the rural areas SBD225.02. 6. The Incidence, Depth & Severity of Poverty in Solomon Islands 6.1 Head Count Ratio 75. On the basis of the per capita a.e. Food and Basic Needs Poverty Lines in Table 13, the incidence of poverty observed from the household per capita expenditure in the HIES data is summarised in Table 14: Incidence of Poverty for Population and Households and in Charts 5 & 6. The incidence of poverty is measured by the \u201cHead Count Ratio\u201d which indicates the proportion of either households or population which had expenditure less than the relevant poverty line.

Table 14 and Chart 5 show that the level of food poverty, those households with per capita adult equivalent expenditure less than the Food Poverty Line (generally referred to as \u201cabsolute\u201d poverty), the poorest of the poor, is low. The data suggests that on average about 8.6% of all households, representing 10.6% of the population have expenditure which would be insufficient to meet basic food needs as defined by the food poverty line. For Honiara and the provincial-urban centres the level of absolute poverty appears to be very low, 1.7% and 0.6% respectively of households and 2.6% and 0.8% of the respective populations.

Even those HH experiencing food poverty may not necessarily be going hungry. Rather, they are likely to be consuming a very poor diet with inadequate nutrition, and are thus more likely to experience health problems as a result. These health problems then translate into lowered learning abilities in children at school and less likelihood of adults getting employment; a perpetuation of the poverty cycle. The reported increases in non-communicable diseases, many of which are related to diet (diabetes, hypertension, and high blood-pressure), suggest that many households do indeed have a poor level of nutrition whilst at the same time having plenty to eat. 6.3 Incidence of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6736877f-52a6-4bdc-955c-910bc1b5ebad": {"__data__": {"id_": "6736877f-52a6-4bdc-955c-910bc1b5ebad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Solomon Islands Analysis of the 2005/06 HIES", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6222671b5d0d6c07a5d75e14d80464af93992611371515c5e0ea147e943df51d"}, "3": {"node_id": "abbe27a6-13ad-4dc7-8be4-99f547e68d77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39117c321311f7f6a0896bc5ad4e9a09f6827cf34109e29f8fe4e0cdc69546bc"}}, "hash": "41a4cfef9e07a460a7c9f0c86320471695bea956b9993ee4ec70038755603a77", "text": "Basic Needs Poverty 78. The estimated incidence of basic needs poverty is also shown in Table 14 and illustrated in Chart 6. Nationally it is estimated that 18.8% of households representing 22.7% of the population, had weekly p.c.a.e. expenditure less than the basic needs poverty line. For Honiara households the proportion having p.c.a.e. expenditure below the BNPL is estimated at 24.6% (32.2% of the population).

These estimates of poverty incidence therefore suggest that 22,220 people in Honiara, including 8,166 children under 15 years, were unable to afford a basic minimum standard of living. In the rural areas the number so affected is estimated to have been around 83,000, of which 31,734 are estimated to have been children.

There are also many more households and individuals who have expenditure only just above the basic needs poverty line and who are therefore vulnerable. It is estimated that additionally around 18,500 rural people (including 8070 children) and 3,885 people in Honiara (including 1450 children) have expenditure no more than ten percent above the rural and Honiara BNPL respectively. With rising prices and/or declining incomes/expenditure these people are highly vulnerable to slipping below the poverty lines. 81. Based on the aggregate national average basic needs poverty line it is estimated that 121,063 people were living in basic-needs poverty in Solomon Islands. This included an estimated 47,238 children. Additionally those children living in households where the per capita adult equivalent expenditure was no more than ten percent about the level of the national BNPL numbered an additional 10,136. Thus approximately 57,000 children in Solomon Islands were either already living below the poverty line or were highly vulnerable to falling into poverty. 82. These figures suggest that although Honiara is a source of work and employment for many, there are, nevertheless, many households whose expenditure cannot cover the basic needs costs of a reasonable minimum standard of living. There are many who would be classified as working poor. They may be in employment, either full or part- time, but their incomes and thus expenditure is insufficient to meet all their family\u2019s needs. 83. Households that appear to be least disadvantaged in terms of the poverty line are those in the provincial-urban centres. Many in these centres are employed either by government or the provincial administrations. Indeed the survey reveals that almost 70% of HH heads in the provincial urban centres were in some form of employment, and even amongst the lowest three deciles the proportion was around 60%. These HH have the benefit of lower local produce prices and less need to spend on non-food items. Thus they appear generally better-off relative to those in Honiara. 84.

In considering the basic incidence of poverty it is also useful to estimate the number of those other households and population who might be vulnerable to falling into poverty, that is those who are only just now living above the BNPL. A sensitivity analysis has therefore been done with the BNPL being increased by 10% to estimate the additional number of HH and population that would then fall below the BNPL. 86. For Honiara a 10% increase in the BNPL to SBD152.94 p.c.a.e per week would bring an additional 510 households and 3885 people into poverty. This would raise the incidence of households in poverty by 5.1 percentage points to 29.7%, and would raise the proportion of the Honiara population below the poverty by 5.6 percentage points to 37.8%. 87. For the rural areas raising the BNPL by 10% to SBD43.55 p.c.a.e per week would bring 2471 households into poverty representing and additional 18,504 people. This would raise the incidence of rural households in poverty by 3.3 28 Solomon Islands: Analysis of Poverty from 2005/2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence percentage points to 18.5%, and would raise the proportion of the Honiara population below the poverty by 4.1 percentage points to 22.9%. 88. Nationally, a ten percent increase would put the BNPL at SBD52.11 p.c.a.e per week and would bring an additional 3,500 households below the poverty line. These HH would represent 22,495 people. The national incidence of poverty at the household level would increase by four percentage points to 22.8%, and would increase the proportion of the national population below the by 4.2 percentage points to 26.9%. 89. It can therefore be seen that there are many households and people who are very vulnerable to small changes in personal or household circumstances. A small loss of income, or jump in prices, as being seen now in the cost of basic foods, particularly rice, flour and cereal products that feature prominently in both urban and rural diets, can quickly bring many new people into poverty. 6.4 Depth and Severity of Poverty 90. The depth and severity of poverty are measured by the Poverty Gap Index (PGI)13 and the Squared Poverty Gap Index (SPGI)14 respectively, Table 15. The former is a measure of the depth of poverty being experienced by each household below the basic needs poverty line. The latter measures the severity of poverty by giving more weight to the poorest households whose poverty gap is greatest. The higher the indices the greater is the depth and/or severity of poverty within the population. 91. The PGI for Solomon Islands is calculated as an index of 7.5 which is similar to Tonga and Samoa and less than estimates for Fiji and FSM (Fiji, 11.2, FSM 9.8, Tonga 7.7, Samoa 6.5 )15. This implies that the depth of poverty is similar to the regional average. For Honiara the PGI was estimated at 8.5 and for the rural areas at 6.1. Not surprisingly, given the reported low level of food poverty, the provincial-urban centres generated a low PGI of 3.1. The PGI is an important poverty indicator being Indicator 2 of Target 1, Goal I of the MDGs. 92. The SPGI measuring the severity of poverty also suggests that Solomon Islands experiences generally a similar level of poverty severity as other regional countries. The SPGI at the national level was measured at 3.5, compared with national level SPGIs of 5.1 in Fiji, 4.8 in FSM, 4.0 in Tonga and 2.6 in Samoa. Across the regions the SPGI was 3.4 in Honiara, a low 1.0 in the provincial-urban centres (where the incidence of poverty is lowest) and 2.8 in the rural areas. 6.5 Income Distribution and Inequality 93. Levels of income distribution and inequality can be illustrated in a number of ways. Table 16 summarises the Gini Coefficients (where a higher coefficient indicates greater inequality and a lower one represents greater equality). The figures indicate that inequality in Solomon Islands is relatively low within each of the three regions (averaging 0.31).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78e4ae54-498b-48a2-a064-4ffd4da2c652": {"__data__": {"id_": "78e4ae54-498b-48a2-a064-4ffd4da2c652", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Solomon Islands Analysis of the 2005/06 HIES", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f8ace4c49e0c81db6eeae8d52c6b5a04a0acff74dc227a89dfb03c3a4efd15c"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb6e62df-dd95-4502-99ef-9baf457b096e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "583f0576bea843efde381266a93080f0f7a97accea0d867f930cc315dd24b112"}}, "hash": "b6396abdc42db3603d1c30f554bb787c96f4f9d1cd939e3e8e7232072a0f6d4b", "text": "However, the coefficient is higher (0.39) at the national level as there are wide differences, as have already been seen, between HH expenditure levels in Honiara compared to the rural areas.

Chart 7 shows the share of expenditure incurred by each decile; Appendix Table A1 provides details of the proportion of expenditure by decile. On average the poorest ten-percent of all households incurred about 2.6% of expenditure while the top decile of households incurred around 31% of all expenditure. There were variations between the three regions with the lowest three deciles in Honiara having a slightly greater share of expenditure (16.3%) compared to 13.8% in the rural areas. However in both Honiara and the rural areas the top three deciles had 52.6% and 52.8% of expenditure respectively. 95. The ratio of the share of the bottom quintile to the top quintile of HH (MDG Indicator 3 of Target 1, Goal 1) was 6.9 at the national level, 4.0 for Honiara and 4.9 for the rural areas. The higher ratio at the national level reflects the bias of Honiara HH to the higher deciles when aggregated with those in the rural areas where expenditure is generally lower as a result of the valuation of own-production. 96. The foregoing analysis has illustrated that there are wide gaps between the expenditure levels of households across the country, and particularly between those in the urban and rural areas. It has highlighted however, that although the p.c.a.e. expenditure levels of those in the rural areas is on average lower than households in Honiara, when it comes to their ability to meet basic needs, those in the rural areas are in fact \u201cbetter-off\u201d. They produce more of their own food, and thus do not need to purchase so much, and also they need less cash for non-food basic needs as there is generally less available in the way of services to be purchased, and less \u201cneed\u201d for expenditure on such things as transport, fuel and power, water, communications and such other \u201cessentials\u201d required in an urban environment. 97. It is arguable of course that households in the rural areas without, or with only limited access to basic services are inherently \u201cpoorer\u201d than those with better access in Honiara. As noted at the beginning however, this analysis is looking at \u201crelative\u201d poverty amongst those living in similar environments and not at \u201cabsolute\u201d poverty measured against a single common benchmark (e.g. US$1 or US$2 per day).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef5803c5-fba2-419a-abd9-2bed13302ca0": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef5803c5-fba2-419a-abd9-2bed13302ca0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Solomon Islands Analysis of the 2005/06 HIES", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec90da6644d2a89753c71abbc654f2ec04ef5eee8194a7c1e503e714e3d41491"}, "2": {"node_id": "287d2dd2-8ea2-463c-b968-45d948ef9294", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/solomon-islands-analysis-2005/06-hies", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62ec7fa5445f444cc7f803b28ffb747e244736d43fc1b5bd46830da49c017b60"}}, "hash": "bccd7e17bfb81e7bbf5c1ebcc19ad143141cc7398b372fa25afcbc3001b4d493", "text": "US$1 or US$2 per day).

On the other hand, the Western, Isabel and Guadalcanal provinces are under- represented relative to their share of rural HH and population. While the largest proportion of rural poor (lowest three deciles of weekly per capita a.e. household expenditure) are located in Malaita province (33.5% of HH and 34.5% of population); these proportions are only slightly above Malaita\u2019s relative share of the overall rural population (29.4% of HH and 30.9% of population).

Relative to its share in the overall rural population, Makira/ Ulawa is the most disadvantaged province. The province accounted for 9.9% of all rural HH and 10.8% of the total rural population, but had 15.3% of all rural poor HH and 16.4% of the total rural poor population. Temotu was the next most disadvantaged; this province accounted for 5.7% of all rural HH and 5.2% of the total rural population, but had 8.4% of all rural poor HH and 8.0% of the total rural poor population. 7.2 Age of Household Heads 102. Table 18 indicates that a higher proportion of poor HH are headed by elderly persons. In the country as a whole 12.4% of HH were headed by those aged 60+; however in the lowest three deciles the proportion rises to 16.9%. Between the three regions Honiara had the lowest proportion of HH headed by elderly persons, 4.1%. However, in the lowest quintile the proportion was 5.6%. In the rural areas, on average 13.7% of HH were headed by the elderly and in the lowest three deciles the proportion was 15.7%. This indicates that most of the elderly-headed HH are in the rural areas and supports the suggestion that dependency ratios in the rural areas are increasing as young people move away, either to the provincial-urban centres or to Honiara. 103.

Overall female-headed households are estimated to account for 6.5% of all HH, but around 7.3% of those below the basic needs poverty line. 105.

Table 20 provides an analysis of all females by expenditure decile in the urban centres (Honiara and Provincial) and the rural areas. This indicates in particular that 39% of all urban females under 15 years were living in households in the lowest three deciles. This compares with 36.4% of those aged 15 years and above in these deciles. The situation was similar in the rural areas where the corresponding figures were 34% and 35.7%. In contrast the table indicates that, notwithstanding the higher proportion of female headed households in the highest quintile in Honiara, in aggregate females are under-represented in the highest quintiles in all both age groups and in both urban and rural areas. 7.4 Children in Poverty 107. The survey results indicate that there were 223,603 (41.9%) children under the age of 15 (115,020 boys and 108,583 girls, a ratio of 106 boys per 100 girls) in the total estimated population of 533,671. Of these, 24,990 children were to be found in Honiara (equivalent to 36.1% of the Honiara population) and 6,796 in the provincial urban centres (41.7% of the provincial urban population). The remainder being the large majority, 191,817, were in the rural areas, and represented 42.8% of the rural population. 108. Overall it is estimated that 32.9% of all children live in HH in the lowest three expenditure deciles. Girls account for 33.5% of all children in these HH compared with 32.4% of boys. In comparison 24.8% of girls and 24.0% of boys live in HH in the highest three expenditure deciles. Children are also slightly over-represented in the lowest quintile, with 22.6% of children being in these HH. These results are illustrated in Chart 12. 109. The household analysis indicates that children in Honiara are more likely to be living in the poorest households than in other parts of the country. In Honiara 38.7% of children live in households in the three lowest expenditure deciles. This compares with 34.3% of those in provincial urban households and 33.6% in rural households. 33 Solomon Islands: Analysis of Poverty from 2005/2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence 110.

Table 21 provides a comparison between the situation of children in all households compared with those living in a female headed HH.

In contrast, in the rural areas only 16.6% of HH heads are in employment. This proportion falls to 9.5% for those in the lowest three deciles. 113.

Charts 13 and 14 show the principal activities of Honiara and rural households by top and bottom three deciles and by the sex of household head. These charts show the importance of being in some form of work as a basis for being not-poor, especially in the rural areas. In Honiara those working full or part-time are almost as likely to be in the lowest as in the highest three deciles. This suggests that many are working full-time on very low rates of pay. However working for household consumption is likely to be associated with being below the poverty line while in the rural areas this activity could be associated with being in the top three deciles. 115. Being unemployed (defined as though available and looking for work) was recorded as the situation for 11.8% of all HH heads in Honiara and for 20.1% and 25.0% of HH heads in the provincial-urban and rural areas respectively. However for those in the lowest three deciles the proportions were 14.7% for Honiara HH, 23.8% of provincial- urban HH heads and 23.4% of those in the rural areas. Thus it would seem that the continuing migration into the Honiara urban centre is a rational response to the fact that unemployment is much more likely in the rural and provincial-urban areas than in Honiara. 116. However as the Charts show households with unemployed heads are more likely to be in the bottom three deciles in both Honiara and the rural areas. The problem of unemployment extends through the whole population. The level of unemployment is especially high in the rural areas where one-third of all males and all females in the lowest three deciles reported as being unemployed. 117.

In the poorest three deciles almost three-quarters of HH heads had no attainment beyond primary level. 121. Not surprisingly, the highest proportion with post-secondary education are found in the highest three deciles of urban HH heads. 48.5% of this group had achieved some level of post primary education, compared with only 14.6% of those in the poorest three deciles. This suggests that the poor are only one-third as likely to have post primary education as the better-off. Even against the overall average of Honiara HH, the poorest are only half as likely to have progressed beyond primary level. 122. A similar situation exists in the rural areas where the poorest HH are only half as likely to have gone beyond primary level compared with the average for all HH. 123. The rural areas are clearly disadvantaged in terms of attainment at post-secondary levels. Even amongst the highest three deciles the proportion of HH heads attaining this level was only 11.6%, and these were almost certainly government employees in rural schools or medical facilities. For the lowest three deciles 3.9% of HH heads had, however, achieved some level of post-secondary education. 124. Since this is the first survey to have linked educational attainment (and other household characteristics) with expenditure it is not possible to say whether or by how much the \u201ctensions\u201d of the past few years have impacted either educational levels or the state of poverty. However, given the breakdown in much of the institutional structure during the \u201ctensions\u201d, it would be surprising if there were not some significant adverse impacts being felt through the economy. 7.7 Energy Access and Use 125. Chart 18 shows the nature of energy used for cooking by Honiara HH. It is interesting that although both gas and electricity are available in Honiara a high proportion of households across all expenditure deciles (57.3% of the lowest three decile HH and 32.7% of those in the highest three deciles) use open fires for cooking. In the lowest three deciles a further 15.2% used saw-dust stoves Chart 16 Educational Attainment of HH Head: Rural HH: Lowest Three Deciles No Grade, 21.5 Secondary 20.8 Post Secondary, 3.9 Primary, 52.0 NR, 1.9 No Grade Primary Secondary Post Secondary NR Chart 17 Educational Attainment of HH Head: Rural HH: Highest Three Deciles No Grade, 7.3 Secondary 27.8 Post Secondary, 11.6 Primary, 51.8 NR, 1.9 No Grade Primary Secondary Post Secondary NR 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Electric plate Lowest Three Deciles Highest Three Deciles % of HH Chart 18 Type of energy usage for cooking: Honiara HH Electric stove Gas Burner Gas Oven Kerosene Woodstove Sawdust stove Open Fire Other 36 Solomon Islands: Analysis of Poverty from 2005/2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence and in the highest three deciles 21.9% of HH use gas burners. This suggests that the cost of purchased fuel is a deterrent to its use and that firewood is easily accessible (at least currently), either in the market or from collection.

Thus while there may be significant health benefits (especially for women and young children) from the use of \u201cclean\u201d energy sources for cooking, the cost of such fuels compared to the \u201cfree\u201d source of firewood is likely to be difficult to overcome. Changing to clean fuels might also require significant changes in traditional cooking methods and food types. Any change will therefore likely need to be slow and gradual. 128. The nature of power for lighting in Honiara is shown Chart 19. Amongst the lowest expenditure households, in both the Honiara and rural areas, kerosene is the most widely used power source for lighting. In the rural areas this applies across all deciles, averaging 89.5% amongst the poorest HH and even 87.9% amongst those in the highest expenditure groups. For a small proportion of rural households, around 2.6% of those in the highest three deciles, solar energy is also used as a source of lighting. 129. For Honiara HH the use of electricity for lighting increases with the higher deciles; in the poorest HH only 40.9% are connected to the power system while 88.6% of those in the highest three deciles are connected. In the lowest three deciles 56.4% of households use kerosene. Details of power usage for lighting in Honiara and the rural areas are provided in Appendix Tables A6 and A7. These show the proportions of households using each type of power by decile and by source of power. 7.8 Access to Water and Sanitation 130. The next three charts look at access to water.

The data indicates that around 27.4% of households in the rural areas are using unsafe or unprotected primary sources of water in terms of public wells (21.9%), streams or rivers (5.5%). This compares with an average of 23.5% of HH overall. 131. Even amongst better-off HH a high proportion still rely on unsafe sources; some 20.3% of the top three deciles use public wells, rivers and streams as their primary water source. 132. For those in Honiara the town reticulated supply or a similar piped source is most common, Chart 22. Amongst low expenditure HH, just over sixty percent have piped water, rising to 85% of those in the highest expenditure groups. Even in Honiara, however, that still means that almost 30% of the poorest HH are relying on unsafe water sources. 133. Around 13.2% of Honiara HH in the lowest three deciles use public wells as their primary water source compared to an average over all Honiara HH of 7.4%. Also 3.3% of the poorest HH rely on rivers/lakes/streams as a primary supply source.

Thus in Honiara there must be serious health concerns that in the lowest decile a significant proportion of households have neither safe water nor safe sanitation. These are likely to be in the peripheral squatter areas where conditions of living are poor and consequently, the health risks are high. 137. It has been noted above that there are many children living in households in the lowest deciles, and thus these children are likely to be at very high risk in terms of their health. 138. For the rural areas, Charts 24 and 25, the most common form of sanitation is the over-water closet type, accounting for 54% of those in the poorest HH and even 41% of those in the top three expenditure deciles. This over-water system would, of course, only be available to those households on the coast; for inland HH it is clear that either pits or \u201cother\u201d forms of sanitation are used. This suggests that many of these types of sanitation are not improved and are therefore a source of potential health problems. 139. As with the poorest HH in Honiara, poor access to safe water is frequently found alongside poor access to improved sanitation in rural areas. The over-water closets pose serious health concerns where the surrounding reefs may be a source of shellfish or where children play at the water\u2019s edge. 140. It is also noted that 7.9% of poor households and 4.8% of the better-off recorded having no sanitation system at all. 141. Details of the particular situation of female headed households in access to safe water and sanitation is provided in Appendix Tables A16 and A17 for water and sanitation. These tables show that for female headed HH in the lowest three deciles in Honiara 19.8% had no access to piped water. The tables also show that 47.5% of female headed households in the lowest three deciles in Honiara had un-improved sanitation compared to only 20.4% of those similar female headed households in the top three deciles. 142. In the rural areas 92.2% of female headed households in the lowest three deciles had unimproved sanitation compared to 68% with unimproved sanitation in the top three deciles. Access to improved water was however little different between the lowest three and highest three rural deciles with 49.8% and 51.2% of female headed households in these groups not having access to an improved water supply. 143. Access to improved water and sanitation are therefore critical issues for households throughout the country, but especially in the rural areas. 8. Conclusions 8.1 Poverty of Income or Opportunity? 144. Poverty is a multi-dimensional issue.

The BNPL measures the incidence of \u201cincome or expenditure\u201d poverty but this is just one aspect of poverty or hardship. Families might have low incomes, but through good household budgeting and prioritising of expenditure, might still be reasonably well-fed and healthy. Nevertheless they are still likely to live in conditions where they experience varying degrees of hardship. The analysis suggests that relative poverty exists in all parts of the country, with the highest level being experienced in Honiara where one-in-four households and one-in-three people lives below the urban basic needs poverty line. 147. In the rural areas where the poverty line, and arguably the minimum standard of living is itself lower, approximately one-in-seven households and one-in-five people also live below the rural poverty line. The actual level of the basic needs poverty line is however more than three times as high for those in Honiara, SBD139.04 p.c.a.e compared with the rural BNPL of only SBD39.59 p.c.a.e. The rural BNPL is lower both because the cost of local food is lower, and is largely from own production for the poor at least, but also because \u201cbasic needs\u201d are lower since there is less access to services. 148. As this paper indicates, the poorest households might lack access to basic services, especially water and sanitation if they are in squatter areas in the urban centre of Honiara or in the remote parts of the rural provinces. Similarly they might lack access to health, education and transport facilities. They lack access to economic opportunities resulting in urban drift and growing numbers of un-and under employed youth. The weaknesses in access to services and opportunities are especially chronic in the rural parts of the country; but they also affect those who have drifted or migrated into Honiara. A combination of low educational attainment, socio-cultural factors relating to age, gender and other personal characteristics further limit freedom of choice, or socio-economic opportunity. 149. This poverty of opportunity, e.g. lack of access to basic health and education services, employment opportunities, standards of good governance and equal opportunities across gender and age, is now regarded as just as important in defining the extent of poverty and hardship in a society as is the lack of income/expenditure. Often 40 Solomon Islands: Analysis of Poverty from 2005/2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence the conditions and circumstances giving rise to the poverty of opportunity are the causes of income/expenditure poverty. Alleviating poverty of opportunity will help to increase incomes and wealth. 8.2 How Does Poverty Affect People 150. As noted in the analysis, households with expenditure below the basic needs poverty line level will not necessarily be going hungry, although their diet is likely to be poor in nutrition. It means, more likely, that whilst they are probably not going hungry they are, nevertheless, struggling to meet their daily/weekly living expenses, particularly those that require cash payments (power, water, transport, school fees, clothing, housing, medical costs etc). These families will be constantly trying to balance their incomes with their expenditure and frequently something has to be given up, a trade-off will have to be made between one bill and another, food or fees. 151. Urban drift leading to higher levels of unemployment and growing numbers of people living in squatter settlements and sub-standard housing conditions result in a deteriorating social environment. Poor housing conditions lead to poor health, poor educational attainment and poor employment prospects, conditions which perpetuate poverty and hardship. The levels of urban hardship and poverty indicated by the analysis of the 2005/06 urban HIES point to a wide range of issues that need to be addressed by government policy. Increased opportunities for employment, not only in the urban centres but also in the rural areas, are amongst the most critical. 152. The data suggests that almost one-third of the population of Honiara and almost one-quarter of those in the rural areas struggle to meet even the basic needs for a decent family life. Fortunately few people appear to be going hungry but there are indications in the expenditure patterns of the poorest households that many may be getting inadequate nutrition. This may be especially the case for children in the urban centres where local produce may not be so readily available in household diets. The analysis shows that a high proportion of the basic diet of the urban poor is based on imported foods. 153.

Many of the poorest in Solomon Islands society live in low-quality housing without proper access to water, sanitation and other basic services.

The cycle of poverty can therefore be perpetuated. 155. Perhaps the most critical issue is education. Without good basic education it is very difficult for the poor to move out of poverty. Higher income derives from having the ability to take advantage of economic opportunities, this means having an ability to read and write. The \u201ctensions\u201d of recent years have undoubtedly contributed to a decline in the educational attainment of those in the areas most affected. The rapid increase in the Honiara population appears to be putting ever greater pressure on the urban infrastructure. Thus, many of those in the new squatter areas, and those who are likely to be amongst the poorest, do not have access to basic water and sanitation services. 156. Urbanisation appears to be pushing prices higher in Honiara, thereby further disadvantaging those who are not engaged in the cash economy. It is also widening the gap between those in Honiara and those in the rural areas. Local level poverty alleviation measures offer an opportunity to create new opportunities in rural areas. But these rely on stability, transport and adequate economic infrastructure. 157. With the logging industry expected to begin a decline in production in the near future there will be a large number of newly unemployed young men. Many will be seeking alternative employment opportunities. At present the most advanced developments are mostly centered on Guadalcanal province with the palm-oil plantation and Gold Ridge. It is essential that government seeks to support new and sustainable enterprises in other provinces where logging will cease. New forestry plantations or tree-crop ventures would provide some new opportunities for employment creation in sustainable ventures. 158. Overseas migration in temporary worker schemes may also provide opportunities for some, but these often require some minimum educational or technical qualification. With so many in Solomon islands having a maximum of only a basic primary education there is a need for education service delivery and education outcomes to be improved. 159. The analysis has provided much evidence for use in policy formulation; it has identified many issues which require further, more detailed investigation, in terms of the extent of poverty by gender, province and other characteristics. Further research needs to be undertaken to quantify these issues on the basis of the survey data so as to provide government with clearer, evidence-based indications of the policy issues and possible policy options to address these. 160. Perhaps for the first time in many years the data is available to inform and guide government in its pursuit of improved development and better lifestyles for all Solomon Islanders.",

While some countries have made remarkable progress on some goals, slow progress persists towards other goals, and disparities remain between the national and local or regional levels, with rising inequality in some countries. This trend is similarly re\ufb02ected in the Paci\ufb01c region where the performance of countries on the MDG framework varies by goal and between the urban centres and rural areas or outer islands. Generally speaking, one notes that countries in the Melanesia sub region lag behind on several goals and need additional support to make a signi\ufb01cant dent towards achievement of the MDGs. While some progress has been made, the Micronesian countries in the North Paci\ufb01c are struggling to maintain development gains. Countries in the Polynesia sub region show a marked improvement in human development indicators, and generally are on track to achieve the MDGs by 2015. However, additional e\ufb00orts need to address vulnerabilities to climate change, HIV/AIDS and gender inequalities. 2008 is therefore a milestone year to review progress, and identify the required support to accelerate improvements towards poverty reduction, achievement of countries national development priorities and the MDGs. Building upon the foundation established in 2006 through a regional workshop on the MDGs, in 2007, the UNDP Paci\ufb01c Centre - in collaboration with other UN Agencies and UNDP Regional Centres in Colombo and Bangkok - organised two sub regional workshops on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting. The \ufb01rst workshop was organised in Pohnpei, FSM in June 2007, and aimed at strengthening national capacities in linking policy, planning and budgeting in the North Paci\ufb01c countries of the Federated States of Micronesia (all four States), Palau, the Republic of Marshall Islands and Kiribati. The second workshop had a similar focus and was held in Honiara, Solomon Islands for the West Paci\ufb01c countries of Fiji, Vanuatu, Tuvalu, Nauru and Solomon Islands. The Polynesian sub regional MDG workshop held in Rarotonga, Cook Islands, in May 2008 is therefore the third and last in the series of sub regional workshops. The workshop targeted government and non government participants from Niue, Samoa, Tokelau, Tonga and Cook Islands. The workshop was designed to strengthen national capacities in understanding poverty and hardship and the MDGs, and how di\ufb00erent types of policies can contribute to poverty reduction and achievement of national priorities and the MDGs. Understanding how to put together an MDG-based national sustainable development strategy (NSDS) or national plan, and aligning resource allocation mechanisms to overarching policies was part of the workshop objective. In this respect, the experience of the Philippines on planning and budgeting, including gender responsive budgeting, was both practical and interesting. Given the vulnerability of Paci\ufb01c Islands Countries to natural disasters and the rising prices of oil, environment and energy featured prominently in the workshop sessions. The highlight of the workshop was the introduction of a number of sectoral needs assessment / costing tools to enable countries to identify sectoral priorities and estimate the resource requirement to \ufb01nance implementation of interventions in these key areas. There was strong interest in the following needs assessment / costing tools: education, health, HIV, environment, energy and gender, and countries have requested follow up training in-country so that more national counterparts can be trained to use the tools. The workshop had a strong focus on gender, with speci\ufb01c sessions on gender responsive policies, gender responsive budgeting and the introduction of the gender costing tool. Gender was also addressed and mainstreamed in other sessions, including on disaster risk reduction.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2980aad-0ac5-4acd-98e2-8cd6235a2bab": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2980aad-0ac5-4acd-98e2-8cd6235a2bab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based Planning, Costing and Budgeting for the Polynesian Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e1c0c8429394967ae7cf8c8e7dfd10ab6c5d4c8db208f7812b9b33c5b3a84b4e"}, "2": {"node_id": "e270ec18-0afb-4e11-9395-0df614480ffc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd9dfa5bc4c148851754e46421849da556ad333218a7ae2fd4e5fd8cfe1fec8d"}}, "hash": "b07ee419580af7d0059e80639e3f41eb4fda90fb5e66affd3b7e867f3c8f6c71", "text": "Gender was also addressed and mainstreamed in other sessions, including on disaster risk reduction. 2 Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for the Polynesian Countries The expected outcome of the workshop was greater understanding of poverty / MDG- related issues, including what countries should do to achieve the MDGs; strengthened capacities in identifying sectoral priorities, and how to link these to national planning; better grounding of the budget process and how this should relate to policy and planning; and understanding of how to use the needs assessment / costing tools to inform policy decisions and prioritisation, and provide a rationale for the preparation of sectoral / national budgets.

O\ufb03cial Opening The key note address at the workshop was delivered by Ms. Naheed Haque, UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative for the Samoa Multi Country O\ufb03ce, covering Samoa, Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau. In her statement, Ms. Haque thanked the Hon. Prime Minister for the Cook Islands hospitality and for kindly accepting to o\ufb03cially open the workshop. She highlighted that 2008 is a milestone year for the MDGs, with a number of high level meetings taking place to review the performance of countries in achieving the MDGs. Ms. Haque also indicated that the workshop brings together countries with similar human development levels to share experience and learn from each other. The workshop aims to strengthen understanding of how national and local development priorities can align with the MDGs, inform policy formulation at sector and national level, and increase coherence among sector and national plan and budgets frameworks. She hoped that as the workshop would introduce a number of needs assessment / costing tools to support governments to estimate expenditure in education, health, gender, energy, environment, infrastructure and other sectors, and also support prioritisation of interventions and policy options, this training would not be a one-o\ufb00 event, and that capacity strengthening would be an ongoing support. She emphasised that particular attention should be paid to addressing gender issues, vulnerability to climate change and environmental concerns, and the needs of vulnerable communities. The workshop was o\ufb03cially opened by Honourable Jim Marurai, Prime Minister of the Government of the Cook Islands. In his opening statement, the Hon. Prime Minister extended a very warm welcome to all workshop participants, and expressed appreciation to UNDP for choosing Cook Islands as the venue for the sub regional workshop. The Hon. Prime Minister emphasised that at mid point to the deadline to reach the MDGs, it is opportune to re\ufb02ect on the progress which countries have been able to achieve, as well as take stock of whether development partners have lived up to their pledges to scale up aid resources to developing countries. The Hon. Prime Minister highlighted that the Cook Islands has embraced the spirit of the Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals, and will ful\ufb01l their commitments. He also indicated that while the Polynesia sub region is on track to achieve all the goals by 2015, a number of key issues need to be addressed, including climate change, rising oil and food prices, and gender inequities. The Hon. Prime Minister was pleased to note the alignment between the focus of the workshop and the development concerns of the Polynesian countries. He particularly welcome the One UN collaboration for the workshop.

Day 1 - Session I: Objective: Achieving national development priorities and the MDGs & reducing poverty: policy implication The MDG framework in the Polynesian Sub Region, Carol Flore- Smereczniak, UNDP Paci\ufb01c Centre The \ufb01rst session provided a comprehensive assessment of the MDGs and how the 5 Polynesian countries are performing on the MDG framework. The presentation highlighted that in September 2007, the MDG monitoring framework was revised to include 4 additional targets and 11 related indicators. Emphasis was placed on the Millennium Declaration, the normative content of the MDGs, speci\ufb01cally on human rights, equality - including gender equality, and the rights-based approach to development. The inter-relatedness of the goals, the non-exclusive aspect of the MDGs, and the synergies between the MDGs and human rights frameworks were reinforced. There was a strong focus on women empowerment and \ufb01nancing for gender equality, with concrete examples being provided to underscore the centrality of gender to achievement of all the MDGs. Generally speaking, the \ufb01ve countries in the Polynesian sub region are doing well on the MDG framework. However, the political representation of women in Parliaments and Cabinets remains extremely low, and the issue of non-communicable diseases needs serious attention, along with adaptation and mitigation e\ufb00orts to climate change. The importance of monitoring and reporting on the MDGs - and the use of the MDG Monitor - complemented by planning and budgeting to achieve the MDGs, was highlighted. Attention was drawn to the role of civil society organizations in collaborating with governments as well as hold them accountable. During the discussions, countries raised concern with the inadequate level of \ufb01nancing available from donor partners to support them in implementing their national development priorities. Some countries felt that their high level of debt could reverse their MDG gains unless additional \ufb01nancing can be made available. It was suggested that countries which do not have representation in New York could make a formal submission through the Paci\ufb01c Ambassadors\u2019 Group, currently chaired by Tonga, to ensure that the Polynesian concerns are voiced at the High Level Event on the MDGs in September 2008. Cooks Islands indicated that its MDG Report would be reviewed by the end of this year to align with achievement of the MDGs. Participants were informed that the last census was in 2006 and a Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) has just been \ufb01nalised. SPC will provide support for the analysis of the results. These should provide su\ufb03cient data to review the MDG Report. Samoa\u2019s \ufb01rst National MDG Report was prepared in 2004, but remained unpublished. The current UNDP Country Programme Action Plan (CPAP) makes provision for the review of the MDG Report. In the implementation phase, emphasis is being placed on those MDGs which are unlikely to be achieved by 2015, namely MDG 7. There is also a lack of capacity to focus on measurement of the MDGs. The last population census was in 2006, and the HIES is currently being processed. So there is su\ufb03cient data to work on a review of the MDG Report. 5 Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for the Polynesian Countries Tokelau informed that there is data available which can be used to update the information available on the country\u2019s indicators.

To calculate the cost of basic needs for populations, both food and non-food basic needs are taken into consideration. In general, within each Paci\ufb01c country, one in four households has a level of expenditure which does not meet the minimum cost of a basic standard of living. This can be higher in some countries, and lower in others, and are therefore relative numbers. The gap between the better o\ufb00 and the least o\ufb00 (poverty gap) is most severe in FSM and Fiji. The Gini Coe\ufb03cient, which measures the level of inequality - the higher the index the greater the level of inequality - also indicates that inequalities are rising. Emerging issues impacting on poverty and hardship in Paci\ufb01c Island societies include the increasing monetisation of Paci\ufb01c economies, migration, food security and the proportion of food in low income households. The presentation was followed by discussions which further clari\ufb01ed the de\ufb01nition and understanding of poverty, and highlighted the contextual understanding of food security in the Paci\ufb01c. 6 Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for the Polynesian Countries Day 1 - Session II: Objective - Policy options to achieve the MDGs Pro-poor policy and implications for MDGs achievement, David Abbott, UNDP Paci\ufb01c Centre Compared to the high GDP growth rate in Asia, there has been highly variable growth rates in the Paci\ufb01c, and in general, the region has witness slow growth of only 1.7% per annum. Poverty might therefore have increased in many households in the Paci\ufb01c. While broad- based economic growth is recognised as a necessary condition for poverty reduction, growth alone is not su\ufb03cient and requires an enabling environment for economic opportunities to be created for the poor to improve their lives. Good pro-poor policies tend to target the most disadvantaged population groups, and aim at increasing the income levels of the poorest at a faster rate than the average income as a whole, hopefully resulting in a reduction in inequality. In formulating MDG-based national development strategies, it is important to ensure that MDG-focused policies are pro-growth in the long term, and equally imperative to ensure consistency between macro and growth policies and pro-poor, MDG-focused policies, looking at the impact of economic reform on those who are disadvantaged and vulnerably. Policies and strategies also need to be holistic and address linkages among sectors, with Government prioritising, where necessary. A sound \ufb01scal policy will put in place non-discriminatory tax and tari\ufb00 policies, and ensure that budgets are transparent, with resource allocations increased for services used by the poor and women in particular, and user charges based on the ability to pay. A proper costing of policies can be done based on clear, target goals and targeted interventions; assessing the impact of policies; the unit cost of delivery; and the cost of doing nothing. It was noted that inaction can have a cost impact as in poor health, poor educational attainment, social tension, pressure on infrastructure, etc. Child-friendly policy and child-friendly budget for MDGs achievement, Mereia Carling, UNICEF The presentation highlighted that focusing on children is one way of achieving the MDGs as many MDGs relate to children. The key principles of child friendly policy as re\ufb02ected in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) are universality, non-discrimination, indivisibility, participation and accountability. These provide a framework for thinking about the needs of all children. In thinking about universality and the budget, for example, the objective is to ensure that it takes into account all the rights of all children and do not leave some behind. This means that in achieving all rights of all children, governments need to balance key priorities with competing resources. The principle of non discrimination ensures no child is excluded. An example is to ensure that all children in rural areas have access to water (MDG7) so that they can all go to school (MDG2). The rights of children are inter-related just as the MDGs are inter related, reinforcing the principle of indivisibility and an integrated approach to achieve all rights.

The impact of migration on population structures in Polynesia: Implications for MDGs achievement, Jean Louis Rallu, UNFPA In Polynesian PICs, large scale international migration impacts strongly on age structure and dependency ratios, reaching 80% in Tonga, Samoa and Tokelau and around 65% in Cook and Niue \u2013 due to lower fertility in the latter. Such high ratios are due to depleted adult cohorts and large number of children. High fertility is a strategy to avoid population decline and provide future migrants to ensure constant \ufb02ow of remittances. The Demographic Window of opportunity is less an issue in migration countries, because the work force is abroad and sends remittances. However, this has drawbacks, as brain drain reduces quali\ufb01cation of local work force and remittances are mostly used for consumption, and much less for investments and savings. Brain drain and departures of most entrepreneurial adults are also detrimental to social and political change. In terms of achieving the MDGs, a stable population due to migration tends to ease coverage of services, but the quality is low and hinders progress in health and education. It is still debated whether remittances reduce or increase inequalities. It is clear that poor households have fewer migrants and usually receive less remittances than richer households whose migrants are more quali\ufb01ed. However, even limited in\ufb02ow of remittances can lift a number of households out of poverty. Making the islands attractive (investments policies, good governance, openness to new ideas, etc) enough to return (or circular) migrants is the challenge to reap the bene\ufb01ts of circulation of elites that would increase local technical capacity and development. A vicious circle can be identi\ufb01ed with low quality of education resulting in low quali\ufb01ed migrants who are subjected to unstable employment in rim countries and send less remittances than more quali\ufb01ed migrants with stable/formal employment and higher wages, and \ufb01nally are often in poverty. Gender-responsiveness for MDGs achievement, Ana Laqeretabua, UNIFEM The presentation highlighted the centrality of gender equality to the Millennium Declaration which provides a broad framework for working towards achievement of the MDGs. Paci\ufb01c commitment to gender equality is theoretically strong, with 14 countries having rati\ufb01ed CEDAW and many National Women\u2019s machineries having National Women Action Plans. However, a lack of technical capacity on gender hampers implementation of commitments on the Beijing Platform for Action and the Paci\ufb01c Platform for Action. Strategic entry points to ensure that the MDGs promote gender equality include framing national indicators that respond to CEDAW and Beijing priorities, improving statistical capacity on gender equality issues, and identifying appropriate implementation measures. In this last respect, the CEDAW Committee Concluding Comments often give guidance on speci\ufb01c gender equality measures that can be implemented. Because of the unprecedented global consensus on the MDGs, they provide an opportunity to improve coordination on gender equality concerns and raise them to higher policy levels. The national planning process therefore allows countries to re-energize gender equality initiatives. Conversely, gender equality indicators can also support CEDAW implementation, highlighting the mutually reinforcing relationship between the MDGs and human rights frameworks. In mainstreaming gender in a programme or project, it is important to understand existing 8 Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for the Polynesian Countries gender roles and the cultural context of gender, include gender issues in the assessment phase (ensure gender analysis is carried out), integrate gender speci\ufb01c actions, and take account of gender indicators in all phases of programming, including in monitoring and evaluation. The presentation was followed by a group exercise to encourage participants to think through gender friendly policies and how to ensure the gender perspective is addressed when decisions are made. The group discussions on the case study were very lively and participants were quick to identify the likely impacts of privatisation on women and also on men.

MDG-based national development strategies often strengthens the coherence between planning and budget processes, as costing allows planners to allocated resources to clearly identi\ufb01ed interventions. An important aspect of MDG-based NSDS is that it links to the macro- economic framework, looking at the need for scaling up of public investments with implications for economic growth and income distribution. MDG-based NSDS provide a monitoring and accountability framework and because they are comprehensive, prioritized and costed, can support policy dialogue and negotiations between countries and their development partners. The guiding principles to prepare an MDG-based NSDS is that they are best done when there is high level commitment; the process is nationally owned, inclusive, transparent; it \ufb01ts into ongoing processes; and it is regularly reviewed. The key steps are to start by (i) setting and/or adapting targets as it de\ufb01nes the scope and scale of interventions; (ii) review existing plans and establish baselines as many countries already have sector strategies; (iii) undertake the needs assessment /costing through 2015. The needs 9 Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for the Polynesian Countries assessment /costing is a bottom up approach to planning which looks at the total cost of interventions, and speci\ufb01es interventions such as goods / infrastructure/ services; de\ufb01nes coverage targets for each interventions; estimate the resource needs - both recurrent and capital cost; and check results; (iv) develop a consistent macro-framework, policies and \ufb01nancing strategy; and (v) develop a MDG-based long term development strategy. Currently, there are 9 MDG needs assessment /costing tools developed. During the discussions, concern was raised over who will pay the cost if the costing exercise is an unconstrained exercise. It was clari\ufb01ed that \ufb01nancing is part of the process, and although the costing exercise is separate, the two are linked and required. The issue of estimating total costs as opposed to incremental cost was also debated, as in some sectors, things change over time. It was pointed out that as the costing exercise is done over a 10- year period or more, the exercise has to be an iterative one, revisiting the cost every 3 years or so, to re\ufb02ect changes. Discussions also highlighted that sectors need to be realistic in identifying interventions and estimating the resource needs, and avoid coming up with wish lists. Planning and Budgeting to achieve the MDGs, Emma Sanopo, National Economic Development Authority, Government of Philippines The presentation on the Philippine highlighted that the Development Plan integrates the MDGs, child-friendly policies and population policies, with linkages done from the regional to the local level, and subsequently integrated at national level. The Framework Plan from which programs and projects are identi\ufb01ed is the investment program. The budget framework indicates what the national government intends to spend and includes the source of funds. The budget preparation starts with the budget call followed by budget hearing, before line agencies\u2019 budgets are consolidated for approval by the President. Public expenditures are managed to keep public spending within a\ufb00ordable limits, spend on the right things and at reasonable cost. Philippines has an MTEF which is a top-down budget allocation process based on policies and the priorities set by the national government. It is also a bottom-up estimation of the cost of policies, programs and projects. This goes together with an organizational performance indicator framework to focus expenditure on priorities. The planning process is anchored in data gathering and analysis, including identi\ufb01cation of gender issues, which is integrated in the socio-economic pro\ufb01le which addresses physical, economic, social and other issues. The Budget Circular states that each Ministry must allocate a minimum of 5% of their budget to gender and development (GAD).

Cook Islands highlighted that in their case, the gender budget is mostly for salaries and there 10 Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for the Polynesian Countries is a strong reliance on donor funding to implement projects. Other participants mentioned that there is often a reliance on annual budget with no links to a medium term planning and budget framework, and if the funds are not spent, these usually revert back to the Ministry of Finance. The need to review legislation in order to incorporate projects for a lifespan of 3 years or more into an MTEF and have them costed was debated. It was recommended that donor funding aligns with the multi-year funding framework. MDG \ufb01nancing and linking cost estimates with national budgetary/ \ufb01scal instruments: The core of the MDG Initiative, Anuradha Seth, UNDP Regional Centre Colombo The issue of how to \ufb01nance the MDGs is critical for several reasons: (a) as most of the funding is from public investments for basic social services, there is often a need to scale up public investments if the MDGs are to be achieved; (b) ODA increases for MDG investments have not been forthcoming, and there is a need to look at an exit strategy from ODA in the long term; and (c) the implementation of a national plan requires resources. To estimate the MDG \ufb01nancing gap, the total volume of capital and recurrent resources required can be derived from the needs assessments for achieving each MDG. Since government already has MDG-related programmes \ufb01nanced from public funds, the gap is between the investment needs and what government is already spending. In doing this, a key technical issue is to determine what constitutes MDG-related expenditures. The conceptual framework for \ufb01nancing the MDGs is to undertake a \ufb01scal space diagnostic, looking at the four pillars of ODA, domestic revenue mobilisation, public borrowing and reprioritisation and e\ufb03ciency of expenditures. The experience of Bhutan\u2019s formulation of a national strategy to \ufb01nance the MDGs and the results was shared in detail. The discussions highlighted the challenge of identifying resources to \ufb01nance the MDGs in small Paci\ufb01c Islands Countries. A key point was made that while the most important bilateral donors have continually increased ODA year by year to PICs (except for PNG), \ufb01nancing the MDGs is not just about ODA, and governments have to look at resources which can be mobilized domestically, including through reprioritization from one sector to another. Public borrowing should be a last resort. Countries questioned whether the Paris Declaration requires an exit strategy from ODA. It was clari\ufb01ed that exit strategies are usually required at project level. Day 2 - Session IV - Objective: Introducing the Needs Assessment / Costing Tools to support policy formulation at sectoral and national levels Introducing the Education Costing Tool, David Abbott, UNDP Paci\ufb01c Centre The Education Costing Tool - as is the case for the other Costing Tools - consists of excel spread sheets put together based on formula. As such, while the tools are comprehensive, they are not complex. In the Education MDG, three areas are highlighted: universal primary education, equality of access for boys and girls and for urban and rural children, and the quality of educational attainment. The Education Model (EPSSim) was developed by UNESCO and re\ufb01ned by UNDP BDP and RCC. The tool is comprehensive and can be used to cost all aspects of education policy. The key starting point for using the tool is to decide what the targets are (cost of building more schools, cost of sta\ufb03ng more schools in outer islands, etc). So it can be used to cost a whole range of policy options. Data requirements for input into the model is mostly demographic data and unit cost. The basic population for education is the number of children - boys and girls - entering the school each year and population growth rates; a base year to start the simulation exercise; data on class size; and measures to address high levels of drop-outs and the cost of these measures. 11 Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for the Polynesian Countries The introduction of the model was followed by a practical exercise which allowed participants to have hands-on experience with the education tool.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e3f306d-37ad-4028-841f-40a01943b3c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e3f306d-37ad-4028-841f-40a01943b3c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based Planning, Costing and Budgeting for the Polynesian Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "83b1890f862c61dc0c2b628e22879743182d47e049b381a126575a2ee9c18add"}, "2": {"node_id": "6af1732c-13bb-4acb-ac63-b1403ccab9fc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d20676a9b5b50d81596746fae7a3a7f83f37333840333206d9e6e2d6c82da39"}}, "hash": "8bf068ad0025b0f0ebf624bd7e4e0629853ffeb7ead6477df173d40a7771529d", "text": "There was strong interest in the costing tool as participants recognized that it enabled sta\ufb03ng requirements, infrastructure needs and other goods such as school materials, curriculum, etc to be costed.

The linkages between HIV/AIDS and human development are complex and HIV appears to thrive more on income and gender inequalities rather than on poverty itself. Reported HIV cases in Polynesia are still low; however, they are increasing over the years and the small populations of Polynesian islands make them vulnerable. The high rate of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) found in Polynesia is a particular cause for concern as STIs are known to considerably increase vulnerability to HIV infection. There are socio-cultural and structural factors including gender inequalities, high mobility (of men in particular) and unfavorable laws for HIV response that can also contribute to higher HIV susceptibility and hinder the response. These issues are usually not factored in existing budgeting and costing exercises for HIV responses which tend to be essentially health-centric. The MDG costing model demonstrated includes a new area of costing labeled \u201cEnabling Environment\u201d. It allows users to design and cost a number of interventions outside the typical health sector that are essential to consider in order for more comprehensive responses to HIV. Paci\ufb01c countries and Polynesian islands in particular, still have a window of opportunity to move from commitment to action. It is important that the responses being designed are based on thorough appraisals of the cultural, political, social and economic parameters that could potentially drive HIV as well as draw on lessons learned from around the world. This is essential if the dramatic human, social and economic consequences witnessed in the comparatively more a\ufb00ected regions of the world are to be averted. Day 3 - Session V: Objective: To look at how the environment and energy costing tools can support policy development, and draw linkages between development processes and disaster risk reduction for MDG achievement Energy and poverty linkages, Thomas Jensen, UNDP Regional Centre Bangkok/UNDP Paci\ufb01c Centre A key issue in Polynesian countries is the very high cost of petroleum products and electricity, particularly in remote/outer islands. The very high PIC oil price vulnerability has been documented by the Asia-Paci\ufb01c Oil Price Vulnerability Index (OPVI) developed by UNDP. The recent year\u2019s increases in oil prices have had very severe impacts at macro- economic, sector as well as household levels. For instance, in all the Polynesian PICs there are low income households who use little petroleum fuel and electricity because of their high cost even when they are easily accessed. The key message is that without access to reliable and a\ufb00ordable modern energy services, achievement of the MDGs will not be possible in the Polynesian PICs. A revised energy costing tool that has been designed speci\ufb01cally for the Asia-Paci\ufb01c region was presented against this background. The revised energy tool captures Asia-Paci\ufb01c regional speci\ufb01c energy planning and costing issues. The key aim of this tool is to facilitate policy dialogue, by providing countries with a methodology for estimating the cost of energy needs related to meeting their needs and the MDGs. 12 Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for the Polynesian Countries The discussions focused on the rising prices of energy and how PICs can mitigate this pressing concern. The possibility of PICs using indigenous resources (such as wind, solar, biomass and hydro power) was debated. It was noted that coconut seems to be a viable renewable energy resource in Tokelau. The issue of using income generating commodities to inject money into the national budget in order to o\ufb00set the rising prices of energy was also raised. On the issue of biomass and biofuel, countries noted that if there are changes in patterns of cropping leading to signi\ufb01cant portion of traditional land being cut down, this again could lead to vulnerability in terms of land degradation. It was apparent that as the price of oil continues to increase, the economics of renewable energy are becoming more attractive. This being said, as in many other areas there are economies of scale. The cost e\ufb00ectiveness of energy alternatives (as for instance compared to diesel power systems) is thus a very important issue for small islands. In looking at a way forward, countries encouraged donors to build on past experiences (good as well as the bad ones) so as to make progress instead of repeating past mistakes including using in a PIC context proven technologies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "680a3f22-9670-4b92-8feb-addf2e445800": {"__data__": {"id_": "680a3f22-9670-4b92-8feb-addf2e445800", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based Planning, Costing and Budgeting for the Polynesian Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a3f87c798affcb5f7263c7610589a4b1c9b715f28e8255c3c4ec7a245f3bfa81"}, "2": {"node_id": "58d4fcbf-2197-4c04-81b2-b2ca6f40eff6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3515e2a3ddc178268099d5ef89acd849163621553eb97dcfac61b88c40ecbcf1"}}, "hash": "ae7966804aeb9f11ffabd02fd728f50ce96c396d73bdb1413c97a2679569dfb5", "text": "Environment, Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction - Policy implications for the Paci\ufb01c region, Herman Timmermans, UNDP Paci\ufb01c Centre In setting the scene, the inter relatedness between environment, climate change and disaster risk reduction was highlighted.

Islands are more vulnerable than mainland, and the linkage people have with natural resources must not be disrupted when dealing with development. A useful distinction was made between environmental conservation (putting aside areas where ecosystems are preserved) and environmental management (land use planning, zoning, etc). Paci\ufb01c SIDS are at greater risk to disasters and hazards, and while we cannot do much about physical hazards, it is possible to reduce socio-economic vulnerability. Evidence suggests that climate is changing and sea level is rising, with associated hydro- meteorological hazards expected to increase in frequency and intensity, putting Paci\ufb01c SIDS at further risk. Consequently, there is an increased urgency to manage development processes in order to reduce vulnerability and risk. 13 Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for the Polynesian Countries Some PICs are now developing National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) and many have Country Climate Change Teams. While Paci\ufb01c SIDS have policies to address vulnerabilities, there is often a lack of cohesion between economic, social and environmental policies. The most serious policy implication is that without adequate planning to reduce environmental impact, vulnerability and risk, and address climate change, the MDGs will be harder to achieve (water, education, health infrastructure, income, inequalities between men and women, etc). The over-arching policy response is to mainstream environment, disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change (CC) into national development policy, planning, budgetary processes and sectoral policy and planning, and ensure that strategies to address the MDGs do not add to risks. Environmental activities under MDG 7 also need to take gender into account. Recently, the GEF Paci\ufb01c Alliance for Sustainability (GEF-PAS) program was approved for Paci\ufb01c SIDS to tap into. The discussions brought out further that development is a double edged sword, and that Paci\ufb01c countries need to consider two key issues: \u2022 While environment is a cross cutting issue which all sectors should address, having a stand alone agency facilitating the required mainstreaming process is very important. \u2022 Have a close relationship between civil society and government.

Environment costing tool, Thomas Jensen, UNDP Regional Centre Bangkok/UNDP Paci\ufb01c Centre The presentation emphasized how the diverse ecosystems of the Paci\ufb01c region play a vital role in meeting basic human needs, supporting sustainable livelihoods and contributing to national economic development. For instance the tourism, agriculture and \ufb01shing sectors contribute very signi\ufb01cantly to national economic development in most of the Polynesian PICs. Thus environmentally sustainable investment clearly matters in the Paci\ufb01c region and the environment costing tools can assist to estimate the associated costs to support environment interventions as part of a strategy for meeting the MDGs at the national level. Intervention areas in the tool as well as the strategic actions are indicative only and can very easily be modi\ufb01ed to re\ufb02ect country speci\ufb01c situations in the Polynesian countries. As with the other costing tools, the introduction was followed by a hands-on approach to give participants a better understanding of how the tool operates and the areas captured.

Tokelau Case Study, presented by Afega Gaualofa, Senior Policy Advisor, Taupulega O\ufb03ce The National Development Plan has a 3-year time frame 2007-2010, set to closely link with the Economic Support Arrangement (ESA) with New Zealand. In both of these documents, Tokelau has highlighted the following priorities for the 3 year period: Village Development, Health, Education, Transport, Economic Development and Communications and IT. Priorities are established through the National Fono (General Assembly) which has representatives from all 3 villages as well as village consultations. Clear National Development Guidelines ensure that the National Development Plan relates to sector plans. Approval for the NDP is conferred through the Council of Elders, the Council for Ongoing Government and the National Assembly. Departmental bids for government budget contributions are based on these plans. The monitoring framework includes monthly and 6-monthly reports on Government budget contribution, complemented by the following reporting on donor contribution: internal monthly report, quarterly reporting to donors and 6-monthly internal reporting. The Tokelau presentation had a speci\ufb01c focus on the health MDGs, re\ufb02ecting the following results: on MDG 4, over the last 2 years there have been 3 infant deaths in Tokelau. On MDG5, while in most years there are no maternity deaths, over the past 2 year, Tokelau recorded 2 maternal deaths due to pregnancy complications. On MDG6, while there is no HIV case, there is a high incidence of STIs among mobile populations as well as a high incidence of NCDs which makes a signi\ufb01cant dent in the budget. On MDG7, every house has safe and adequate drinking water, with about 60% of the population accessing basic sanitation. It was noted that climate change is a severe issue for Niue, with huge implications on the livelihood of this small island. Tonga Case Study, presented by Dr. Malakai Ake, Ministry of Health The Tonga Strategic Development Plan builds on the theme of the \ufb01rst National MDG Report in 2005. The Strategic Development Plan Eight (SDP8) 2006-2009 is a 3-year plan, with an annual review and an update done every 6 months. The SDP8 is a milestone for the kingdom of Tonga as it is the \ufb01rst plan which underwent national consultation throughout all the islands, and with the public and private sectors. Government ministries have Corporate Plans based on the SDP8, which aligns with the MDGs. The draft SDP8 is approved by the Prime Minister and endorsed by Cabinet before approval by Parliament. 15 Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for the Polynesian Countries In terms of linkage to the budget process, the \ufb01rst step was to link the MDGs to the SDP8 and subsequently link the plan to the budget. SDP8 is a key policy instrument and has mandated performance indicators. The budget process requires that all ministries comply with a checklist which includes: (a) a Corporate Plan, (b) Expenditure and Revenues, (c) Sta\ufb00 Proposals, and (d) Performance Indicators. The Ministry of Planning and Ministry of Finance have now been merged into one entity, potentially enhancing the link between policy, planning and budgeting. Community development funded by donors is led by NZ (67% of funding, and 11% by Japan, EU and Australia respectively) and this is complemented by government funding for community development. A monitoring mechanism is in place to follow up on the implementation of the SDP8. The discussions highlighted the degree to which the planning and budgeting processes vary from country to country. It was noted that in the \ufb01ve countries present at the workshop, there is a lack of consultation with civil society when it comes to the budget process in spite of the fact that the national development plans emphasize the need for engagement with all actors. Consultation is much more meaningful on the national development plans. Participants felt that e\ufb00orts should be made for more consultations outside of government agencies with civil society.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3beb8615-8621-4c61-b53c-a5a3a149ad6b": {"__data__": {"id_": "3beb8615-8621-4c61-b53c-a5a3a149ad6b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based Planning, Costing and Budgeting for the Polynesian Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6553db7de8caaa55ab51fff2a5738e443414711104b91aa22a70afaccb0961ab"}, "2": {"node_id": "a95c1098-9f65-43e2-afce-880331f196f7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c99725636e34e2157b19f57b7ad75bb40ca66e323206ee5459fcde8196249bc6"}}, "hash": "213fbf4c272ab0e78b672bcb5fffb2386dae8267404ed259c3bab45c1a5ea9bb", "text": "It was also clear that in most countries, the budget allocation is done on an annual basis even if the development plan has a 3-year or longer time frame.

Countries noted that the MDG costing tools would be helpful in costing sectoral plans, but that it would be important to distinguish between the cost of achieving stated objectives and what can be a\ufb00orded in each country. Concern was raised over data and information systems in some PICs, and the need to integrate all data collection to better support reporting, monitoring and evaluation. Samoa Case Study, presented by Litara Taulealo, Principal Sector & Projects Planning O\ufb03cer, Ministry of Finance Samoa has a strong planning framework with the national plan (4-year) setting the overall policy objectives. The sector plans set the strategic direction for the sectors and have a medium term (5-10 years) focus. These are complemented by Corporate Plans which set out the approaches to be undertaken by government agencies to achieve stated policies. The \ufb01nal step is an Annual Management Plan which outline annual strategies/activities to achieve the objectives of corporate plans, and link with the budget. The budget process reconciles \ufb01scal targets with the need to reduce public debts. With those \ufb01scal targets in mind, ministries are given a ceiling to align their submissions. National priority setting is informed by a situational analysis and consultation with stakeholders by sector. The national vision is then established and submitted to Cabinet for endorsement. The SDS 2008-2012 is the 6th SDS, with the same vision of \u201cImproved Quality of Life for All\u201d as before. The focal areas include economic policies, social policies, public sector management and environmental sustainability. Notable changes from previous SDS include a comprehensive assessment of past performance, incorporation of relevant regional and international development goals (including the MDGs), an M&E framework, and environmental sustainability as a new goal. 16 Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for the Polynesian Countries In terms of the relationship between sector plans and the SDS, it is recognized that sector plans are a means to implement the SDS. Consequently, sectors are encouraged to develop MTEF simultaneously as a basis for integration into the budget, in line with the introduction of forward estimates. This provides a logical framework between planning, budget and a clear allocation of resources. Priorities are re\ufb02ected through a program of activities that have funding endorsed over the medium term, with the MTEFs integrated into the budget where these have been developed. The SDS implementation matrix is also used as a basis for identifying sector priorities and corporate objectives. Challenges include the consultation process which can be costly and sometimes is overdone; the planning linkages which are clear on paper but can be di\ufb03cult to implement; the need to have sector planning completed across government (only 5 out of 15 ministries have sector plans); and in relation to that, the development of the MTEF. The lack of institutional capacity in some sectors makes all this di\ufb03cult. Cooks Islands Case Study, presented by Liz Koteka, Director of Policy and Planning, Central Policy & Planning O\ufb03ce, O\ufb03ce of the Prime Minister The Te Kaveinga Nui (2007-2010) - Pathway for Sustainable Development in the Cook Islands is the long term visionary framework for the country. \u2018Te Kaveinga Nui\u2019 which took 4 years to develop, seeks to respond to the 2020 challenge and is based on the achievement of the long term national vision: \u201cTo enjoy the highest quality of life consistent with the aspirations of our people, and in harmony with our culture and environment\u201d. Te Kaveinga Nui is translated into the National Sustainable Development Plan (NSDP) 2007-2010, NSDP 2011-2015 and 2016-2020, which are the medium term planning framework for the country. The NSDP outlines the strategic goals, strategies and targets covering social, economic, governance, environment and cultural values and has been developed in wide consultation with all key stakeholders. The \u2018Te Kaveinga Nui\u2019 and NSDP 2007 \u2013 2010 were launched in January 2007.

Currently, the Cook Islands have an annual budgeting process where appropriations are guided by the Budget Policy Statement (BPS) developed by 3 central agencies (O\ufb03ce of the Prime Minister, Ministry of Finance and Economic Management and the O\ufb03ce of the Public Service Commissioner). Although the BPS must be aligned to NSDP, this is problematic because the NSDP is neither prioritized nor costed. It is envisaged that subsequent NSDPs will be prioritized and costed at sector level. To ensure implementation of the NSDP and Sector Plans, a robust M&E framework is needed. In developing this framework, Cook Islands is challenged by the lack of baseline data, an area that needs strengthening. 17 Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for the Polynesian Countries This is an exciting time for the Cook Islands as it develops more robust, planning, budgeting and M & E frameworks. In all these activities the focus has been to move from output to outcome based systems so that results are not only e\ufb03cient but also e\ufb00ective. However, the Cook Islands recognize that it still has to address the de\ufb01ciencies in institutional frameworks, capacity and resources if it is to realize the goals of the NSDP and its long- term vision. The thrust of the Cook Islands presentation was to share its experiences in coordinating planning, budgeting and monitoring and evaluation frameworks with other Polynesian countries and in particular to highlight the challenges that it faces in the development and implementation of these frameworks. It is anticipated that the next round of planning will be a lot clearer, more coordinated and e\ufb00ective. Linking Policy, Sector Plans, and National Strategy and Budgeting to Achieve the MDGs: Good Practices, David Smith, UN-ESCAP The presentation outlined the linkages between policy, sector plans, national strategy, budgetary allocations and development outcomes. It was noted that many PIC governments \ufb01nd di\ufb03culty in translating their national policies and strategies into activities, projects and programmes funded through the government\u2019s own budget or funded by development partners. The presentation highlighted some of the reasons why these linkages are weak or do not exist. Reasons included the lack of coordination across government; the sidelining of a national strategy; lack of national ownership of the strategies; and lack of capacity in planning or policy o\ufb03ces. Critical good practices were outlined including the need for a strong agency to prepare, coordinate and monitor national plans; strong local ownership; sound analysis of local development challenges; and a budgeting system that supports the plan\u2019s priorities. A number of useful tools were identi\ufb01ed to assist in making the linkages more e\ufb00ective. These included sound ministry level corporate plans linked to the plan strategic priorities; a 18 Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for the Polynesian Countries plan monitoring system based on performance indicators and involving government and non-government organisations; and a budget system that includes aid resources and where ministry expenditure is based on clearly costed programmes to achieve national development goals including the MDGs. A Medium Term Expenditure Framework is a tool that can be used to plan well costed programmes within the \ufb01scal limits of the country. A more rigorous approach to testing the linkages was presented which involved a methodology for evaluating national development strategies. The evaluation methodology provides a means to identify key areas for improvement. The methodology is based on evaluating the extent to which national NSDS processes conform to good strategic planning and sustainable development principles. ESCAP has already tested this tool in a number of PICs. The discussions pointed to the importance of medium term budget framework to plan for forward estimates. The issue of local ownership and political commitment at the highest level before these processes can proceed was raised. The role of civil society in monitoring government commitment and the importance of governance to underpin planning and budgeting processes was also noted. In the Action Planning and the Way Forward session, the UNDP Paci\ufb01c Centre emphasised that the workshop was not a one-o\ufb00 event, and that it was important to identify areas in which countries needed additional support at country level to implement the proper linkages among policy, planning and budgeting.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d813d08-aac5-4b71-830f-96a3d738d636": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d813d08-aac5-4b71-830f-96a3d738d636", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based Planning, Costing and Budgeting for the Polynesian Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "63e646c4a12c234857fd51aa56081ac6436189f6c9a80baf41966eb89e234b6d"}, "2": {"node_id": "e1fcf180-4811-47d7-8751-96ba2c9263aa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee2aedba78b3a92d0dc62667ce86e3398a07ecdeba5298abce920d99184fde9c"}}, "hash": "9e03b7856a581a93810775809dcf0890c45d8160e10b2a47521c1866da84b74e", "text": "Participants were provided a template re\ufb02ecting the various issues addressed during the workshop and encouraged to provide feedback on the type of support needed for them to put into practice what they had learnt.

Let me extend a very warm welcome to you all, and hope that you will enjoy your visit to our island. Let me also express our appreciation to UNDP for choosing to organise this important sub regional event on the MDGs for the Polynesian countries in our country. We are proud to host you, and hope our country will live up to your expectations. This year is indeed a landmark year for the MDGs. At mid-point year, it is important to look back and re\ufb02ect on what countries have been able to achieve, and how far the international community has lived up to its pledges. The latest UNDP Human Development Report highlights the progress made by countries in the Polynesian sub region in terms of its human development index, with signi\ufb01cant progress recorded in education, health and other areas. Regional and National MDG Reports also con\ufb01rm the trends that the Polynesian countries are on track and likely to achieve the MDGs. As you know, the Cook Islands was among the \ufb01rst Paci\ufb01c Island Countries to produce a National MDG Report in 2005. This Report, which was \ufb01nalised through a participatory process involving a partnership with civil society organisations, which had an innovative focus in that it tailored certain MDGs, particularly MDG 6, to \ufb01t the local context by adding a goal on non-communicable diseases and MDG 9 on governance showing national support for the democratic voice of the people. Building upon the National MDG Report of Cook Islands, my government has taken the MDGs agenda forward by incorporating the MDGs into the National Sustainable Development Plan 2006-2010. While some progress has been made, we still need to address the issue of limited capacity due to our small population. Despite the challenges we face, the Cook Islands embraces the spirit of the Millennium Declaration and Development Goals, and we have resolved to ful\ufb01l our commitments and responsibilities to not only our own people but also to the world community. 36 Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for the Polynesian Countries As you are aware, the Paci\ufb01c Plan remains a key framework on regional cooperation and regional integration. At the Forum Leaders\u2019 Meeting in Tonga last October, Leaders notably committed to a \u2018whole of government\u2019 and stakeholder based approach to strengthening and developing National Sustainable Development Strategies, noting the importance of operationalizing National based priorities with national budgetary processes. Leaders also called on regional agencies and development partners to jointly plan and coordinate regional assistance in support of Forum Island Countries to ensure that sectoral and cross cutting issues, are addressed and implemented through NSDS (and related) processes, with climate change and energy security as priorities for 2008. Climate change has now become an unprecedented challenge for the 21st Century, and we need to collectively implement adaptation and mitigation measures so critical for the survival of small nations. Vulnerability to rising oil and food prices, distances from markets, small populations and gender inequities - and the inter-relatedness among them - are issues of paramount importance to small islands developing states in this region and we need to \ufb01nd sustainable solutions to address them. We also need to balance these competing priorities with an equitable allocation of resources and opportunities for all, in particular for our vulnerable communities. I am very pleased therefore to note that the focus of this sub regional workshop clearly responds to the needs outlined by Paci\ufb01c Leaders and to our own development concerns. I particularly welcome the seamless collaboration of UN Agencies working together at regional and national level as One UN, to bring coherence to interventions at ground level, thereby optimising the use of resources and expected impact. Along the same lines, I also welcome the presence of representatives of regional organisations at this workshop. I wish you the best for this workshop, and have no doubt that the outcomes will be achieved, given the commitment of every one to this event. I also encourage you to take some time to see what the island has to o\ufb00er and wish you a very pleasant stay in the Cook Islands. I now have the pleasure of declaring the workshop o\ufb03cially open.

Good morning to you all. I am very pleased to extend a very warm welcome to all of you on the occasion of this Sub-Regional MDG workshop on Planning, Costing and Budgeting, organised for Polynesian countries by the UNDP Paci\ufb01c Centre in collaboration with the UNDP Multi- Country O\ufb03ce based in Apia. Before I go any further, let me extend my gratitude and deep appreciation to the Prime Minister, Honourable Jim Marurai, the Government and the people of the Cook Islands for kindly accepting to host this sub-regional workshop in their beautiful country. I am sure the participants will experience the legendary hospitality, kindness and friendliness of the people of the Cook Islands. Let me also thank you, Honourable Prime Minister, for taking time out of your very busy schedule, and for gracing us with your presence this morning. We are very honoured by your presence. This sub-regional workshop is the third being held in the Paci\ufb01c region. Last year, the UNDP Paci\ufb01c Centre in collaboration with other UN Agencies and the UNDP Regional Centres in Colombo and Bangkok organised a similar sub-regional workshop for the Micronesian countries in June, and for the West Paci\ufb01c and Melanesian countries in November 2007, re\ufb02ecting the spirit of \u201cOne UN\u201d. We are very pleased, therefore, that this workshop is focused on addressing the speci\ufb01cities, unique needs and priorities of the Polynesian sub-region. 38 Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for the Polynesian Countries Honourable Prime Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen, This is a milestone year for the Millennium Development Goals and the Millennium Declaration. As many of you are aware, this year represents the mid-point year for the MDGs, as we are half-way between the Millennium Summit of 2000 and the deadline of 2015 to achieve the MDGs. By now, we are all very familiar with the MDGs: MDG 1 : Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger MDG 2 : Achieve universal primary education MDG 3 : Promote gender equality & empower women MDG 4 : Reduce child mortality MDG 5 : Improve maternal health MDG 6 : Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases MDG 7 : Ensure environmental sustainability MDG 8 : Develop a global partnership for development At this mid-point, much attention is understandably being placed on the performance of countries in their pursuit of the achievement of the MDGs and the partnership and global support required to reach these goals by 2015 \u2013 this global partnership is covered under MDG 8. This sub-regional workshop is important because it brings together countries with similar human development levels to share experiences and learn from each other. The Paci\ufb01c is one of the least developed regions in the world, and PICs face common challenges due to their small size, geographic location and frequent natural disasters. Development is hindered by isolation from foreign markets, small domestic markets, high living costs, lack of natural resources, periodic devastation from natural disasters, inadequate infrastructure, human capacity constraints, and declining populations through emigration. Natural disasters, especially cyclones, have had a devastating impact on all four countries. In 2004, cyclone Heta caused widespread destruction in Niue costing US$70 million.

The \ufb01rst is MDG 3 on gender equality & women\u2019s empowerment. Polynesian countries may not all be able to achieve this MDG. In February 2008, the UN Commission on the Status of Women met in New York to discuss the issue of Financing for Gender Equality. Member States who attended this meeting - which lasted two weeks - debated the challenges of achieving gender equality because of its centrality to reaching all the MDGs. Even though there is a speci\ufb01c goal on gender (MDG3), it is now clear that the MDGs can only be achieved if the gender dimension is addressed in each goal. Most countries were unanimous that more resources need to be made available to support developing countries to address gender inequalities such as gender-based violence, lack of female participation in the decision-making process and at political level, lack of access of women to paid employment, reducing the vulnerability of women to HIV and so on. I am therefore pleased to extend a particularly warm welcome to all the representatives of Ministries of Women who are represented here today. I hope that you will be able to take back a greater understanding of how gender is related to all the MDGs, and will be more capacitated to negotiate the mainstreaming and integration of gender in sector and national planning and budget processes. The second MDG that is unlikely to be achieved is MDG 7 environmental sustainability. Environmental degradation continues to be an important issue in the Cook Islands. All the Polynesian countries have very fragile environments and limited natural resources. Climate change is an issue that is threatening the very survival of some Polynesian countries, and may well reverse some of the MDG gains made so far. Although key national environmental policies and plans are in place, urgent action needs to be taken to address priority environmental issues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63fcef83-e478-4db9-8b2a-aa67eba625ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "63fcef83-e478-4db9-8b2a-aa67eba625ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based Planning, Costing and Budgeting for the Polynesian Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "633c99f2cd42d9ab31752dc6d342c22d6035803aef8ed0274b2bbe615f6a7ea2"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9abb9f3-c62f-4bb8-99ee-6d7065725ec3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ac304b2343d9e26ea86be0d3921483a614260515a91ccb4b94ad2052ecd1a2e"}}, "hash": "081ac9dda646a228f60c93985a6d68fdb32b29d1dc2adda24d1febab1bcb4dbd", "text": "Communities in some countries have started on-the-ground initiatives to integrate environmental management and livelihoods, and this can be a strategic entry point to achieve large-scale results and positive impact on the environment.

US$1 million has been provided by UNDP as seed funding for the Centre. 41 Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for the Polynesian Countries This workshop therefore directly responds to the needs and priorities of countries present here today. The various sessions will strengthen understanding of how national and local development priorities can align with the MDGs, how they can inform policy formulation at sector and national level, how they relate to sector and national plan and budgets. As Governments have a primary responsibility to meet the basic needs of their people, we hope to better equip government o\ufb03cials to ful\ufb01l this role as duty bearers. Civil society also has an extremely key role to play in meeting the Millennium Development Goals. In the Paci\ufb01c, including in the Polynesian sub region, local NGOs and civil society organisations, including faith-based institutions have been very active in advocacy and service delivery in education, health, women\u2019s issues, environment and so on. The Paci\ufb01c has a long tradition of consultation with the people, and it is important that this participatory process is maintained as countries open up the policy and budget debate to allow inputs from civil society. We hope therefore that this workshop will further deepen understanding of the various MDGs and what needs to be done, and that CSOs as right holders will work with Governments to contribute to achievement of the MDGs, holding governments accountable where necessary. I am therefore pleased to note the presence of several NGO and CSO representatives at this workshop, and I extend a particularly warm welcome to all of you. Let me emphasise that this sub regional workshop is not meant to be a one-o\ufb00 event. Rather, it is intended to further increase awareness and develop national capacities in policy, planning and budgeting. Recognising that some countries have developed relatively strong national capacities in some of these areas, we would like to build on this by introducing innovative approaches to planning to achieve national priorities and the MDGs. The workshop will also introduce sectoral costing tools developed by UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo and the UNDP Bureau for Development Policy. These costing tools can support governments to estimate expenditure in education, health, gender, energy, environment, infrastructure and other sectors, and also support prioritisation of interventions and policy options. During the Action Planning session on the last day of the workshop, you will have an opportunity to identify areas where further support is needed at country level so that capacity strengthening and enhancement takes place on an ongoing basis. For Cook Islands, Niue, Samoa and Tokelau I am pleased to announce that UNDP will be placing national Strategic Planners in the Ministries of Planning to support the process of mainstreaming MDGs into national development planning as well as serve as Liaison O\ufb03cers for UNDP and the UNDAF In closing, I would like to thank our colleague in the Government of the Cook Islands for o\ufb00ering to host this sub-regional workshop in Rarotonga, and for their invaluable organizational and logistical support, without which this workshop would not have been possible.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3514b267-f294-44da-9f71-d5c7e84de935": {"__data__": {"id_": "3514b267-f294-44da-9f71-d5c7e84de935", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based Planning, Costing and Budgeting for the Polynesian Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c0364f2c330af904a8c60272f5d95f76708fad387c90375e108244a61b6cb741"}, "2": {"node_id": "ed8d6d4c-7d52-48a7-9ca5-27a316c3b0c0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-polynesian-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b184162d549766e4ee99478506e48b13d7e27bfc8f293903d6ec262ec85a299"}}, "hash": "ccf1686144b6fb567dc64efabacc0344b5397ae3b88a05226a1af10e01799dd4", "text": "I would especially like to thank colleagues from the UNDP Paci\ufb01c Centre who conceptualized this workshop, provided the substantive content and made the arrangements, especially David, Carol and Mezi.

Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for Western Paci\ufb01 c countries Introduction As part of the UNDP Pacific Centre\u2019s efforts to strengthen national capacities for countries to comply with the 2005 World Summit Outcome on \u201cCommitment by all developing countries to adopt national plans for achieving the Millennium Development Goals\u201d, in early October 2006, a one-week regional workshop on MDG- based Planning and the Development of a Pro-poor Policy and Budgeting Framework was held in Nadi, Fiji. Organised by the UNDP Pacific Centre, in collaboration with UN and other regional organisation partners, the workshop brought together about 100 government participants from 15 Pacific Islands Countries, as well as UN colleagues. The objective was to strengthen the capacities of government counterparts (Ministries of Finance, Ministries of Planning, Ministries of Women, National Statistics Offices, sector Ministries) and UN staff in the areas of MDG-based planning, pro-poor policies and budgeting, following a gender-sensitive approach. As follow up to that regional workshop, sub regional workshops are being organised to focus on countries\u2019 specific priorities and needs. In this regard, a sub regional workshop was organised for the North Pacific countries (FSM, Marshall Islands, Palau and Kiribati) in June 2007. The second sub regional workshop was organised for Fiji, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Nauru and Tuvalu from 12-15 November 2007 in Solomon Islands. Organised by the UNDP Pacific Centre in collaboration with UNESCAP, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNDESA, and the UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, the workshop brought together approximately 60 participants from the Ministries of Finance, Planning, Health, Women and Energy or Environment as well as 2 representatives from civil society organisations from Fiji, Tuvalu, Nauru, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands respectively. A full list of workshop participants is available at Annex I. The workshop was meant to further strengthen planning, costing and budgeting practices in Pacific countries, and at mid-point to the 2015 deadline, focus efforts and resources towards bridging the gaps to reach the MDGs in the next 7 years. The main theme of the workshop was policy, planning, costing and budgeting to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, with a focus on some sectoral issues of relevance to the participating countries. The sub-regional workshop built on the 2006 Regional Workshop, and incorporated lessons learnt from the Nadi and North Pacific workshops both in the process and the content delivered. The objectives of the workshop were to: (a) build upon the foundation established in October 2006 by looking at MDGs and poverty data for progress monitoring and reporting in the five target countries; (b) introduce the planning, needs assessment and costing tools developed by RCC/ BDP and discuss how they can support policy development for the achievement of the MDGs in Small Islands Developing States; (c) strengthen national capacity to implement the MDGs and the Mauritius Strategy in PICs by making the appropriate linkages with national and sectoral plans, budget frameworks including gender responsive budgeting and the Pacific Plan; (d) address the linkages between poverty, energy, environment and climate change in the Pacific, including the need for a national integrated approach in disaster risk reduction; (e) strengthen planning and budget frameworks by reviewing the process of putting together an MDG-Based Plan or National Sustainable Development Strategy, including monitoring and evaluation; 2. Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for Western Paci\ufb01 c countries (f) strengthen the budgeting process at national level including a gender sensitive approach; Official opening of workshop The workshop was officially opened by Ms. Christina Carlson, UNDP Deputy Resident Representative, Solomon Islands. In her opening remarks, Ms. Carlson placed on record UNDP\u2019s appreciation to the Government of Solomon Islands for accepting to host this sub regional meeting on the MDGs. She highlighted that UN Agencies had come together as a truly One UN for the workshop, and that this partnership would also be reflected in the follow up at country level. As 2007 is the mid-point year for achievement of the MDGs, Ms. Carlson stressed the need for both additional resources and actions to accelerate progress towards the MDGs in the next seven years.

Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for Western Paci\ufb01 c countries Day 1 set a foundation for the following days by looking at how national priorities and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) can be integrated into national and sectoral planning and budget frameworks. Session 1 - Objective: To better understand poverty and MDG trends in the context of national development efforts in Western Pacific MDGs monitoring and reporting in Western Pacific, Carol Flore- Smereczniak, UNDP Pacific Centre The presentation provided some basic information about the MDGs, such as the source of the MDGs and the contextual background of the Millennium Declaration. Emphasis was put on the inter-relatedness of the MDGs, the revised MDG Framework since September 2007, the minimum threshold that the MDGs provide for every one, the centrality of gender to achieve all the goals, and the synergies between the MDGs and human rights instruments such as CRC, CEDAW and others. The role of UNDP as scorekeeper and campaign manager of the MDGs, and the fact that the MDGs represent selected country priorities and needs was looked at, before considering the reporting and progress of the five countries on each Millennium Development Goal. Generally, countries have made some progress on some goals, but these are insufficient to achieve all MDGs by 2015. The importance of linking national priorities requiring additional attention to national and sectoral plans so that budget allocations can be made for implementation was addressed, along with monitoring and evaluation. The role of CSOs in the MDG framework and the need to talk about the MDGs along with the Millennium Declaration were stressed. MDG 1: Definition and trends of poverty in Western Pacific, and policy implications, David Abbott, UNDP Pacific Centre The presentation on definition and trends of poverty highlighted the fact that all data provided came from Household Income and Expenditure Surveys (HIES), as all countries in the region have either had a HIES in the past 4 years, or will do so in the next year or two. Most countries will also have new census rounds in the next two years. Together, these will provide a significant increase in the source of information for the MDGs and other aspects of evidence-based policy-making. Poverty has many characteristics, comprising both low incomes and poverty of opportunity or lack of access to services. Women are often more severely affected by poverty and face more constraints than men to move out of poverty. A suggested Pacific definition of poverty is hardship which reflects an inadequate level of sustainable human development. Poverty and hardship can be measured both quantitatively through poverty lines and qualitatively through participatory assessments. The importance of understanding poverty and undertaking a gender sensitive poverty analysis to inform the formulation of gender responsive pro-poor policy making and appropriate budget decisions was highlighted. Indicators of poverty and inequality, and measures to break the self-perpetuating cycle of poverty were also discussed. The plenary discussions on MDGs and poverty highlighted the need for assistance to Nauru to update their data so that a National MDG Report can be compiled. Vanuatu indicated that their national data is not always disaggregated by sex and does not always reflect the reality as some areas (women, the disabled,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6db6e805-f580-474e-b26a-691d8c169fea": {"__data__": {"id_": "6db6e805-f580-474e-b26a-691d8c169fea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-western-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based Planning, Costing and Budgeting for Western Pacific Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-western-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f7484282b82b0bf31b0c97ccd2e31e58765b8bc74c10229d40016c6b68623162"}}, "hash": "f7484282b82b0bf31b0c97ccd2e31e58765b8bc74c10229d40016c6b68623162", "text": "etc) are not targeted. It was also 5. Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for Western Paci\ufb01 c countries stressed that the US$1 a day indicator is not relevant for PICs. Countries pointed out that they were still working on the poverty data, which should not be released until the data has been endorsed. Fiji pointed out the difficulty to undertake monitoring and evaluation of the Strategic Development Plan as there are problems with data, adding that resources would be required to support ministries and departments to update the data. Solomon Islands questioned why many countries have not made sufficient progress on the MDGs and what needed to be done. The need to maintain focus on reporting as an initial step and to address issues highlighted in the reporting through national / sectoral plans and appropriate budget envelopes was emphasised. Participants also queried whether loneliness can be looked at as part of poverty in the Pacific context, and how this would be researched. It was explained that the gradual breakdown of the traditional caring society and the impact of monetisation with children leaving the islands as they reach a certain age was having an effect, including resulting in loneliness. It was suggested that the number of households headed by elderly people could be examined to see whether they are better or worse off. Session 2 - Objective: Practical steps to integrate the MDGs into planning and budget frameworks, taking into account other frameworks such as the Mauritius Strategy and the Pacific Plan, chaired by Siliga Kofe, UNESCAP Integrating the MDGs into National Sustainable Development Strategies, including Monitoring and Evaluation, Matthias Bruckner, UNDESA A National Sustainable Development Strategy is a coordinated, participatory and iterative process (rather than a product) that supports national development. Deriving from the commitment of countries to prepare and implement NSDS in Rio in 1992 and reaffirmed in Johannesburg in 2002, NSDS are country driven and integrate economic, social and environmental pillars, and coordinate national strategies and sectoral plans. NSDS build upon existing information and processes to avoid duplication, and consider intra- and inter-generational equity for future generations. It is driven by broad participation of all stakeholders and partnership to foster ownership. There are different ways to organise an NSDS, depending on countries\u2019 institutional structures. A by-product of NSDS is that the process develops capacity for implementation. It focuses on priorities and outcomes for implementation and therefore has strong linkages to public investment and the budget. NSDS usually show strong coherence between international and national goals and targets. The MDGs are part of the sustainable development agenda, but sustainable development goes beyond the MDGs. Monitoring of NSDS is done at several levels: monitor the activities in the NSDS, monitor the effect and impact of NSDS on sustainable development, and monitor progress towards sustainable development (common indicators for the last two). Formulation of targets is important, and can be done in line with the MDGs, and with the involvement of National Statistical Offices throughout the process. From national strategy to sector plans: Why a longer-term vision must be translated into strategic objectives and sector plans to achieve the MDGs, David Smith, UNESCAP Pacific Island Countries have National Development Plans or National Sustainable Development Strategies (document). The issue is to what extent these plans reflect the principles of NSDS, which is the process surrounding the preparation of the plan. 6. Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for Western Paci\ufb01 c countries Often, sustainable development principles are integrated in policies and programs, but problems are encountered during implementation due to the involvement of several departments, and a lack of focus on development objectives. Grounded in lengthy consultative process to establish a vision, NDPs/NSDS address economic and social progress, followed by a review to determine main development challenges. This results in a set of priorities to be addressed in national strategies or visions, lead to sector plans, link to budget allocation and donor funds, and translate into development outcomes reflecting positive changes in people\u2019s lives. However, often linkages do not work because they do not exist, or there is a lack of monitoring and evaluation, or poor coordination between ministries and central agencies, or financial management reforms are underway. Examples of countries\u2019 institutional set- ups were provided for Vanuatu, Nauru, Tuvalu, Fiji and Solomon Islands, indicating differences in the way plans are developed and implemented. Countries face similar problems (slow implementation), and most deal with process (implementation, getting the budget in line with the priorities, etc.) rather than the document itself.

Linkages between the MDGs, the Mauritius Strategy and the Pacific Plan: Implications for NSDS implementation, including monitoring of progress, Philippe Boull\u00e9, Consultant The presentation highlighted the added value of the Mauritius Strategy amidst a multiplicity of other frameworks, and how it can be integrated into national development plans along with the MDGs and the Pacific Plan. The Preamble of the Mauritius Strategy states that as a follow-up to the Barbados Programme of Action (1994), the Strategy recognises the special circumstances and vulnerabilities of SIDS in achieving sustainable development, and is therefore one of the most important UN frameworks for SIDS. The Mauritius Strategy reaffirms the international status of 49 SIDS Member States as a specific group of countries at the UN and at international level. It is a partnership agreement containing obligations for both the international community and small islands states. Embedded in sustainable development, the Mauritius Strategy (proposals for development) can be summarised around four clusters: natural resources; economic issues; social issues; and governance and political issues. The MDGs, the Mauritius Strategy (MS) and the Pacific Plan represent a hierarchy of complementary frameworks which countries need to address within their NSDS or other national planning instruments. While the MDGs are a global framework for all countries, the Mauritius Strategy is an agenda specifically for SIDS, and the Pacific Plan provides a regional framework for Pacific Islands Countries (PICs). While there are systems in place to report on the MDGs and the Pacific Plan, countries need to develop their own monitoring and reporting of the MS which was adopted only in 2005, using existing tools, institutions and people, and involving all stakeholders. Countries have already done much to implement the MS, but this is not being captured in countries\u2019 reporting. Implementation of the MS requires its integration with national budgets, which can be done through linkages made in the NSDS. The plenary discussions revealed that participants were grappling with how to reconcile the MDGs, the Pacific Plan, the Mauritius Strategy and the NSDS. It was explained that the Pacific Plan is a guiding plan for the Pacific and provides a definition of sustainable development to which PICs may or may not have paid attention, while the Mauritius Strategy is a Strategy for SIDS. One way forward is to incorporate the framework of sustainable development as laid out in the PP within the NSDS or NDP, and use the MDGs as a guide to set measurable goals and monitor progress. The NSDS should address the MS at the same time, as there are 7. Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for Western Paci\ufb01 c countries strong linkages among these various frameworks. CSOs have an important role to play when governments plan and implement programmes. While CSOs need to hold government accountable, governments need to include and educate CSOs on planning, implementation and the role of governments and CSOs respectively vis-\u00e0-vis the public.

Why are these important for achievement of the MDGs?, David Abbott, UNDP Pacific Centre Pro-poor policies aim to target those who are most disadvantaged, either in income or opportunities, in a way that will change their situation in relation to those who are more well-off. They aim to increase the income levels of those who are poor at a faster rate than for other groups, so that as income levels rise, there is an improvement in other MDG indicators and, subsequently, in the overall standard of human development. Anecdotal evidence suggests that generally there has been a decline in standards of living in PICs because policies have not been pro-poor. The characteristics of pro-poor policies include being labour rather than capital-intensive, targeting sectors where the poor are engaged, and generating income and employment for marginalised communities. A two-way causality between growth and MDGs suggest that the MDGs are both an end in themselves and a means to setting targets for achieving high quality, sustainable growth. Since the poor and disadvantaged are often concentrated in specific sectors, pro-poor policies would target resources to these sectors to reduce inequalities, including those between women and men. In linking national strategies, pro-poor policy and the budget, there is need to derive a long term vision which highlights pro-poor and sector priorities and strategies which are then translated into strategic outcomes to be achieved over a shorter time frame (3-5 years). These strategies and priorities are then costed and integrated into annual budgets and MTEF. Because economic growth is a necessary but insufficient condition for poverty reduction, it is important to address the redistributive aspects of economic growth, high population growth rates, access to basic services and resources, governance, and prioritising the budget. Child-friendly policies and child-friendly budgets: linkages with MDG achievement, Will Parks, UNICEF The presentation looked at how to place children at the centre of policies and budgets, and why. Child friendly policies are a subset of policy-making and are vital to governments who have ratified the CRC. The principles of universality, non-discrimination, indivisibility, participation and accountability seek to ensure that all policies reach all children without excluding anyone, and satisfy all of their needs. Policies should be holistic and take account of other sectors, and mobilise many actors in development for implementation, sustainability and give voice to the voiceless. In essence, conditions need to be developed so duty- bearers and right-holders have capacity to fulfil and exercise their respective rights. 9. Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for Western Paci\ufb01 c countries Budgeting is a powerful tool to reduce poverty and analysis of the budget is a tool to keep children at the forefront of budget decisions. A child-friendly budget seeks to improve the condition of children, both girls and boys, in a country and focuses on education, health, protection, etc. Children experience poverty differently from adults and girls often experience poverty differently from boys. Consequently, poverty analysis should focus on children to determine whether they face lack (access to schooling, protection from abuse, nutrition, etc). Support is available from UN Agencies on costing tools, data analysis, and capacity strengthening in negotiation and harmonisation. Ecuador was mentioned as a strong advocacy model for child-friendly budget and child-friendly public policies. Session 3 - Objective: To look at the characteristics of population policy, chaired by David Abbott, UNDP Pacific Centre From Population and Development Policy to MDGs: The relationships between population and development variables, budgeting and MDG Progress in the Pacific, Jean Louis Rallu, UNFPA The presentation addressed the central role of population, including population projections, in MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting. The global context of the impact of population trends and structures (population momentum and window of opportunity) on development and MDG attainment was considered based on Pacific data. As the Pacific is late in reaching a window of opportunity, population projections in two hypotheses of rapid/slow fertility decline were presented for Solomon Islands, Fiji and Kiribati to illustrate possible trends in population size and dependency ratios and their benefits. Correlations calculated for a series of MDG indicators for 12 PICs illustrated the relationship between population growth, age structure and poverty/GDP per capita on one side, and MDG indicators levels and trends on the other.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38948dec-762b-4c31-948f-6d7e4e8275ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "38948dec-762b-4c31-948f-6d7e4e8275ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-western-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based Planning, Costing and Budgeting for Western Pacific Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-western-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3a266743e9883a9071ddc15e1fbce2035314bfc6cdffc420a0d7c523fcf0ac0"}, "2": {"node_id": "575bf4f4-cf47-4073-8526-b3af211920c0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-western-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0de27fd61ee0af8e1e286bc14e2e579aa0b94ea9e6179c2827927d43c9787815"}}, "hash": "ec09c2f6549b22946aa0f2afdb6f596e9cf2c94db0e727f3d26cb11fa8ea5313", "text": "With most PICs having dependency ratios above 70%, and more developed, emigration affected PICs having similar dependency as less developed, high fertility PICs, there is little correlation between age structure and MDG indicators.

Thus, the relationship between MDGs indicator levels and the likelihood of MDG attainment on one side and population/poverty variables on the other could be assessed for the Pacific, and awareness of participants on the role of population in development and state planning and budgeting was enhanced. There was much interest in the different types of policies. Participants discussed why countries should have population policies and what support they can receive to address these. It was explained that while people have the freedom to choose the number of children they can have, the family size determines how much and where resources are spent. Increasingly, people tend to have less children in order to have better quality of life. Nauru pointed out that there is no family planning and support is needed to address the growing population. Participants also recognize that people need to take more responsibility to improve their own lives and not always look for support elsewhere. Participants were keen to point out that the shift from an economic-centred approach to development to a people-centred approach focusing on women, children, the poor required a change in mindset and attitudes, as well as capacity building for both government and CSOs. Attention was drawn to the fact that there are many tools, approaches, filters which countries can use in their policy-making and planning (SWAPs, costing tools, peace and policy framework, etc). The aim of the workshop was to enhance participants\u2019 understanding of these various tools so they can choose the most appropriate ones, as \u201cplanning and policy making is deliciously messy\u201d. UN Agencies were asked to share guidelines on child-friendly policies and budgets. 10. Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for Western Paci\ufb01 c countries Session 4 - Objective: To look at how policies in the health sector can be costed, chaired by Ethel Sigimanu, Solomon Islands MDG needs assessment and costing methodology, Yuba Raj Khatiwada, UNDP Regional Centre, Colombo This session built upon the presentations on pro-poor policy and from national strategy to sector plans respectively by looking at how MDG needs assessment (NA) and planning can address the challenges. Needs Assessment is a tool for MDG-based planning which answers the question: what (interventions, resources, strategies, capacity, etc) will it take to achieve the MDGs? NA strengthens coherence between planning and budget processes, provides a proper monitoring and accountability framework, and has a strictly bottom-up approach. NA is necessarily integrated with other frameworks such as the MTEF. The guiding principle is that some of the core MDGs are state responsibility. Therefore NA focuses on all interventions that require full or partial public financing in terms of both capital and operating expenses. The MDG NA methodology includes four steps: identify interventions critically needed to achieve MDGs by 2015; specify coverage target; estimate resources; and check results for synergy, consistency and robustness of the costing exercise. MDG NA is only one aspect of the MDG-based planning process, and is complemented by macro framework, macro and sectoral policies and institutional set ups, thereby addressing policy issues. NA helps identify policy gaps, and in that process, it is also a built-in process to refine existing policies. Lessons learnt indicate that this is a process which builds capacity. Costing tools are available for the following sectors: Education, Gender, Health, Water and Sanitation, Energy, Transportation, Agriculture, Environment, HIV/AIDS. These are comprehensive tools which require capacity building for government and other partners. Addressing all the MDGs without trade-off with the macro-economic framework is not always possible. Other lessons learnt are to prioritize and sequence interventions, develop a financing strategy, and integrate with M & E. In the plenary discussions, participants noted that while the needs assessment and budget planning exercises are bottom-up approaches, these have to be reconciled with budget ceilings imposed in a top-down approach, and wanted to know how these can be handled. It was explained that the first step is to do a bottom-up analysis to determine how much resources are required, followed by the next step to identify how much additional resources can be mobilized. Through prioritizing and scaling up of resources, it is possible to integrate needs assessment and budget planning.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aba560a8-b013-4dbe-a13e-57895285a40f": {"__data__": {"id_": "aba560a8-b013-4dbe-a13e-57895285a40f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-western-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based Planning, Costing and Budgeting for Western Pacific Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-western-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6e68df477c7f82784ba827b4495a13c45fd40ae54e720a9531595e11f6676f2"}, "2": {"node_id": "eaf8c134-4586-47a0-975e-781a993fc3fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-western-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e8de762f13d9a2c2981ba673cdac200a343912831894302a32bff0602bdae94b"}}, "hash": "f459dbba1b3128d7238f13f67d799f94be5f66bbd6424ce87038fbd36c88d962", "text": "Building upon the sessions on MDGs and child-friendly policies respectively, participants also queried how coverage of immunization can be extended to all children in the face of financial, geographical, communication and infrastructural constraints.

Introducing the HIV costing tool, Kazuyuki Uji, UNDP Regional Centre, Colombo The presentation made the distinction between AIDS (physical state in which the body\u2019s immune system is too weak to defend against a range of diseases or opportunistic infections) and HIV (the virus that causes AIDS). HIV is singled out from the other two diseases in MDG 6 because of its strong correlation with achievement of the other goals. With over 95% of HIV infections happening in 11. Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for Western Paci\ufb01 c countries developing countries, HIV could greatly hamper poverty and hunger reduction efforts, with negative trickle down effects on education. HIV also disempowers women and young girls because they are more susceptible to HIV infection due to biological and cultural factors and unequal power relations between the sexes. Infants and children living with HIV tend to die early, and pregnant women with HIV are twice as likely to die as HIV-free pregnant women. People living with HIV are more prone to TB. In conclusion, HIV can negatively influence efforts to reach the MDGs. HIV has not yet taken a strong hold in the Pacific except for PNG, but according to ADB, the cost of the epidemic for the Pacific region is increasing. Factors fuelling HIV escalation in the Pacific include mobility; young population structure in Melanesia, particularly young girls and women; low contraceptive use, particularly condom use; strong stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV; and geographical difficulty in accessing services. Human rights based responses to HIV, Kazuyuki Uji, UNDP Regional Centre, Colombo The UNGASS Declaration reaffirms the full realisation of human rights (HR) as an essential element in the global response on HIV. To realise HR guaranteed by HR instruments, it is critical to enhance the capacity of duty bearers to meet their obligations and right holders to exercise their rights. In the context of HIV, it means viewing people as right holders and not just beneficiaries. Human rights are important in the context of HIV because violation of HR can be both a cause and consequence of HIV infection. Often those who are marginalised or whose rights are violated are more vulnerable to HIV, reflected in more women being infected than men in developing countries, as evidenced also in PNG. The follow-up group exercise on HIV and human rights was meant to encourage participants to think through some of the issues and challenges that need to be resolved and the various stakeholders who need to be involved in responding to HIV.

Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for Western Paci\ufb01 c countries Introducing the Health costing tool, Yuba Raj Khatiwada, UNDP Regional Centre, Colombo The purpose of this session was to look at how programs and activities in the health sector could be costed. The presentation highlighted that reaching the MDGs will require investing in a health system that can deliver quality essential health services to all of the population; such a health system should include prevention and treatment activities carried out in community, clinic and up to district, referral, and national hospitals. The presentation also emphasized that individual disease- focused programs (such as malaria control, antiretroviral treatment, etc.) cannot be viewed on a stand-alone basis but should be considered as part of a larger basket of essential health services. Estimating resource needs requires not only an assessment of individual-level inputs but a rigorous evaluation of the costs of establishing and maintaining a national level health system and the costs of public health activities. Main components of a functioning health system include scaling up system-wide health HR (including clinical and administrative staff), facilities and infrastructure, and improving the system\u2019s ability to plan, finance, and deliver high-quality health services by strengthening management capacity, improving M&E and quality assurance, enhancing community demand for and access to essential interventions, and building capacity for health research and development. The presentation was followed by a practical hands-on exercise on the Integrated Health Tool. The MDG-consistent HIV model is designed to calculate the total cost of HIV responses, but does not \u2022 Assess the impact of a response on the future course of the epidemic \u2022 Examine the cost-effectiveness of responses \u2022 Set priorities The key features of the model are that it is simple and user-friendly, integrates the cost of the \u201cEnabling Environment\u201d, is consistent with the MDG timeframe and target-based approach, and is compatible with UNAIDS targets for 2010 universal access for treatment. It calculates the cost of prevention, ARV treatment, care and support, health systems and cost summary. Participants found the health and HIV costing tools useful and comprehensive, and wanted to know what level of government officials would use them, and whether they were conducive to any country. It was pointed out that the costing tools are generic and countries can adapt them to their particular context. In addition, while use of the health costing tool would be led by the Ministry of Health, for example, several ministries would need to get involved including education, water and sanitation, statistical offices, etc. The level of persons involved would be middle-level government officials with influence on policy. Countries should ensure that data sources are accurate and reliable before inputting into the models. Participants requested that UNDP provides additional training on the various costing tools to familiarize them with these tools. UNDP highlighted that the workshop is not a one-off event but builds upon the regional MDG workshop held in Nadi in 2006. As such, the next step is to work with government and non-government counterparts in-country to address issues highlighted during the workshop discussions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8d46ead-ada4-402d-854c-731c0c5a763b": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8d46ead-ada4-402d-854c-731c0c5a763b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-western-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based Planning, Costing and Budgeting for Western Pacific Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-western-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5366a4115bafda22687ec5cb4bdbeaee83eb76af6e427e88bed8d5dd31b1ff8"}, "2": {"node_id": "7c4bda9a-c7da-4345-9097-42da4c36efca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-western-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e37f2672f448c8a5b3b76fb801d99d5cbdf9bfafbecd826e21c6f7dec8df72a"}}, "hash": "c7f4f2165caaabca73daafa58d7c8d40aa4c92505fe73138303f8ef82cbf08b1", "text": "This would be discussed in more details in the Action Planning session on the last day. 16.

The education costing tool was developed by UNESCO and later refined by UNDP BDP / RCC. Some further refinements are necessary so that the tool can be used by Small Islands States. The tool can be used to cost all aspects of education policy at all levels of education. It is a comprehensive model which can be used for discrete modules of education and can be tailored to meet the needs of individual countries. Data needs for the model include: (i) population and population growth rates to provide levels of education enrolment; (ii) selecting a base year data so that the model starts at a particular point; (iii) universal primary education almost reached for most PICs; (iv) measures to reduce the level of drop-outs /push-outs and the cost of these measures; basic education ratios (pupil / teacher ratio); current class size and target class size. It is necessary to look at implications for additional classrooms, additional teachers, teacher supply and qualifications, subsidies to poor families as well. Data needs include unit costs (teacher salaries, support staff salaries, administrative support, cost of books, additional classrooms, additional teachers, maintenance costs). Additional data include GDP per capita (as a basis to calculate teachers\u2019 salaries), annual salary increases, and efficiency gains. Participants were very interested in the education costing tool, and made the linkages between this and previous presentations. They were keen to know how the costing tool Workshop participants familiarize themselve with the HIV Costing Tool. 17. Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for Western Paci\ufb01 c countries could be useful in factoring in the number of drop-outs or push-outs. It was noted that, in recognition that many young people are better at skills levels, the model can cost improvements to technical and vocational training levels to provide certain basic skills to young people. This will enable them to take advantage of opportunities in different fields such as various labour migration schemes in the Pacific. Discussions also highlighted that the model looks at the mainstream education system, but can be adapted to look at the cost of provision for children with special needs by inputting the data. Although the model is a budgeting tool, it can assist ministries to upgrade the quality of education by looking at what is needed to strengthen the system and cost these inputs. Session 6 - Objective: To look at how the energy costing tool can support policy development, and draw linkages between development processes, climate change and disaster risk reduction for poverty reduction and MDG Achievement, chaired by Banuve Kaumaitotoya, Fiji Energy & Poverty linkages: policy implications for achievement of the MDGs, Patil Balachandra, Consultant Energy is both the driver of the MDGs and its absence is the cause of poverty, as economic activities cannot be performed without energy. Human welfare is thus linked to sustainable economic development. Access to information through media such as television, internet, etc. is defined by the ability to adopt and use modern technologies, which transform natural resources into goods and services useful for human life. What matters most for the poor is energy end- use services which should be accessible, affordable, adequate and of high quality. From the MDGs aspect, cooking, lighting, cooling are important to improve human development indicators, particularly if the economy is dependent on agriculture and needs energy for preservation or transformation of raw material. Information - when translated into knowledge - brings informed decision-making. The oil prices vulnerability index, which ranks countries according to their vulnerability to rising oil prices, indicates that Melanesian countries (Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa) are highly vulnerable to oil prices. PNG is in the medium category because of its oil production. Hardship is experienced in the Pacific due to high vulnerability to energy shortages, as access to electricity is relatively low (<25%) in Melanesia, except for Fiji where it is around 50%. Possible strategies to increase access to energy is through PPP, donor support, or independent carriers, which may not always be applicable in SIDS. Plenary discussions emphasised the linkage between oil prices and the standard of living in countries. Vanuatu, for example, has high energy use and if the price of oil continues to rise, it is likely to have an impact on people\u2019s living standards.

The Mauritius Strategy, Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction: Implications for MDG achievement, Philippe Boull\u00e9, Consultant Disasters can set back economic development by years if not decades, and have serious implications for MDG achievement. It is important to address disasters as a component of NSDS, and anticipate how they can affect sustainable development. The Mauritius Strategy recognises that SIDS are located in the most vulnerable 18. Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for Western Paci\ufb01 c countries regions of the world in relation to the intensity and frequency of natural disasters, and that they face disproportionately high economic, social and environmental consequences when a disaster strikes. The MS also stresses that adaptation to the adverse impacts of climate change and sea level rise remains a major priority for SIDS. These main concerns were embodied in the Hyogo Framework of Action (UN World Conference on Disaster Reduction, January 2005) which is now the UN blueprint for Disaster Risk Reduction. Geological and hydro meteorological hazards (earthquake, hurricane) turn into natural disasters (impacts on people and property) depending on the vulnerability of communities to these hazards. There is need to learn to live with risk, and to define at various levels what is the acceptable level of risk for the community concerned. Recent statistics show that 70% of natural disasters for the past 25 years are of hydro meteorological nature. Although there has been a decrease in casualties, indicating that disaster risk reduction activities work, economic losses have increased tenfold between 1980 and 2005. Recently, (2007) the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has confirmed future threats of great importance for SIDS, such as an increase in the frequency of heat waves, heavy precipitation, drought, tropical cyclones, extreme high sea level, and the major projected impact of these events. Steps to put in place mitigation measures have been slow. Application of the risk management chain to counter the impact of hazards include: \u2022 knowledge including risk mapping at two levels (both hazards and perception of the hazard), vulnerability maps. These evolve in time and need to be regularly updated \u2022 Prevention (campaigns in schools, land use, building codes) \u2022 Preparedness (one essential measure is the early warning system) \u2022 Response and relief (coordination, speed, professionalism) and \u2022 Recovery and reconstruction The world conference on disaster risk reduction proposed that SIDS adopt institutional approaches to DRR and associate all stakeholders including NGOs, and others; build national platforms for action; work with UN Country Teams, regional and bilateral partners for response logistics. Proposals for action in the Mauritius Strategy include insurance and early warning systems. Given the vulnerability of some PICs to rising sea level and climate change, there was much discussions on this issue. Participants highlighted the importance of indigenous and traditional knowledge in dealing with disaster risk reduction, and wanted to know which agency provides support when a disaster occurs. It was pointed out that several UN Agencies provide assistance in this area: WMO is a lead agency for hydro meteorological issues, together with UNESCO which provides support for early warning systems. In many countries, UNESCO has provided financial assistance to build schools that are cyclone-resistant so that these are used as refugee shelters in case of disaster and cyclone. The UNDP Pacific Centre indicated that one of its three practice areas includes conflict prevention and disaster risk reduction and there is capacity to support countries on this issue. Presentation on the Energy Costing Tool, Patil Balachandra, Consultant The energy costing tool was conceptualised and developed by the UNDP Bureau for Development Policy, and later modified by RCB for the Asia and Pacific region. The tool is used to support achievement of the MDGs by reflecting and costing the prioritised energy needs of countries but does not address national energy planning. Participants were given an opportunity to see how the tool works in practice. They indicated that the tool would need to be adjusted to the context of SIDS for them to be able to use it effectively. 19.

This makes the link from MDG-based plan to annual budgets through a credible MTEF in an integrated manner. A proper institutional set up in the country is critical as this should be a country-led process fully owned by Government who should have capacity to do this exercise with backstopping from UN Agencies. The steps for MDG-based planning include: (a) launch the process with institutional set up; (b) review existing plans and establish baselines; (c) undertake MDG NA and costing through 2015; (d) develop the macroeconomic framework, policies, and financing strategy; and (e) integrate the MDG NA into long and medium term plans and MTEF. Some challenges exist. While growth requires investment in MDGs, MDG costing also requires prior information on growth. MDG NA does not estimate non-MDG public spending and private investment. The macro model thus needs to estimate spending and investment separately. The Simplified Macro Framework (SMF) needs to be customized to country conditions to make it applicable. The SMF addresses the extent to which poverty reduction is possible with investments identified by the MDG NA and private sector investment estimated outside NA which may not always match with the MDG poverty reduction target. The main strengths of the SMF is that it is comprehensive at macro-level and data requirements are light. As it links to the MDG NA, it is useful in budget programming; and the user interface can be customized for any country. The main weakness is that the sector resolution is limited, the distribution module uses single HH (over 100 income percentiles), and the population dynamic is exogenous. During the plenary discussions, participants discussed the relationship between the MDGs and poverty reduction efforts, and how to integrate these into NSDS with links to the MTEF. Participants also discussed whether the SMF facilitates pro-poor policy. It was explained that macro-economic reforms have not always been pro-poor and have sometimes led to people being denied certain services. The MTEF and the NSDS are interlinked, and usually strategies will address commitments made at national and international level. Countries also wanted to know whether support was available to ministries on the tools and how this can be coordinated. UNDP Pacific Centre stressed that the tools were being demonstrated so that participants can gauge whether they can be useful to their respective countries. Mention was made that Solomon Islands and Vanuatu can receive targeted support to progress the MDGs in 2008, and the Centre will take account of the needs expressed by other countries in developing its Workplan for the next few years, in collaboration with other UN Agencies. 20. Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for Western Paci\ufb01 c countries Session 7 - Objective: Linking national development strategies, costing and expenditure frameworks, chaired by Will Parks, UNICEF Budgeting to achieve the MDGs: Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks, Annual budgets and pro-poor budgets, Emmanuel Cuvillier, UNDP Mauritius The failure to link policy, planning and budgeting is the single most important cause of poor budgeting outcomes in developing countries. The Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) is now widely accepted in many countries as the most appropriate framework for strategic expenditure programming and budget restructuring. In many respects, MTEF has become the new panacea of public expenditure management for the inadequacies of planning and budgeting systems and broader performance problems at the sector level. It is rational to plan and manage finances in an integrated manner, with a medium term perspective. The MTEF approach is based on the recognition that resources are limited and unlikely to increase in the medium term. The MTEF does not result in a higher level of resources; instead it is a tool to determine available resources and allocate these in line with Government\u2019s priorities. The MTEF approach involves bringing together all resources available to ministries in a common basket to enable them to achieve a clear purpose. The MTEF process involves assessing total resources available to Government as a whole, estimating the actual costs of policies in each sector and then comparing these resources to requirements. These policies, and the activities required to implement them, will need to be revisited and activities scaled down to fit within available resources.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9fdcb327-d9e3-4745-9f19-6af034f4ccd4": {"__data__": {"id_": "9fdcb327-d9e3-4745-9f19-6af034f4ccd4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-western-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based Planning, Costing and Budgeting for Western Pacific Countries", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-western-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "735b8a5a186f583780d847c5b160be2355ee196e6276efc4e150783024af954d"}, "2": {"node_id": "9c4420d5-40f0-4191-8845-21e2b7e89a7d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sub-regional-workshop-mdg-based-planning-costing-and-budgeting-western-pacific-countries", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "20323eed670dd343ab9adb3bea3fbf96f4486c97517b7dbf0e468c062a6772ae"}}, "hash": "4931b9500bf07596fdbe3eca3f7bf755c897868fe31524a97f63e7ab1234a999", "text": "The overall objective of the MTEF approach is rooted in the effort to address the weaknesses of the budgeting system such as arbitrary cuts in estimates; separate recurrent and investment budgets; and lack of transparency in the basis for budgetary allocations.

The MTEF is based on four goals: 1) Introduce a strategic basis to budget preparation so that expenditures are aimed at achieving agreed objectives; 2) Produce integrated, broad based budgets that integrate both recurrent and capital expenditures funded by Government and development partners; 3) Focus on the performance of ministries and measure the efficiency of total resource use; and 4) Introduce a three-year perspective so that ministries can plan ahead. The key elements of the MTEF is a clearly defined macro economic framework to determine availability of resources for key activities; setting priorities; information on efficiency savings; a policy process to reconcile revenues with how to spend the new savings; providing statistical data on public finance; determining baseline estimate of current policies and forward estimates. At any one time, three budgets will be at various stages of the budget cycle. The discussions on the MTEF highlighted the need for reliable data so that countries can monitor the impact of public expenditure based on key performance indicators. Proxy data can be used or new data developed by Ministries or Statistical Offices in the absence of comprehensive reliable data. Participants tried to integrate the different sessions, and wanted to know how costing relates to the MTEF. It was explained that while costing is a useful tool to know how much resources are required, the MTEF would determine 21. Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for Western Paci\ufb01 c countries how much resources can be spent and why. The tools enable countries to determine the cost of strategies, while performance indicators show how the impact of expenditure will be monitored and measured. Participants pointed out that it is quite challenging to develop and work with social data. A recommendation was made for countries to learn from and share knowledge with each other through a South-South modality. Programme-Based Budgeting, Emmanuel Cuvillier, UNDP Mauritius Performance budgeting seeks to improve expenditure efficiency by systematically linking funding to results, making use of performance information to achieve that linkage. It aims to redesign the budget process so as to improve the allocations of public expenditure, so that it is directed towards services of greater social value, and also to boost both allocative and technical efficiency. Programme-Based Budgeting (PBB) places primary emphasis upon allocative efficiency and, more specifically, upon improving expenditure prioritization in the budget preparation process. Good expenditure prioritization is particularly essential when Government faces new and unexpected challenges which require substantial expenditure responses. Budgeting is therefore necessarily about expenditure choices and these choices are often tough. The tighter the aggregate expenditure constraints facing a Government, the more important it is to be able to prioritize expenditure well. Whether achieved through better expenditure prioritization, or through improved efficiency and effectiveness at the ministry level, the social benefits of increased expenditure efficiency are clear, and to some extent, seek to reduce the upward pressure on public expenditure over time. Good expenditure prioritization should also have the same effect of facilitating aggregate expenditure restraint over the medium and long term by helping to finance new priorities by cuts in low-priority existing programmes and sub-programmes. PBB can be implemented in 7 steps: highlight strategic priorities; define a structure of programme and sub-programme; identify measurable outcomes for each of the above; group activities relating to the same outcome or objective; define outputs for delivery of public services; identify key performance indicators to monitor delivery of outputs; undertake monitoring twice a year. PBB is a basic tool to ensure that ministries and parastatal bodies receiving budget allocations deliver value for money from public funds. Most governments look for greater accountability rather than more control. Assessing budget performance is therefore an important step, and can be derived from KPI that are measurable and verifiable. Session 8 - Objective: Linking national development strategies, costing and expenditure frameworks, including gender responsive budgets, chaired by David Smith, UNESCAP Gender-responsive budgeting: concepts, benefits and methodology for Pacific countries, Katrin Schneider, Consultant Gender responsive budgeting is an approach to mainstream a gender perspective into all stages of the policy, planning and budget processes. Gender is a social construct with roles and responsibilities of and attitudes to men and women determined by society. Women\u2019s and men\u2019s priorities often differ in society and the way governments spend money or raises revenues may have a disproportionately negative impact on women. There are five dimensions that should be considered when analysing gender equality in relation to budgets: public employment, users of publicly funded services 22.

It is important to ensure that public spending is adequate to men\u2019s and women\u2019s needs, and to reallocate the budget to reduce disparities if it is not. GRB is not a separate budget for women, and its advantages include the possibility to monitor achievement of policy goals and to alleviate poverty more effectively. Gender equality is a fundamental human right, but can also help to increase economic efficiency, and thus, stimulate gender equitable economic growth. An important distinction from pro-poor budgeting is that GRB does not only look at the household level but also looks into the household, as resources, time burden and access to services are not always equally distributed among household members. In addition, it explicitly takes the so-called care economy into account which consists of reproductive activities that are not included in the System of National Accounts (SNA), e.g. caring for children or the elderly, cleaning, cooking or shopping. Different ways to incorporate unpaid work into the economy have been devised, with different valuation methods (input and output value methods) for unpaid work. PBB is a very good entry point for GRB because it can define objectives, targets, indicators and activities in a sex- disaggregated and gender-sensitive way. GRB is not necessarily about more money but better spending to achieve MDG3 and other additional indicators of gender equality. Measures to implement GRB include the sensitisation of government officials, the change of attitudes, training and capacity building, the change of budget formats, guidelines and manuals, the collection of sex-disaggregated and time use data, the analysis of current expenditure, and the undertaking of a Gender Needs Assessment. During the plenary discussions, participants highlighted efforts being made in their countries towards gender mainstreaming. The point was stressed that GRB affects both men and women, and that sex disaggregated data is a key to identify disparities and discrimination, as well as entry points for better policies. It was also emphasised that many stakeholders can play a key role in GRB, not only the Ministry of Finance. Those involved in women\u2019s development, CSOs, the media, parliamentarians, researchers, other Ministries, and the Ministry of Women all play a role in making the case for GRB and in its implementation. In many instances, the Ministry of Women needs capacity strengthening to better negotiate budget allocations with the Ministry of Finance. The role of strong leadership in implementing budget reforms including GRB was emphasized, and the need to train / sensitize leaders to understand the issues was raised. Examples of countries where Ministers have been trained in budget issues from a gender perspective were provided. The discussions were followed by a group exercise to encourage participants to work through some of the steps that need to be taken when implementing GRB, identify constraints they are likely to face and action points. Session 9 - Objective: Action planning and the way forward, chaired by David Abbott, UNDP Pacific Centre The objective of Session 9 was to identify countries\u2019 priorities over the next 2 years, and determine the support needed from UN Agencies. The discussions linked back to the various components of the workshop, and were grouped around 4 issues: (i) formulation of new/ review of existing NSDS; (ii) poverty & MDGs; (iii) policy formulation; and (iv) the costing tools.

Sub Regional Workshop on MDG-based planning, costing and budgeting for Western Paci\ufb01 c countries Conclusions Thanks and appreciation were extended to the UNDP Pacific Centre, UNESCAP, UNFPA and other UN Agencies for organising the workshop. It was seen as a useful exercise and a very relevant one for participants who also highlighted the need to strengthen understanding among decision-makers and key political figures of these issues to foster greater political will to address them. Recommendations were made to facilitate exchanges among islands in the Pacific region and between the Pacific and other regions through a South-South modality. UNICEF and the Pacific Centre expressed commitment to further support countries on issues discussed during the workshop and to facilitate inter-region exchanges on these issues. In its closing remarks, the Government of Solomon Islands through the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Women expressed its appreciation to UNDP that Solomon Islands was selected as the host for the sub regional workshop. The Permanent Secretary also highlighted that this was a workshop with a difference, as the meeting clearly focused on the countries\u2019 specific needs and priorities, and the support required by countries to address these. The partnership among UN Agencies who operated as One UN was also commended.
