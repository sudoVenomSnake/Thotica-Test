oi Inthanon National Park which includes Th ailand\u2019s highest peak, Doi Inthanon, was demarcated in 1972 in the area above the village. Th e Park included many upper watershed areas and embraced many villages of the Karen, Hmong and other indigenous groups. Water from the Mae Klang, which originates in the upper watersheds of Doi Inthanon, is used to irrigate longan fruit orchards and paddy \ufb01 elds in the lowlands of Chom Th ong. In 1985, the National Forestry Policy was adopted which aimed at maintaining 40 percent of Th ailand as natural forest. Th e Policy resulted in more rigid and increased control over reserved forests areas. Communities were strictly prohibited from living or using any resources within protection zones and watershed class 1A areas. Further limited use of resources was allowed only in the bu\ufb00 er zone. The RFD used satellite images to demarcate most of the forest areas. Contrary to ground realities, they also assumed that older secondary forests were uninhabited. Indigenous hill peoples were excluded from any part of the process, the exclusion even extending to receiving any information about the land use planning decisions years after plans were adopted. Th e demarcations made illegal almost all the settlements in the area. Many communities came to know about their illegal status only when they were arrested. Much later, RFD o\ufb03 cials working at 295 Thailand 296 Bridging The Gap the ground level came to realize that collaborative management of resources with the a\ufb00 ected indigenous hill peoples was better than their exclusion. However, the idea of segregating \u201cnature\u201d and \u201cpeople\u201d was too deeply entrenched among policy makers. Many communities were relocated and resettled, often coercively, to areas that were infertile or already settled or with negligible agricultural areas. It created a new level of con\ufb02 ict and social, cultural and economical repercussions that were either unanticipated or ignored. In any case, such severe steps did not stop the degradation of natural resources but further aggravated the situation. Meanwhile, longan orchards were eating up huge parts of the lowland area around Chom Th ong, which increased by about 50 square kilometers, demanding a steep rise in consumption of water. Unsurprisingly, water resource management became the focal point of resentment among lowland Th ai farmers. Th e Chom Th ong Watershed and Environment Conservation Club was formed in 1989 by these farmers to manage water resources for their interest across the whole district. Th ey soon allied with the Dhammanaat Foundation which sought relocation and removal of indigenous highland peoples from their traditional settlements. Th e con\ufb02 ict reached a head in the late 1990s when a severe drought destroyed many fruit trees. Immediately, lowland conservation groups blamed the indigenous highlanders claiming they destroyed the forest through \ufb01 res to open new areas for agriculture. On the other side, indigenous highlanders pointed out businessmen who wanted to set up resorts as the culprits of the \ufb01 res. Extreme steps were taken by lowland conservation groups, including blocking access roads to the highlands and barb wiring certain areas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28e3b9a6-6fc7-4d27-9c70-f430e90f03fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "28e3b9a6-6fc7-4d27-9c70-f430e90f03fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76a0766e67592421b9e6910345f80024d62ba0a684666bd3f87da10f3f95d62b"}, "2": {"node_id": "53a35af8-4823-4bb2-978b-fa2c3b927928", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "153ce9ccffc1006019f5cefa399d139a268210dd2e9dd2f9ec328a93cce24850"}}, "hash": "2aee9547a0284f8604927afdbb1b5fb4cf8168c08d75d6e01ab1061a9dad0559", "text": "Th e cement pillars of the barb wire fences were painted in the colours of the Th ai \ufb02 ag \u2013 a clear sign that they considered the highland peoples to be foreigners or \u2018non-Th ais\u2019.

Th e con\ufb02 ict was also used by in\ufb02 uential lowland farmers to increase their control over resources. 297 Thailand Response While the con\ufb02 ict has abated, it still remains largely unresolved. However it has served to underlined proactive steps taken by indigenous hill peoples for sustainable management of resoures. Indigenous communities put into place a more institutionalized set of regulations based on their traditional practices. Th ey reduced their shifting cultivation areas drastically and learned new resource management skills. Community activities for resource management such as making forest \ufb01 res breakers, checking illegal logging etc were conducted more e\ufb03 ciently. At the same time, e\ufb00 orts to counter negative propaganda against them were also undertaken. As a response, the con\ufb02 ict also saw the creation of the Northern Farmers Network (NFN) which links 107 villages located in 14 sub-watersheds in the upper northern region of Th ailand. NFN strives to promote community forestry and local participation in natural resource management and the application of indigenous knowledge to management strategies. Many self-regulatory practices on a number of topics ranging from watershed management to harvesting non- timber forest products are negotiated and discussed among members. Th ey recognize the need for dialogue with government and lowland communities and actively seek to involve them. NFN creates awareness about government policies and laws among their members and has been partly successful since then in encouraging government agencies to involve local communities and people\u2019s organizations in natural resource management. Lessons Learned Th e case highlights the tense lines drawn over resource use with increasing pressure on it from every quarter. It indicates some useful lessons as well. \u2022 Indigenous communities have taken positive steps to respond to changing resource availability and pressure. \u2022 Community forestry can be strengthened if there is institutional support from the government and a legal framework as its basis. \u2022 Coordination and cooperation between watershed communities facilitated through networks and associations can greatly enhance and stabilize natural resource management. 5. Challenges and Drawbacks 5.1 Democratization, Decentralization, Participation and Sustainability It is evident that the con\ufb02 ict over natural resources management in Th ailand \u2013 be it land tenure insecurity, dispute over water resources or others \u2013 stems from the myopic process behind policies and laws that seek to govern resource management. Lack of participation from the a\ufb00 ected quarters stymied most of the policies and laws before they were even implemented. What is the way out then? It is not so much the substance of a law that is the answer. However good a law is on paper, it would still need to pass the challenges of implementation. For implementation to be successful, it needs to involve the rights holders and stake holders. Involvement cannot be expected if there is no sense of ownership. It is here that democratization and decentralization with emphasis on participation comes in. It is only through such a process that the sustainability of any process, law or policy can be expected. Ultimately good resource management is a question of ensuring social justice. However, seeing the history of top-down administration in Th ailand, democratization and decentralization remains a great challenge. 5.2 Implementation of Laws As can be seen, laws that were drafted before the last decade expressly exclude the utilization of resources within national forest reserves and other protected areas. Th ey criminalize activities of indigenous communities which they have traditionally carried out for their sustenance. Th ough there are thousands of communities managing and protecting their local forests, their activities are deemed illegal. Further, current laws and regulations prioritize the private sector. It has been found that strict enforcement of laws have not worked in arresting problems of natural resource management but instead exacerbated it. Th is can be attributed to two factors: the con\ufb02 icting and overlapping nature of di\ufb00 erent laws governing natural resource management in Th ailand; and the non-involvement of communities as right holders in natural resource management. Th e \ufb01 rst have led to confusion among various government agencies about their roles which in turn leads to a more haphazard and arbitrary enforcement of laws. Th e second factor is a consequence of the conservation", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ff97cfd-27b8-42b4-8ef1-bd07477f62bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ff97cfd-27b8-42b4-8ef1-bd07477f62bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Bridging the Gap", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/bridging-gap", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57c89f6967500ad9e9aec926fa8ea4e875ba7e5ac5bb72b8bbdd7412e4040698"}}, "hash": "57c89f6967500ad9e9aec926fa8ea4e875ba7e5ac5bb72b8bbdd7412e4040698", "text": "oriented approach of these laws which do not factor in the sustainable traditional resource use 298 Bridging The Gap methods of indigenous peoples which alienates them further from government initiated activities as they do not get a fair share of bene\ufb01 ts. Rural communities, speci\ufb01 cally forest communities, have become important to the success of forest and environmental objectives as their relationship with the forest is rooted in culturally based indigenous knowledge and because of their proximity to the forest which ideally places them to either protect or destroy the forests.149 Fortunately some positive signs are emerging. Th e adoption of the Constitution of 1997 heralded a signi\ufb01 cant benchmark toward a more inclusive participatory approach. Along with this, the Tambon Council & Tambon Authority Act and the Decentralization Act, if implemented e\ufb00 ectively and sincerely, has the potential to not only overhaul the bureaucratic set up of natural resource management but also the whole administrative structure of Th ailand. In Tambons, such as Ban Luang TAO, where there is a strong representation of indigenous communities, there are already signs of the local administration being more receptive to resource management initiative of indigenous hill peoples. Although community forests do not have a legal basis, authorities have informally started recognizing them indicating a more open interpretation of laws. Further, the restructuring, reassignment and revision of responsibilities for natural resource management under Ministry of Natural Resource Management is a welcome initiative toward streamlining that will hopefully make law implementation more sensitive to ground realities and bring in the required changes. 299 Hui Kha Nu village, Chom Thong, Chiang Mai Photo: Udom Charenniyomphai Thailand 5.3 Bridging Gaps between Di\ufb00 erent Actors With the decentralization and streamlining initiative, there is increased potential in bridging the gaps in perception of natural resource management among state agencies, NGOs and indigenous communities. However to be e\ufb00 ective certain underlying issues need to be addressed. Closely related to the top-down approach of decision making is the negative attitude toward indigenous hill peoples and their use of natural resources. Government o\ufb03 cials often assume that indigenous hill people are the culprit of natural resource degradation. Th ey are unable to see resource use based on traditional customs and traditions as sustainable. Government programs usually tell communities what to do rather than try to understand how the forest is used and how that use can be improved to support the objectives and needs of both parties.150 Bridging gaps also need strong commitment and trust from all parties involved. Th e con\ufb02 ict of ideologies between di\ufb00 erent NGOs, con\ufb02 ict between stake holders and right holders etc all function at di\ufb00 erent levels to e\ufb00 ect natural resource management adversely. Commitment should also come with the readiness to acquire the required skills necessary for natural resource management. Because of the strong bureaucratic background in which the government operated in the past, state agencies continue to see activities with indigenous hill peoples as a means to control them and not as a means to achieving better management of natural resource management. Th erefore skills such as community organization, community liaison, facilitation qualities etc are required from those in a position of decision making. 5.4 Competing Discourses on Natural Resource Management In the analysis of natural resource management laws and their impacts on indigenous hill peoples, one angle that is often not given the importance it deserves is the con\ufb02 ict in ideological discourse between di\ufb00 erent NGO camps: the Dark Green and Light Green camps. Because of middle class support and elite representation, Dark Green NGOs, whose concept of nature is associated with an idealistic self-contradictory notion of an \u201cundisturbed\u201d nature, have been quite successful in blocking promising initiatives such as the Community Forest Bill that would have changed the whole structure of natural resource management in Th ailand. Th e opposing discourses are not as simple as a disagreement in approach toward natural resource management but also contain a lot of sub-text of power relations, class equations 300 Bridging The Gap Thailand and social structuring. Th ese needs to be taken into account while addressing this challenge.151 5.5 Gender in Natural Resource Management Th e e\ufb00 ect and role of gender in natural resource management varies widely across di\ufb00 erent peoples and across di\ufb00 erent times. However it is fair to say that the bargaining power of women is often not as strong as men which put them in a more vulnerable situation when the natural resources that the community is dependent on are no longer accessible.

Yet they are highly complex systems, closely interlinked with other indigenous systems. They incorporate a keen awareness of the environment and an appreciation for conservation and continuity. They also encourage sustainable innovation and place the long-term wellbeing of the community as the focus of all activities. Indigenous resource management systems are also closely linked with other indigenous systems \u2013 including social, cultural, spiritual, economic, governance, juridical, health, technological and learning. The case studies from Bangladesh, Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand contained in this book reveal how indigenous natural resource management systems can be viable alternatives to current attitudes and practices to natural resource management. They also show why it is important that autonomy and indigenous rights to their territories are crucial for the successful implementation of their natural resource management systems.

Donors and local stakeholders alike have come to realise that most governance issues are highly dependent on the overarching political governance frameworks within which Executive decision-making, lawmaking and oversight take place. A growing body of evidence suggests that constituents across the Pacific are unable to articulate their needs and demands to national leaders, suggesting systemic failures in democratic governance. Pacific Islanders need legitimate state institutions of governance in which their deepest aspirations and needs can find voice. Since the drafting of the Millennium Declaration in 2000, these issues have been brought into greater focus with the need to develop proactive regulatory networks to allow for the conceptualization, consultation and drafting of enabling legislation to allow for the realization of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is not the intention of this publication to make broad recommen- dations on how best to achieve the Millennium Development Goals in their entirety. This has been done thoroughly elsewhere (GoPNG 2004, GoS 2004, SPC and UN 2004, UNDP 2004). Rather, this booklet posits a set of practical suggestions on how strengthened lawmaking processes and improved parliamentary-constituency relations can help realize the achievement of these objectives, paying particular attention to the nation-states of Samoa, the Republic of the Fiji Islands and Papua New Guinea (PNG) (see map). These recommendations are based on a thorough reading of the raft of reports, the handful of scholarly works that have been generated on parliaments and political governance in the Pacific Islands (Henderson 2003: 225\u201341, Morgan 2005, Okole 2005, Patapan, et al. 2005) and on intensive consultation with regional stakeholders conducted by the author over the past five years (Morgan 2002, 2001, 2003). The MDGs in perspective I n September 2000, the member states of the United Nations (UN) committed themselves to achieving human development and broadening its benefits to the world\u2019s neediest people by 2015. Known as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), this eight-point plan seeks to: \u2014 Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger; \u2014 Achieve universal primary education; \u2014 Promote gender equality and empower women; \u2014 Reduce child mortality; \u2014 Improve maternal health; \u2014 Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases; \u2014 Ensure environmental sustainability; and \u2014 Develop a global partnership for development. While global progress on these goals has been mixed, measurable gains have been made in North Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean and Europe.

The MDGs in the Pacific The Secretariat of the Pacific Community report on progress on the MDGs showed that in comparison to some regions, the Pacific Islands were progressing strongly on key goals: \u2018the efforts by the region\u2019s people, governments and development partners have resulted in positive outcomes\u2019 (SPC and UN 2004). Already, complementary regional activities such as the Pacific Plan, PICTA and PACER are gaining momentum among the Pacific Islands\u2019 political leadership, and these will necessarily propel regional cooperation and provide the bulwarks upon which global partnerships for development \u2014 the last of the MDGs \u2014 can be built. For example, the Auckland Declaration (see insert) commits Forum leaders to attaining economic prosperity, excellence in governance, the protection of human rights and regional partnership \u2014 ideals that are to be found at the very heart of the MDGs. Hence, while financial, human and physical resources must still be brought to bear, preliminary measures have been taken to attain the MDGs. Historically, the severity of many of the problems that the MDGs target has been less pronounced in the Pacific than elsewhere in the world. In Samoa, for example, the level of literacy is high, equitably distributed between men and women and between rural and urban populations (GoS 2004). In Fiji, life expectancy is comparable with Western countries, infant, child and maternal mortality rates have been halved since the 1960s and primary level education is already almost universal (UNDP 2004). Yet across the region poverty and widening income disparities are mounting concerns, not least for the fact that despite the commitment to the abovementioned agreements many small island economies face significant obstacles to economic growth, and have endured many difficulties in shifting their economies to a market footing. More troublingly, the prevalence and rate of infection of HIV/AIDS in PNG and the possibility that unsustainable ecological and mineral resource exploitation will lead to greater human suffering through degradation, despoliation and unfair disbursement of royalties and profits are looming as crises. The government of PNG, recognizing that the MDGs are overly ambitious for the country\u2019s development context, tailored the MDGs to a set of achievable reforms, which include halting the HIV/AIDS epidemic, curtailing Building Political Governance Frameworks 9 PNG\u2019s high population growth rate, and overcoming the obstacles presented to reform by \u2018a very large variety of natural, socio-economic, cultural, political, geographic, language barriers and \u2026 external aid dependency\u2019 (GoPNG 2004). Regional governments are already tailoring their expectations of success based on local factors. Despite the progress that has been made against some of the MDGs, therefore, issues such as these suggest that more work needs to be done on facilitating the realization of this global agenda. Indeed, without the restructuring or reinvigoration of many of the region\u2019s political governance structures, the mobilization of partners and resources, the commencement of pro-poor policy reforms and budget reallocation to support them, the strengthening of parliamentary institutions able to scrutinize Executive performance and the adoption of informed, effective and principled policy-making practices, the Pacific Islands may progress little further in their attainment of the MDGs. As the South Pacific report on regional progress on the MDGs reports: \u2018Much of the work required to achieve the MDGs is already underway but demands greater focus and a renewed sense of urgency\u2019 (SPC and UN 2004). It is to these ends that this report is directed.

A t heart, the MDGs are policy matters and therefore largely the responsibility of the Executive. However, the importance of input from the Legislature and of broad-ranging initiatives designed to sensitize MPs to the significance and implications of the MDGs cannot be underestimated. Throughout the world, Executive branches of government agreed to pursue the MDGs without passing decisions back to the Legislature for domestic deliberation (Sharkey 2004). Accordingly, the Executive branches of the Pacific Islands supported the Millennium Declaration, and with the minimal involvement of the Legislature, ratified and then reinforced the MDGs rapidly and comprehensively.1 Forum Island Country legislatures, elided from the initial consultations over the MDGs, have been marginalized further by their respective Executive branches. Consequently, gaps have begun to emerge in the implementation process. The UNDP noted that \u2018responsive and accountable institutions of governance are often the missing link between antipoverty efforts and poverty reduction\u2019 (UNDP 2000). Creating stable and effective policy environments in the Pacific Islands will provide many of the preconditions needed to attain the MDGs. It is logical to assume that 1 The MDGs were emphasised and affirmed at each Forum Economic Ministers Meetings (FEMM) from 2002 to 2004, the Regional Workshop on MDGs in March 2003, the 13th Statisticians Meeting in September 2003, Pacific Islands Forum meeting in 2003, and the UN/Council of Regional Organisations of the Pacific (CROP) Working Group on the MDGs meeting in November 2003. stronger legislative institutions may contribute to better poverty reduction outcomes. Nonetheless, there are significant obstacles and bottlenecks to the development of proactive state-law regulatory networks in Forum Island Countries (FICs) that will facilitate the attainment of the MDGs. Encouraging legislative involvement in the attainment of the MDGs draws our attention back to a set of challenges that long have been faced by FIC legislatures and legislatures globally \u2014 effective lawmaking and the relationship between constituencies and their elected national representatives. In exploring these core issues, however, a series of associated matters arises: What political governance frameworks can facilitate better lawmaking? What kinds of institutions can contribute to more productive relations between members of parliament and their constituencies? How will these issues be married to facilitate the attainment of the MDGs? In answering these queries, we need to be aware of the institutional and other constraints placed on parliaments and parliamentarians in their existing roles. Only then can the preconditions of effective parliamentary governance be determined. There are a number of key problems associated with advocating for broad legislative strengthening to encourage the attainment of the MDGs. In particular, regional parliaments vary in size, level of support and basic structure. Fiji, for example, has a developed system of parliamentary governance involving standing, select and statutory committees, while Vanuatu is only now in the process of establishing a formalized system of standing committees. An obvious interim measure therefore would be to map all relevant legislative bodies, civil society organizations and allied institutions which may contribute to the attainment of the MDGs in the Pacific Islands, and define their roles and responsibilities. This may involve parliamentary committees, quasi-legislative committees (all those which involve MPs, in addition to other stakeholders) and participating civil society organizations (CSOs). Once this is done, external stakeholders and domestic CSOs will be better placed to engage the relevant Building Political Governance Frameworks 13 deliberative bodies and determine recipients of potential pro-MDG briefings. Moreover, existing support arrangements to parliaments have often been hamstrung by a lack of interagency cooperation, exacerbated by fierce competition over donor funds. Few opposition MPs have their own staff to support research on bills before them for consideration and nor do they have access to parliamentary counsel to advise them legally of the implications, guidelines and requirements of legal drafting or to comment on the gender, poverty, educational or health implications of bills. With the exceptions of Fiji and Samoa, legislators tend not to use parliamentary committees as vehicles for interrogating the broader implications of government policy; for exploring the possible poverty reduction implications of improved transport infrastructure, of crime prevention, and so on. Up till recently, few parliaments were furnished with specialist oversight and lawmaking organs in the form of standing and select committees, but as their merits are broadcast across the region as vehicles for stable and effective political governance, greater expectations are being placed on MPs to drive governance reform and on parliamentary administrative staff to support it. What has been found in consecutive reviews, however, is that parliamentary", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79fb7ef6-669a-4e98-84f4-2287cf4a913e": {"__data__": {"id_": "79fb7ef6-669a-4e98-84f4-2287cf4a913e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/building-political-governance-frameworks", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Building Political Governance Frameworks", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/building-political-governance-frameworks", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d89e3c14464d32e4012ec4e4707e73628bb2c1af155d2ed55f1695701967a986"}}, "hash": "d89e3c14464d32e4012ec4e4707e73628bb2c1af155d2ed55f1695701967a986", "text": "secretariats \u2014 clerk\u2019s offices, secretariats general, speaker\u2019s bureaux \u2014 are under resourced and severely challenged fulfilling the expectations held of them by local and international stakeholders (Clements 2001, Morgan 2003, Okole, et al. 2004). Not surprisingly given these conditions, the thorough background analysis and evaluation of legislative options often demanded of public leaders by civil society is compromised with many parliamen- tarians simply not understanding the rules, responsibilities and procedures governing the lawmaking process and the contents and implications of the legislation. Simultaneously, prima facie, constituen- cies in the Pacific Islands have great trouble having their primary aspirations represented in national lawmaking processes, further distancing political elites from electors. Hence, cooperative Building Political Governance Frameworks 14 legislature/executive approaches to the identification of key issues, the formulation of policies and their implementation, and the monitoring and evaluation (NDI/UNDP 2004) of government programs have also faltered. These elements represent significant weaknesses in the operation of Westminster in the Pacific Islands, although recent local, regional and international strategies may be turning this tide (CDI 2005a: 2, 2005b: 3, Lindroth 2005, \u2018Vanuatu Parliament Act\u2019 2005). Without adequate human, physical and financial resources being directed to support parliamentary governance, the difficulty of these complex tasks will increase manifestly, while the divide between the expectations of the system and its actual performance will grow. A key challenge that remains unaddressed in the realization of the MDGs is how to incorporate legislatures in the processes of determining priorities and achieving the goals of this global agenda in meaningful ways. Without the mainstreaming of the MDGs and without the engagement in debate of the range of interests represented in the region\u2019s legislatures, the lofty global agenda of eradicating poverty, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equality, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability and developing global partnerships for development will likely atrophy. The creation and support of appropriate, stable and responsive political governance frameworks is crucial to the attainment of each of the Millennium Development Goals (SPC and UN 2004). Building Political Governance Frameworks 15 Creating regulatory frameworks L awmaking is central to the functioning of any Legislature. While the Executive generally determines the legislative agenda in any given Pacific Island country,2 the Legislature remains responsible for ensuring that the laws they pass are consistent with community needs and aspirations. Through this function, the Legislature may shape the formal legal framework of a society \u2014 either by reflecting social rules and mores or determining its needs in the national interest \u2014 and thereby settle by majority vote on the direction that society takes. Throughout the Pacific Islands, legislatures are seen to be deficient in this function. While ideally representing the consent of the people, without special effort to protect the independence of the law-making function, parliamentary systems can degenerate into the subservience of the legislature to a dominating political executive which expects little more of the political assembly than that it \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 government initiatives [my emphasis] (Uhr 2003: 36). Despite the gains that have been made in the Pacific Islands since their independence, and the strength and vitality of their democratic institutions, many Pacific Legislatures are unable to transcend the dominance of the Executive. Moreover, in many parts of the Pacific the lawmaking and oversight functions of the Legislature have become subservient to the imperative to join the Executive. Little stock is placed in overseeing government performance. Thus, not only 2 Private Members Bills are incredibly rare in FICs. does the Executive override the Legislature, but also few members of the Legislature seek to reverse this situation. This has a number of implications. In most of Melanesia, including PNG and Fiji, governments use their numerical dominance in parliament to suspend Standing Orders (the rules presided over by the Speaker that govern parliamentary procedure). This allows them to truncate the mandatory period required to consider bills before the Legislature and limits the amount of time parliamentary committees \u2014 where they exist \u2014 are able to spend vetting legislation and calling for submissions from civil society or industry. Parliamentary secretariats across the region have often been unable to notify members of what bills they will be considering adequately before members arrive from their regional constituencies. Many governments do not habitually furnish legislative programs to their parliamentary secretariats before the beginning of the parliamentary session, despite clear guidelines for doing so.

However, effecting such a transition would require sufficient incentives to be provided to Executive government, in the form of a mobilised Opposition, the fear of media opprobrium or the fear of electoral defeat. Yet often this is not how the democracies of the Pacific Islands function. Because the implications of legislation are not always effectively communicated to regional constituencies and because members themselves often fail to grasp the implications of the laws that they enact, parliamentary debate has been stifled. Laws are enacted neither in the interests nor with the understanding of the people. A particular feature of legislative behaviour across the Pacific is that legislation is passed very quickly. As the Hon. Bire Kimisopa, MP for Goroka, PNG, stated during consultations with UNDP staff, executive dominance and the Building Political Governance Frameworks 17 suspension of standing orders \u2018is killing parliamentary democracy and \u2026 our effectiveness as Members\u2019 (Okole, et al. 2004). Parliamentary Committees The issue of weak legislation and executive dominance is at the heart of the increasing prevalence of parliamentary committees across the Pacific Islands. Specialist committees can often provide better vehicles for community liaison, oversight and the vetting of bills for inconsistencies and biases than the whole parliament, and their focused activities can serve to transcend narrow personal or party loyalties. Most FICs have provisions for creating ad hoc committees or sectoral committees charged with gauging public opinion on proposed legislation built in to their standing orders and parliamentary procedures, but formalised core sector committees are a recent innovation in most areas. Understandably, not all Bills can be subject to in-depth public scrutiny but some level of interaction is clearly needed for legislation with social or economic ramifications, such as those that will further the MDGs. Partly, this challenge can be answered by broadening the scope of involvement in parliamentary committee work to include civil society actors, industry representatives and public servants. At such time as committees in the FICs are operating effectively, they could be used by MPs to interrogate government performance against the MDGs. Committees would be entitled to demand input from the public service on the impacts of certain policies. For example, they could explore the effects that funding changes to the education sector have on the levels of primary education and on school retention rates, or investigate gender disaggregated data in relation to these areas. Crucially, political governance systems could be nurtured and provided with the basis from which they are able to adapt to local circumstances without compromising the fundamental principles upon which parliamentary governance is predicated. It is important to bear in mind that committee systems tend to operate differently in different milieux. Once established, their operation will very much Building Political Governance Frameworks 18 depend on a set of local variables, such as the ability of MPs to mobilise around certain issues, the influence (positive or negative) of political parties and the preparedness of the Executive to listen to committee recommendations and amend their policies accordingly. Once again, these matters draw our attention back to the fundamental need to strengthen the institutions of parliament and improve the capacity of staff and MPs. The ability of Pacific lawmakers to acquit their responsibilities through committee work is also dependent on the level of support they receive through their secretariats and respective ministries. Without the provision of adequate human and financial resources to these tasks, committee work can easily become a simple reward for political loyalty or a pay-off for joining government coalitions. Similarly, without adequate support and training being provided to clerks, parliamentary staff, committee staff, researchers and librarians, the architecture of political governance can become an irrelevance. The continued involvement of regional parliamentary staff in training programs, exchanges and capacity building is crucial. Similarly, the increased involvement of regional MPs in parliamentary associations, mentoring programs and study tours will provide them with comparative experiences on which to draw in their parliamentary careers, for skills and competencies to become entrenched and for the institutions of political governance to be buffered by the personal expertise of the people who work in the system. Last, the research capacity of FIC legislatures has historically been weak. A possible answer to the challenges of informing MPs in their work would be to invest parliamentary counsel with functions that support the mainstreaming of the MDG relevant issues. For example, a core task of parliamentary counsel could be to ensure gender equitable and non-discriminatory language is used in the drafting of Bills.

National strategies are issued as government policy, rather than being approved by parliament. This necessarily reduces national commitment to the contents and implications of these policies and, in countries where political instability is endemic, it tends to minimise their longevity. The turnover of MPs in government necessarily weakens policy formulation and implementation. Regime instability requires policy advocates continually to begin their work afresh, as they lobby newly appointed ministers for policy change. Indeed, where changes of government are frequent, unavoidable lags arise in issue identification, policy development and policy implementation. Necessarily, good governance is undermined in unstable polities. Where these conditions are in evidence, progress towards the MDGs is intermittent. Hence, it is crucial for FIC governments and donor agencies to conceptualise development plans and annual budgets in concert. In some countries, planning cycles and national budgets are integrated, but in many FICs the development strategy is considered to be the responsibility of donor agencies, with minimal linkages to appropriation bills. Government and opposition legislators play key roles in endorsing development strategies, tailoring national goals to achievable and sensible targets, devising or acknowledging relevant indicators of progress and monitoring executive performance through annual budget reporting, committee work and ongoing parliamentary over- sight. National legislators are ideally placed to bring sub-national information to bear on national debates. Indeed, detailed information on sub-national development levels is a powerful tool in discussions about the distribution of development resources. In that Public Accounts Committees (PACs) are entitled to draw on public comment, may investigate issues in the public interest and may subpoena witnesses in defence of financial probity, the budget cycle potentially offers a broad ranging entry point for breaking down obstacles to community-Legislature-Executive relations by drawing civil society representatives into the deliberative process progressively. It presents a critical juncture in the transition from government policy Building Political Governance Frameworks 20 to law, when the Executive seeks legislative approval for its vision, development priorities and economic decisions. During the budget cycle, the Legislature in cooperation with other stakeholders is required to oversight Executive spending. Indeed, budgeting highlights the raft of actors involved in priority setting and oversight of economic management, and hence of MDG programming. Especially in small economies, the viability of the health and education sectors, for example, is predicated on monies allocated during government budgeting. Where PACs are entitled to review appropriation bills, MPs from government and opposition are able to steer the absolute direction of the budget by voting on the amount of money allocated to a certain sector. This arrangement guides appro- priation bills in Samoa, where the PAC may vote to limit a budget head, although it is never entitled to raise amounts for appropriation. More commonly, Pacific Island PACs oversee fiscal probity and vet their Executives\u2019 record of success in achieving economic priorities after the passage of the Appropriation Bill. Even without the direct involvement of civil society in parlia- mentary discussions, greater transparency in budgeting may allow civil society organisations to disseminate information regarding national budgets, and scrutinise their possible effects on the MDGs. Already in PNG, CSOs such as the Consultative Implementation and Monitoring Committee (CIMC) scrutinise national budgets, an activity which could dovetail comfortably with MDG monitoring. Conversely, without broadening involvement in the budgeting process, FICs are likely to experience a worsening of societal ill-will regarding economic decision making. Over the past few years in the Pacific Islands, insular budgetary deliberations or preferential disburse- ments of state monies have occasionally sparked social unrest. Indeed, more inclusive budgeting practices might serve to strengthen and stabilize political governance in polities labelled as being driven by state-weakness, economic mismanagement and corruption. A number of preliminary measures must be enacted before these aspects of high-level legislative oversight can be effective. Recognising Building Political Governance Frameworks 21 that PACs are only as effective of the cycle of accountability in which they operate, more effort needs to be put into making sure that the Executive upholds the standards of financial probity expected of it. In that most PACs rely heavily on their respective national audit offices, they remain susceptible to Executive interference. Across the region, constitutional watchdogs are considered to be under-resourced, although there are significant examples of successful investigations and oversight. Rather than act as investigative committees, PACs are generally expected to be the bodies to which \u2018managers answer for their actions\u2019, based on the findings of the reports of respective auditors-general.

Some PACs have not met for extended periods, while in other legislatures they function inadequately. Providing institutional strengthening and capacity building to these agencies may tip the balance in favour of financial probity.

Bringing Local Focus to the Global Agenda R epresentative democracy places certain expectations on MPs. Voters choose their representatives to act in their interests. This involves some level of delegation of decision-making authority to the representative and is predicated on the understanding that the MP will be equipped intellectually and morally to deal with the changing exigencies of public leadership. Hopefully, the derogation of community interests to the personal agenda of the MP will be avoided and certain checks and balances are placed on the representative to ensure this, such as constitutional, statutory and judicial watchdogs, and provisions for an impartial judiciary to counterbalance Legislative and Executive powers. Given that elections are the keystone process by which the Legislature \u2014 and through it, the Executive \u2014 remain accountable to the people, the levels to which people are able to access relevant information about governance generally is crucial to democratic functioning. Indeed, the mobilisation of public scrutiny of government is crucial to effective oversight and lawmaking. Yet across the Pacific, systems for disseminating information to constituents relating to parliamentary structures and performance and for representing constituency concerns in lawmaking are vulnerable because of incomplete state-building, histories of ineffective colonial administration, uneven development, weak communication infra- structure, disparate settlement and rugged terrain. Most Pacific Islanders have access to broadband radio broadcasts and urban people in particular have access to a varied printed media. Poor literacy levels throughout the Pacific limit the effectiveness of print media as a source of information. Despite recent attacks on media sources in Solomon Islands and the suppression of free media in Fiji during the coup (2000), overall the Pacific Islands benefit from a relatively free media, especially when compared to the position of correlate agencies in Central Asia and Africa. Parliamentary coverage has been a feature of Pacific media broadcasts since their respective independences, yet explanation of the meanings of parliamentary debate and the implication and ramifications of bills under consideration is limited. In much of Melanesia, for example, the roles and duties of members are unclear. Little distinction is made between Executive and Legislature; all MPs are expected to provide services, resources and employment (Okole 2002: 37\u201340, 2005, Okole, et al. 2004), whereas the state, ideally guided by the Executive and overseen by the Legislature, has its legitimacy diminished. In Melanesia, this has stimulated increasing ambivalence about democratic institutions among many constituents. According to Henry Okole, \u2018the state\u2019s institutional structures are convenient tools for the extension of the relational networks that exist in society\u2019 (Okole, et al. 2004). For much of Melanesia these issues are intertwined with the nature of political party organisation. Interests are simply not aggregated by social organisations to be directed into government policy-making.

Therefore, while the quality of candidates matters to the voters, the most important factor is which candidate would be able to reciprocate their support at the polls with tangible benefits (Okole 2002: 37\u201340). The health of Pacific polities depends upon the reversal of trends away from popular participation, trust in institutions and support for ideals rather than individuals. As baseline activities, concerted civic education programs are needed to raise awareness and understanding about parliamentary functions throughout the Pacific to ensure that citizens are aware of the parameters of acceptable activity of their elected members, satisfied with the system\u2019s provisions for financial probity, knowledgeable about their options for redress when they feel Building Political Governance Frameworks 25 that their leaders have acted unaccountably and capable of advocating for change where needed. The existing activities of CSOs which address these issues should be supported. A basic measure therefore would be to educate civil society in its broadest sense about the roles and responsibilities of the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. Ongoing public education campaigns on the political system, particularly in rural villages and in primary schools, are long-term strategies. In general, the need for civic education components to be included in school curricula development for primary and secondary schools is a broad and widely recognized problem in the Pacific; Transparency International has already begun this process in Vanuatu. Curriculum development should involve components for visiting parliament during session, where practicable. Appropriate civic education strategies and awareness raising activities, incorporating school and university curriculum development, radio programs and the like are needed in a range of sectors and jurisdictions. Simultaneously, support for further research on constituency parliament relations in the PICs is needed to inform the development of appropriate and sustainable community outreach programs, which plausibly could benefit from existing civil society organisation networks. Parliaments cooperating with civil society Any plan for cooperation in FICs to facilitate the realization of the MDGs raises the thorny issue of how best to effect meaningful relations between Civil society, the Executive and the Legislature. CSOs already play pivotal, albeit informal, roles in parliamentary process across the Pacific, especially regarding issues such as awareness raising and advocacy for domestic violence and family law reform. While these informal mechanisms of civil society advocacy are beneficial, one of the major political governance challenges in the Pacific Islands is the unproductive nature of many civil society- parliamentarian interactions. MPs and civil society representatives \u2014 particularly NGO activists engaged in lobbying and advocacy \u2014 are characteristically at loggerheads. One of the major challenges to Building Political Governance Frameworks 26 building productive political governance frameworks which can facilitate the fulfilment of the MDGs therefore is to encourage both meaningful alliances and healthy disagreements between civil society, Parliament and the Executive. Indeed, sometimes, the sign of life of a polity is the room stakeholders allow for opposing views and the mechanisms they employ for accommodating difference. It creates a false premise to expect MPs and civil society to agree on all issues, but more effort needs to be made by FIC legislators to tap into the expertise of local civil society actors, and to draw on it in their roles as lawmakers, overseers of the Executive and community representatives. As privileged decision makers, lawmakers require a mastery of the options available for reducing poverty and improving political governance. Drawing on civil society expertise would open FIC legislators to all sorts of information to strengthen their understanding of issues before them for debate. Already in Fiji, civil society groups brief committee members on certain issues, representing the great progress that legislators, civil society and the parliamentary secretariat have made in strengthening mutual information sharing. Given that they are often linked into international networks of advocacy and support, civil society organizations can provide useful information networks for MPs, keeping them abreast of international developments, comparative national information and regional/local experiences of service delivery. Throughout the life-cycle of a parliament, and at each major legislative juncture, there are opportunities for productive civil society-parliament interaction, cooperation and/or synchronization. Basic lawmaking, the budget cycle and ongoing committee work all contain entry points for civil society actors to take part in parliamentary governance. Given that certain Bills before government may not be accessible to rural or undereducated people \u2014 who nonetheless are affected by legislation \u2014 CSOs offer avenues for the dissemination of information on their content and ramifications. Already across the Pacific, CSOs are involved in advocating for legislative change, contributing to policy discussions through consultative forums and contributing to public education Building Political Governance Frameworks 27 programs.

The adoption of governance arrangements which encourage meaningful interaction between civil society, the Legislature and the Executive will serve to improve MP\u2019s access to information crucial to the development of proactive state law and to bringing local focus to the global agenda of the MDGs. In concert with a more active role for parliamentary secretariats in terms of drawing on civil society expertise for briefing papers, measures like these could contribute to the strengthening of the legislative cycle. Civil society groups, especially NGOs engaged in lobbying and advocacy on particular issues, such as the position of women in society, poverty, education, HIV/AIDS and public health, can provide information for government and opposition members on legislation before them for consideration. Moreover, should committee secretariats be able to formalize and standardize civil society inputs (briefing papers, submissions and the like) into committee procedures, another valuable avenue for Civil society/Legislature/ Executive cooperation could be created. In the monitoring of budget rounds CSOs may be able to leverage support among MPs for pro-poor policies by holding public meetings on issues of concern for citizens, such as poverty alleviation, gender empowerment and communicable and vector borne disease eradication. Empowering Women Parliamentarians are strategically placed to provide leadership in advancing gender issues in political and decision-making processes. Lobbyists and advocates for change should target MPs to increase their understanding of and sensitivity to gender, democracy and development. While gender issues should be mainstreamed in the broader governance debate, professional development for parlia- mentarians similarly should encourage the promotion and training of Building Political Governance Frameworks 28 women MPs. Yet there are few powerful women leaders in FIC legislatures. While women have suffrage throughout the FICs, the record of having women elected to parliament has generally been poor. Despite their increasing employment in the upper echelons of government bureaucracies throughout the Pacific Island states, women remain under-represented in national legislatures. Throughout the Pacific \u2014 even where concrete initiatives have been taken to strengthen the position of women in society generally and in public decision-making specifically \u2014 empowerment programs have had only limited effect. Only one woman has been elected to the Tuvaluan parliament (two women are departmental secretaries). The Marshall Islands, PNG, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu each have only one elected woman representative. Tonga has had three women elected to the Legislative Assembly but none has become a Minister. Of all the small islands states, Fiji has the strongest representation of women in national parliament: there are eight national representatives, five of whom are in the lower house and four of whom hold ministries. International agencies and local NGOs have focussed on achievable reforms such as ensuring that laws are drafted in non- gender specific language and supporting legal and political literacy programs for grassroots women with an eye to facilitating the advancement of women at all levels of society. The PNG government has enacted legislation, aimed to enable women to participate equally with men in the affairs of the country, with limited success. Provisions are contained in PNG\u2019s Organic Law on the Integrity of Political Parties and Candidates (OLIPPC) that are designed to encourage parties to support women candidates, although these have not yet translated into more women being elected to parliament.3 Enacting legislation to require a role for women in public leadership has yielded limited returns for women\u2019s empowerment overall. While the new constitution Building Political Governance Frameworks 29 3 Section 62 of the OLIPPC provides that a female candidate who receives 10 percent or more of the votes shall have 75 percent of her campaign expenses refunded by Central Fund Board of Management to the political party that endorsed her. of Bougainville sets aside three seats exclusively for women, no woman stood for any of the other seats. Of key importance would be to place the issue of women\u2019s role in public leadership more squarely on the agenda for public discussion. The assumption that public leadership is men\u2019s business is pervasive in the Pacific islands for myriad reasons, not least the predominance of conservative Christian and traditionalist ideologies. While there are no explicit legal barriers preventing women from running for office, societal structures make it incredibly difficult. Certain laws might contain provisions for gender empowerment, but these are often not enforced.

Many people argue that women should not be privileged in any way, especially as the opportunity and freedom to participate is already available. That is, many problems facing women in their attempts to be elected to public office are simply too big to be tackled in the course of a legislative strengthening project. In effect, this means women are impeded at every step along the route to election to national parliament, with this resistance often being couched in terms of tradition. The lack of overt legal impediments to their empower- ment and entrenched attitudes among both women and men continue to undermine a greater role for women in public decision-making. Nonetheless, it is logical to assume that the more women in elected office the more that issues hitherto suppressed from public debate will be brought to the fore. Not least among them will be the issue of women in public leadership itself, but myriad social issues such as maternal health, domestic violence and HIV/AIDS may find greater voice in national affairs. Assuming their future success, statutory reforms such as the provisions of OLIPPC mentioned above will provide the framework for further non-statutory strategies of empowerment. Women in Building Political Governance Frameworks 30 parliament may need to mobilise collectively in women\u2019s caucuses, irrespective of party differences, if they are to raise the profile of women MPs and gain higher offices within the parliament (IDEA 2002). Simultaneously, women need to rely on men in parliament for the attainment of offices. A key problem with furthering women\u2019s participation in public decision-making is that many programs tend to corral them away from men. This can be useful in building women\u2019s networks but it generally reinforces the existing problem. Hence, strategies for promotion within parliament and within parliamentary political parties are necessary. More general changes to political party organisation may need to be made to allow women into all levels of the party hierarchy. Already many Pacific Islands political parties publicly acknowledge the value of electoral support from women, especially those parties heavily dependent on urban, educated electorates. In Fiji each of the major political parties advocates several programs to improve the position of women: publicly the parties advocate strong stances on sentencing for sexual offences, making sexual harassment a crime and long-term civic education strategies. The ongoing review of the progress, opportunities and obstacles to women\u2019s political participation needs to be maintained.

Building Political Governance Frameworks 32 Advancing the MDGs through Parliamentary Strengthening I f the MDGs are to be reached in the Pacific Islands, then the existing bottlenecks and obstacles to stable and effective parliamentary governance need to be overcome. Foremost, the contents and implications of the MDGs \u2014 viz. poverty eradication, universal primary education, gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, the reduction of child mortality, the improvement of maternal health, the combating of HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, the adoption of practices supportive of environmental sustainability, and the development of global partnership for development \u2014 need to be mainstreamed in domestic political discussion. This will require the broadening of the focus of the UN and allied stakeholders in human development from the bailiwick of the Executive to include all elected representatives in discussions about the MDGs.

Broadening the focus of discussions to include all stakeholders in the legislative process is similarly crucial to encouraging local ownership of the MDGs. Indeed, while signing on to the MDGs was correctly the role of the Executive, giving the MDGs force in law, ensuring that government policies remain consistent with them and maintaining support for their implications is the role of every MP from every electorate in the Pacific region. Overall, the Legislature itself should determine the level of involvement in pro-MDG policies, not donor agencies. A necessary measure, therefore, will be to have parliaments issue resolutions on the MDGs, drawing their implications into domestic political debate, providing signposts for civil society actors about parliamentary support for the MDGs and providing benchmarks for national action, discrete from the Executive agenda. Where they are not already in place, mechanisms for the monitoring and evaluation of the MDGs, the domestic drafting of progress reports, and their use in public debate are crucial, as well as the improvements to national and regional development policies, recommended above. Consulting with MPs at the earliest stages of policy advocacy may provide human development activists with the greatest chance of having their message incorporated into public debate, rather than being stifled by a lack of information or staying narrowly defined by Executive pronouncements without the commensurate involvement of the Legislature. Where they exist, committees may effect meaning- ful interaction between legislators and constituents and contribute to the dovetailing of community concerns, poverty reduction and pro- poor budgeting. Where they are functional \u2014 Samoa, PNG and Fiji \u2014 standing or select committees act as conduits of community, sectoral and industry sentiment relating to issues central to the MDGs. Tasks such as the prioritization of MDGs in budgeting, including provisions for gender-sensitivity, education priorities, health and environmental sustainability, equitable and efficient domestic revenue raising (taxation) and the alignment of aid disbursements with national and sub-national priorities are of crucial importance (UNDP 2004), but their effects are unlikely to be exhaustive or sustainable without significant domestic pressure being brought to bear on Executive decision-makers. This may only be possible through the mobilisation of public sentiment, articulated through elected representatives and civil society activists. It is here that the dual role of MPs as both representatives of community aspirations and shapers of public thinking are the clearest. Building Political Governance Frameworks 34 Arguably, legislatures occupy the apex of the Westminster systems which have been bequeathed to the Pacific Islands, and the Legislature should act ideally as the central forum for debates about public policy. The creation of interest groups, caucuses and the like within regional legislatures which transcend the vested interests of region, ethnicity and family, and which promote the attainment of the MDGs may be one way of ensuring meaningful discussion about the global agenda encapsulated in the Millennium Declaration. The failure to do so may spell disaster for the MDGs.

Appendix II The Millennium Development Goals At the Millennium Summit in 2000, world leaders pledged to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The 8 MDGs offer an agreed pace for development and a means by which to measure results. By 2015 all 189 United Nations Member States have pledged to: Goal 1. Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger Goal 2. Achieve universal primary education Goal 3. Promote gender equality and empowerment of women Goal 4. Reduce child mortality Goal 5. Improve maternal health Goal 6. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases Goal 7. Ensure environmental sustainability Goal 8. Develop a global partnership for development UNDP, as the UN\u2019s global development network, links and coordinates global and national efforts to reach the Millennium goals. There are four pillars of UNDP\u2019s strategy in support of the goals: \u2014 Integrating the MDGs into all aspects of the UN system\u2019s work at the country level, including creating new guidelines for country assessments and national development frameworks; \u2014 Assisting developing countries in preparing MDG reports that chart progress towards the goals, in cooperation with other UN agencies, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, civil society and other partners; \u2014 Supporting the Millennium Project, led by Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University, and the Millennium Campaign to build global support for the goals; \u2014 Supporting advocacy and awareness-raising efforts based on national strategies and national needs. Developed countries focus on trade, aid, technology and other support needed to reach the MDGs, while in developing countries, the aim is to build coalitions for action and help governments set priorities and use resources more effectively. MDGs at the country level Through the UN country teams worldwide, UNDP leads efforts to help countries integrate the Millennium Development Goals into their national development frameworks. Countries are tailoring the MDGs to national circumstances, building them into national development strategies and policies, and incorporating them in budgets and ministries\u2019 priorities. The goals are also integrated into assistance frameworks and programmes. For more than 70 of the poorest countries, the main strategic tool is a nationally-owned poverty reduction strategy, which relates to national budgets, development activities and other assistance frameworks. Charting progress Countries \u2014 Dozens of national MDG reports have been issued, and more are under preparation. The plan is for each developing country to have at least one report, either nationally or as a region, by September 2005 when the UN Secretary General presents a Global Report on progress towards achieving the MDGs. Donor countries are also being encouraged to prepare reports that analyse their contribution to Goal 8. In the Pacific several Pacific island countries are in the process of preparing national MDG reports \u2014 Fiji, Samoa, PNG, Solomon Islands and Tonga are amongst these. Regions \u2014 UNDP collaborates with other UN agencies, governments and regional commissions on regional MDGs reports. In March 2003, Building Political Governance Frameworks 42 representatives of Pacific Island Countries met to discuss how the Millennium Development Goals could best be incorporated into national strategies. This was a significant step towards devising a cohesive approach to achieve these goals as a sub-region and as a means of contributing towards the realisation of this global challenge. Since then, Pacific Island Countries have incorporated the MDGs as part of their national and regional development plans. It has also become a priority for many regional organizations to work towards achieving these goals in partnership with UNDP. Partnerships with regional organizations and with the Pacific Community (SPC) in particular saw the publishing of The Pacific Regional MDG Report in 2004. Global \u2014 The UN Secretary-General issues a yearly report on progress toward implementation of the Millennium Declaration, including the MDGs. This report is based on information drawn from across the UN system. A comprehensive review is planned for 2005, and will draw on the MDG Reports produced nationally among other products and reports. Millennium Project Launched in July 2002, the Millennium Project is an independent advisory project commissioned by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and supported by the UN Development Group. Professor Jeffrey Sachs, Special Advisor to the Secretary-General on the Millennium Development Goals and Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University directs the Millennium Project. Working in cooperation with developing countries and other partners, the project has set up an expert task force to prepare strategies to help countries achieve the goals by bringing together the best current thinking and research.

UNDP - United Nations Development Programme USAID - United States Agency for International Development Executive Summary Moving towards poverty reduction requires not just the generation of growing and sus- tainable income streams among the poor but also protecting these incomes through effec- tive risk management.

At the household level, insurance serves as a tool for addressing ex ante risks as opposed to coping with a disaster after an unfortu- nate event has occurred. At the macro level, insurance provides long term funds that can be used for infrastructure development. While the utility of insurance for the poor is evident, market based insurance may not be immedi- ately applicable for all categories of the BoP population. Its potential is likely to be greater for those with income streams and assets to protect, at least in the early days of market development. Conservatively estimated, the potential market size for microinsurance (life and non life) in India ranges between INR 62, 304.70 to 84,267.55 million (US$ 1,298.01 to 1,755.57 million), which is only expected to grow as microinsurance is better understood. In the case of life, the potential is estimated to be between INR15,393 to 20,141 million (US$ 320.69 to 419.60 million); in the case of non-life, between INR 46,911.70 to 64,126.55 million (US$ 977.33 to 1312.05 million). The non-life estimation is limited to four types of coverage \u2013 milch animals, livestock, health and crop insurance.

Rationale for Microinsurance Moving toward poverty reduction requires not just the generation of growing and sustainable income streams among the poor, but also pro- tecting these incomes through effective risk management - a complementary, twin-track approach. However, in contrast with income generation schemes,1 risk management among the poor has received much less attention, es- pecially for those in rural areas and even more so for women, who tend to be at the bottom of \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd Millennium Development Goal aims to eradi- cate extreme poverty and hunger; microinsur- ance also contributes to the third Goal of wom- en\u2019s empowerment among the rural poor. With low assets and incomes, even small shocks can have disproportionately large, adverse im- pacts on women\u2019s human condition because the capacity of this section of the population to weather risks is limited; a need exists to insti- tutionalize risk management. For India, in keeping with its national development goals, risk management among low income populations can contribute to eco- nomic and social inclusion, especially for rural households and women, addressing the multi- dimensionality of poverty. It can complement rural development and employment generation schemes, promoting convergence between in- come generation and protection. Insurance can minimize the loss of development gains among the rural poor by reducing vulnerabilities faced by the relatively disadvantaged. Where income is dependent on credit-based agricultural op- erations or rural micro and small enterprises, insurance can provide cover for repayments in times of loss.

For such solutions to be sustainable, they have to be commercially viable as well. Both supply and demand side bottlenecks exist in extending insurance services to the rural poor, resulting in a missing market. A mismatch exists between the standard prod- ucts and services available in the market and what can be of use to the target population. On the supply side, the standard set of products offered by insurance companies is largely designed for the relatively better off, predominantly urban male clientele, with a few products aimed at female customers.

Insurance is not well understood and the knowledge of its potential as a risk manage- ment tool is not widely prevalent. Pricing of ex- isting insurance products has been a deterrent. Moreover, the products have been unsuitable. Complicated procedures also have contributed to alack of demand, in spite of need. In combination, these and other bottlenecks discussed below have constrained the devel- opment of more inclusive insurance services. Though ambitious in stated intent, most poverty reduction programmes have limited reach and only partially support the poor, addressing risk incidentally, if at all. The most vulnerable rural populations - in particular, women - are largely excluded from the insurance market. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd A well-developed insurance sector has both mi- cro level implications for households and macro implications for the economy as a whole. At the household level, insurance serves as a tool for addressing ex ante risks instead of coping with a disaster after an unfortunate event has occurred. Insurance can provide part or full cover for both unanticipated events - natural disasters, illness and death - as well as expected events such as drought, or vital events like marriage or child- birth, when households in India can face desta- bilizing lump-sum expenses. It can serve as an alternative and a supplement to more informal, traditional support mechanisms. At the macro level, insurance provides long-term funds that can be used for infrastruc- ture development while strengthening risk- taking abilities of people. In India the life in- surance sector has contributed INR 6,041,798 million (US$ 125,871 million) as funds avail- able for investment, as of March 2007 cumu- latively; non-life insurance investment amounts to INR 503,828 million (US$ 10,496 million) in the same period7.

Chapter 2 : Insurance in India 2.0 Introduction Of the total global insurance premium, esti- mated at US$ 4,060.87 billion in 2007, India\u2019s share of the insurance market accounted for 1.34 percent, up from an abysmal 0.73 percent in 2005. This amounts to US$ 54,375 million for the year against US$ 25,024 million for 2005, improving India\u2019s spot from 19th to 15th out of 88 countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "256929b5-74b2-427e-93a2-c10f53b6dedd": {"__data__": {"id_": "256929b5-74b2-427e-93a2-c10f53b6dedd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/building-security-poor-potential-and-prospects-microinsurance-india-second-edition", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Building Security for the Poor: Potential and Prospects for Microinsurance in India (Second edition)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/building-security-poor-potential-and-prospects-microinsurance-india-second-edition", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42f60e080e885dae71de902cab9f01fa380353bb9a8bb43a1c2d4295f016c8d2"}, "2": {"node_id": "0f3e2bf6-6ae8-482d-b4e0-aafce2ea2b37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/building-security-poor-potential-and-prospects-microinsurance-india-second-edition", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72ed41f7e0cbc96f149c0c8d0e8f9e108c5189696cdaaa396b9f235e1c29ddc8"}}, "hash": "3451e7e814807c00ae356552ee0522b620f29599a544623b84e7fbdc1f0be2c0", "text": "Among emerging mar- kets India ranked second, after China. Of the total for India, most was accounted for by life insurance premiums with a turnover of US$ 47,132 million in 2007, more than doubled to US$ 20,176 million in 2005 (which was 11.38 percent of total emerging markets). Though non-life premiums comprised just US$ 7,243 million in 2007, they were up from US$ 4,848 million in 2005 (which was 3.31 percent of to- tal emerging markets).12 Insurance penetration, an indication of the level of risk awareness in \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd an economy, increased from less than half to 63 percent of the global average between 2005 and 2007. Insurance density, used to measure progress of the insurance industry relative to other countries and its maturity in the economy, increased from about 4 percent to 7.7 percent of the world average (Table 1.1). As suggested by these statistics, the overall insurance industry in India is still at a rudimen- tary stage of development, in spite of its large population and the varied risks people face. This points to an enormous scope for growth. The potential is even higher when the untapped rural population is considered.

Moreover, it is largely supply driven, as most insurers re- peatedly indicated during discussions. Consid- erable work remains for the potential to be real- ized. Recent changes in national policies have brought about an expectation of new dynamism in the insurance sector, inducing a shift from the past, with a clear signal to the industry to expand in the direction of the rural poor.

In India the formal insur- ance industry started in 1818 with the establish- ment of the Oriental Life Insurance Company in Calcutta. General insurance business (non- life) came into existence in 1850 with the com- mencement of the Triton Insurance Company. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd pre-independence period in 1938. Almost a decade after India\u2019s indepen- dence from the British in 1947, the Government of India merged 240 private insurance compa- nies to form the government owned Life Insur- ance Corporation of India (LIC) in 1956. The stated aims of nationalization were countering high levels of fraud and improving the spread across the country for better security for people. Non-life insurance companies also were nation- alized in 1972 and taken over by General Insur- ance Corporation (GIC) and its four subsidiar- ies - United India Insurance Company Limited, Oriental Insurance Company Limited, National Insurance Company Limited and New India As- surance Company Limited.

Coverage also has been largely for men. Lack of appropriate products and challenges of de- livery channels, coupled with limited demand arising from low awareness, have resulted in a rather low penetration of insurance services outside urban areas.

The traditional jajmani (patron-client) system24 is breaking down, and zamindars (landlords) have disappeared as the system was dismantled after independence.

A number of Govern- ment run poverty reduction and social security schemes have replaced traditional systems, but they have limited coverage and do not address vulnerability to risks and shocks. Coping with risks and shocks without in- surance further limits potential for income growth, savings and asset accumulation. These shocks affect poor rural households in many adverse ways, including reduced capacity to work, low productivity, increased absenteeism from work, reduced food consumption and nu- trition security, high drop out rates of school children, and homelessness, aggravating overall deprivation and human poverty. Understanding risks among the BoP is essential in formulating appropriate supply side responses through ap- propriate products, pricing and procedural in- novations, as well as in facilitating the growth of demand through education and marketing. 3.1 Risk Categorization Risks and shocks arise from many different factors, unanticipated and anticipated.

Accidents and Ill Health For those with limited or no productive assets, labour is the primary income source.

The direct costs of treatment also forced affected households to borrow. Those with productive assets faced losses due to asset sale or pledging to raise funds for treatment. In either case, economic costs were a concern. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd- gations included disability caused by accidents while using a harvester or thresher, injuries \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd hits, falling into a well while drawing water, being hit by toppled trees during high veloc- ity winds, snake bites, inhaling pesticides while \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd getting dragged into the sea while spreading \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd road accidents for those living by the side of highways and in urbanized areas. Under ill health, economic implications differed depend- ing upon whether hospitalization was required. In case of hospitalization, loss of wages of the attendee also needed to be accounted for. Al- most 80 percent of diseases causing ill health are either waterborne or caused by water bod- ies (cholera, diarrhoea, typhoid and hepatitis A), particularly relevant for rural populations whose access to protected water cannot be tak- en for granted. Communicable diseases also are reported, adding to health risks faced by indi- viduals and communities. The average rural household spent INR 90 (US$ 2) on an illness without hospitalization and INR1,044 (US$ 23.20) in case of hospital- ization.28 Under the former, major components of costs include - 71 percent on medicines, 8 percent on diets, and 14 percent on transport. In case of hospitalisation, major components of cost are 52 percent on medicines, 15 per- cent on clinical tests, 12 percent on transport, 8 percent on surgery, 8 percent on diet and 4 percent as hospital charges. The Network for Education and Empowerment of Rural Artisans (NEERA)29 conducted a health survey in 2002 among 1,748 self-help groups in southern Tam- il Nadu - a population group where women are relatively empowered and are more likely to seek health care - the results of the 2002 health survey suggested that 9.32 percent of all mem- bers had been hospitalized for in-patient care.

It is estimated that 56 percent of the country is prone to earth- quakes and 68 percent to drought. Natural di- sasters affect the vulnerable poor populations much more than the better off. The devastating effects of the 2004 tsunami on the coastal ar- eas are well known, the tsunami which hit 12 coastal countries killed around 280,000 while successfully damaging infrastructure and pro- duction facilities. All this has underscored the need for insurance, perhaps not as a stand alone instrument, but certainly as a part of overall risk mitigation for areas prone to such covariant risks. Droughts also can be disruptive, though their risks are underestimated because they do not happen suddenly. In Rajasthan severe droughts are a prominent risk, as the illustrative \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd g. Life Cycle and Female Oriented Risks Financial shocks associated with the life cycle affect rural households because of the demands they impose on the household. These are dif- ferent from premature deaths, as they are pre- dictable in nature.

Of the 400 children enrolled in the local school, only 150 attended. The remainder had dropped out for paid work to support their families during the drought.

It was necessary to transfer the risk, an important avenue for which was re-insurance. Just as the poor have no access to insurance, microinsurance institutions typically have no access to re-insurance under current regula- tions.75 During the 7th Global Conference of Actuaries it was demonstrated that re-insurance was a cheaper alternative than holding high contingency reserves.76 Creation of a facility \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd At a Round Table Conference on Microin- surance Regulations, organized by FICCI and IRDA in February 2005, it was proposed that smaller microinsurance organizations, such as NGOs and MFIs, be given the space and op- portunity to grow by bringing them under \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd guidelines published in November 2005 did not consider these smaller players as insurers, even though some had pioneered interesting innova- tions in this nascent industry.

It highlights factors that have inhibited this market. Need has not been trans- lated into demand. Non availability of custom- ized products and perceived high premiums by customers can be compounded by poor distri- bution, resulting in low outreach. Procedural and regulatory factors can inhibit and facilitate. Yet it has also found that the impact of micro- insurance is positive where new products and processes have been successful in responding to client needs.

Management and pooling of such data is vital for insurers and intermediaries to be able to offer the best prices -- even reduce them over time. Box 5.7 illustrates how data can be used in pricing decisions. The SMART Card system of MicroCare in Uganda (see Section 4.5) also is illustrative of how shared electronic databases updated in real time, have helped adjust prices for medicines and treatments as well as moni- tor diagnostic practices for microinsurance clients. d. Subsidies Insurance was being subsidized in part because of the need to meet quota obligations. The question of whether or not to subsidize was much discussed among insurers and intermediaries. The predominant opinion opposed subsidies. Insurers and intermediaries argued that subsidies were highly detrimental to the long term development of this new market. It was important for long term sustainability that ru- ral insurance products be designed and priced \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd own.

While subsidies could distort incentives, the reverse is also taking place, with demand being sustained through subsidization of premiums. As seen in Box 5.6, the prominent life insurance product JBY is being sold for INR 200 per member per year, of which only half is paid by the insured. Although the price is considered unduly high for the cover pro- vided, clients were buying the JBY because of the Government subsidy, helping market devel- opment. However, what would happen if the subsidy were suddenly withdrawn remained an open question. Well meaning social protection schemes initiated by the Government thus could dis- tort the market for rural insurance and create avoidable confusion, as seen in a Tamil Nadu example based on donor funding from the In- ternational Fund for Agricultural Development, Rome (Box 5.9). The question of whether or not to subsidize was much debated Box 5.8 Subsidies Could Lead to Distortions: An Example from Rajasthan The Urmul Seemanut Samity operating in Bajju, Rajasthan, paid a premium of INR 13,000 (US$ 289) for rainfall insurance covering 21 farmers. Having become accustomed to this, they saw no point in paying the premiums from their own pockets. This also created a dependency on the NGO. The farmers were neither aware of product\u2019s features, nor whether it met their needs -- and they did not really care. The money spent on subsidizing insurance for a handful of farmers could have been better spent on educating a larger number about the risks they faced and insurance potential to address their real needs. 59 Chapter 5 : Understanding Ground Realties: What Works and What Does Not Building Security for the Poor 60 5.4 Distribution and Outreach Issues Insurance companies found the cost of \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd a.
