These can take the form of: A. Managing land-related vulnerabilities in recovery B. Finding land for relocation of at-risk households C. Providing secure tenure to families and businesses to avoid later displacement These challenges are often compounded by the presence of informal land systems and weaknesses in formal land administration. Situations such as poor land records may be pre-existing problems, or caused by the disaster. A. Managing land-related vulnerabilities UN-HABITAT identifies five land-related characteristics of disaster vulnerability, which are mutually reinforcing.140 \u00a7\ufffd Unsustainable land uses \u00a7\ufffd Poor urban planning \u00a7\ufffd Landlessness (lack of access to land markets) \u00a7\ufffd Land-related discrimination \u00a7\ufffd Weak land administration Long-term disaster risk reduction in ASEAN Member States depends on improving access to safe land, particularly for low-income households, and on making land use sustainable. The need for significant relocation of facilities or housing following a disaster often indicates policy and regulatory gaps, either in land administration or land use planning and regulation, or both. The disaster recovery period will not provide the time to fully implement reforms to reduce land-related risks. Nevertheless, they should be addressed in 140 UN-HABITAT, 2010, Land and Natural Disasters: Guidance for Practitioners. http://unhabitat.org/books/land-and-natural-disasters-guidance- for-practitioners/ 141 Land readjustment is also called community-based land adjudication.

B. Finding land for relocation Human settlements in unsafe locations can cause or worsen disaster impacts. As a result, recovery frequently prompts a search for land to relocate facilities, households, and businesses to safer sites. Yet the site selection process itself is subject to various risks. Relevant solutions may be different in urban and rural contexts.

An initiative was launched to involve people in rebuilding their settlements, supported by multiple donors, which included community-driven land adjudication (or community land mapping). Volunteers were trained to identify landmarks and to produce drawings that showed parcel boundaries. Once completed, the map was signed by a family member and owners of neighbouring parcels. The national Land Administration Agency validated the community\u2019s findings regarding ownership and boundaries, using land records from before the tsunami and parcel measurements, and then secured community agreement. The ruling on the land parcels was published, and registration of titles was offered free of charge. The goal was to formalise 600,000 land titles. The property management system was computerized, and joint titling for married couples was introduced. This activity set the stage for reconstruction in these disaster-affected regions.143 93 94 Figure 5: Continuum of Land Rights Source: United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), Handling Land: Innovative Tools for Land Governance and Secure Tenure. 144 Food and Agriculture Organisation, 2012, Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f939c0a-4660-4694-ae2e-7772698f6eec": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f939c0a-4660-4694-ae2e-7772698f6eec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN Disaster Recovery Reference Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a70a7c962123e6b261d10e524b95226ac0af48d5371407647a4a1c5422a8d9e"}, "2": {"node_id": "780cbff9-2429-4f8a-b8c4-98c56d2d80b7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-disaster-recovery-reference-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3bc78efead53b09fa16c56a44c7bf51ac9d4237fc29cdfbe56cfe45003e2fe57"}}, "hash": "98cc2eb72021d3df7596d5782fb0c45701e3de4a878e85aa898dfcde67e30040", "text": "http://www.fao.org/nr/tenure/voluntary-guidelines/en/ and Oxfam, 2015, Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security from a Gender Perspective. https://www.oxfam.de/system/files/ox_vggts_broschuere_web.pdf Security of land tenure is considered by many to be as important for housing and livelihoods as formal land ownership, especially for women.

The disaster killed more than 6,000 people, 4.1 million were displaced, and another 1,785 others went missing. Around 1.2 million houses were damaged; 50 per cent severely.145 The affected areas were some of the poorest provinces of the country. Following the disaster, the President of the Philippines declared a no-build zone of 40 meters from the shoreline with the objective of reducing the exposure of lives and assets in the vulnerable coastal zones, especially during the Yolanda recovery process. Between November 2013 and January 2014, a number of local institutions (municipalities and cities) in the affected areas issued ordinances related to no-build zones.146 On 1 February 2014, the Government of the Philippines downgraded the no-build zone to a no-dwelling zone. It was clarified that a blanket application of the no-build zone will not address exceptional circumstances and may be impractical for certain areas. For example, areas with fishing industries or tourism-oriented businesses still need to build structures within 40 meters from the coastline. Moreover, areas located in high elevations, though in the 40-meter zone, are not susceptible to storm surges. This entailed distinguishing between \u2018Safe Zones\u2019 and \u2018Unsafe Zones\u2019 and identifying \u2018No Dwelling Zones.\u2019 In order to identify safe and unsafe zones, hazard risk maps were developed of the affected areas between April and November 2014. An Inter-Agency Committee comprising of the Department of National Defence, Department of Public Works and Highways, Department of Interior and Local Government, Department of Science and Technology and Department of Environment and Natural Resources collaborated to prepare hazard maps of usable scale for the affected region. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources developed and shared geo-hazard maps at a scale of 1:10,000 for 131 out of the 171 municipalities of Yolanda-hit provinces. These maps were intended to be of use by the Local Government Units as a tool to plan their resettlement and rebuilding efforts. The implementation of the no-dwelling zone resulted in an increased awareness of the need and usage of high- resolution hazard maps for risk reduction in recovery. It also included setting up a mechanism for the generation, dissemination, and usage of high-resolution hazard maps in recovery planning and implementation 145 NEDA, Reconstruction Assistance on Yolanda, Philippines, 16 December 2013, p. 2-3 146 Communications with Communities, Report Number 13, 24 February- 1 April 2014, p.1 95 96 GLOSSARY Accountability The obligation to demonstrate that the activities of public and non-governmental actors are conducted in accordance with agreed rules and standards and report fairly and accurately on results.

processes related to Development Finance, including the 3rd international conference on Financing for Development (FfD), which will take place in addis ababa in July. in september, the sustainable Development goals are expected to be agreed; an important element of the sDgs will be discussions on the means of implementation, including a focus on the financing of the Goals. At the end of the year, the uNFccc conference of Parties (coP 21) will take place in Paris, with countries meeting to discuss an international climate change agreement, and the financing architecture needed to take it forward. Following the associate administrator\u2019s participation in the asia Pacific High-Level Consultation on Financing for Development in Jakarta at the end of april, the bangkok regional hub (brh) has prepared this Issues Brief on Financing for Development as a resource for Country Offices and their partners. It is meant to complement resources developed at the global level, including the Desa web site on FfD, uNDP\u2019s FfD blog series, and the administrator\u2019s promotional video for the FfD conference. The nature and profile of development finance in Asia Pacific is changing rapidly: \uf076\ufffdThere have been significant changes to the regional profile of the inflows of international resources to countries. oDa continues to be an important source of development finance, yet it is declining as a proportion of the envelope of international inflows for many countries in the region. South-South Cooperation, while difficult to define and quantify, is increasing. china is thought to be the biggest ssc provider in the world, providing to 160 countries1. For the period 2010-2012, China provided a total of $US 14.41 billion in grants, interest-free and concessional loans.2 \uf076\ufffdThe regional development finance profile is also affected by outflows, including illicit financial flows. by nature difficult to track and measure, IFFs from the Asia Pacific were estimated at a scale of over $US 400 billion in 20113. overall, Asia Pacific accounts for 39.6% of total illicit outflows from developing countries, the largest share in volume among regions.4 \uf076\ufffdSuch illicit flows impinge on efforts to increase the volume of available development financing in the region, including through improvements in domestic resource mobilization.

This global transformation agenda is seen as vital in an increasingly interlinked world to address the impact of climate change, protect the planet, promote inclusive and sustainable growth, and foster peaceful and inclusive societies. The sustainable development agenda explicitly recognizes the importance of inclusive and responsive governance systems for achieving the three strands of sustainable development: social, economic and environment.i In this instance governance becomes an \u201cenabler\u201d for achieving all sustainable development goals, as well as being a \u201cgoal\u201d in and of itself.

The development context in Asia-Pacific Most countries in Asia-Pacific have witnessed significant economic growth and social transformation. The region has witnessed significant increases in financing for development with the majority of the countries of the region financing development from their own domestic revenues and international and domestic private flows. Official Development Assistance represents a shrinking relative resource for the region, except for some LDCs and SIDS.ii Almost all countries in the region have halved their poverty rates and the region, as a whole, has made significant progress in increasing access to safe drinking water, access to primary education, and meeting health targets. Despite these gains, economic growth has not benefitted everyone equitably. Asia\u2019s (as a single unit) Gini coefficient increased from 39 in the mid-1990s to 46 in the late 2000s. Income inequality between countries in the region has risen faster than within countries.iii The region is also home to about two-thirds of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c27fd25b-cf9c-4a1d-b464-4141984d6122": {"__data__": {"id_": "c27fd25b-cf9c-4a1d-b464-4141984d6122", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/issue-brief-governance-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Issue Brief - Governance for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/issue-brief-governance-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7915ffda53a4936211cc3f51fb9be868a3e8cf912840e9b8619ed9b3a25b5957"}}, "hash": "7915ffda53a4936211cc3f51fb9be868a3e8cf912840e9b8619ed9b3a25b5957", "text": "world\u2019s poorest people.

In addition, 1.2 billion people in rural areas and 480 million in urban areas still lacked access to safe sanitation.iv Over 600 million people lack access to electricity and nearly 2 billion people rely on inefficient energy sources in the region.v Gender based discrimination and inequality remains high in Asia-Pacific and close to 100 million women in Asia are \u201cmissing\u201d because of discriminatory treatment in access to health and nutrition, neglect or pre-birth sex selection.vi Women\u2019s political participation in the region is less than the global average and ranges from a low of 3.6% in the Pacific region to a high of 19.7% in South Asia.vii The region has also witnessed other development challenges such as climate change and rapid demographic shifts. While Afghanistan and Timor Leste have large populations of young people (over 50%), the rest of the region is experiencing diverging trends. South Asia\u2019s \u201cyouth bulge\u201d is plateauing and is expected to fall from 2035 onwards. East Asia\u2019s youth population has started to shrink from a high of 20% in 2005 and, overall, the number of young people aged 15-24 years in Asia is projected to decline from 718 million in 2015 to 711 million in 2030.viii This fundamentally means the region is rapidly ageing and by 2030 an estimated 565 million people above the age of 65 will live in the region. Climate change, rising sea levels and natural disasters are also expected to have a devastating impact\u2014particularly for low-lying countries such as Bangladesh and Pacific Island Countries. They can trigger migration and conflict and also reverse development gains (e.g. as seen in Nepal and Vanuatu). Quality of governance\u2014a key factor for development Efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have highlighted the importance of governance for developing and implementing policies and delivering quality services.ix Good governance (with a specific emphasis on human rights principles) is critical for dismantling discrimination and reducing inequalities. Poor governance is a factor that contributes to rising inequality and unequal development in the region.x Evidence shows that the performance of the Asia-Pacific countries on governance indicators has either stagnated or deteriorated. The overall performance of Asia-Pacific countries on Worldwide Governance Indicators (which measure the performance of countries on six governance dimensions: voice and accountability; political stability and absence of violence/terrorism, government effectiveness, rule of law, regulatory quality, and control of corruption) has deteriorated since 1996.xi Figure 1 below compares the performance of Asia-Pacific countries (according to East and South Asian sub-regions) on governance indicators in 2003 and 2013. While there is a sub-regional difference, the aggregate performance of Asia-Pacific countries on governance indicators has either stagnated or deteriorated over the last decade. The implication of weak governance on sustainable development is enormous. Evidence shows that good governance is essential for countries to move towards more inclusive and sustainable and sustained growth patterns. Better governance systems allows for the development of people-centric policies, effective and transparent use of the national budget, more capable and responsive institutions, social inclusion, efficient implementation of social and economic policies and regulations, efficient division of labour, and higher productivity of investment, all of which are important for sustained economic growth and sustainable development. The correlation between voice and Page3 accountability, rule of law, political stability and absence of violence, and development is stronger in middle and higher income countries.xii Figure 1: Performance of Asia-Pacific countries on governance indicators In recent years, several countries in the region have taken measures to constrain freedom of association or assembly, and clamp down on NGO activities (specifically human rights organizations).xiii But at the same time, transformation in the information and communication technology sector and growth in social media have created new platforms and avenues for public engagement and participation (e.g. Webo in China). Whilst there are increasing finances available in the region, particularly from increasing domestic resource mobilisation, the effectiveness and transparency of the budget process and government\u2019s capacity to allocate resources towards sustainable development and to deliver services remains weak, including at the local level. There is a dearth of data related to local revenues and expenditure. Where data is available, it points to low levels of public revenue and rates of expenditure. Weakness in allocating and using resources affects ability of governments at all levels to respond to crucial issues that require immediate action, such as climate change.

For example: in East and North East Asia region, the IFF ($152 billion) is 44% of the commercial resource inflows.xvi Marginalization, and economic and political exclusion continues to fuel intra-state conflicts and tensions. For example, the nearly five-decade long Maoist and Naxalite movement/conflict in India is due to land rights issues and unequal economic development.xvii Similar reasons were at the root of Nepal\u2019s Maoist insurgency, which ended in 2006. Conflicts and constitutional crisis in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Solomon Islands, and Thailand were related to access to political space.xviii Struggle for political and economic autonomy is the underlying reason for continued conflicts in Myanmar, and Mindanao in the Philippines. The Asia-Pacific region and the SDGs Asia-Pacific countries have actively engaged in discussion and working group meetings that have led to both the adoption of the Financing for Development Addis Ababa Action Agenda for implementation the SDGs, as well as the adoption of the SDGs themselves. For example, Indonesia co-chaired the high-level panel on SDGs and hosted regional consultations for Financing for Development (FFD)xix, while Malaysia hosted the regional workshop on SDGs and Philippines a regional workshop on FFD. Goal 16 is one of the goals countries in the region consider both an \u201cend\u201d goal and an \u201cenabler\u201d that is vital for the achievement of other SDGs.xx That said, some countries (India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, one of the seven triumvirates representing the Asia-Pacific group in the Open Working Group for SDGs) also view that SDGs should emphasize the development agenda and the governance and rule of law agendas should be locally driven (e.g. bottom-up approach). This was confirmed by the G77 where leaders called for country-level selection of development indicators. China\u2019s position paper on the SDGs (2013) also highlights the importance of addressing poverty and promoting sustainable development although it considers political factors, such as governance and human rights, to be domestic issues and not international goals. Despite the above reservations on Goal 16, countries have continued to fully engage in SDGs discussions and adopt the SDGs. Following the formal adoption of SDGs, countries are expected to go through a process of prioritization where they will align national and local development policies to achieve the SDGs. Countries will also identify indicators to measure progress against the 169 SDG targets. In spite of all this, it is important to note that commitments at the international level have often not translated into national and local level action. Even when national development programmes are consistent with international commitments, these programmes either \u201cdo not, or inadequately, obtain their desired or targeted results when implemented on ground\u201d.xxi Governance challenges, 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 East Asia 2003 East Asia 2013 South Asia 2003 South Asia 2013 Page4 including weak policy prioritization that does not take into account local context or lack of institutional capacity are major bottlenecks for not achieving desired results. Such disassociations may also prove to be a challenge in translating the SDGs into concrete plans and programmes. UNDP and the SDGs The UN Development Group (UNDG)\u2014through its Sustainable Development Working Group chaired by UNDP, UNICEF and WFP\u2014has adopted a joint strategy for effective and coherent implementation support, called Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support (MAPS). This strategy focuses on policy coherence and multi-stakeholder engagement, paying special attention to partnerships, data and accountability.

Thus, within the MAPS strategy, governance will be a \u201csupportive yet distinct element\u201dxxii that would allow UNDP to respond to the complexities of translating SDG goals for national and local implementation. For UNDP, governance is one of its core areas of work and UNDP\u2019s strategic plan (2014-2017) underscores the strong correlation between democratic governance and progress towards sustainable development. Increasingly, UNDP is taking a systems approach to its governance and peace-building programmes.xxiii This approach allows UNDP to consider the broader linkages between governance programmes and other priority areas. Such an approach also allows UNDP to take a leadership role in supporting the achievement of Goal 16 on peaceful and inclusive societies and ensuring linkages between Goal 16 and other goals on the sustainable development agenda. In implementing this systems approach, the UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub (BRH) has redefined its governance priorities so they will focus on, \u201cstrengthening political-democratic processes and governance systems that take into account voices and rights of all people for equitable and sustainable development.\u201d To achieve the above, BRH will work across four thematic areas: \uf0b7 Support political transitions for resilient, inclusive states and lasting peace; \uf0b7 Strengthen the rights and voices of vulnerable, marginalized and at-risk groups; \uf0b7 Maximize availability and good governance of development finance at global and national levels; and, \uf0b7 Strengthen transparent and accountable national and local governance systems to provide effective and equitable services. UNDP BRH support to strengthening governance for achieving sustainable development The above four thematic areas are in line with SDG 16. To clarify how UNDP will strengthen governance for achieving SDGs (specifically SDG 16), with the four thematic areas, BRH organized the Asia-Pacific Regional Dialogue on Governance and Peacebuilding in Bangkok, Thailand in September 2015. The dialogue brought together 80 staff from 22 UNDP country offices in the Asia-Pacific region, along with UNDP\u2019s regional and global Governance and Peacebuilding teams. A framework, as clarified in outcome document of the regional dialogue, was adopted at the dialogue for strengthening governance for sustainable development. The framework includes three dimensions. These are: a) Governance for the SDGs - refers to the political process of building national and local ownership of SDGs, prioritization of SDGs, and integrating SDGs with national planning and budgeting processes, and strengthening parliamentary oversight. b) Governance in the SDGs - refers to relevance of governance throughout all the SDGs. Here, UNDP can strengthen the achievement of the SDGs, specifically those in line with the organisation's mandate (such as poverty reduction, and inequality), through integrated approaches that address the legal, policy, and institutional challenges. c) Governance as a SDG - refers to SDG 16 on inclusive and peaceful societies, and the support UNDP will provide to achieve the SDG 16 targets. Page5 Specific activities within the framework will include: Holding national and local dialogues on SDG. A key lesson from MDG implementation was that \u201cbuy-in\u201d and \u201cownership\u201d of all stakeholders at national and local levels is vital for successful implementation of plans and programmes. To achieve this in relation to the SDGs, UNDP will support countries in launching national and local dialogue processes on the SDGs to inform prioritization and development of national and local development plans. Supporting governance assessments. Legal and institutional frameworks should be aligned to support the achievement of development policy aspirations, which in this case are the aspirations of the post-2015 development agenda. To this end, UNDP will support country-led governance assessments to ensure that gaps in legal, policy and institutional frameworks and capacities at all levels of government are identified and addressed. The governance assessment process will be a participatory process that can help strengthen the responsiveness and accountability of institutions. Localizing SDGs. The localization of SDGs (as in translating global goals into national and sub-national ambitions, policies and programmes) is considered a priority. UNDP, building on the lessons from MDG localization, will focus on supporting national and sub- national governments to define priorities and integrate SDGs into local planning and policy processes and service delivery systems. UNDP will also support identifying targets and priorities, developing indicators, and assessing progress. In addition, UNDP will support sub-national and local governments to prioritize goal 16 in order to strengthen local governance systems.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ecfdb67c-abed-411d-a2dc-07ef0fff2e47": {"__data__": {"id_": "ecfdb67c-abed-411d-a2dc-07ef0fff2e47", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/issue-brief-governance-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Issue Brief - Governance for Sustainable Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/issue-brief-governance-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3fcc0a6e0e0860de5434a6567cd62efb2827859342c6506b8f8109e062b1b1c3"}, "2": {"node_id": "1dfafdad-b8f5-46c3-a237-b604e9e72073", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/issue-brief-governance-sustainable-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "649cd12fd9fcd9541fb80bd3158683ba68c08cf03a7e3939a6aea84240d8bd35"}}, "hash": "fd21377c335a53ed71ca315ca7c2a859360a58759f4786a5e4acab5a6974837f", "text": "It will also foster enabling environments for relevant non-state actors (including the private sector) to contribute to local development initiatives.

Strengthening participation, transparency, accountability and anti-corruption initiatives. Strengthening the transparency and accountability of governance systems will underpin all of UNDP\u2019s governance work. UNDP will support programming that increases access to information, enhances public participation (including marginalized people) in public monitoring initiatives and decision making processes, and increases the transparency and accountability of public institutions. In addition, UNDP will also support strengthening oversight institutions and anti-corruption agencies working at national and sub-national levels. As part of strengthening the oversight and accountability framework for the SDGs, UNDP will also focus on strengthening parliaments (including sub-national legislatures) and civil society\u2019s role in monitoring the SDGs, as well as using data to hold governments to accounts. Where possible, partnerships will be established and capacity development support provided to produce shadow reports on SDG achievement. Supporting inclusive processes for political transformation. Through its regional initiative on peaceful and inclusive societies, UNDP BRH will support countries in the region to increase political participation and representation of all segments of the population. This approach could reduce the high incidences of political violence (a key target of SDG 16) and lead to political transformation. Most importantly, the political participation of women and young people will be supported through UNDP\u2019s efforts. Piloting SDG 16: Indonesia\u2019s experience UNDP supported the piloting of SDG 16 in five countries including Indonesia from July 2014 to September 2015. The primary objective of the pilot project is to enhance the readiness of the country in integrating proposed SDG 16 and associated targets into national planning processes. Under the leadership of Bappenas (the national planning agency) at the national level and Bappeda (the regional planning agency) at the sub-national level, the pilot project helped identify different sources of information to report on SDG 16 targets. For example, information on violent death rates was collected from the case management systems of national police, the attorney general and courts at the national and sub-national levels. Existing national indices such as the Indonesia Democracy Index, the Anti-corruption behavior Index, and data from the Corruption Eradication Commission provided relevant data on effective and accountable institutions and levels of corruption. All data however, was not in \u201cready to use\u201d format. Consolidated data mechanisms often do not exist and data is spread over several institutions. At the sub-national level, the limited scope and capacity of local governments has led to the use of different data management systems, which makes data incomparable and challenging to use. The pilot project helped identify gaps in existing data management systems and in the production and utilization of data in planning and budgetary processes. Based on this, one of the immediate steps for Indonesia is to collaborate with the \u2018Praia group on Governance Statistics\u2019 to develop relevant country-level indicators and establish integrated data systems for all SDGs. Indonesia will also share its experience on establishing working groups and stakeholder engagement to develop indicators and identify sources of data with other countries. Page6 Measuring the SDGs. A robust monitoring, review and reporting framework (at the local, national, regional and global levels) is proposed for the SDGs. Each level of monitoring requires different types of indicators, and data that is collected needs to be defined, collated, analyzed and utilized for future policy setting. The box on piloting SDG 16 in Indonesia highlights some of the challenges related to the implementation of SDGs, specifically with regards to establishing and measuring country-level targets and indicators. UNDP will prioritize supporting governments and other stakeholders in establishing adequate systems for assessing SDG achievements, and ways of utilizing data for shaping policies and programmes at all levels of government. Strengthening the effectiveness of financing for sustainable development and Climate Change Achieving the SDGs in Asia-Pacific will cost $1 trillion a year.xxiv Resources will have to be mobilized from different sources, including national and sub-national governments, as well as the domestic and international private and public sector. Financial governance therefore, has to be strengthened to ensure that resources are raised, allocated and effectively utilized to achieve the SDGs. UNDP\u2019s development finance work can support countries in mapping available resources for development programmes, and improving systems for increasing internal revenue flows and resource allocation for the SDGs. Similarly in the area of climate change, UNDP\u2019s Governance of Climate Change Team can assist to strengthen governance systems to respond to climate change, and reform the budget process to be more effective and accountable for integrating a climate change response at national and local levels.

This report presents the first ever analysis on the steps that countries are taking to better link finance with their national development priorities and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through integrated national financing approaches. As Chair of the Asia-Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility (AP-DEF) and its Steering Committee, I am proud to launch this important work. The report has been developed under the auspices of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), as Secretariat to the AP-DEF. I greatly recognize the generous support of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Government of Switzerland in developing the report. The AP-DEF supports countries throughout the Asia and Pacific in addressing challenges related to financing of the SDGs and provides an invaluable platform for South-South exchange in this regard. Over 20 countries have benefited from its services. At the Third International Conference on Financing for Development in 2015, countries agreed the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA). The AAAA highlighted the need for integrated national financing frameworks in leveraging the full potential of all financial flows \u2013 private and public \u2013 for sustainable development. As many countries are moving forward to establish SDG-focused financing strategies, this report offers analysis and guidance on some of the key steps to take in establishing more integrated financing frameworks. Bangladesh has had the privilege of working with UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub and the AP-DEF for a number of years. In particular, we have benefited from the Development Finance Assessment (DFA) developed under the Facility. The DFA has helped us understand our own progress towards building a more integrated financing framework for delivering our national development agenda and the SDGs. We are now considering how to follow up on the DFA and develop a more comprehensive financing strategy. We encourage other countries in the region and globally to do likewise. This report\u2019s findings and recommendations are relevant to a number of policy processes. It is extremely timely, however, that we use its conclusions to feed into deliberations on the role of effective development cooperation in financing the SDGs, as part of the Second High-Level Meeting of the Global Partnership of Effective Development Cooperation held in Nairobi, Kenya at the end of 2016. I do hope you enjoy reading this report and that it supports you in your own efforts in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs.

Countries face a range of financing challenges, with some common and some differentiated issues across the region. Domestic public finance is a key driving force for sustainable development results across the Asia-Pacific region and revenues are growing fast in some countries, though they have slowed in others. In absolute terms, revenues remain low for much of the region, at less than $1,000 per person in half of all countries (compared to an average $16,500 per person in advanced economies). Governments are also working to make their revenue models more sustainable and progressive\u2019. And they are increasingly looking to systematically harness the potential of other financing. Rapid growth in private finance, an average 9% per year since 2005, is driving increases in the scale and diversity of financing for a number of countries, though trends have been uneven across countries and some aim to accelerate nascent growth in private finance. Many low income countries or LDCs face a transition away from concessional finance as they graduate from these groups. To address these challenges countries are developing more integrated, holistic financing frameworks for managing the mobilizing and harnessing of finance for sustainable development results. Governments across the region are strengthening the institutional structures, mechanisms and policies that they have in place to manage their strategy toward financing. This report examines policies and institutions that countries use to link different sources of finance and national development priorities. It seeks to understand the degree to which these policies and institutions add up to an \u2018integrated national financing Executive summary EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 7 framework\u2019 for achieving the SDGs. An integrated national financing framework can be understood as a system of policies and institutional structures that can help governments to develop and deliver a strategic, holistic approach toward managing financing for nationally-owned sustainable development strategies. This concept, which was called for in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda,2 is explored for the first time in detail in this report. The report provides practical solutions for governments and adds to existing reports and global financing processes by providing a holistic country perspective across all financing types and the frameworks that countries have in place to mobilize them. Key features of existing country financing frameworks To develop more comprehensive and coordinated policy, financing frameworks in many countries are rooted at the top of government. To achieve coherent policymaking across government requires leadership at this level to bring actors across government together, build consensus and give authority to the mechanisms designed to coordinate and align across interconnected policy areas. In Samoa, for example, leadership from the Ministry of the Prime Minister has been critical in establishing a whole-of-government approach to planning financing and monitoring implementation. In Indonesia a dedicated Cabinet-level ministry coordinates planning and policy for economic affairs. Many countries have established a long-term vision for the results they want to realize, which provides a foundation for policymaking and the development of financing strategies. Long- term visions, typically articulated through a national development plan, provide overarching direction on the development path that countries want to follow and specify key results they aim to achieve. They are the platform on which medium-term operational strategies and financing policies are built. In recent years a number of countries have developed new long-term visions. Papua New Guinea established Vision 2050 in 2009 which, with a 40-year outlook, is one of the most forward-looking plans in the region. Countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia and Mongolia, which recently launched its 2030 Sustainable Development Vision, have established plans with 10 to 20-year timeframes. Others such as Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) are in the process of establishing a long-term vision. Countries are developing more holistic financing strategies that define the contributions that all resources can make. The need to mobilize contributions from a wide range of financing types is well recognized and many countries have developed holistic financing policies that specify the roles they want non- state actors, particularly the private sector, to play. Bangladesh aims for private financing to fund 77% of its Seventh Five Year Plan (2015/16 to 2019/20). While countries have achieved successes with these policies, they are typically operational policies that cover three to five years at most. There is a gap between these and the longer-term vision documents. There is potential to build on these existing structures and develop strategic financing policies that establish long-term direction for the financing a government aims to mobilize, and determine what reforms are needed to get there. A number of countries have established a results-oriented, cost-based approach", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd89013e-8798-4904-85a3-57c2a4f62df2": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd89013e-8798-4904-85a3-57c2a4f62df2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5e7adec7f5d2aee1ab183286157882f6300f3b687c410d0348cad323ec01741d"}}, "hash": "5e7adec7f5d2aee1ab183286157882f6300f3b687c410d0348cad323ec01741d", "text": "for their 2. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda says \u2018Cohesive nationally owned sustainable development strategies, supported by integrated national financing frameworks, will be at the heart of our efforts.\u2019 Paragraph 9, AAAA, http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/AAAA_Outcome.pdf financing strategies. Starting from estimates of the cost of the investments needed to achieve results can help countries to develop an ambitious financing strategy that looks at the interventions necessary to scale up resource mobilisation accordingly. This is in contrast to approaches that build solely on historic trends and develop a strategy based on the likely trajectory of existing flows. Lao PDR has established a process to estimate the financing needs of its five-year National Socio-Economic Development Plan. Clarity on the contributions it targets from the private sector, for example, has helped the government to implement policy changes designed to unleash much greater investment. Private investment has consecutively exceeded the targets outlined in Lao PDR\u2019s five-year plans. Countries are undertaking reforms to enhance the alignment between financing policies and overarching plans. Each country\u2019s overall approach to financing is designed and operationalized through a range of policies, involving a large number of actors across government and an even larger group of stakeholders outside government. Ensuring that there is coherency\u2014common understanding of direction, goals, roles and responsibilities\u2014across the system is essential for overall efficiency and to ensure each actor is effectively fulfilling their role. For many countries the overarching national development plan, with accompanying financing plan, is the foundation on which the system is built. The strength of mechanisms which ensure that operational policies across the system are closely aligned to this foundation and complement rather than contradict one another, is a key determinant of overall efficiency. In the Philippines, government budgets have been scrutinized by Cabinet-level committees to ensure clear linkages between public spending and the objectives articulated in the medium- term vision document, the Philippine Development Plan 2011\u20132016. The strength of these mechanisms has been reinforced by involvement at the highest level: the President has acted as Chair of one of the scrutinizing committees, and of the National Economic and Development Authority, which manages the Philippine Development Plan.3 Countries across the region recognize the need for corresponding mechanisms to coordinate private sector policy but, with just a few exceptions, have found this more difficult to achieve in practice. Government influence over private finance is less direct and exerted through the incentives and business environment created by a large number of government agencies, often across levels of national and subnational administration. Where countries have been successful, such as Cambodia\u2019s promotion of rice exports, their efforts have often been characterized by narrowing the focus to specific interventions that have clear leadership from the highest levels of government, clear targets and well-defined implementation plans. A number of countries are taking steps to strengthen their focus on results in planning, implementation and monitoring. Systematically managing all aspects of policy design and delivery for results can increase efficiency, though it takes time and iterative steps to build the systems and results-oriented culture necessary to achieve this in practice. The Philippines introduced results matrices to monitor progress against the 2011\u20132016 Philippine Development Plan. These emphasize the outcomes and impacts targeted in the plan. They track progress in a hierarchical framework, linking the overall societal goal, \u2018Poverty reduction in multiple dimensions and massive creation of quality employment\u2019, with intermediate goals and outcomes in sectors and subsectors. The importance, and efficiency gains, of systematic approaches to accountability and dialogue are recognized by many countries. Dialogue is essential for building the trust and sense of shared ownership that is critical for successfully mobilizing the contributions of private actors and other partners. Engaging partners from the policy development phase through implementation and review can help governments design and deliver more realistic, responsive policies. Accountability mechanisms are important in their own right, providing a voice and channels for stakeholders to engage; and they can also support more efficient policymaking. In India social accountability mechanisms play an important role in strengthening the efficiency of Union (central government) and state budgets, and in reducing losses from budgetary expenditure. Monitoring by non- governmental organizations has helped policymakers understand the extent to which stated priorities are reflected in the implementation of polices, clarify optimal burden sharing between administrative levels and strengthen the case for investment in social sectors. Such mechanisms have also helped improve the implementation of key social policies, reducing losses and improving efficiency. 3.

Countries face a complex and rapidly changing financing landscape and are adapting the way they plan and deliver policy to leverage the opportunities, and address the challenges, this presents. Drawing on the evidence in this report about the core principles of countries\u2019 existing financing frameworks and the adaptations they are making, a number of principles or building blocks to an effective, integrated and holistic financing framework emerge: \u2022 Leadership that facilitates institutional coherence \u2022 A clear vision for results \u2022 An overarching strategic financing policy \u2022 Results-focused financing policies for specific flows \u2022 Integrated monitoring, evaluation and learning \u2022 An enabling environment for accountability and dialogue This report draws these principles together to build a conceptual model for an integrated national financing framework (see figure above). The concept of an integrated national financing framework, that incorporates these building blocks, can help guide countries as they consider and undertake reforms. It can help senior leaders in governments across the Asia-Pacific region, and beyond, think about their financing frameworks holistically. It can prompt reflection on the strengths and weaknesses of existing frameworks as a whole, in relation to the sustainable development strategies and financing needed to realize them. At the start of the SDG era, now is an important time for countries to examine their financing frameworks and to consider establishing integrated national financing frameworks. To realize ambitions for results across an integrated sustainable development agenda, countries will need to be able to design and deliver strategic, holistic financing policies that mobilize and maximize the impacts of a wide range of financing. The frameworks governments have in place to manage these financing policies will be critical for their success. The concept of an integrated national financing framework can help countries strengthen their existing frameworks and identify reforms that can be made in the short run and built on over time toward stronger systems in the long run. A number of countries, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Myanmar and Nepal, are already thinking about how to take steps toward establishing an integrated national financing framework.

Countries wishing to establish an integrated national financing framework can learn from one another and may wish to establish an index to develop a roadmap and track their progress. While the financing frameworks across the region vary widely, they have many common features and challenges, and as such knowledge sharing between countries can be invaluable in helping a government to determine the path of reform that it will follow. Regional platforms, such as the Asia Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility (AP- DEF) have an important role to play in facilitating exchange, supporting countries as they undertake reform and building up an understanding of good practice. Countries may wish to undertake a Development Finance Assessment. They may also wish to compile indicators that capture the status of each building block, in order to define milestones in their roadmap toward an integrated national financing framework, and to monitor progress over time. Such an index could be at least partially built on information from existing monitoring processes and surveys such as the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (GPEDC) monitoring framework,4 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability5 (PEFA) assessment and Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA),6 open budget survey7 and others. The role for development cooperation and implications for the Second High Level Meeting of the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation in Nairobi With greater emphasis on nationally led development strategies, countries and providers alike are reflecting on how development cooperation should evolve.

The evidence and analysis provided in the report concludes that three particular roles for development cooperation stand out. Firstly, development cooperation will be most effective if it plays to its strengths relative to other types of financing within each country context. Development cooperation is a small resource, but it has unique characteristics that mean it can be used for investments which other resources cannot. Secondly, development cooperation can play an important role in leveraging other flows to contribute toward results \u2013 leveraging both increased volumes of financing, and leveraging development-additionality from this financing. Thirdly, there is increased priority on the role and responsibility of the international community to support institutional development so that countries are better able to drive their own development strategies. This encompasses both the provision of direct support for countries as they reform and develop institutions, and development cooperation providers themselves operating in a way that strengthens and does not undermine institutional development. 4. http://effectivecooperation.org/monitoring-country-progress/explore-monitoring-data/ 5. https://pefa.org/content/pefa-framework 6. http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/CPIA 7. http://www.internationalbudget.org/opening-budgets/open-budget-initiative/open-budget-survey/ 10 ACHIEVING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE ERA OF THE ADDIS ABABA ACTION AGENDA Introduction 8. UNCTAD, 2014. World Investment Report 2014. http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/wir2014_en.pdf Countries in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond have set themselves ambitious targets for the results they want to achieve in the next 15 years. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development envisions a world without extreme poverty, where inequality is falling and climate change is being addressed. Realizing these ambitious goals will require a significant increase in investments. The cost of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is estimated at US$5 trillion to $7 trillion per year worldwide,8 levels beyond the resources currently available in the region. Meeting these investment needs will require raising and mobilizing significant additional resources from multiple sources. It will require using and channelling resources efficiently. All actors, public and private, domestic and international, have contributions to make, though each type of financing has different characteristics and varying potential to contribute to different aspects of the sustainable development agenda. Using resources effectively will mean working to their comparative advantages in meeting different types of financing needs. Countries across the Asia-Pacific region face a diversity of financing contexts and challenges. For some, public finance is growing rapidly; for others it has plateaued and, while still a key driver of progress toward sustainable development, remains low in absolute terms. Governments are also working to make their revenue models more sustainable and progressive. Private finance is growing and diversifying in many parts of the region, bringing opportunities to build partnerships and encourage sustainable development impact; yet this also brings complexity and coordination challenges across government and with partners. For other countries the challenge is to attract new flows of private finance, or to diversify beyond a reliance on narrow sectors. For low income countries (LICs) transitioning to Middle Income Country (MIC) status, the transition away from concessional finance and changing nature of development partnerships will require considered strategies. Finally the contribution of international public finance will remain critical for many years to come in Small Island Development States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries. Ensuring continued concessionality in these contexts will be essential. Meeting these financing challenges will require a strategic, holistic approach to managing, mobilizing and channelling financing. Governments across the region have recognized this and are reforming and strengthening the financing frameworks that govern their approach to financing\u2014 building coherency, developing more comprehensive planning structures and increasing the emphasis on managing for results. This report looks across countries\u2019 financing frameworks and builds on the strengths of different approaches to develop a model of an \u2018integrated national financing framework\u2019. This is a system of policies and institutional structures that can help governments to develop and deliver a strategic, holistic approach toward managing financing to achieve the results envisaged in nationally-owned sustainable development strategies.

It sits alongside the 2016 Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (GPEDC) monitoring report and builds on many of the concepts of development effectiveness captured in the GPEDC monitoring survey. It builds on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and can feed into the financing for development follow-up process and annual report of the Inter- Agency Task Force on Financing for Development. It can support countries in dialogue and reporting about means of implementation in the SDGs at the high level political forum on sustainable development. The report also draws from and builds on efforts to develop results-based management and related concepts. At the national level it draws heavily from the UNDP supported Development Finance Assessments (DFAs) that countries across the region have undertaken, and complements processes such as the Pacific Islands Forum Compact Peer Review. While it is complementary to these processes, its added value is its holistic look at financing frameworks. It draws from many of the areas that look at individual aspects of financing strategies, and analyses the financing frameworks that governments have in place as a whole. The report also sits alongside regional publications such as UNESCAP\u2019s Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific,9 the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Asian Development Outlook10 and UNDP\u2019s Regional Human Development Reports.11 It adds to these publications by focusing specifically on financing, taking a holistic perspective across all types of financing and linking financing to results. The report begins in chapter 1 by providing an overview of the regional context, looking at the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals, and the challenges ahead. It provides an overview of the financing landscape, looking at how the financing available in countries across the region is evolving, the differences between countries and the challenges countries will face in mobilising the finance needed to achieve results. Chapter 2 provides an introduction to the integrated national financing framework that is developed in this report. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 look at domestic public finance, domestic and international private finance, and international public finance respectively. These chapters examine the institutional structures and policies that countries have in place to make, mobilize and harness finance in each of these areas. Chapter 6 weaves together the key features of country financing frameworks in these areas to present and explore in detail the building blocks of an integrated national financing framework. Finally, chapter 7 presents recommendations at the country, regional and global level about how integrated national financing frameworks can be taken forward to support nationally-owned sustainable development strategies. 9.

This allows for aggregation at the regional and sub-regional level as well as for comparisons across countries. Financing data are organized into four categories: domestic public, domestic private, international public and international private. Domestic public finance includes government revenue data, excluding grants (unless specified otherwise).

Discussions at the High Level Meeting will focus on the development effectiveness and financing for development agendas, and look to identify innovative approaches to sustainable development that can be scaled up. In these discussions and as countries move to the implementation phase of the sustainable development goal era the concepts presented in this report can help governments to refine and develop their financing frameworks to strengthen the linkages between financing and sustainable development results in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. INTRODUCTION 13 14 ACHIEVING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE ERA OF THE ADDIS ABABA ACTION AGENDA Chapter 1: Regional context The Asia-Pacific region20 is the world\u2019s most populous, encompassing great diversity across countries, environments, economies and societies. Countries across the region have ambitious plans to achieve progress across a wide ranging, interconnected sustainable development agenda. This chapter looks at the regional context, the successes and unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), trends in inequality and demographics, and the integrated nature of the challenges ahead. The chapter takes an in-depth look at all types of financing in the region, unpacking the diverse contexts and trends that countries face and the range of financing opportunities and challenges that this presents. It highlights the ambitious, integrated and interconnected contexts that countries in the region are working within.

The Asia-Pacific region was a key driver of the global success in meeting MDG1a, the target to halve extreme poverty. The proportion of people living on less than PPP$1.25 a day across the region as a whole fell from 54.6% in 1990 to 15.3% in 2011 (and to an estimated 12% in 2015,21 Figure 1.1). Individually, the majority of Asia-Pacific countries also met the target to halve extreme poverty. Progress in halving the prevalence of children underweight was more mixed, with the target achieved in East and North East Asia, but only 7 of 21 other countries realising the goal.

Gender parity targets in primary and secondary education were widely achieved, though progress in gender parity in tertiary education was uneven across countries. Infant and maternal mortality targets were not met by most countries. 10 of 35 countries and 7 of 29 of Asia-Pacific countries met infant and maternal mortality targets respectively. No LICs or Pacific Island countries met the maternal mortality target. Some countries met targets related to skilled birth attendance and antenatal care, though success rates among fragile states were poor. Progress in reducing HIV prevalence and tuberculosis (TB) was more widespread among countries in the region. Progress in meeting environmental targets was varied. All except one country in the region achieved the target for protected areas, while progress toward emissions targets was mixed. Progress in access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation showed a clear divide across countries at different levels of economic development: three-quarters of upper middle income countries achieved the basic sanitation target, compared to less than a third of lower middle income country and less than a fifth of LDCs. Country-by-country progress across the whole agenda was mixed (Figure 1.2). The region\u2019s best performer, the Maldives, achieved (or was on track to achieve, according to the latest estimates) 19 of the 20 targets for which data exist. At the other end of the spectrum, Papua New Guinea achieved four targets, and regressed in five others.

CHAPTER 1: REGIONAL CONTEXT 15 16 ACHIEVING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE ERA OF THE ADDIS ABABA ACTION AGENDA Significant progress is needed in promoting gender equality. Women\u2019s economic empowerment is a prerequisite for sustainable development and pro-poor growth.23 The Asia- Pacific region loses an estimated $89 billion in income every year because women are underrepresented in the workforce. If women\u2019s representation increased to 70%, as in the advanced economies, annual GDP could be an estimated 4.2% higher in India, 2.9% higher in Malaysia, and 1.4% higher in Indonesia.24 Women who gain equal access to education and economic decision-making are a key driving force against poverty through raising household incomes.25 The evidence shows that when women have greater control over resources, investment in children\u2019s health, education and nutrition increases, which yields long- term benefits for future generations.26 In South Asia, 60% of employed women work in family enterprises but do not get paid (Figure 1.3). There remains significant unfinished business from the MDGs. Over a half a billion people still live in extreme poverty in the Asia- Pacific region. In 2012 an estimated 21 million children were not enrolled in primary school, 75 million children under five were underweight and over 1.6 billion people still lacked access to safe sanitation. With mixed overall progress toward achieving the MDGs, many countries will carry targets forward, even while ambitions are being raised in the SDGs. The SDGs present an agenda that is more ambitious, wider-ranging and highly interconnected. The bar has been raised across goal areas such as reducing poverty, moving from the MDG to halve the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, to a goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030. Goals in areas that were not covered by the MDGs are included in the SDGs, and there is wide recognition of the interlinkages that can reinforce or present trade-offs between goals in related areas. Inequality across the region is falling, albeit slowly. The Gini coefficient27 for the region as a whole fell from an estimated 39.1 to 38.1 between 2000 and 2014. Trends are more pronounced when China and India, where inequality has changed little over the period, are excluded. Some of the largest reductions in inequality were among countries where inequality was highest at the turn of the Millennium: Micronesia, Nepal and Papua New Guinea. Other countries, such as Fiji, Lao PDR and Viet Nam, experienced rising inequality over the period. The Asia-Pacific region is the world\u2019s most populous and is undergoing a demographic transition. Five of the ten countries in the world with the largest populations are in the region. Most countries in the region are undergoing or on the verge of beginning a demographic transition, where the ratio of working age to younger and older people grows.

This is increasingly recognized at the international and national level and has profound implications for countries and the way they approach policy and financing, highlighting the need to mobilize not just greater volumes of resources, but also appropriate types of financing to address different types of challenges. Opportunities and challenges in a changing finance landscape Countries across Asia and the Pacific face an evolving financing context. Growth and increasing complexity in the financial resources available are opening up opportunities and challenges for countries as they work toward realizing their goals. All types of financing can play a role in meeting the challenges countries face, though the different characteristics and strengths of each finance type means these roles will be differentiated by context. The challenges countries face in mobilizing the resources they have or could have available, and channelling these to impactful investments, vary widely across the region. Rapid growth in domestic finance is driving an evolving resource landscape Financing across the region as a whole is growing rapidly (Figure 1.4). Total financing29 grew from US$4.0 trillion in 2005 to $8.9 trillion in 2014.30 Domestic resources in particular have increased rapidly: domestic public and private finance FIGURE 1.4 In aggregate, domestic resources, private and public, are by far the largest source of financing to the Asia-Pacific region, accounting for 89% of all resources in 2014 Sources: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC), World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI), World Bank International Debt Statistics (IDS), World Bank Migration and Remittances data, UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), International Monetary Fund (IMF) Article IV publications.

The main driver behind this has been growth in government revenue,31 which almost tripled between 2005 and 2014 and has also been increasing as a proportion of total financing, rising from 36% in 2005 to 44% in 2014. Growth in domestic public finance in China dominates regional figures. Chinese government revenue increased from $571 billion in 2005 to $3.0 trillion in 2014. China alone accounts for 96% of the overall increase in domestic public resources in the region. Excluding China, domestic private finance has driven overall trends. Excluding China, domestic private finance has grown at an average 7% per year. The largest increases have been in India, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, yet this growth has been widely experienced. More than half of countries for which data exist32 experienced growth averaging more than 5% per year. Conversely, outside China domestic public finance remained relatively constant in volume, plateauing between 2007 and 2012 at around $1 trillion. It has decreased as a proportion of total financing, from 49% in 2005 to 37% in 2014. The balance between domestic and international finance, and between private and public financing, is evolving differently in different contexts. In East Asia international flows and, to a lesser extent domestic private resources, have been decreasing as a proportion of total financing due to the vast increase in domestic public resources\u2014driven by China. On the other hand, in South East Asia, domestic public resources have remained relatively constant in proportional terms since 2006, while domestic private resources have increased from 32% of total financing in 2006 to 38% in 2014. In the Pacific, international finance plays a critical role, on average accounting for over 50% of all financing to Pacific countries since 2005. Domestic public and private resources dominate the mix of resources overall These trends mean that, in aggregate, financing across the region is dominated by domestic resources 31. Unless specified otherwise, all government revenue figures used in this report exclude grants. See methodology for details. 32. 12 of 21 countries for which data exist, from a total 35 countries in the region (excluding China). 33. The domestic private resources figures are estimates in lieu of comprehensive data on domestic private investment. Calculations are based on gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) data from the World Bank, which are used to estimate total investment in each country. FDI and public capital expenditure data are then deducted to estimate for domestic private investment alone. GFCF data exclude certain types of investments such as land sales and purchases and all kinds of financial assets, and do not make any deductions for depreciation of fixed assets. These estimates should therefore not be treated as precise facts about the domestic private investment taking place in each country, but rather estimates of the general trends and scale of this financing.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c06527a-d61e-481f-801b-ab5a38721132": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c06527a-d61e-481f-801b-ab5a38721132", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "179e660e19f0cc0f8cf7dd1688acd5228e0c565b870bbc7b812c9d2f22976904"}, "2": {"node_id": "09f750f8-f41b-423d-a5b5-d7fad1126bf1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eff5ea768b84d193d6451cca2a68f8c8d0e09cacb017adc81a3b80a031f9f2e3"}}, "hash": "11fa6f40b06adf8454d48743123cb3b055f9b7bb009b3e948e61dc0ace1dfd9e", "text": "-1.0 -0.5 0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 Public Private Public Private US$ trillions, 2014 Domestic International In\ufb02ows Out\ufb02ows FIGURE 1.5 In aggregate, domestic resources, private and public, are by far the largest source of financing to the Asia-Pacific region, accounting for 89% of all resources in 2014 Sources: OECD DAC, World Bank WDI, World Bank IDS, World Bank Migration and Remittances data, UNCTAD, IMF Article IV publications.

See Methodology for details. Note that, although the total of all financing is greater than the estimates of the cost of achieving the SDGs (see introduction), it is not the case that all of this financing is used on investments that will contribute to their realization. Data points: in 2014 domestic public totalled $3.91 trillion, domestic private $3.97 trillion, international public finance $151 billion, international public outflows $74 billion, international private inflows $842 billion and international private outflows $427 billion. (Figure 1.5). Domestic public finance accounts for 44% of the total and domestic private finance an estimated 45%.33 However, international flows still represent an important source of finance\u2014and among international financing private flows have grown to account for 85% of all international financing in 2014. The overall mix of financing within the region varies widely (Figure 1.6). Subregional country groupings highlight the multitude of different financing landscapes faced by policymakers in the region. Both between groupings (as shown in Figure 1.6) and within groupings the mix of available resources is quite different. China\u2019s financing landscape is dominated by domestic resources which account for 94% of all resources; while for Mongolia (also an East Asian developing country) private long-term lending alone accounts for a fifth of available financing, 2% more than domestic private resources. In the Philippines, remittances, a flow within the international private finance category (see Table 1.1), are by far the largest form of international finance, alone accounting for 18% of all resources. In Lao PDR remittances are only 0.82% of available financing, with the majority being domestic resources\u2014 public and private in roughly equal proportions, followed by international debt financing (12%), foreign direct investment (FDI; 10%) and public long- term debt (9%). International public finance, particularly official development assistance (ODA), continues to be significant in small island developing states (SIDS). In Kiribati and the Solomon Islands, ODA alone accounts for over 30% of total financing, in Tuvalu it accounts for over 50%. Among LICs in the region, domestic resources account for less than half of all financing (47%). ODA and remittances account for over a quarter each.

As countries develop economically, they attract an increasing volume and variety of private sector investments. Over the past decade, the number of MICs in the region has risen from 16 to 29.34 In Thailand (an upper middle income country) domestic and international private finance combined accounts for over half of all available resources. International long-term lending to the private sector accounts for 10% of financing in Thailand.35 In Bangladesh (a lower middle income country), domestic private investment alone accounts for almost half of all resources (48%) and remittances play a substantial role, accounting for a fifth of all financing. In recent years Bangladesh has attracted a wider range of international private finance with both lending to the private sector as well as FDI and equity investments growing. In Cambodia, FDI is equivalent to 26% of total financing, twice the volume of ODA. An evolving mix of international finance The mix of international flows varies significantly (Figure 1.7). For 16 countries in the region ODA accounts for more than 10% of available financing; for 6 countries it represents less than 1% of all resources. At its highest levels, it accounts for 53% of financing in Afghanistan, 52% in Tuvalu and 45% in Micronesia. Public long-term debt, which includes lending to the public sector or lending to private sector actors that is guaranteed by the state, has grown the most in volume of international 34. No historical income classification data (2000\u20132014) is available for Cook Islands, Nauru, Niue, Tokelau; historical income classification data are not available pre- 2009 for Tuvalu. 35. This is private non-guaranteed debt; a portion of public and publicly guaranteed debt is also taken on by the private sector but the data record this separately, in a way that is indistinguishable from public debt. See Methodology. public inflows to the region as a whole. Countries driving this trend are India, Indonesia and China, and to a lesser degree Pakistan. In India, lending to or guaranteed by the state increased from 1% to 4% of all available resources available between 2013 and 2014 FIGURE 1.7 Some Asia-Pacific countries are increasingly accessing non- concessional debt; others still rely heavily on ODA and remittances (equivalent to a rise from 0.4% of GDP to 2.0%). In Bhutan public long-term debt has been rising as a proportion of total financing, from 1.8% in 2008 to 19.6% in 2014, reaching 18.3% of GDP in 2014.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06a74066-0c6d-4140-b3a1-3c3db33bcb79": {"__data__": {"id_": "06a74066-0c6d-4140-b3a1-3c3db33bcb79", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e157950c2ebe5528da682fbea1341a7ba1be26fea8dcf306dce1ee3b687337ec"}, "2": {"node_id": "60baec55-0402-4f47-a69e-dd624a82e654", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0fe2dffd892785134f6c888d0c505c919c9887d4e187c26d27bfa8abe374a4e9"}}, "hash": "b85b21a8cee442fad23e7c65a336336de1aabc39d8d8addaa6a4be42f6c61d75", "text": "The increasingly significant role of public long-term debt calls for 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 ASEAN\u2019s resource mix 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 ASEAN\u2019s resource mix Remittances Portfolio equity, net Short-term debt, net Private long-term debt FDI Public long-term debt OOF ODA Sources: OECD DAC, World Bank WDI, World Bank IDS, World Bank Migration and Remittances data, UNCTAD.

In Papua New Guinea, private long-term debt, the largest source of international finance since 2007, has been fluctuating significantly: increasing over twelvefold between 2009 and 2011, then dropping by 71% in 2012, tripling in 2013 and decreasing by 90% in 2014. Development finance institutions play an important role in financing across the region which is partly captured by available data. This includes World Bank agencies (International Development Association, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International Finance Corporation) and the Asian Development Bank\u2014the latter providing 6% of ODA and 30% of OOF received by Asia-Pacific countries in 2014, or $2.3 billion and $6.5 billion respectively. Multilateral organizations provided a higher proportion of overall OOF (29% of the total to the region) than ODA (21%), with bilateral providers36 accounting for the rest. While development finance institutions\u2019 total operations including financing beyond what they report as ODA and OOF, these data do provide insight into their relevant role in development financing to the region, especially in terms of concessional financing. Wider international finance Beyond the flows outlined above there are a range of international finance flows for which comprehensive data do not exist, including from new development banks, South-South cooperation (SSC) and impact investing. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) was established in 2014, beginning operations in 2016 with targeted lending for the year between $0.5 billion and $1.2 billion (by comparison, loans and grants from the Asian Development Bank totalled $16.3 billion in 201538). Its role is expected to become increasingly significant especially in the infrastructure and productive sectors in the region, thus increasing the pool of emerging finance available for investments in these areas. The substantial role the AIIB is likely to play in the Asia-Pacific region and in global development cooperation more broadly is further underlined by its expected role in the One Belt, One Road initiative (see box). An increasing number of countries are providing SSC, a type of international public finance, including China, India, Indonesia, Thailand and most recently Timor-Leste. While it is difficult to provide accurate estimates of this financing, available data do allow exploration of some of the differences in trends and targeting of resources from these actors. According to national sources, China\u2019s development cooperation has been increasing steadily over time, quadrupling between 2001 and 2013. India\u2019s SSC also grew, albeit more slowly, increasing by 45% between 2008 and 2013 (the period for which data are available). Neighbouring countries seem to be the main recipients for a number of countries\u2019 SSC allocation. The vast majority of Thailand\u2019s ODA reported to the OECD DAC in 2014 was disbursed to Lao PDR and Myanmar ($55.5 million and $12.1 million respectively out of $77.9 million). Conversely, for others, countries outside of the Asia-Pacific region dominate disbursements: for example, 97% of Timor-Leste\u2019s ODA reported to the OECD DAC for 2014 went to countries in sub-Saharan Africa. As countries expand their role as SSC providers, integrated approaches and systems to strategically direct these resources toward maximizing sustainable development outcomes in recipient countries will become increasingly important.39 36.

Impact investing is defined by the Global Impact Investing Network as investments made into companies, organizations, and funds with the intention to generate social and environmental impact alongside a financial return. Impact investing has four core characteristics: intentionality, investment with return expectations, a range of return expectations and asset classes, and impact measurability. https://thegiin.org/impact-investing/need-to-know/ 41. Note that these investments are not included in the figures because it is not possible to identify them within the data for the financing flows presented here. 42. These estimates are based on the 2016 Annual Impact Investor Survey by the Global Impact Investing Network. The data are based on a survey of 158 impact investment organizations.

Worldwide, the primary sectors for impact investments are housing, microfinance, energy and financial services, which together account for more than half of the total. Climate finance Climate finance is growing within the Asia-Pacific region. Many governments are increasing their spending on climate finance, while also taking steps to establish systems that better manage investments in this cross-cutting area (see chapter 3). The majority of climate finance comes from domestic resources \u2013 in Bangladesh an estimated 80% of climate related programmes are funded domestically.43 Climate public expenditure and institutional reviews (CPEIR), which provide estimates of climate expenditure by governments, have been undertaken by a number of countries. Across seven countries in the region that have undertaken these reviews, climate expenditure ranges from 0.15% and 0.53% of GDP in Indonesia and Thailand to 2.73% and 2.74% of GDP in Samoa and Vanuatu.44 Many of these governments are placing increasing priority on climate expenditure. In Samoa, climate expenditure rose from an estimated 9.8% of total government spending in 2007 to 14.0% in 2012. In Nepal, it rose from 5.7% in 2008 to 7.2% in 2012, and in Cambodia from 5.35% in 2009 to 6.32% in 2012.45 International climate finance is also growing (Figure 1.8).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "331548b9-7029-492c-8744-f97648c49d4d": {"__data__": {"id_": "331548b9-7029-492c-8744-f97648c49d4d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "acfae1dabc1f1b3ebc83070052f277b4a52f07215a99b8f5b44d07ea2c9298c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "7e4bacd5-c3e3-49f0-9840-5c3b5667e259", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "191f8864ffe6dde7880143e9e3b8f625bbee00c7e5e1a6b5d311c3ba94eaed16"}}, "hash": "012cd241f441dc85481b98c9a84f25cfde98a2c9a4e945a7ac23a43bd2af249e", "text": "Climate-related ODA, which includes spending by bilateral development cooperation providers, multilateral development finance institutions and some climate specific funds, has risen from $1.1 billion in 2005 to $4.7 billion in 2014 (though part of this rise may be attributed to better reporting by development cooperation providers to the OECD DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS)).

Philanthropy and international NGOs Resources from the not-for-profit sector, including international transfers through international NGOs and foundations as well as domestic philanthropy and other resources mobilized by local NGOs,46 represent a crucial and complementary source of funding for the SDGs. Not only are these flows considerably larger than is customarily recognized and growing rapidly (especially domestic philanthropy in lower middle income countries and MICs), but they are likely to be more specifically targeted at reducing poverty and providing services in the poorer areas. Particularly in Asia, these resources are rising fast, in part due to the rapidly increasing number of \u2018high net worth individuals\u2019 in the region and the increasing pattern of philanthropy. However, these resources tend to be underestimated due to the lack of global, comprehensive and consistent reporting standards for this type of financing. Strengthening the policy environment for philanthropy, including tax incentives for corporate giving, and involving philanthropists in discussions about national development is likely to lead to more effective collaboration between the not-for-profit sector and government, and to greater private giving for the SDGs. Based on a combination of available estimates, international private giving to developing countries is conservatively estimated at $45 billion per year in 2013.47 In comparison, domestic philanthropy, especially in Asia, is likely to be much higher and is rising. In just three Asia-Pacific countries (China, India and Indonesia) domestic giving amounted to $43 billion in 201548 and Asian philanthropy is estimated to be growing at approximately 10% per year.49 Giving from philanthropists has also shown a trend in recent years, from targeting localized projects in their home towns (such as donations to elite education and health facilities) to national development projects (this is the case in China for example). This highlights the growing potential for this type of financing to contribute toward national level, SDG-related investments. Moreover, in 2014 the SDG Philanthropy Platform was established by leading foundations and other organizations including the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to support philanthropy to engage in the global development agenda through multi-stakeholder partnerships aimed at achieving the SDGs. Similarly, the Global Network of Foundations Working for Development (established by the OECD Development Centre) supports foundations and associated organizations to form dialogue and partnership with governments for development. It also provides a reservoir of information on the sector.

An estimated $10 billion to $12 billion50 of ODA is channelled to developing country NGOs (directly or via international NGOs). In the Asia- Pacific region, although the overall volume of ODA channelled through NGOs has been increasing since 2005, it still represents a very tiny proportion of total ODA to the region. In 2014, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan accounted for 47% of all NGO- channelled ODA to the region\u2014with education, health and emergency response the main target sectors.51 Wide variation in the scale and trajectories of financing The scale of financing is unequal across countries in the region. While the mix of financing available varies widely between countries, so too does the level of financing available (Figure 1.9). Government revenues are less than $1,000 per person in more than half of all countries in the region,52 while they are $2,167 in China. Domestic private finance ranges from $30 per person in Cambodia to over $2,100 in China. International public finance levels vary between $2.90 per person in Iran (Islamic Republic of, hereafter \u2018Iran\u2019) and $3,545 per person in Tuvalu. International private flows are below $200 per person in 13 countries and above $1,000 in only four (Mongolia, Maldives, Marshall Islands and Tonga). These data highlight how the financing landscape across the Asia-Pacific region is evolving. In aggregate, financing is growing and diversifying rapidly. This opens up opportunities to meet the scale of the sustainable development 50. Estimate given in Irish L, et al, 2009. Outsourcing Social Services to CSOs: Lessons from Abroad.

A more integrated approach to managing financing to results Within these diverse contexts, the tasks countries face to mobilize the financing they require are significant. Countries must maximize the impact of the financing available, mitigating risks and establishing mechanisms to channel and incentivize financing into priority areas according to the strengths of each type of finance. And they must look to mobilize and stimulate further growth in financing from an increasingly complex financing landscape. To achieve this requires an integrated and holistic approach to managing financing: one that can engage with more diverse types of financing and establish policies to mobilize and channel them across investments in an integrated sustainable development agenda. Chapter 2: Introducing the integrated national financing framework With high ambitions for results and significant financing challenges, countries across Asia and the Pacific are developing more strategic, holistic and results-driven approaches to managing financing. This report looks across the financing frameworks that countries have in place and are developing, to draw out their key features and develop a conceptual model for an \u2018integrated national financing framework\u2019. This concept, which was called for in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda,53 is explored for the first time in detail here. The subsequent chapters look at the frameworks and structures countries have in place to manage strategies with regard to each type of financing; domestic public finance (chapter 3), domestic and international private finance (chapter 4) and international public finance (chapter 5). The key features of these frameworks are drawn together to develop the model for an integrated financing framework as a whole in chapter 6. 53. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda says \u2018Cohesive nationally owned sustainable development strategies, supported by integrated national financing frameworks, will be at the heart of our efforts.\u2019 Paragraph 9, Addis Ababa Action Agenda, http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/AAAA_Outcome.pdf FIGURE 2.1 An integrated national financing framework for delivering national development priorities and the SDGs Government in\ufb02uence over investments More direct Less direct Domestic public \ufb01nance International public \ufb01nance Domestic private \ufb01nance International private \ufb01nance 1 Does the \ufb01 policy ope within alig and coher mechanism a mandate senior lead 2 How does support re the vision for results 2 Vision for results 3 Strategic \ufb01nancing policy Long-term vision Medium-term development plan Annual results plans Costed targets Link to SDGs 1 Leadership and institutional coherence 5 Monitoring and evaluation Government action Investment outputs Investment outcomes Results Private sector International community Civil society 6 Accountability and dialogue 4 Financing policies for speci\ufb01c \ufb02ows 3 How does mobilize a catalyze re to contrib the strateg \ufb01nancing Consid CHAPTER 2: INTRODUCING THE INTEGRATED NATIONAL FINANCING FRAMEWORK 25 26 ACHIEVING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE ERA OF THE ADDIS ABABA ACTION AGENDA What is an integrated national financing framework? An integrated national financing framework is the system of policies and institutional structures that a government has in place for managing its approach toward financing. This conceptual model is built on the strengths of existing financing frameworks across the Asia-Pacific region and lessons learned from earlier approaches to poverty-reduction partnerships such as the poverty reduction strategy papers. Drawing on the strengths of current practice, six building blocks emerge that underpin the integrated national financing framework (Figure 2.1): 1. Leadership that facilitates institutional coherence is essential for bringing together actors across and outside government to build an integrated approach, ensuring alignment in policies and providing overall results-oriented direction for financing policies. 2. A clear vision for results that the country wants to achieve is the foundation of an integrated national financing framework on which financing plans and targets are built. It sets out the sustainable development outcomes and impact that the country wants to realize and is typically articulated in a national development plan. 3. A strategic financing policy takes the long-term vision for results and develops estimates for the costs and types of investments needed. It provides a broad framework within which operational financing policies that mobilize the outputs which lead to sustainable development impacts can be developed. For many countries in the region this would be a new policy process, or a significant extension of an existing medium- term financing framework. 4.

An enabling environment for accountability and dialogue is essential to build the trust necessary to mobilize contributions from stakeholders outside government; make sure policies are being designed and delivered effectively; and ensure a voice for citizens, civil society, business, development partners and other actors in development. Together these building blocks form a conceptual model for an integrated national financing framework. This conceptual model can prompt governments to assess their financing frameworks as a whole and guide thinking about reforms that are needed to strengthen them. Chapter 3: Domestic public finance Domestic public finance is a critical resource for financing sustainable development. It accounts for 44% of total financing across the Asia-Pacific region. As the type of financing over which governments have most control, and one that can be linked more directly to results than many other types of financing, it is a core driver of nationally-owned development strategies. For many countries, the institutional structures that govern domestic public finance will be used as a basis for establishing an integrated national financing framework. This chapter examines the differing scales and types of domestic public resource mobilization in the region and the impact they can have on sustainable development results. It then outlines some of the key reforms that governments are undertaking to better align fiscal policy to national development plans, strengthen vertical coherence, enhance systems for monitoring and evaluation, and strengthen approaches toward accountability and dialogue. Effective government financing for results Domestic public finance plays a critical role in financing across the Asia-Pacific region. It is the financing instrument that the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) outcome documents calls \u2018central to our common pursuit of sustainable development, including achieving the SDGs\u2019.54 This is because despite differing scales of public resources in countries in overall resource terms, fiscal policies can have a profound impact on development in a range of ways, by: \u2022 Showing commitment and instilling confidence: for governments to attain ambitious development strategies they must be able to drive progress through their own investments, show commitment to their national development strategies and instil confidence in other actors domestically and internationally, ensuring coherence and alignment with all resources. 54.

Therefore the challenge for countries in the Asia-Pacific region is shaping fiscal policies in an optimal way, to maximize their potential to drive progress toward the developmental goals set. Although each country context and needs are different, policy-makers are grappling with similar questions: \u2022 What are the appropriate levels of domestic public resources needed to meet developmental targets, the feasibility of achieving these levels and the strategies for reaching them in an efficient and sustainable manner? \u2022 How can resources be allocated in the most efficient way, according to their comparative advantage, ensuring they are focused on delivering results? Although the answers are complex and vary according to the country context, there has been a clear shift within governments in the region to better aligning fiscal policy, implementation and monitoring and evaluations processes in a results-focused national development planning framework. This is helping governments make more informed decisions to optimize fiscal policies in the wider financing landscape. The scale and potential of domestic public resources to finance development goals Domestic public resource mobilization is essential for enabling governments to directly target financing to areas where it\u2019s needed to optimally achieve national development goals. While how domestic revenue mobilization is raised is important in shaping development progress (see later in this chapter), recent policy debates have focused on its current low levels, both in scale and in relation to the size of a countries economy, and the potential to scale these finances up to help finance development goals. For example, at the global level, the AAAA outcome document \u2018recognizes that significant additional domestic public resources, supplemented by international assistance as appropriate, will be critical to realizing sustainable development\u2019.56 While domestic public resources in the Asia-Pacific region have grown significantly over the past 10 years (see chapter 1), the perceived potential for further increases is highlighted in Figure 3.1 (see table), which shows that compared with advanced economies, revenue generation per person across the Asia-Pacific region is 16 times lower and almost 12% less as a proportion of the economy. This difference in revenue mobilization has been cited in recent studies as a central reason why domestic public resources could increase in the region.57 However, behind the regional averages, there are distinct differences between countries, again both in terms of the amounts raised and as a proportion of the economies (see Figure 3.1). For example, 19 of the 31 countries with sufficient data available had non-grant revenues per capita of below $1,000, with the majority of South, South-West and South-East Asia countries raising less than $600 per capita. In addition, almost half of countries raise revenue less than 20% of GDP, a level that has been used as a benchmark minimum target.58 One of these is Bangladesh, which has recognized the low level of taxation and has targeted raising it from its current level of 9% to 14% in 2020, which would see almost a tripling of tax revenue in nominal terms, from $18 billion to $52 billion.59 FIGURE 3.1 Revenue generation levels and their proportions in relation to the size of the economy vary significantly across Asia-Pacific countries Source: IMF World Economic Outlook database (April 2016), latest available article IV staff reports for each country Notes: Data are from the respective countries\u2019 financial years 2014.

This point is highlighted in Figure 3.2, which shows that while East Timor relies heavily on petroleum revenue, SIDS such as Tuvalu rely on non-tax revenue (particularly fishing licenses), Sri Lanka relies largely on indirect taxation, and Indonesia has a more varied revenue mix. These differences highlight the challenges that exist within groups of countries in the region. For example: \u2022 For SIDS dependent on resource extraction, if revenues are due to decline, what strategies can be developed for the medium to long term, to use resources sustainability to diversify or grow economies? \u2022 How can countries with low revenue mobilization that depend on indirect taxation such as Sri Lanka and Bangladesh increase direct taxation when the structure of the economy is largely informal,61 and encourage private investment? How are indirect taxes impacting the poorest people now and how would any changes in the future? \u2022 What opportunities are there for those with broader based revenue regime, such as Indonesia, to increase overall collection, ensuring fiscal policies continue to encourage growth, investment and promote moving to a sustainable green economy? These examples show that there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 model for increasing domestic public resources to finance development. Each country has its FIGURE 3.2 Countries\u2019 composition of non-grant revenue can vary significantly in the region Source: Latest available article IV staff reports for each country Notes: Data are for the respective countries\u2019 financial years 2015.

Government fiscal policies of revenue generation and allocation cannot be viewed as purely financials input into development. They are very much integrated in development outcomes\u2014economic, social and environmental\u2014which the following section explores in detail. Fiscal policies linked to development results Economic impacts Fiscal policy plays a significant role in shaping economic growth in a country. From a revenue generation perspective, policies can indirectly constrain the levels of private consumption and investment. Impacts can be negated through the use of public spending: using transfers such as subsides to individuals or companies, although their effectiveness in providing optimal overall financing levels in the region has been questioned.62 Government spending on goods and services also plays a crucial direct role in economic growth, estimated to account for between 15% and 20% of GDP globally. A key challenge for all countries is ensuring economic growth is maximized through the use of fiscal policies. A balancing act is crucial, between contractionary and expansionary approaches, to maintain an optimum mix of private consumption, investment and government spending. As fiscal policy is at the heart of economic growth, governments in the region must also ensure that growth is sustained over the long term. This means that revenue generation and public investment decisions need to be focused on long-term development objectives as well as the short term.

While these policies have the potential to curtail investment and constrain economic growth, research63 has suggested that well-designed tax reforms with environmental taxes could reduce CO2 emissions significantly, while still producing gains in GDP growth and employment in Asian countries such as Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, China and India (see Table 3.1). This may be especially true in a best-case scenario, where other taxes such as corporation taxes are lowered as a result of increased collection of environmental tax. 32 ACHIEVING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE ERA OF THE ADDIS ABABA ACTION AGENDA Viet Nam\u2019s 2012 environmental protection tax65 The rapid economic growth in Viet Nam over the past 25 years has been fuelled by a significant increase in carbon energy, leading to environmental degradation. In response, in 2004 Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung called for the introduction of environmental protection taxes as one instrument to move to a greener economic model. In 2012 the Environmental Protection Tax Law entered into force. This taxes a diverse range of pollutants, such as fossil fuels, plastic bags and agricultural goods; taxes are applied at source and as a proposition of use (excise tax), rather than on the price (value added tax). Although no thorough post assessment of these taxes has yet been made, studies during their conception raised concerns about the potential impact on economic growth and lower social welfare of the population, particularly in urban areas. Despite this, environmental taxes have provided a key revenue source to the government in maintaining deficit targets, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently stating this could be increased, while recommending protecting the poorest people through targeted transfers.66 65.

Although subsidies are common in many countries in the Asia-Pacific region, reforms are underway in some to replace them with better targeted support or social spending programmes, as highlight in the box on Iran. In Indonesia, subsidies have reduced from $36 billion in 2012 to $4 billion in 2016, which is expected to reduce energy use by 10% and greenhouse gas emissions by 9% by 2030.70 Social impacts The model of domestic public resource mobilization is an important part of governments\u2019 toolkits to improve social welfare.

More progressive revenue generation better targets an individual\u2019s or group\u2019s ability to cope with the burden of paying, leading to more equitable societal outcomes. Examples of this include direct taxation like income or cooperation tax, where levels or taxation are structured so the burden to pay is shared proportionally With many Asia-Pacific countries recognising the need to focus on environment challenges such as greenhouse gas emissions, many governments have either implemented environmental taxes67 (e.g. Viet Nam, see box) or are in the process of doing so (e.g. China).68 Proceeds from these taxes can then be directly targeted at investments in environmental protection, such as through increased monitoring or enforcement activities. Public resource mobilization has the potential to indirectly impact on environmental and resource sustainability issues. Pacific Island countries are highly dependent on fishing licence fees for public resource generation. Although these have been implemented with sustainability as a key objective (e.g. Parties to the Nauru Agreement Vessel Day Scheme), ever-rising catch sizes have raised concerns about fish stocks and the need for precautionary management FIGURE 3.3 Equity of tax and spending policy in Asia compared with the rest of the world Source: Asia and Pacific \u2013 Building on Asia\u2019s Strengths during turbulent times (April 2016), World Economic and financial surveys, Regional Economic Outlook.

However, as seen in the case of Viet Nam, public resource mobilization can also be regressive in nature, adversely impacting on those with less ability to pay, such as the poorest and most vulnerable people. Tax regimes can also impact on different groups; for example if a person is not on a tax register, they may be excluded from certain government spending benefits. Governments have the ability to address the impact of revenue mobilization on equity and social wellbeing through their spending allocations. The impact of reduced wellbeing on the poorest people in society through taxation can be reduced through social protection programmes, free education and other social care. However, the IMF has noted that in Asia as a whole, while direct taxation policy is neutral in nature in its equitable outcomes, spending policies are poorly targeted at equity (Figure 3.3). This is in sharp contrast to the rest of the world, where government expenditure is more redistributive in nature. This may be because Asian governments spend proportionally less GDP on the key social sectors of social protection, health and education (see following section). However, while that might outline trends for Asia as a whole, the situation between countries in the region can contrast, as outlined by the cases of China and Iran (see box). Getting the balance right Fiscal policies can have positive and potentially negatives impact on the economy, social welfare and the environment, and these impacts are very much interlinked. For example, implementing fiscal policies that focus on environmental protection can indirectly impact economic growth and increase poverty and vulnerability, through increasing the cost of energy prices. However, other fiscal policies will counteract these adverse impacts. It is difficult to design an overall fiscal strategy that has optimal positive influence on all three of these areas. Therefore, in reality it is a continuous balancing act for governments to manage, based on priorities they have set out in national development planning. Thereafter the success of fiscal policies achieving this is based on the effectiveness of public financial management, which is the focus of the following section.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8cf7e75-35bb-415b-8326-93a02083f33b": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8cf7e75-35bb-415b-8326-93a02083f33b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "421433c086451dc6c0086b6a09959008f111156a1a59a94a88597577f419e641"}, "2": {"node_id": "b293a75a-841c-464f-bb95-5bd259df5f31", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0569d65a765bf31b364e27518621dba677028f8f0a2d8f50198dcbd7e1bee6a0"}}, "hash": "abc66c0f959703a572850185d94584f8e8a3cd53bcdb6deb01ba40d99c165b8a", "text": "CHAPTER 3: DOMESTIC PUBLIC FINANCE 33 34 ACHIEVING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE ERA OF THE ADDIS ABABA ACTION AGENDA Achieving optimal fiscal policies through results- based public financial management The role of public financial management in achieving optimal fiscal policies76 and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "862a652d-ed42-49e3-a672-9acf25ef41f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "862a652d-ed42-49e3-a672-9acf25ef41f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2cab5a8f9b570691305705a57912cadbc4e6bd367417e87b33d135ad24ce84c1"}, "3": {"node_id": "85c51f82-6fa8-4b1c-a410-ad18e6fe07aa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5793ed0fb24d28d34c776a06f569f930d12ccd15192f611ccd0c8ecb0a64510c"}}, "hash": "154c625cd5d6b837ecfa994443f07c7b0d4b0e8dd73b088eca17455eae2e84ce", "text": "reforms towards results-based framework There are four key structural processes to domestic public resources that all governments need do to get this balancing act right: 1. Planning: establishing the main development priorities Fiscal policies and inequality in China Since economic liberalization in the 1970s, China has been a remarkable success story of sustained economic growth and with it has helped moved over 700 million people out of poverty. However, the benefits of this growth have not been shared equally, and, although government fiscal policies are providing some redistributive powers in society, they are so far failing to fully reverse this trend. From a tax perspective although the regime structure is thought to be generally progressive in nature, the high level of tax avoidance (only 3% of the working population pay income tax) has meant a reliance on indirect taxes in practice, which has disproportionally impacted on the populations of lower and middle income groups. In addition, spending on social protection programmes and healthcare accounts for only 6% of GDP, meaning that only a fraction of total spending is considered to be redistributive in nature.72 Subsidy reforms in Iran: improving economic, social and environmental outcomes Since 2010, the Government of Iran has embarked on significant reforms to energy and food subsidies, as these were creating a high fiscal burden, poorly targeted, leading to wastage in consumption, and having a significant impact on the environment.73 The Subsidy Reform Act of 2010 initiated the shift from subsidies to a national cash transfer system, with the intention of reducing inequality, improving living standards, reducing consumption and promoting economic development. Although the first phase of the move to cash transfers was not targeted, several studies74 have praised it for being pro-poor in nature and having a transformative effect on poverty and inequality in the country. The second phase of the programme is now working to better target people on lower incomes, which is helping to reduce the government deficit and increase tax receipts, which the IMF states could create the fiscal space for greater public investment programmes.75 72.

Although these defined areas are broadly the same across all countries, the ways in which they are designed, established and implemented varies widely, depending on a range of factors including context, needs and capacity. However, this overall public financial management system is in continual reform, with the aim of improving its effectiveness and efficiency. In recent years one of the major shifts in reform within the Asia-Pacific region has been to better integrate these processes in a results- based framework. The starting point is a focus on development impact and results, which resources and structures are centred on achieving. Taking those four groups again in a results-based framework would therefore mean that: 1. Planning: establishing the main development priorities and outlining how fiscal policies, on both the revenue and expenditure side, can help achieve this CHAPTER 3: DOMESTIC PUBLIC FINANCE 35 2.

Monitoring and evaluation: monitoring and evaluating fiscal performance and the outputs/ activities linked to it, in an integrated way that enables a continual assessment of progress to national development goals. This integrated and more holistic results-based public finance management structure has no definite and prescribed formula for success, and countries have shown different ways of establishing it. Therefore, it makes it difficult to assess the extent to which countries in the region have made reforms towards having all or part of this framework in place. However, there are a number of prerequisite components required to have an integrated results-based framework, and indicators on these show a varying picture in the region. For example, two key indicators from the PEFA (Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability) framework for assessing public financial management: \u2018the quality of budget classifications\u2019 and \u2018the existence of costed sector strategies\u2019 are good assessments of whether a results framework is in place because they are crucial for the integration of planning, budgeting and monitoring and evaluation processes. The scores from the PEFA assessment of Asia-Pacific countries show a mixed picture, with some scoring above well (above 3) for one or both indictors, but a significant number scoring less well (2 or below) for both, indicting a difficulty in being able to effectively implement a results-based framework in practice (Figure 3.4). Reform towards a results-based framework is by no means a pre- condition for fiscal policies to achieve success in meeting national development goals, but evidence from those countries that have made reforms show how an integrated results-based framework can lead to more effective and efficient fiscal strategies and public financial management systems. The following section provides an overview of some of the key areas where a result-based framework has been used to integrate national planning into public financial management systems, and may proof useful and informative for other governments in the region.

While it important that this focus is maintained, recent reforms by countries have shown how these documents have become more integrated with the financing required to meet them, of which domestic public resource are a central component (see box for the example of Timor-Leste). This move to outlining the overarching role those resources can and should play in financing the development vision or strategy helps guide the role of fiscal policies in two ways.

The document focuses on the results envisaged during the duration of the plan (parts 2 to 5), while part 6 details economic targets that make the vision obtainable, including an assessment of the domestic public finance required. It plans for a diversification of revenues beyond the natural resources sector and customs and trade taxes, toward a broader tax base and increased contribution from taxes on income and capital gains.78 Although the Nepalese government is still formulating its 2030 long-term development strategy, it has outlined its general direction.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f8fcb6a-ab34-4aa4-adf0-82b414a715f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f8fcb6a-ab34-4aa4-adf0-82b414a715f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d564e1ba529f41f1260b9f191a3dd5ebf312671fb772537f8b5ad80b37798b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "c0f62f8e-9b5d-4a58-9ed4-8cd4961eed17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45d5400e10500fb8888a5740c5575d0cc811e012c08d14e26eee08f5c781bda6"}}, "hash": "e7bed389aa1b3c7cb7a5b066186709ceb0255c22147037c01a0efca6fa536592", "text": "Like with the government of Timor Leste, there is a clear articulation of developmental results, including reaching middle income status through inclusive growth and achieving the SDGs by 2030, but there is also a clear commitment to situating it in a financing framework, including the role of domestic investment such as public spending.

Linking budgetary processes with longer-term plans The indicators and targets in national development plans provide governments with a central focus to align to public financial management planning and budgeting. Building on this foundation, a process is needed by which government ministries, departments and agencies can effectively implement this. Different countries have approached this in different ways (see the Philippines example in the box), and the recent adoption of \u2018outcome-based budgeting\u2019 in Malaysia provides a clear example of where a ministry-level results framework has been aligned to the overall development planning (the national result framework) in a top-down approach, leading to budget formulation from the bottom up that it consistent with overall planning (see box). 77.

To strengthen the linkages between the strategy and the budgetary process the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) has implemented a results matrix, which takes the goals and outcomes from each chapter in the strategy and articulates indicators and targets to be achieved. These indicators have helped shift the budgetary focus from an input\u2013output model to a results framework, as ministers can use them to assess to what extent their projects, activities and programmes align with the strategy and this in turn helps decision-making on what to fund though the Public Investment Program and other government resources. 79.

International Monetary Fund, https://www.imf.org/external/ pubs/ft/wp/2016/wp16150.pdf Budgeting for Sustainable Development: the case of climate change and gender A major challenge with the social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development and Agenda 2030 is that they cut across sectors. To try and effectively formulate budgets and track investments specific budgeting practices have been establishing alongside existing frameworks within countries in the region on themes such as climate change and gender. With regards to climate change a number of national governments a number of national governments, as well as some Indian States,82 are using climate change financing frameworks to manage their response to climate change. These frameworks offer an approach that helps government address key components of their approach toward climate change, covering both adaptation and mitigation. A number of countries are establishing budgeting processes which allow for climate change to be into sector budget submissions thus ensuring that the whole of the budget is responding to climate change. Examples include Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan and the Philippines. There is significant scope for this type of more integrated budgeting to be applied to other aspects of the SDG agenda \u2013 which has placed the importance of an integrated approach at its core. As part of implementing more whole of government approaches to climate budgeting, some governments have also developed systems for tracking climate change budget allocations and expenditure across sectors. This is helping them to better track relevant expenditure, for example, through the use of climate change relevant scores for budget line items, a technique being used in Nepal and Indonesia.83 A number have developed detailed estimates of the costs of their planned interventions for both adaptation and mitigation responses. Through these ongoing reforms, governments are developing a clearer understanding of the costs and resources being used to respond to climate change, and are strengthening their management of climate change strategies across government departments covering a range of traditional sectors. Similar processes have been taking place in respect to gender for many years. UN Women has helped 43 countries worldwide develop gender- responsive national development plans and sectoral plans, which then feed into national budgetary frameworks,84 although a recent IMF85 report has stated that many of these were one off indicatives and in effect only 4 countries have made noteworthy progress in the Asia Region.

Each ministry is asked to define how their strategy impacts on gender issues, based on expected changes in 14 policies areas that have a specific relevance to gender. The Ministry of Finance then uses a model to assign budget percentages of spending targeted at gender, which feeds into an annual report to parliament alongside key performance indicators that outline how allocations have made an impact. A similar system is in place within India,87 with budgetary allocations coded as either specifically targeting women, pro-women allocation and mainstream spending linked to gender, with a yearly report produced by the Controller and Auditor General of India. Gender budgeting has also been successfully transferred subnationally to some Indian states, with moves to integrate it at the local level also planned. However, although gender budgeting initiatives focus on the expenditure aspect, the lack of detailed sex-disaggregated tax data has inhibited monitoring and evaluated revenue generation from a gender perspective in the region. Vertical coherence While an established results-focused public financial management framework can provide a clear direction for fiscal policy nationally, it is important that these are integrated vertically between levels of government. Integration between the local and national government is of particular importance in the Asia-Pacific region, given that many countries have some form of fiscal decentralization or devolvement of public service delivery.88 This importance is underlined in Table 3.2, which shows how, in the case of education, both aspects of financing and service delivery can be split between national and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42c0316d-a945-4d8b-9903-c613cdef91c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "42c0316d-a945-4d8b-9903-c613cdef91c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc616b89c3812132c45d1b240317a8b3ef0274128846c6257fc84f0fe0759bdf"}, "3": {"node_id": "351c7542-126b-499c-8bb7-442270133baa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e3e165519667ef756433e043fde45520bbe6f45a9dcc3693bdfea8b05e8a43a"}}, "hash": "b4c57ea7b6c6a445dbf3eeb8815432a29b46b7d9bd1291d81734f09ea52f02bf", "text": "subnational governments.

An example is shown in the case of Indonesia (see box), with a good example outside the region being Uganda, where local development plans are assessed against compliance to national one89 \u2022 Integrating public financial management planning to budget formulation (see Indonesia box) \u2022 Ensuring efficient mechanisms for transferring resources and sufficient capacity for subnational government to manage resource and deliver services \u2022 Implementing coherent mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation, both in terms of fiscal performance and service delivery and ensuring sufficient capacity of subnational government to implement these. Fiscal relations between national and local governments are strong in many countries in the region. Intergovernmental fiscal relations form a component of PEFA reports, with 12 of 16 countries scoring 3.0 out of 4.0 or higher (Table 3.3); although in some countries such as Myanmar and Laos PDR they could be more effective.

An example of this can be seen in the number (10) of Asian Pacific countries since 2011 that have signed the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax matters,90 which provides a framework for greater coordination and exchange of tax information between countries. And from that, the nine that have committed to the Multilateral Component Authority Agreement,91 which will be initiated in 2017 and aims to further facilitate access to information along with increased dialogue and cooperation between countries through standardization of systems. This internationally integrated framework and structure for tax administration aims to reduce illicit flows, thereby increasing tax collection by countries, which can be targeted towards development goals. Implementing monitoring and evaluation systems that measure and assess progress on both fiscal targets and result outcomes Monitoring and evaluation are critical aspects of public financial management. Alongside the systematic monitoring of progress within fiscal policy implementation, progress can be assessed continually against stated targets. In addition, evaluation processes help assess progress against stated aims and allow for important feedback loops into redesigning plans at relevant stages (annual, medium and long term).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "351c7542-126b-499c-8bb7-442270133baa": {"__data__": {"id_": "351c7542-126b-499c-8bb7-442270133baa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc616b89c3812132c45d1b240317a8b3ef0274128846c6257fc84f0fe0759bdf"}, "2": {"node_id": "42c0316d-a945-4d8b-9903-c613cdef91c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b4c57ea7b6c6a445dbf3eeb8815432a29b46b7d9bd1291d81734f09ea52f02bf"}}, "hash": "2e3e165519667ef756433e043fde45520bbe6f45a9dcc3693bdfea8b05e8a43a", "text": "Country Report year Intergovernmental fiscal relations Cook Islands 2014 4 Cambodia 2015 3 Nepal 2014 2.5 Afghanistan 2013 4 Viet Nam 2013 3.5 Vanuatu 2013 3 Tuvalu 2011 3 Solomon Islands 2012 3 Philippines 2016 4 Papua New Guinea 2015 3 Pakistan 2012 4 Myanmar 2012 1 Marshall Islands 2012 3 Lao PDR 2010 1 India 2010 3.5 Indonesia 2011 2 Source: Latest available publically available PEFA assessment reports from 2010 to 2015 Notes: Scores have been converted from alphabetical scores with the PEFA framework (A\u2013D) to numerical (4\u2013 1), where A and 4 are the highest available scores.

These systems are often managed by ministries of finance or agencies linked to them such as audit offices. However, with a growing number of Asia-Pacific countries now aligning fiscal policy to an overarching results or outcomes focus, there has been a significant shift in monitoring and evaluation to focus on performance targets linked to outcomes or objectives in national development planning. Monitoring and evaluation systems are now much more substantial and are often led by a specific ministry, with coordinated systems across a wide range of other ministries. One of the main challenges with a results-focused monitoring and evaluation system is the need for update and timely data, not only on fiscal performance, but also on outcomes, requiring ministries and subnational governments (where relevant) to track progress, as shown in the example of Korea (see box). 90.

As part of this process the government passed the National Development Planning System in 2004, the structure of which is outlined in Figure 3.6. In terms of national development planning, the long-term plan for 20 years and five-year mid-term plans (currently 2015\u20132019) provide top-down shaping of development priorities, where opportunities are given to the public for consultation. These national plans form the basis for regional planning. Local and provincial governments participate in annual consultative discussions with national government on work-plan formulation at the national and local levels. Although most subnational revenue is earmarked towards nationally set priorities, the \u2018Musrenbang\u2019 process provides the opportunity for citizens at the community level to shape budgetary decisions at the local level. During the first part of each year, communities articulate and outline development priorities, which are made public. This helps local governments define priorities and programmes to be funded through the annual budget, and representatives from each community \u2018Musrenbang\u2019 attend meetings to agree on the final draft of local government work plans and budgets. However, in practice there are a number of challenges that this process has faced: \u2022 The 2004 national development law does not articulate how much influence \u2018Musrenbang\u2019 priorities should have over funding allocation, which can limit their influence on budgetary decisions and allocation. There are some exceptions, such as the Bandung local government, which sets aside 30% of the local budget for \u2018Musrenbang\u2019 priorities. \u2022 Local government transparency in making publically available financial documentation varies, as does the capacity of citizens to interpret them, curtailing the influence the \u2018Musrenbang\u2019 process can have. The local government of Jakarta has established e-Musrenbang94 to provide a transparent portal for information and allow for easier facilitation of consultation processes. 20 years 5 years Annual Law of Development Plan Law of Finance Central government Local government National Mid-term Plan Government Work Plan National Long-term Plan Draft State Budget State Budget Regional Long-term Plan Regional Mid-term Plan Regional Work Plan Draft Regional Budget Regional Budget Work Plan Detailed Regional Budget Regional Budget Regional Work Unit Strategic Plan Regional Work Unit Work Plan Ministries\u2019 Strategic Plan Ministries\u2019 Work Plan Ministries\u2019 Budget Work Plan Detailed State Budget Synchronized in the National Forum on Development Plan FIGURE 3.6 The Musrenbang system in Indonesia 92.

OECD, https://www.oecd.org/gov/budgeting/41641086.ppt Monitoring and evaluation in Korea: the abundance of real-time information Following the Asian financial crisis in 1998 and the need to increase public spending due to an ageing population, the Korean government instigated a number of reform programmes to improve efficiency. In 2006 the National Finance Act made it a legal requirement for ministries and agencies to monitor performance and be evaluated. Performance monitoring is based on a variety of systematically collected data, including financial performance, customer surveys and administrative data. This information is then used to measure progress against indicators on planning implementation, impact, public relations and policy evaluation. The evaluation process is split into two areas: self evaluation and an in-depth review process. Each year a third of programmes are evaluated through self-assessment by ministries coordinated by the Ministry of Finance and selected major programmes are evaluated annually by an evaluation committee under the Prime Minister\u2019s office. The results of evaluation feedback directly feed into future budgetary decision-making.95 FIGURE 3.7 Transparency and access to fiscal information is mixed in the region and improvements can be made in most countries Source: Latest available publically available PEFA assessment reports from 2010 to 2015 Notes: Scores have been converted from alphabetical scores with the PEFA framework (A\u2013D) to numerical (4\u20131), where A and 4 are the highest available scores.

These surveys help the authorities understand the compliance costs on taxpayers and access the impact of tax policy on the business climate in the country, in turn feeding directly back into policy decision-making. Since 2008 the overall satisfaction score for taxpayers has risen from 76% to 82% in 2015.96 Bottom-up citizen-led approaches: Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability A number of NGOs in India are involved in monitoring the budgets of both Union (central) and state governments. The Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability is one of the longest-standing of such initiatives, and tracks spending by the state in specific (especially social) sectors. This helps policy-makers in various ways: it identifies whether stated priorities are reflected in implementation; it clarifies the burden sharing between state and central governments (state burdens are rising much faster than budget transfers from the centre); it raises \u2018budget literacy\u2019 in civil society, the media and the public generally; and it fosters more effective participation of civil society in financing for development and tax structure deliberations.

These resources, including commercial investments from domestic and foreign investors, private lending and remittances, have important contributions to make in financing sustainable development results. Many governments are taking a more active approach toward mobilising private finance, yet governments have only an indirect influence over the scale of private finance and the way that it is invested. This chapter reviews trends in private finance and highlights the range of contexts across countries in the Asia- Pacific region. Focusing on domestic private finance and foreign direct investment,97 it gives an overview of the results that governments across the region are targeting from private finance. It looks at the principles underlying government strategies for mobilising private finance, and closes by examining some of the key challenges for unleashing growth among domestic private finance and international private finance. Private finance in the Asia-Pacific region Domestic private investments are the single largest source of finance in Asia-Pacific countries and have significant potential to contribute to countries\u2019 national development objectives. Between 2005 and 2014, domestic private finance in the region more than doubled from $1.8 billion to $4.0 billion, driven by growth of domestic credit to the private sector. International private finance\u2014including FDI, private long-term debt, short- term debt, portfolio equity and remittances\u2014also increased, though 97. This chapter focuses primarily on domestic private finance and foreign direct investment. Other aspects of private financing such as remittances or private debt are not explored in detail here.

In total, private investment to the region grew at an annual compounded growth rate of 8.8% between 2005 and 2014 to $4.6 billion. (Figure 4.1) This surge in private investment to the region masks very different realities at country level. For lower and upper middle income countries, domestic private resources represent the largest share of available finance, at 41% and 46% respectively. Private finance is smaller in low-income countries, representing 25% of total financial resources, roughly at par with both private and public international flows (see chapter 1). In per person terms the differences are stark, with domestic private finance totalling over $2,000 per person in China, compared Afghanistan and Cambodia, for example, where it is less than $100 per person (Figure 4.2).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7878786f-46b1-43f7-8cb3-15bd3f6ff71b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7878786f-46b1-43f7-8cb3-15bd3f6ff71b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5e5201141bd080d0b9d0f469bb1adcb5f38b2cec507ad19a3d242d548dd2a330"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb16d945-6fc1-4b16-a33e-3965ed9a3b0e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5756a0b2e7c21d4266bb4ae618dd48fc769a184e4e3395c9fc2080a6e3ed274"}}, "hash": "a46b8dfaf2e901f31bc5cd382674e37a76e57aac9c1a9ca201d6608407ee9181", "text": "Potential contributions of private finance to sustainable development strategies Governments across the Asia-Pacific region recognize the potential that harnessing private finance offers for achieving sustainable development results and are increasingly targeting it to do so.

The private sector\u00b4s potential to mobilize investment for financing large-scale, transnational, infrastructure projects warrants its strategic role for bridging infrastructure gaps across the region. Many countries have established policies designed to incentivize private investment into priority infrastructure that supports national development priorities. The private sector can contribute to reducing poverty through more direct channels by creating jobs and providing a livelihood and dignity to citizens. Governments across the region aim to maximize development results from strategic private sector development by incentivizing employment creation in labour-intensive economic sectors; in sectors that tend to employ a larger share of women, such as the ready- made garments sector in Bangladesh; or in remote rural areas. The donor-supported Market Development Facility100 (MDF) in Fiji, Timor-Leste, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka shows how strategic private sector partnerships can support inclusive growth and reduce poverty. MDF analyzes and identifies growth opportunities in the economy that are relevant for poor people, and partners with businesses willing and able to invest in innovative changes to business practices to make a lasting impact. In Fiji, the MDF targeted tourism and related support industries, horticulture and agro- exports, and export processing as the most promising intervention sectors. Job creation through private investment can also strengthen countries\u2019 productive capabilities, helping diversify and increase sustainability over the long term. Developing skills and expertise, as well as technology transfer, can have long-lasting impacts. In the 1970s foreign investors in Malaysia\u00b4s telecommunications industry employed many Malaysians in managerial jobs which, over time, helped build up local managerial capacity. Many of these people eventually went on to set up companies themselves, in industries such as equipment manufacturing, thereby spurring Malaysia\u00b4s equipment manufacturing sector. Targeted incentives can promote social investments by the private sector. In Papua New Guinea an \u2018infrastructure tax credit scheme\u2019 has been effective at responding quickly to provide emergency repairs to the Highlands Highway. It allows companies to build and contribute to public infrastructure such as hospitals, schools, roads and law and justice facilities for a maximum amount of 0.75% of the company\u2019s tax receipts. Growing public resources, in particular tax revenue, through domestic economic activity and foreign investment is an important indirect channel to underpin public investment. This can indirectly support increased investment in essential infrastructure as well as health and education services, which authorities can target to poor and vulnerable people (see chapter 3). 100.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "73eb852b-6229-4d1f-8806-8d18cec50709": {"__data__": {"id_": "73eb852b-6229-4d1f-8806-8d18cec50709", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe1ca7b4dd19a4c2ec2c29fd472606b2198b5baca64598a01c03d2e6f1675729"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd21e42a-2d47-465f-a7d3-40f02cff60db", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28b6b35b356178f68ad694eefd0a1f10c9df9ca96e789b8f7351aacff9702768"}}, "hash": "4423c9ceb42cad82c4db8ca4a5eb7b001675fe8c029e3d060f3bf9a0df804e8e", "text": "100.

It is important for government to establish strategies to mitigate the potential negative impacts of private finance, covering issues such as environmental degradation, labour standards, tax avoidance, corruption and repatriation of profits, as part of overall policy toward private financing. Private sector development can also pose important environmental challenges if appropriate mitigation measures are not taken. Cambodia\u00b4s current growth is based on inefficient technology, energy generation and transportation systems, with the bulk of its emissions attributable to the private sector. The country\u00b4s Industrial Development Policy with its accelerated development of the private sector may aggravate this problem. Its current \u201cClimate Change Strategic Plan 2014\u20132023\u201d is mainly focused on mobilizing private sector investment for moderating the potential harm caused by climatic change effects in Cambodia.101 Countries with high inflows of FDI and portfolio equity may be exposed to financial shocks as these flows are characterized by high volatility. Between 1995 and 2008 the average absolute annual rate of change of FDI inflows in Asia-Pacific countries was 113%.102 Government strategies to harness private finance have a number of core features Governments\u2019 ability to harness private finance for results will be a key determinant of the extent to which national development objectives are realized. The challenge is that governments only have limited and indirect influence over the way most private resources are invested, the objectives they aim to achieve and their impact, both positive and negative, on people, society and the planet. This indirect influence is largely exerted through the business environment\u2014the ease of doing business, the incentives for investing in different sectors/industries and for using different business models. Responsibility in government for policy toward these different aspects of the business environment is scattered across numerous departments or agencies. While the context and challenges vary from country to country, there are a number of common features to governments\u2019 approaches for engaging private finance. Looking across country strategies for mobilizing private finance, a number of key principles emerge. Articulating a clear role for private finance A number of countries in the Asia- Pacific region have established processes to define a clear role for private finance, and set targets to realize this. Governments will be most successful in mobilizing private finance (or any type of finance) to achieve results if they have a clear vision for the role that finance will play. A number of countries across the region have developed processes in their medium-term planning systems to set targets for mobilizing private finance and priority areas it can be invested in. This guidance on the role that private finance is expected to play in relation to other types of financing sets a foundation for more focused policies to target and influence private finance. Establishing coordination mechanisms to align policy and implementation A government\u2019s approach to private finance must be aligned if it is to successfully influence the way private finance is invested and the results it realizes. Many important reforms transcend the responsibility of a single ministry. This demands an Mobilising private finance in Laos Lao PDR has been successful in mobilizing increasing domestic and international private finance. Lao PDR\u2019s national socio-economic development plans (NSEDPs), which cover five-year periods, are used to operationalize policymaking and the vision for results. In consecutive NSEDPs, Lao PDR has developed estimates of financing needs and targets for mobilizing private finance, alongside other financing. These clear targets for mobilizing private investment have provided a basis for more targeted policymaking and have contributed to ongoing reforms in the way investment is governed in the country. Through measures such as establishing a single-window approach to investment project approvals, enhanced dialogue through annual meetings with investors and an amended investment promotion law, the country has been able to achieve and exceed private investment targets in successive NSEDPs. Over the 20 years between 1986 and 2005, cumulative FDI totalled $8.5 billion; yet this rose to $11 billion during the Sixth NSEDP (2006\u20132010)103 and $20.9 billion during the 7th NSEDP (2011\u20132015).104 Lao PDR now aims to further grow and diversify private finance, for example targeting greater FDI in sectors such as tourism.105 Other countries, such as Bangladesh and Cambodia, have adopted similar approaches to setting out the overall scale of private finance to be mobilized through their five-year plans, and using this as a basis for targeted policymaking. authoritative, high-level coordination mechanism across all government stakeholders to ensure the different components of key reforms and policies are coherently designed, developed, implemented and monitored.

When these agencies and levels of government are not well coordinated the result can be fragmentation and duplicity. In Viet Nam, for example, competition between subnational administrations to attract investment has led to a disproportionately large number of infrastructure projects. Where countries have been successful, such as Cambodia\u2019s promotion of rice exports, their efforts have often been characterized by narrowing the focus to specific interventions that have clear leadership from the highest levels of government, clear targets and a well-defined implementation plan.106 The Tonga Energy Road Map has achieved successes, building on government leadership at the highest levels; a shared sense of social and economic issues among government, the private sector and development cooperation providers; and clear targets for outcomes.107 Inter-ministerial coordination mechanisms can focus on identifying and aligning potentially conflicting policy priorities upfront. For instance, the Ministry of Finance may excessively finance its public investment budget from borrowing on domestic capital markets, crowding out business from access to finance and effectively cancelling the impact of central bank measures to facilitate access to finance. In Bangladesh, domestic borrowing by the government risks crowding out private sector investment.108 Such mechanisms can operate across central government and between the different administrative levels to ensure alignment and identification of synergies between national and local policymaking. Local governments are often more aware of deep poverty and inequality issues in their regions and such mechanisms can elevate this information to agencies responsible for development planning. Local governments also have a better understanding of the economic dynamics and necessities of local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and can enter into dialogue with them or ensure their needs are taken into account. The Philippine Development Plan 2011\u20132016 recognizes that provinces have different constraints to growth due to differences in location and initial endowments, and has adopted for the first time a spatial focus for matching provinces to development strategies and interventions designed to address deep poverty and inequality in the country.109 Developing effective monitoring, evaluation and learning mechanisms Strong monitoring, evaluation and learning systems are critical for effectively linking financing policy to results. The reality of achieving desired results is often a complex one incorporating multiple indirect mechanisms. This is particularly true for private finance. Rigorously assessing the contribution of private finance to national development results\u2014and the contribution of government activity in influencing private finance\u2014can inform more effective policymaking. It can highlight where private finance is more or less effective in achieving results, identify constraints to mobilizing private finance, and help governments to understand their own efficacy in influencing the private sector. Specifically, monitoring and evaluating the private sector\u00b4s contribution to national development priorities can focus on two main questions. How do particular resources/types of investments impact on overall desired development results targeted by the national development plan? And to what extent have dedicated government policy measures facilitated this private sector impact? Integrating these two overarching questions into wider monitoring and evaluation systems requires indicators and measures of progress that capture progress against the desired results from private finance and enable these to be linked up to the wider results targets. It is also critical to understand the effectiveness of government policies in influencing private finance. This could entail three related levels of indicators that measure: 1. The effectiveness of government policy, output and activities towards the private sector, such as the measure of quality of public-private dialogue. 2. The volumes and types of private sector investments being made, such as the volume and quality of FDI. 3. The impact of private sector investments related to private sector resource policies,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff9c446d-f4e6-4dd9-9955-e43b011a605c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff9c446d-f4e6-4dd9-9955-e43b011a605c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9829eafa6a98cb623867dbce79e8a2a072e84b133127f72227a1ef2ba610aa6a"}, "3": {"node_id": "ae2896e0-6e81-4547-86cb-74f9ae40556f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a92a680afbc0cfa2a63b1ee22901e6fd87416d594b4a14b374cd90d1dbb4889"}}, "hash": "48ba5757e805964ec3ac9a3e0f4d208ec1fb8a14b63f7b39ab7d95cddedf689a", "text": "for example the number and quality of jobs created by FDI, number of women employed and wage levels. 106.

Philippine Development Plan 2011-2016, Republic of the Philippines National Economic and Development Authority. http://www.neda.gov.ph/2013/10/21/ philippine-development-plan-2011-2016/ While effective national systems for monitoring and evaluating the impact of private finance on sustainable development results are not common across the region, there are initiatives underway to improve the reporting and understanding about the impact that business is having. Philippine Business for the Environment and UNDP have developed a partnership that aims to leverage the impact reporting that a growing number of companies are undertaking themselves by encouraging them to report through a standardized process. Launched in September 2016, \u2018Philippine business contributions to the sustainable development goals\u2019 will capture and showcase information on private sector contributions through an annual report.110 Strengthening public-private dialogue Public-private dialogue is an essential foundation for designing effective policy and for engendering the buy-in to and ownership of national plans from private actors that can successfully harness private finance for development. Dialogue can build an understanding of the objectives and challenges that public and private actors (both commercial and civil society) face, and can help align interests. It helps government to understand the challenges and constraints that private actors face, and set realistic ambitions for the size and scope of private contributions to national development objectives. It is important to determine common interest between what the government wants by way of results and what the business community can support through investment. Through a multi- stakeholder dialogue, governments may have more realistic expectations for business\u00b4 contributions to national development plans. Public-private dialogue also allows business to contribute its experience and insights for effective policy implementation supportive of an enabling business environment. To be sustainable, public-private dialogue needs to lead to tangible actions and results for building trust and credibility. This requires involving all relevant stakeholders from the public and private sector and all relevant public agencies affecting the business operating environment so that agreed reforms are actually implemented in a timely manner. Building trust is a prerequisite for partnering with the private sector particularly in countries with significant state ownership of business, such as former communist countries, or in sectors where there has been a history of irresponsible business practice. Data from the GPEDC monitoring framework show a readiness from public and private sectors to engage in dialogue across much of the region (see chapter 5, box \u2018What the GPEDC monitoring framework tells us about countries\u2019 financing frameworks\u2019). In many countries, the private sector is perceived to be more ready for dialogue than the public sector, which suggests it will be receptive to engaging with government as it develops more active policy toward private finance. Examples of public- private dialogue across the region illustrate there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach for governments partnering with private sector actors. Partnerships need to adapt to local realities, needs and stakeholders. In Timor-Leste a Chamber of Commerce and Industry was established in 2010 to help stimulate growth in the private sector.111 A key role of the chamber is to facilitate dialogue between the private sector and government, both about the challenges that private firms face and to enable businesses to participate in consultations about government policy on issues such as tax and fiscal reform measures.112 This dialogue between the public and private sectors has helped to shape policy and build consensus around development objectives.113 In Nepal, the World Bank\u2019s Investment Climate Reform Program was designed in Nepal\u2019s post-conflict period to use private sector development and investment for economic reform and peacebuilding.

Countries face a variety of challenges in mobilising domestic private finance The status of the business environment and private finance vary widely across the Asia-Pacific region and countries face a range of challenges in both stimulating growth in private finance and in channelling this finance toward investments that can realize sustainable development results. Developing the domestic private sector, and SMEs in particular, can support national development results and boost national productivity. SMEs are the backbone of Asia\u00b4s domestic private sector, accounting for 98% of all enterprises. Between 2007 and 2012 they provided on average 66% of total employment and 38% of GDP or manufacturing value added.114 In China SMEs accounted for 41.5% of total export value in 2012, while in Thailand they made up 29.9%.115 Viet Nam\u2019s domestic enterprise sector is dominated by small and medium-sized, proprietor- financed enterprises that account for two-thirds of total investment. Despite the size of the SME sector, there remain challenges that constrain further growth and contribution to development results in many contexts. Many of the challenges to doing business in the region (Table 4.1) are directly related to, or influenced by, government policy and operations, and cut across many different parts of government. Developing a strategic and holistic approach to providing an Main challenges Countries Access to financing Bhutan, China, Iran, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Viet Nam Inefficient government bureaucracy China, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Mongolia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand Inadequate supply of infrastructure Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Nepal, Philippines Corruption Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand Policy instability India, Iran, Myanmar, Nepal, Viet Nam Government instability Bangladesh, Mongolia, Nepal, Thailand Inadequately educated workforce Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Viet Nam Restrictive labour regulations Bhutan, Singapore, Sri Lanka Insufficient capacity to innovate China, Malaysia, Singapore Inflation India, Pakistan, Singapore Tax rates Pakistan Source: World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Report 2015\u20132016.

SMEs, defined as those with up to 150 employees, account for close to 50% of the sample for the Asia-Pacific region. TABLE 4.1 The business perspective on main challenges to private sector development enabling business environment for SMEs is therefore a priority if governments wish to unleash its potential to contribute to national development. Increasing access to long-term credit Lack of access to long-term credit limits domestic private sector growth, ultimately impacting on employment, tax revenue and the country\u2019s productive capacity. It is one of the most commonly cited challenges to private sector development across the region (Table 4.1). Countries across the region are deploying measures designed to address a number of constraints to increasing access to credit. In Viet Nam private companies depend mainly on proprietor finance with limited access to commercial credit, due to complicated procedures and strict collateral requirements. This has contributed to the challenge faced by domestic business in Viet Nam when moving into higher value- added activities and developing the economies of scale required to act as suppliers to foreign investors and to participate in global value chains.

Unless Viet Nam can move into more productive investments, there is a risk that it will begin to lose out to lower wage economies. This will require facilitating private sector access to land for using it as collateral.116 To address financing constraints faced by domestic businesses, Asia- Pacific countries are encouraging their national banking sector to tailor its lending operations to the domestic private sector through measures such as incentivizing more flexible collateral requirements and increasing competition.

Microfinance can be a powerful financial instrument to improve access to finance for the poorest households and micro- enterprises, and is being used to contribute to wider goals such as gender equality. In the Philippines microfinance has been mainstreamed in the formal financial system with private microfinance institutions providing poor households and micro-enterprises with financial services. The microfinance institutions sector in Cambodia, which has very high levels of transparency and a strong pro-poor approach, has significantly increased financial inclusion with nearly 90% of microfinance institutions lending outside of Phnom Penh.118 And in Bangladesh, where the Grameen Bank developed the early models of microfinance, over 1,500 NGOs, including Building Resources Across Communities, are now providing microfinance. Through the Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation, a not-for- profit established by the Bangladesh government, microcredit has been provided to about eight million borrowers, of which 91% are women.119 Across the region smart use of information and communications technology (ICT) has enabled access to financial services in areas without bank branches. In Viet Nam banks have started to use mobile phone technology, reaching 8 million users of e-money.120 In Papua New- Guinea since 2009, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), through the Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme, has led the opening of the mobile money market through its sector development approach. Bangladesh Bank has taken a number of measures, such as mobile banking, to support access to credit for micro, small and medium enterprises. Access to finance is often restricted to firms operating in the formal economy, yet there are a range of reasons why many firms choose to remain in the informal sector. Tax policy and administration is one reason: when taxes are high and commensurate gains seem low, many businesses may choose to stay informal, thereby limiting their access to credit (and also their contribution to government revenue through paying taxes). Viet Nam addressed this issue in 2014, acknowledging that tax rates were too high and applying a reduced tax rate of 20% to SMEs, while also reducing rates from 25% to 22% for other businesses. The challenges for access to finance across the region are significant and demand multi-faceted, coordinated responses from across government, often requiring a long-term perspective. Addressing infrastructure constraints for inclusive and sustainable development Infrastructure growth in the Asia- Pacific region lags behind economic growth, and also behind international standards of infrastructure quantity and quality.121 To address this it has been estimated that Asia and the Pacific would need to raise an estimated $8 trillion for national infrastructure financing between 2010 and 2020, out of which 68% would be for new capacity and 32% for maintaining and replacing existing infrastructure.

Properly designed infrastructure, in line with governments\u00b4 national development plans, can make growth more inclusive by sharing its benefits with poorer groups and communities, especially by connecting remote areas and small and landlocked countries to major business centres.127 Channelling private investment into much-needed economic and social infrastructure development is seen as a top priority for many countries in the region.

Reuters, 25 May 2015, \u2018China invites private investors to help build $318 billion of projects,\u2019 bridge the infrastructure financing gap. Viet Nam aims for the private sector to finance a large share of its infrastructure needs, estimated at over $25 billion a year or 20% of GDP, in complement to public investment, which has never exceeded $14 billion. Indonesia\u00b4s ambitious Infrastructure Development Plan for 2015/2019 aims for 40% funding from public investment,128 with the remainder mobilized from the private sector. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are gaining importance for bridging the infrastructure gap Many governments in the region have developed PPP policies as a central pillar of strategies to expand and develop infrastructure. Private actors also see this as an area of growth in the future: over half (54%) of respondents to the PwC 2015 APEC CEO Survey think PPPs will mature as a vehicle for infrastructure investment over the next five years.129 PPPs are seen by governments as an instrument to leverage large investments with limited public finance contributions, and to benefit from the potentially higher levels of technical capacity, efficiency and resources that the private sector could offer.130 Infrastructure such as toll roads, power plants and mass rail transport are often amenable to private construction, operation and maintenance, and using this instrument can free up public resources that would otherwise have been used for infrastructure, to meet other societal needs.131 In 2015 China released new regulations and directives governing PPP investments and launched more than 1,000 projects, worth a total $317.8 billion.132 The Philippines established a PPP programme in 2010 that has since awarded deals worth $4 billion. A key success factor to the government\u00b4s success in building and maintaining an attractive pipeline of PPP projects has been its PPP Centre,133 and the Philippines was recognized by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most improved Asia-Pacific country for PPP readiness in 2014.134 Indonesia has also established a PPP Centre to specifically handle project preparations and auctions. Thailand\u00b4s policy toward PPPs is embodied in its new PPP Act, with a PPP Policy Committee headed by the Prime Minister to streamline the project approval process. To avoid a fragmented approach and excessive decentralization of infrastructure that could be detrimental to national development priorities, a country\u00b4s PPP policy needs to be embedded in its overarching financing plans.

In the Philippines, ODA has been used to provide loan guarantees for projects to entice private capital, and to build institutional capacities in evaluating and monitoring PPP projects. ODA can be used more strategically to catalyse a larger amount of private capital into PPPs for infrastructure development in health or education than it would have been able to finance by itself. Infrastructure is the largest single sector for both ODA and OOF (see chapter 5). PPPs can make an important contribution to financing infrastructure in Asia and the Pacific, but challenges remain. Many countries, particularly smaller countries including many Pacific Island countries, lack the human and financial resources to successfully manage PPPs. The model is complex by nature and needs significant technical capacity from a range of professions, from engineers to economists.135 There are challenges in coordination across the various departments and agencies responsible for the areas covered by a PPP policy. This is reflected in investor perceptions in many countries of unpredictable regulations, poor project preparation, bureaucratic delays, inequitable risk allocation, and struggles to secure land rights. At present investment capital exceeds the availability of economically sound projects.136 Finally, while PPPs can unlock financing for key projects in the short run, over the long term they can incur costs that reduce their overall efficiency and cost effectiveness.137 Multilateral organizations can address capacity constraints and facilitate PPPs in infrastructure by assisting in PPP project preparation. PPPs are a core part of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Strategy 2020, with the bank aiming CHAPTER 4: HARNESSING PRIVATE FINANCE FOR DEVELOPMENT 53 54 ACHIEVING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE ERA OF THE ADDIS ABABA ACTION AGENDA Advancing gender equality through the private sector The way the private sector and SMEs in particular develop is increasingly recognized across the region as a key driver to progress against gender equality objectives. A number of countries have mainstreamed gender objectives in the laws, policies, plans and programmes that provide a framework for stimulating private sector development. In the Maldives, legislation governing SMEs, cooperatives and decentralization incorporates features designed to progress gender equality through private sector development. The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Act (2011) mandates the Ministry of Economic Development to review and amend legislation and policies that may inhibit women from participating in the MSME sector. It provides a framework to support MSMEs owned and operated by women and includes representation of women entrepreneurs among the permanent members of the MSME Council. The Cooperative Society Governance Code (2010) provides for 20% women\u2019s participation in cooperative societies and the Decentralization Act (2010) mandates island councils and city councils to focus on income-generating activities for women through their respective committees.139 In India, policies at the national and state level aim to promote gender equality through increasing women\u2019s employment opportunities and wages. The National Employment Policy (2008) promotes equality in the labour market and increased access to opportunities. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme is structured with 33% participation by women and equal pay for women. At the subnational level a number of states have developed programmes supporting women\u2019s enterprises, such as the Odisha State Agriculture Policy, which aims to help the development of women\u2019s agro-enterprise.140 And in Bangladesh the National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction (revised in 2009) includes SME polices incorporating strategies sensitive to the needs of women entrepreneurs, reducing wage discrepancies and enforcing labour laws relating to women. A National Women Development Policy was introduced in 2011 to improve working conditions for women, in close collaboration with the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs. The ready-made garment sector, which is a main employer for women in the country, is a particular focus.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69a72dc2-29c7-4fe6-98c0-2a02868c56f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "69a72dc2-29c7-4fe6-98c0-2a02868c56f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43b29afcd4ef22ee7ec63aa6e311aa99fd3e511591aa6c54e73ae605c8112cba"}, "2": {"node_id": "c841a8a7-53df-4afa-a9b9-ca29b8af017b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ba87eba9ef0f2847cf27cd16f1c9c17bff3b90b7827a3f8add104b46c57ddc5"}}, "hash": "e7781abf1f92122d24ff8dbbd3e50def2da90ab5f10c6c6e7186f07a99eee26b", "text": "Programmes have been developed to support 300 garment factories in achieving a safe and healthy working environment for workers, and almost 1,700 exporting factories are inspected for fire and electrical and structural safety under this programme.

UNCTAD Investment advisory series: Estonia and Jamaica, 2011. to promote PPPs in all of its core operational areas.138 Countries face varied challenges in mobilising international private finance International private finance, particularly FDI, has played a driving role in the strong economic expansion in Asia-Pacific over the past decade, attracted by the region\u00b4s abundant labour resources in manufacturing and agriculture.142 FDI can contribute to sustainable development through growing capital and employment, bringing innovations in technology and making positive impacts on the environment. Direct contributions to economic growth may include effects on capital formation; trade and the balance of payments; employment and human resource development; technology and innovation; and market structure and expansion. In Viet Nam foreign investment has been a major driver of reducing poverty through creating over 2 million direct jobs and supporting public revenues and the balance of payments. Over the long term FDI, through close interaction with the local economy can make important indirect contributions to development through \u2018spill-over effects\u2019,143 which drive innovation, product and service quality, productivity and wage levels. These can be the result of supplier linkages, competition and demonstration effects, as well as labour mobility.144 Not all types of FDI have the same development impact. Depending on the economic sector or geographic region to which FDI is targeted, its potential for direct and indirect contributions to economic growth may differ significantly. Resource-seeking FDI, which aims to exploit natural resources endowments, is often characterized by enclave economies with limited positive spill-over effects, and can expose local communities to the risk of environmental degradation. Investors seeking access to the internal market (or a market to which it has preferential access) or looking for lowering production costs through cheaper labour as part of global value chains may have stronger developmental impacts, but also require a more proactive and coherent approach on the part of government to attract. On this basis governments across the region are identifying and focusing their efforts to attract FDI in strategic economic sectors and geographic areas that have potentially impactful spill- over effects in generating employment and tax revenues, catalysing domestic investment, developing skills and knowledge and stimulating wider private sector growth. Bangladesh\u2019s 7th Five Year Plan focuses strategically on export manufacturing and global value chains. It targets productive FDI in the ready- made garments sector and has identified a future strategic opportunity in the shipbuilding industry. For the latter it is providing facilities and policies for ensuring compliance with international standards in ship quality, worker safety and environmental pollution and is working to stimulate a strong network of backward linkages industries. Government policies matter for attracting higher value FDI In many Asia-Pacific countries investments in low value-added textiles and simple assembly operations still dominate among FDI flows. Economic spill-over effects in these cases remain limited as many foreign companies bring their components from abroad and export their product, offering few opportunities for local SMEs to become part of international value chains or acquire new management skills or technology. Viet Nam is an example of such a case.145 Providing an attractive investment climate for attracting higher value FDI means having a stable and predictable macro-economic environment, decent infrastructure, public services, a skilled labour force, and effective governance. Improving the investment climate therefore involves multiple policy areas that cut across the remits of a large number of government agencies and departments: competition Remittances are an increasingly important source of international private finance for many Asia-Pacific countries For countries with a large overseas diaspora, remittances account for a large proportion of total international financing, and are often more stable and countercyclical than private debt and portfolio equity flows. India receives the largest volume of remittances, an estimated $70.4 billion in 2014, followed by China with $62.3 billion and the Philippines with $27.3 billion (Figure 4.3).

As well as an attractive investment climate, governments may need to provide appropriate incentives to focus FDI on labour-intensive, job- creating sectors that employ a large share of the most vulnerable segments of the population such as women, unskilled labour and rural poor. This requires central government agencies capable of interacting with foreign investors and coordinating across different government agencies and jurisdictions responsible for FDI promotion and facilitation (e.g. infrastructure, energy, access to finance, development of PPPs and labour market regulation) to ensure coherency across 145. Asia-Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility and UNDP, 2014. Development finance for sustainable development goals in middle-income Viet Nam. CHAPTER 4: HARNESSING PRIVATE FINANCE FOR DEVELOPMENT 55 56 ACHIEVING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE ERA OF THE ADDIS ABABA ACTION AGENDA policies. The government of Viet Nam has developed a strategy for attracting higher quality FDI to increase the development returns from FDI by designing packages of interventions to support specific sectors or markets, covering areas such as infrastructure, vocational training and incentives for investors.146 Perceptions of governance and corruption have an important bearing on FDI and there is considerable evidence that business confidence and investment increase in countries where public pressure fuels improvement in governance. Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index placed the Philippines 141st out of 180 countries in 2008\u2014 consistent with the World Bank\u2019s assessment in 2006 of it being very corrupt, but by 2014 it had climbed to 85 out of 175. This rapid improvement was helped by many government actions, but most influential have been the myriad efforts of civil society and business networks (such as the Makati Business Club) to scrutinize public programmes and identify likely corruption and leakage. As a result, business confidence has improved and there has been a significant increase in FDI.147 FDI may also support development objectives through contributing to domestic private sector growth. This requires policies supporting local SMEs in developing the capacity needed to act as suppliers to foreign investors and establish economic linkages to fully tap the indirect benefits of FDI and integrate global value chains. Impact investing, which aims to generate social and environmental impacts, as well as a financial return, is growing (see chapter 1). Across diverse sectors, from housing to energy and financial services, this type of financing offers the potential to provide sustainable, scalable impact on sustainable development. A number of initiatives exist to stimulate impact investing and channel financing into social impact enterprises. In the Philippines, UNDP has recently launched a social impact fund that aims to help enterprises grow from the \u2018late validation\u2019 phase, where business models are refined, to the \u2018early scale\u2019 phase, where they are rolled out to reach larger numbers of customers or suppliers.148 Other initiatives look to improve impact measurement and rating systems, to help social impact enterprises improve performance, and to attract financing to the most impactful investments.149 Corporate social responsibility policies can also complement national governments\u00b4 development activities, especially in remote areas or specific economic sectors, while supporting sustainable profits and investment for business. Bangladesh\u00b4s National Corporate Social Responsibility Policy for Children, developed through multi-stakeholder consultations in close collaboration with the Ministry of Labour and Employment, requires businesses to contribute to ensure the rights of education of children, for example by ensuring the quality of education along with technical and vocational apprenticeships and giving special attention to children who do not have access to mainstream education. Illicit financial flows sap the contributions of private finance Vast financial resources are lost to Asian countries due to illicit financial flows, in particular trade flow losses resulting from faulty invoicing designed so that traders can direct funds to countries more advantageous to them. While commonly-quoted estimates may over- state the problem,150 it nevertheless represents a major loss of resources that could otherwise have important development benefits (albeit indirectly). It is therefore important that national development plans recognize the potentially significant losses of public revenues occurring from illicit finance. Understanding the multiple ways in which this finance flows in and out of the country and its impact on development outcomes is a prerequisite for developing policy measures to stem the illicit finance problem. While tax havens and countries housing the banks and other firms that receive illicit financial flows should take responsibility for the problem at their end, there is much that countries in Asia and the Pacific can do to stem the problem. This ranges from strengthening anti- money laundering laws and practices to curtailing trade misinvoicing and improving the transparency in taxing multinational corporations. Addressing illicit financial flows can strengthen the direct and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01c21dac-c92f-482b-9330-7c742de68e8d": {"__data__": {"id_": "01c21dac-c92f-482b-9330-7c742de68e8d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca8379e8cea3489d4a53e657b02025f1a1d20ecee1f0ddae2d360924f8475eb5"}, "3": {"node_id": "453fd9d3-ecc0-474c-9410-3052ee9b25fc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de37470374f3e81e4e43a2e796020f1ee9ce3916398d7497669c2e6cf9582bc7"}}, "hash": "7d9b55d5cdc9a002764df8bd252a6be8bdc54202925b6f1f73e13d24c5d787e9", "text": "indirect impacts of FDI on sustainable development results. 146.

Global Financial Integrity has estimated that in 2013, $1.1 trillion left developing countries in illicit financial outflows, mostly resulting from misinvoicing in imports and exports and errors/leakages in balance of payments. They also estimate that Asia accounts for 39% of these flows (Global Financial Integrity, 2015, Illicit Financial Flows from Developing Countries: 2004\u20132013, Washington DC). Yet the analysis methodology has recently been questioned, so the precision of these figures is in doubt, though there is consensus that the scale of illicit finance is significant. Still, it correctly identifies that the causes of illicit outflows include corrupt officials extracting public funds from the country (perhaps using shell companies); money laundering by drugs cartels, terrorists and others; and human trafficking. 5: International public finance International public finance accounts for a declining proportion of total resources in the Asia-Pacific region, as other types of financing have grown more rapidly. Yet it retains an important role in many countries\u2019 financing strategies. While discourse on policy processes for financing development emphasizes domestic institutions as the primary driver, there is consensus about the important supportive role that development cooperation in particular can play. This chapter looks at the development cooperation component of international public finance, covering ODA, SSC, OOF and other financing from development finance institutions.151 It gives an overview of what we know about development cooperation trends in the region and asks what roles it can play within integrated national financing frameworks. It also considers what data from the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (GPEDC) monitoring framework can tell us about the extent to which it is already meeting those roles, and what the monitoring framework can tell us about certain aspects of the financing frameworks that countries already have in place. This chapter can feed directly into discussions at the High Level Meeting of the GPEDC in Nairobi, with messages about the roles that development cooperation can play and monitoring effective development cooperation for the future. International public finance and development cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region Across the Asia-Pacific region as a whole international public finance totalled at least $150.9 billion in 2014 \u2013 data on some components, notably south-south cooperation, are unavailable. Within international public finance, ODA and OOF have together fallen from 2.3% of total financing in 2000 to 151.

Within these frameworks many governments are also articulating a clearer role for development cooperation. Three particular roles for development cooperation stand out: meeting its comparative advantages in the country context, leveraging wider resource flows and supporting institutional development.

Its goal is to provide more comprehensive information on international financing, which can be the basis for more informed policy discussions about the roles and relevance of different financing instruments. The concept is still in development, but has been recognized in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and integrated into the SDG monitoring framework. Moving forward it will move away from the OECD and taken under the aegis of the UN.154 154. TOSSD: A new statistical measure for the SDG Era, OECD DAC. CHAPTER 5: INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC FINANCE 59 60 ACHIEVING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE ERA OF THE ADDIS ABABA ACTION AGENDA Meeting its comparative advantage Ensuring that development cooperation works to its comparative advantages in each country context and within the region can ensure it makes an important contribution to results. While accounting for a decreasing proportion of total resources in the region, development cooperation has unique characteristics that mean it can be used in ways that other resources, even those many times larger in scale, are less well suited to. Development cooperation is the primary type of international financing that can be used to target investments designed to reduce poverty and vulnerability.155 It does not need to return a profit and as such can make investments that are not (or are not perceived to be) commercially viable by private actors. It can be used to address issues faced by the most vulnerable populations, to help ensure no one is left behind. And it can provide financing and help raise political attention for priorities that are otherwise difficult to finance.156 Development cooperation will be most effective if it plays to its strengths relative to other types of financing in each country context. Dialogue between the government and development cooperation providers is essential to develop the comparative advantages of development cooperation among other financing. Agreeing the level of ambition in terms of the scale of financing from development cooperation can help countries to plan more effectively. Articulating the comparative advantage of development cooperation in this way can help providers guide their programming to ensure it is aligned to countries\u2019 visions for results and is being invested effectively. Targeted financial investments will remain an important component of development cooperation. This is true both in countries with limited access to other resources, and even in priority areas or sectors in more rapidly growing countries. For many countries across the region, development cooperation is an important part of overall financing in monetary terms (see previous section) and makes important contributions to national results. Even for countries that are growing rapidly and gaining access to wider resources, financial investments from development cooperation can remain critical for some time. Transitioning away from dependency on development cooperation is an important target for many countries, but must be carefully planned and managed so as not to undermine the objectives of development cooperation (see box below, \u2018Managing the transition away from concessional financing\u2019). Supporting countries to develop knowledge and expertise in critical areas is another function of development cooperation.

This lack of capacity can stop countries accessing or effectively using financing that would otherwise be available to them, particularly LDCs.157 Development cooperation can play an important role in providing technical cooperation and supporting capacity building in countries. Facilitating knowledge sharing between countries can be a catalyst for cross-fertilizing successful solutions to common challenges and regional platforms can play a particularly important role in this. Development cooperation can also play an important regional role in supporting the provision of global or regional public goods. Supranational public goods are essential for combating issues that stretch beyond the borders of individual countries, such as climate change, infectious disease or financial crisis. Many of these issues are prominent in the SDGs and development cooperation can support them at the regional level.

Many governments and development cooperation providers see a growing role for blended finance as a mechanism that has the potential to leverage results on a significant scale with comparatively small input from official resources. Public-private partnerships (PPP), one of the key blended finance instruments,159 feature prominently in many existing financing strategies. In the Philippines, the PPP framework is a key part of the country\u2019s infrastructure financing strategy, and envisages an important role for development cooperation providers (see chapter 4). Through mechanisms that reduce the risk (or perceived risk) to private investors, blended finance mechanisms can help encourage higher levels of investment. As international actors themselves, development cooperation providers may be able to support countries in mobilizing foreign investment, as well as stimulating domestic private sector growth. In countries across the region, such as Lao PDR, where SSC providers are also important investors in sectors such as energy generation or other infrastructure, there are opportunities to work with these providers in leveraging investment.160 Importantly, the role of development cooperation is not just to leverage additional financing, but to leverage \u2018development additionality\u2019 from these private investments. This makes the important link between financing and results, and should have a bearing on both the types of investments leveraged and the way they are made. Providers of development cooperation can support countries to mobilize and stimulate private investment in key sectors, thematic areas and regions in the country where those investments can make an important contribution to results. And by partnering with private actors, development cooperation providers can also influence the way those investments are made, so that operating models are designed in a way to impact positively on sustainable development results. The international community can also play an important role in supporting countries as they increase domestic revenue mobilization. International actors impact the revenues that governments collect through a number of avenues. Policies toward tax havens and international trade regulations have a critical bearing on the way that multinational businesses operate and the taxes they pay. Direct support to the institutions responsible for revenue mobilization, through technical cooperation, sharing of technology and best practices, can also play a role in expanding and strengthening tax systems. Development cooperation providers have recently committed to double the support they provide, through the Addis Tax Initiative.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e2e8ca6-5f5f-4b11-b0de-9723e7d428a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e2e8ca6-5f5f-4b11-b0de-9723e7d428a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "717b58d4a0d86f059be94ea9287c1d6cd23553f599000fbda8d44c724407277f"}, "2": {"node_id": "0a3b6d30-21e7-453d-b8fa-9edfa7a97480", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a583c69131cb7a5e7af13d25febd93efaad2f0843911a0bf782536a26518df51"}}, "hash": "f10c7405f13d8b6eb5a9b715b11990974d45d43305c1d5df495797a9dc3f714f", "text": "Afghanistan, Bangladesh and the Philippines are among the countries currently receiving the largest amounts of this type of assistance.161 Supporting institutional development With a greater emphasis on country-led development, there is increased priority on the role and responsibility of the international community to support institutional development.

International actors need to report on results through their corporate systems in a way that is not always easily compatible with national monitoring systems, for example because donor results are aggregated across countries to report on global impact. This can create a tension between using national monitoring and evaluation systems in a way that would Managing the transition away from concessional financing One key challenge that many low-income and LDCs in the region are likely to face is reduced access to concessional finance as they graduate162 from these groups. Two countries, the Maldives and Samoa, graduated from the LDC grouping in 2015 and seven will be considered for graduation in 2018.163 Taking a longer-term view on the role of development cooperation can help countries manage this transition as they graduate from LIC or LDC status. Many concessional financing windows, in both multilateral and bilateral institutions, currently use the LDC and LIC groupings as a key determinant of eligibility for financing. While many countries have had access to a wider range of financing by the time they have graduated from these groups in the past, the transition can nonetheless result in financing gaps with significant impacts on sustainable development results. Social sectors such as health and education, where development cooperation plays an important role in LICs and LDCs, are particularly vulnerable. This is because less concessional forms of financing are more difficult to use in these sectors, which do not yield the direct commercial returns in the short run that are needed to repay non-concessional financing. Longer-term public investments can also suffer, as development cooperation finances a high proportion of capital investments made by many LDCs. In Cambodia and the Solomon Islands, for example, 34% and 21% of capital expenditure respectively was externally financed according to latest data.164 Planning in advance for reductions in concessional finance is essential if the transition is to be managed without adversely affecting results in key sectors. Engaging in forward-looking dialogue with providers of development cooperation, to share information on future financing plans and manage the way that development cooperation changes once countries have graduated, is critical. This forward planning can help countries build the domestic political will to adjust and restructure government budgets as necessary. For example, this could mean shifting funds between sectors so those investments that generate a more direct return are funded by non- concessional finance, with increased core government funding to social sectors.

It is important to find solutions to these challenges so that development cooperation providers can directly and indirectly contribute to institutional development. For monitoring and evaluation, development cooperation providers can work with governments to plan their reporting requirements and link them in with national monitoring systems. And, critically, they can work together to harmonize the underlying data sources and definitions that feed into monitoring requirements at the national and donor level (see chapter 6). Monitoring development effectiveness The roles for development cooperation discussed above: meeting its comparative advantage, leveraging and catalysing other flows to achieve impact, and supporting institutional development, are three key ways that it can work within and strengthen countries\u2019 financing frameworks. Some aspects of these roles are assessed in the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (GPEDC) monitoring framework. Now in its second round,165 the GPEDC monitoring framework tracks progress in implementing four principles of effective development cooperation: ownership, focus on results, inclusive partnerships and transparency and accountability. It tracks progress in 10 areas across these principles, covering the enabling environment for civil society, public-private dialogue, transparency, systems for gender equality, the effectiveness of country institutions, the alignment of development cooperation with national development plans, mutual accountability and the extent to which development cooperation is predictable, on budgets and untied. The monitoring framework focuses on the effectiveness of the systems, processes and cooperation that are in place, rather than the direct outcomes of those systems. As such, a number of its indicators capture information about country financing frameworks and the way development cooperation is working within them. This section presents the findings from relevant indicators about the way development cooperation works within country financing frameworks (see box below, \u2018What the GPEDC monitoring framework tells us about countries\u2019 financing frameworks\u2019). Alignment with national development objectives One of the core principles of country financing frameworks is that the more aligned actors are around a core, common set of results, the more effective their activities will be in realizing those results in practice. Indicator 1 of the GPEDC monitoring framework tracks the extent to which development cooperation providers use the results frameworks of the countries they are working in. The measures in this indicator give insights into aspects of current alignment between development cooperation and the results articulated through countries\u2019 existing results frameworks. In the 26 Asia-Pacific countries that participated in the survey scores are, on average,166 on par with or above other developing countries (Figure 5.6).

The results from Asia-Pacific countries are on average higher across all four areas than countries outside the region (Figure 5.8). On average providers use financial reporting systems more than other country systems, though with just over 51% of disbursements flowing through countries\u2019 systems on average, overall use of systems remains low.170 Mutual accountability The monitoring framework captures information on five aspects of mutual accountability, ranging from whether there is an aid policy or partnership policy that defines priorities for development cooperation, to whether there has been an assessment of results against targets and if so, if the findings were made public. The monitoring framework considers the mutual accountability indicator to have been met if four of the five criteria are satisfied. Overall, mutual accountability criteria were met in less than 40% of Asia- Pacific countries (9 of 24) surveyed, compared to 49% of countries outside the region.

The survey gathers information on the state of public-private dialogue, whether policies are in place for collaborating with development cooperation providers, whether there are systems for gender budgeting, and the enabling environment for civil society. The state of public-private dialogue Strong public-private dialogue is critical for developing the trust necessary to partner with and mobilize resources from private sector actors. The GPEDC monitoring framework gives some insight into the state of public dialogue, for example by asking respondents to score the readiness and willingness of the public and private sectors to engage with each other (Figure 5.10). These are subjective scores articulated by survey respondents, but can give an indication of the general context and perceptions of willingness to engage and collaborate. Interestingly, private sector readiness to engage appears to be higher on the whole than public sector willingness. Of the 14 countries in the region that responded to these questions, the private sector is perceived to be more ready and willing to engage than the public sector in nine. Only in Fiji is the government perceived to be the party more ready to engage in dialogue. This suggests that in many countries the private sector may be receptive to engaging with government as it develops more active policy toward private finance. National aid policies and targets Articulating a clear role for development cooperation in a country\u2019s national financing framework is essential for ensuring that it meets its comparative advantages. Many countries articulate this role in a national aid policy: of the 24 countries that responded to the GPEDC survey, 19 have such a policy in place. Objectives for development cooperation in the country context can be strengthened further with specific targets for effective cooperation and government. Of the 24 Asia-Pacific countries that took part in the GPEDC survey, 20 have specific targets in place for both the government and providers of development cooperation. Gender equality Gender equality is a central feature of the sustainable development goals and of many countries\u2019 national development plans. As an issue that cuts across a wide range of policy areas, it is important for governments to have the systems in place to design, manage and track their policies toward gender equality. While some countries in the region have such systems in place to track policy toward gender equality (Figure 5.11), many do not.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "786fc92b-a3c6-4b4e-ad75-d0cd05b7134a": {"__data__": {"id_": "786fc92b-a3c6-4b4e-ad75-d0cd05b7134a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d27531aac14bc99c3dc3c690aeac109b3235c055be33f4ab1cfae6ab49c526c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "eafd3f70-66df-4a8f-a54f-a922f59cca24", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6bb297459cf1726e460eb25c70aa94e5ac34cc0a8d0173852f6da8823f20fdc"}}, "hash": "f585592d1f65b229b7494542662bf237890c24b1a12ab8d9bff37b5608a564b9", "text": "Only 7 of 22 countries systematically track allocations for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, for example.

Three particular roles for development cooperation stand out in the integrated national financing framework: meeting its comparative advantage, leveraging and catalysing other flows to achieve results, and supporting institutional development (see previous sections in this chapter). The extent to which development cooperation is aligned to national results frameworks goes part way to capturing whether it is meeting its comparative advantage. Agreed objectives and results for development cooperation are built on a shared understanding between government and development cooperation providers about the priority areas for development cooperation to invest in and the results it should target. Yet there is a dimension above the project level that is absent from the monitoring framework. This considers the extent to which providers are investing across all their projects in line with the vision of their comparative advantages with respect to other resources. Support by development cooperation toward institutional development is partially captured by the monitoring framework. The indicators that relate to the use of country systems\u2014budgeting, financial reporting, audit, procurement and even monitoring and evaluation systems (a component of indicator 1)\u2014go part way to tracking the indirect impact of donor operating models on institutional development. Where use of country systems is high, the assumption is that development cooperation providers\u2019 use of those systems reinforces and strengthens them. Where it is low, developing parallel systems can undermine country systems and even draw capacity away from government\u2019s focus on its systems by requiring departments that receive development cooperation to report through multiple processes. Direct support for institutional development is not well captured by the monitoring framework, however, and it is possible that the methodology even excludes many relevant projects from its tracking of alignment in objectives and results. The monitoring framework only assesses the alignment of new projects exceeding $1 million in value. This may be appropriate for projects in which the key provision is financing, but less appropriate for those that focus on factors such as capacity building or technical cooperation, as they are typically much smaller in value. For example, the Addis Tax Initiative was launched at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa in 2015, to stimulate growth in technical support for countries in increasing their tax revenues. Initial analysis shows that existing aid for domestic revenue mobilization projects are small (the average project size is under $400,000) yet the knowledge and capacity they provide can have a significant impact.171 The alignment and impact on institutional development of most of these projects, as well as similar scale projects in other capacity or knowledge-focused areas, would therefore not be assessed by the monitoring framework. Finally, the extent to which development cooperation catalyses and leverages other flows to achieve results is not captured by the monitoring framework. Developing countries and development cooperation providers alike see this as an increasingly important component of the role of development cooperation\u2014both to leverage additional financing, and to influence business models to enhance their impact on development results. These components are not currently monitored by the framework, though blended finance has been identified as an important dimension that may be incorporated as the framework evolves. 171.

Ambitions for achieving results across the sustainable development agenda are high and levels of financing must be commensurate with those ambitions if they are to be realized. The challenge is not only to mobilize more financing but to maximize efficiency and leverage the varied contributions that all types of financing, public and private, domestic and international, can make. To address these challenges governments are developing more integrated, holistic financing frameworks: the policies and institutional structures they use to manage their approach to making, mobilizing and harnessing financing to achieve the results targeted in their national development plans. Governments across the region are strengthening the frameworks they have in place to mobilize and maximize the returns to financing, in order to achieve sustainable development results. This chapter looks across the financing frameworks that countries have in place, and are developing, to draw out the key principles behind them. It draws on evidence from the development finance assessments (DFAs) undertaken in countries across the Asia-Pacific region. The DFA exercise analyzes the strengths and limitations of existing frameworks and helps countries develop a roadmap toward establishing stronger financing frameworks (see box below, \u2018The strategic financing policy\u2019). The key principles of countries\u2019 financing frameworks are woven together to develop the concept of an integrated national financing framework. This can be understood as a system of policies and institutional structures that can help governments to develop and deliver a strategic, holistic approach to managing financing for nationally-owned sustainable development strategies. This concept, which was called for in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, is explored for the first time in detail here. This concept of an integrated national financing framework outlines a structure that can help governments take a strategic, holistic perspective on the investments needed to achieve the results they are targeting. Integrated national financing frameworks: a conceptual model The aim of an integrated national financing framework is to provide a structure for governments to form and implement a strategic, holistic, results-driven approach to financing their development objectives. Such a system can help governments develop a strategy for mobilizing resources commensurate in scale and in a manner consistent with the results they are aiming for. It can provide clarity on the roles that all actors\u2014public and private, domestic and international\u2014are best placed to play in contributing to that vision. And it can determine the roles and responsibilities for different actors in government for mobilizing and fostering investments. In short, an integrated national financing framework can help countries set a strategy to effectively mobilize the investments they need, and provide a structure that supports coherence across government in channelling resources to the areas they are most suited. Evidence from country financing frameworks in the region points to six building blocks that form the basis of the integrated national financing framework: 1. Leadership that facilitates institutional coherence 2. A clear vision for results 3. An overarching strategic financing policy 4. Financing policies for specific flows 5. Integrated monitoring, evaluation and learning 6. An enabling environment for accountability and dialogue These building blocks and the country experiences they are drawn from are explored in detail in this chapter. FIGURE 6.1 The building blocks of an integrated national financing framework for delivering national development priorities and the SDGs Note: This figure also appears in Chapter 2 as Figure 2.1. 1. Leadership that facilitates institutional coherence Leadership that provides direction and facilitates institutional coherence is essential to bring a government together and establish mechanisms for aligning policy around a shared vision. Experience from across the region highlights the importance of the level at which a financing framework is driven from within government, and the strength of mechanisms to ensure alignment. The extent to which a government can work to mobilize financing in an aligned, complementary manner is largely determined by the political importance of the systems designed to achieve this alignment. To be fully effective, the financing framework requires leadership from a senior level, in order to develop and build shared ownership around a vision for results and to convene government ministries and agencies from all levels of the administration to determine their roles and functions in delivering a strategic financing policy.

In key sectors such as education or basic healthcare, and more generally in federated systems of government, subnational levels of administration play a pivotal role in mobilizing resources, making investments and developing partnerships. Indonesia has developed a process known as \u2018Musrenbang\u2019 for coordinated, consultative planning across central and local government that brings together top-down and bottom-up thinking (see chapter 3). As policies and budgets are developed, refreshed and monitored many countries use a senior-level review and sign- off process to build alignment in practice. The institutional arrangements for such mechanisms vary from country to country but typically involve some kind of senior- level system for checking alignment as policies, budgets and reviews of progress are undertaken. In the Philippines the annual development budget is scrutinized by two cabinet- level committees to ensure there are clear linkages between the proposed outputs and the desired results of the medium-term vision document, the Philippine Development Plan. The President is Chair of one of these committees and of the National Economic and Development Authority responsible for the Philippine Development Plan, ensuring that these processes have strong political drive. In an integrated national financing framework, reviews of policy, budgets and progress would evaluate each financing policy area against the overarching vision for results and strategic financing policy (see box below, \u2018The strategic financing policy\u2019). Critically, the mechanism would also evaluate against other financing policies, to identify synergies, address contradictions and examine trade-offs between interconnected issues. 2. A clear vision for results Having a clear vision for the development path that a country wants to follow is the foundation of an efficient, results-driven financing framework. Countries\u2019 visions for results, which are typically articulated in a national development plan, outline the aspirations for where they want to be over the medium and long term. They determine the sustainable development outcomes and impact that the country aims to realize.

These visions are typically articulated in a long-term national plan or strategy, which is usually managed by a planning authority. In recent years a number of countries have developed new long-term visions. Papua New Guinea established Vision 2050 in 2009 which, with a 40-year outlook is one of the most forward-looking plans in the region. Countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, Tonga and Mongolia\u2014which recently launched its 2030 Sustainable Development Vision, have established plans with a 10 to 20-year timeframe. Others such as Lao PDR are in the process of establishing a long-term vision. This long-term vision for results provides a foundation on which more detailed plans can be developed. Many countries develop medium-term operational plans that link directly to the themes and results of the long-term vision, and develop specific objectives and more detailed indicators to drive progress toward longer-term goals. In the Solomon Islands, the National Development Strategy sets aspirations over a 10-year period (the current strategy covers 2011 to 2020), which are broken down for the medium term in macroeconomic planning and provincial and sectoral plans. These are then operationalized through the four-year medium term expenditure framework, provincial plans, sector plans and the development budget.173 In Myanmar the National Comprehensive Development Plan 2011\u20132031 is designed to encompass four five-year plans. A medium-term Framework for Economic and Social Reforms outlines key policy priorities and \u2018quick wins\u2019 and acts as a bridge between longer-term plans and the regional and sector plans that feed into the five-year plans.174 Other countries in the region, such as Samoa, which do not currently have a 173.

This will enable government and stakeholders across the board to monitor progress against the international commitments the country has made, help facilitate priority partnerships with international actors (for whom international commitments are a key focus), and provide a basis for reporting to international forums such as the High- Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.177 A number of countries including Bhutan178 are using rapid integrated assessments to understand the linkages between their plans and Agenda 2030. 3. An overarching strategic financing policy Developing an overarching strategic financing policy that estimates costs and the scale and types of financing needed to achieve results can be a foundation for clearer objectives in relation to each type of finance. Most countries have developed a vision about the results they want to achieve over the medium to long term, yet this is often only linked to financing over the short to medium term in operational policies such as a medium-term expenditure framework or five-year plan. There are key gaps in many countries\u2019 planning systems: a lack of long-term costed estimates of the scale of financing needed, and a lack of clarity about which types of financing are best placed to make the investments to achieve the vision for results. For many countries, the policies that are in place for mobilizing and fostering investments are based on an assessment of the resources that are likely to be available given the current context, often based on a projection of recent trends into the future. They also typically only cover a 3 to 5 year time period, leaving a gap between the timeframe for the vision for results and plans for mobilizing finance. Some countries, such as Bangladesh and the Philippines, are taking steps to estimate longer-term financing needs and articulate clearer roles for different types of financing. In Bangladesh, the \u2018Perspective Plan of Bangladesh\u2019,179 presents a roadmap outlining the broad approach for financing the country\u2019s long-term plan, Vision 2021 (which was developed in 2010).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "630bde54-8669-4ba7-b38f-ba0b6b182298": {"__data__": {"id_": "630bde54-8669-4ba7-b38f-ba0b6b182298", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "483ec4296a1a08ff316f20bbb47da7c5c1decb8c369b8dbaeecf276206583806"}, "2": {"node_id": "af35d1ca-152f-4e0f-b4e1-d02f4dd6ff04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d0a1750c70b67135a144535f32dc93bbedd5021159db88942c4ce37a21a5f5bf"}}, "hash": "bb83dc6ad70c68ca72b5e73f8fb859cfe1d37e5ffd0feaa04072b4fea41e6bee", "text": "The plan includes guidance on the approach to be taken by the government on financing.

For example the Perspective Plan sets a target for increasing the contribution of direct tax from 25% to 40% of total tax revenue and outlines broad strategies, such as modernizing the tax administration, moving to computerized systems and accounts-based auditing, which can be implemented to make this happen. 181. The targets include, for example, raising total revenue from 10.7% of GDP to 16.1% by 2020 and increasing FDI by $9.6 billion by 2020.The plan sets a target to be 78% funded by private investment. 182. Bangladesh\u2019s Development Finance Assessment presents recommendations for strengthening other aspects of its financing system in working toward an integrated national financing framework. It focuses on the need to strengthen the quality of the budget; to improve the efficiency of spending and alignment with national priorities; to deepen domestic resource mobilization (with attention to the economic, social and environmental impact of doing so); and steps needed for greater leverage of private resources behind national development priorities.

In this way Bangladesh\u2019s Perspective Plan and the financing component of the Philippines\u2019 new long-term vision, AmBisyon 2040, provide longer-term direction on financing for each government to work toward as it develops shorter-term policy related to each specific financing or thematic area. They fulfil a number of the functions of a strategic financing policy that this report suggests countries could consider developing (see box). However, these systems are the exceptions rather than the normal practice across the region. While there are a few other countries that have developed systems that clearly articulate the roles that different resources can play, such as Lao PDR\u2019s approach to private financing (see chapter 4), most countries in the Asia- Pacific region do not currently have this type of planning process in place. These examples show the benefits of establishing a strategic financing policy that covers the same time horizon as the national development strategy. They allow an assessment of what resources are needed: what the costs are and what scale and types of investment are best placed to contribute to realize these long-term goals. This assessment can then form the foundation of longer- term planning to attract, mobilize and foster the necessary investments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae39f8b0-e971-491c-8dec-9c3ebd18a278": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae39f8b0-e971-491c-8dec-9c3ebd18a278", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "386a22747dccf866b6de77b1d01a4aa29486d710ba203c2941c931e8d3dd2a2c"}, "2": {"node_id": "0f7f78c4-69da-4516-89f7-60d56d5645e7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8116a499ddcd3dccdd31add02a6d2cc8ffcf9b1fdcfa30f6abc57013730fe745"}}, "hash": "d89614ed8a57902f849d11a3ba1cc3b9ab372c4283d2b46cf5d54d687b3d752c", "text": "It can prompt government to ask what needs to be done to elicit these sought-after investments from private and other non-state actors (see, for example, section 6 below on accountability and dialogue).

As such it should include two fundamental exercises to (1) estimate the broad costs associated with the vision for results and (2) establish a theory about the comparative strengths and roles that each actor and financing\u2014public, private, domestic and international\u2014should play in priority areas (such as sector, thematic or geographic areas). Based on these exercises the overarching strategic financing policy could articulate: \u2022 How much is needed: estimates of the costs associated with the outputs that are needed to realize the outcomes and impact envisioned by the country\u2019s vision for results, with targets for the scale of resources that needs to be invested. \u2022 How much would be sought after from each actor: broad targets covering investments that could be mobilized from all actors, including public and private actors at the domestic and international level. \u2022 How much investment this would entail in priority areas by each actor: based on the perceived comparative advantages of those actors in the country context, broad targets for investments from specific actors in each sector, thematic, geographic or other priority area from the vision for results. \u2022 What the government needs to do to elicit the sought-after contribution of all these actors to foster the right incentives and policy environment for their cooperation. A policy process of this kind can become the basis for the departments and agencies in government to understand their own roles and objectives in financing more clearly. Like in Bangladesh, it would form the foundation for short to medium-term operational plans. The critical point of this policy process, which would be new for many countries, is not creating a new document, but moving to an approach rooted in a longer-term perspective on the costs and types of investments needed. The actors whose contributions it seeks to mobilize would need to participate. It would be an iterative process reviewed and updated periodically based on actual progress and revised estimates of costs. And the policy itself could be contained as a prominent part of the national development strategy or as a related policy document. 183. At the time of writing, AmBisyon 2040 was in the latter stages of being finalized but had not yet been published. 4. Specific financing policies Building on a strategic financing policy, policies for each type of financing can guide the way resources are mobilized and harnessed to achieve results. Governments across the Asia- Pacific region aim to harness the contributions of a wide range of resources to meet the diverse challenges of an interconnected sustainable development agenda. Public finance, development cooperation, philanthropic finance, remittances, commercial investments and other resources all have unique characteristics and can play differentiated and complementary roles in achieving results. Realizing this will require approaches that encourage resource mobilization according to the comparative advantages of each flow and build on the synergies between different types of financing. Governments have varying degrees of influence over different types of financing (Figure 6.2). Public finance is wholly controlled by government, albeit with competing interests within government and complexities around coordinating various levels of administration. In partnerships with development cooperation providers or private actors, the government has direct influence but not full control. And the government has no direct involvement with private investments but can indirectly incentivize the way financing is used. In all areas of financing there are multiple departments and agencies in government that are involved in mobilizing or using the financing, or impacted by the way it is invested and the results it achieves. There are also interlinkages and synergies between policies toward different types of financing that impact on the same results areas. For example, poverty reduction targets can be influenced by the types of taxes a government raises, by the quality and coverage of its social protection spending, by development cooperation provider programming and by the number and quality of jobs created. The way government manages this complexity, and the strength of the linkages between policymaking in specific areas of financing and overarching plans, will have a significant bearing on the volumes and types of financing mobilized and the ultimate results achieved. Domestic public finance Domestic public finance is, in most contexts, the central driving force to realize the vision for results.

Strong alignment between domestic public finance and results is essential, both because its central to financing overall and because of the demonstration effects to other actors. If a government cannot successfully align its own models of resource mobilization and investment to results then it will struggle to persuade other actors to do so. Revenue mobilization strategies are important for providing government with the financing needed to enact the budget, deliver public services and make investments to underscore long-term sustainable development. The scale of revenue mobilized is therefore very important, and many countries set targets for increasing revenue over time. Yet the model by which revenues are raised is also a critical contributor toward results, as differing systems of taxation can have very different distributional impacts and can be major determinants to the success or otherwise of targeted results in areas such as poverty reduction and gender equality. There are potential gaps in tax administrations across the region as planning frameworks do not typically extend beyond the current or upcoming fiscal year,184 meaning it is more challenging to make any necessary structural changes to tax structures.

The systems that governments have in place for budgeting, for linking budgets to national planning, and for monitoring the performance and results generated from budgetary expenditure, are very important. Evidence from the Development Finance Assessments shows that in many countries the systems currently in place lack strong integration between the vision for results and budgeting. Recommendations for many countries include consolidating results-based financing approaches, introducing programme-based budgeting and strengthening national and sector plans.186 International public finance National aid or development cooperation policies provide a framework for coordination between government and development cooperation providers: DAC donors, providers of SSC, and multilateral, international and regional institutions. Such policies and their related forums and country results frameworks are vital mechanisms for aligning the investments made by development 185.

Domestic and international private finance Domestic private finance is the largest source of financing across the region (see chapter 1) and has the potential to contribute significantly in many results areas. However, a government can only exert indirect influence over this type of financing, as well as international private finance, through the environment it creates for the private sector to grow and the policies and services it provides. There are a wide range of government policies that affect different aspects of the business environment, from headline policies such as economic development or industrial development strategies, to those covering more specific areas such as access to credit, infrastructure and skills development. The policy and institutional structure governing private sector development varies considerably from country to country, but in all there is a complex web of interrelated policies and numerous agencies at the national and subnational levels. Evidence suggests that coordinating and aligning the policies that influence the business environment and overarching results planning is a challenge for many countries in the region (see Chapter 4). Remittances are an important source of finance for a number of countries in the region with large overseas diasporas, such as Bangladesh, the Philippines and Afghanistan. While there may be limited opportunities to directly harness these and influence the way they contribute toward sustainable development results, they can play an important role in financing household consumption and investments in housing, health, education and similar areas.188 Some countries are deploying strategies to engage the diaspora more directly in development. Bangladesh, for example, has enacted a range of measures such as allowing Bangladeshis overseas a 10% quota in initial public offerings of local companies. In the Philippines, the Commission of Filipino Overseas has a longstanding programme to channel donations from the diaspora to finance development projects identified by local government or NGOs.189 5. Integrated monitoring, evaluation and learning frameworks The strength of systems for monitoring, evaluation and learning has an important bearing on the extent to which financing policies can be effectively managed to achieve desired results. If a government does not have a holistic view of all investments being made or that could be elicited, and the impact of those investments toward the results targeted in the vision and strategic and specific financing policies, they cannot effectively develop or refine policies for managing finance or take the steps to elicit those contributions. Strong monitoring, evaluation and learning frameworks which link government action with investments mobilized and outcomes, evaluate results and feedback into policy development are essential for managing financing to achieve the results targeted. Countries across the Asia-Pacific region have widely varying systems for monitoring, evaluation and learning and for linking the monitoring of financing to progress in achieving results. In some countries, systems focus on monitoring outputs while others have results-oriented190 systems in place. Systems for ensuring coordination across government ministries vary between countries. In Vanuatu monitoring of progress is understood as a shared responsibility, with information collated by a central monitoring and evaluation unit that publishes an annual development report.191 The Status of National Evaluation Policies Mapping Report 2015 found that, of 13 Asia-Pacific countries covered, 10 had evaluation systems that are developing, two had evolving systems and one had a semi- formalized system.192 A number of countries, including the Philippines, have taken steps to strengthen the results focus of monitoring, evaluation and learning frameworks, to underscore more impactful policymaking. As part of the Philippine Development Plan 2011\u20132016, the Filipino government has introduced results matrices to monitor progress and provide a results-based management approach to implementing development plans. These focus on achieving the outcomes and impacts from the Plan, which presents the medium-term vision for the country. The framework is designed to also align with other key government policies including the Public Investment Program and President\u2019s \u2018Social Contract with the Filipino People\u2019.193 The results matrices are monitored at a number of levels linked together in a hierarchical structure. At the highest level the framework looks at progress toward the overall societal goal: \u2018Poverty reduction in multiple dimensions and massive creation of quality employment\u2019, tracking five indicators related to poverty and employment. Below this sit two intermediate goals related to rapid economic growth and equal development opportunities.

Building on this type of results- based management model, monitoring, evaluation and learning in an integrated national financing framework could follow a hierarchical model that links financing mobilized with outcomes and results. The critical feature in a results-oriented financing framework is the ability to understand how interventions generate and contribute to results. This could mean, for example, establishing indicators at four levels. At the output level government actions to mobilize resources would be monitored. For example, this could assess the quality of public-private dialogue or the impact of government policy on the business environment. A second level would monitor investment outputs, measuring the scale of resources mobilized, for example monitoring growth in SMEs in key sectors such as agriculture. The outcomes that those investments generate would be monitored at the third level, for example the number and quality of jobs created by agricultural SMEs. These second and third levels would align to the targets of the strategic and specific financing policies. Progress toward the results targeted in the vision for results, for example progress in poverty reduction, would be monitored at the fourth level. With sufficient disaggregation and harmonization in the data collected at each level, the monitoring system could build a picture of the links between these levels\u2014the outcomes that investments generate, and their contribution to meeting headline 190.

Understanding the way progress happens at each of these levels and the links between them is a strong basis for countries to learn what works and increase the efficiency and impact of policymaking. The way data are collected, understood and used is critical. The quality of information from monitoring, evaluation and learning systems can only ever be as good as the data collection systems on which they are based. While this presents challenges in resource-constrained contexts, there are also opportunities in many countries to draw from under-used data sources such as the administrative data collected by government agencies. Data for effective monitoring must also be harmonized, particularly in a multi-stakeholder environment. Harmonizing the way data are defined and joined-up can support more effective collaboration between diverse partners by helping them overcome the varying terminology, standards and definitions public and private actors often use to approach similar topics. 6. An enabling environment for accountability and dialogue The actors who could provide the wider forms of development finance that countries seek to mobilize are unlikely to do so unless they are confident in the targets set, find the role allocated to them attractive, and have trust in the process. The level of ambition for results, alongside changes in the financing landscape, is driving countries to seek new sources of development finance, including domestic and international private sector investment and philanthropy.

To ensure realism regarding the contributions of all actors outside government, and build shared ownership, it is important that there is full transparency of the development plans and assessments of the resource needs for them. It is also important that planning processes include consultation with those actors and opportunities for them to participate in the deliberative processes. This would ensure the frameworks are more realistic and also, by ensuring they have some ownership of the plans developed, heighten the likelihood that they contribute. To maintain that spirit of cooperation and confidence, it is necessary to continue the participatory approach during implementation, allowing non-state actors to identify possible improvements, barriers experienced in realizing their contributions and ways of addressing them, and government measures that would afford a more enabling environment for their cooperation. To maintain their trust in the process it is essential that the monitoring and evaluation mechanisms are rigorous, objective and used to elicit the changes that are called for. This again requires their involvement in framing the approach and for sufficiently independent third parties to play key roles in monitoring and evaluation, including \u2013 especially for decentralized service delivery and poverty reduction programmes \u2013 community monitoring of public expenditures. The findings from monitoring and evaluation processes, as well as citizens\u2019 experience of the programmes financed, must be used rigorously by state oversight institutions and made readily available to others to heighten the accountability in SDG programmes. This again requires a commitment to transparency, engagement with non-state actors, and an enabling environment for citizen-led accountability mechanisms. In the Philippines, for example, a national NGO working with community groups tracked the production of school textbooks to identify where there was malpractice or inefficiency in their printing and distribution. This discovered losses of 40% of the books and massive delays, but with these findings the process was changed, procurement was strengthened and now there are minimal losses, delivery times are a whole year quicker and the per-book cost has fallen by 55%. While initially sceptical that this was any more than a \u2018government-bashing\u2019 exercise, the Department of Education quickly saw the potential benefits and came to be a strong advocate for such citizen monitoring. The department now cooperates strongly with NGOs in the \u2018Check my school\u2019 initiative in which pupils, parents and others can prove all aspects of spending and service delivery. Experiences such as these have led to a flourishing social accountability industry in which citizens use a variety of tools to Harmonizing data As governments aim to collaborate with and influence increasingly diverse actors to implement their financing strategy, so the need for a common understanding of the objectives, indicators and definitions used is amplified. The example in Figure 6.3 shows the complexity in understanding the definitions used in existing parallel systems. Each column captures the definitions used in a different system mapping, from left to right, definitions for categorizing: international public finance (OECD definitions), Bangladeshi government spending, outcomes from the national results framework, and SDG indicators. The lines between each column show how they relate to one another, and how complex those relationships are. It highlights how, without harmonizing definitions, even simple questions about, for example, comparing the contribution of different types of finance toward results in a specific area, become very challenging to answer. Linking data has historically been done on paper per analysis, demand and organization and has hence rarely been reused or updated. More sustainable solutions include data dictionaries that hold centralized metadata information on definitions, meanings and relationships to other data sources. Data dictionaries would allow the scope for all data that will be collected across a government to be determined and set. They have been commonly used by international organizations such as the World Health Organization, the International Labour Organization and the World Bank to organize data collected per country (such as data collected through surveys). However, Uganda is an example of data dictionary which was introduced by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics to increase the usability of national data. Since 2010, the office has been maintaining a national statistical indicators metadata dictionary, which includes definitions, standard classifications, units of measure, disaggregation, compilation practices, sources of data, computation methods, periodicity of production and comments. Ideally the metadata dictionaries supporting integrated national financing frameworks would also include the relationships to other data sources.

In aggregate this provides rich data to supplement official monitoring and accountability instruments. For example, NGOs in India have shown that a high proportion of food distributed in the government\u2019s \u2018fair price shops\u2019, intended for poor people was either sold in the market or went to people who were not poor. This monitoring, coupled with NGO advocacy with local officials, has led to much reduced losses and better targeting. In Karnataka, for example, one survey concluded that the benefits to the state\u2019s poor amounted to $52 per family, without adding to the cost of the scheme. Civil society can similarly contribute to enhancing accountability at the national level, especially by monitoring government procurement: mis- procurement is estimated to cost developing countries 2.5 to 3.3% of GDP.195 NGOs in many countries have worked with governments to insert \u2018Integrity Pacts\u2019 into major public sector procurements; firms bidding must agree to openness (subject to reasonable commercial confidentiality) and allow civil society monitoring. In Pakistan, monitoring the bidding led to an estimated $10m saving in the Greater Karachi Water Supply project, which was completed ahead of schedule. A holistic approach to strengthening accountability, entailing improvements in state oversight bodies and encouraging civil society monitoring, is vital for ensuring that resources mobilized are efficiently directed to their intended uses. This requires strong transparency of development plans, budget allocations, expenditures, procurement rules and processes used. It also requires welcoming civil society and the private sector into deliberative processes (setting plans, budgets and drawing up programmes) and ensuring an enabling environment for them to act freely in monitoring state programmes and empowering communities to voice their concerns. Establishing an integrated national financing framework in practice Together these six building blocks present a conceptual model of an integrated national financing framework. This builds on the strengths of the financing frameworks that countries in the Asia-Pacific region have in place, yet the framework as a whole is an ambitious concept. For many countries, some of these building blocks are a number of steps beyond the frameworks they currently have in place. The concept of an integrated national financing framework is useful as a prompt and a guide for countries to assess the status of their financing frameworks overall and prioritize change. One of the unique features of the integrated national financing framework is its comprehensiveness, and this concept can therefore act as a prompt for policymakers to take a holistic view of their financing frameworks. In this way it is complementary to existing processes and initiatives that support improvements in particular aspects of a financing framework. It may well be unrealistic for countries to move from existing systems to one that functions like the building blocks outlined above in a short period of time.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51b0037f-c126-4b15-9959-7cb8119aec46": {"__data__": {"id_": "51b0037f-c126-4b15-9959-7cb8119aec46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0dee3a824f7c2b7fd11d641dc11446dea26878909502ae9c2c81ac36f07df740"}, "2": {"node_id": "a59103cd-83ef-432c-a230-ddb002e7c41f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "13b549a60c6c01868a346ca4a5498c032bdfd45914824f9ebf6d9e89c73f5e59"}}, "hash": "5a1812d1a3eb456b160772d5f84665bef6462295f7bd8ed8fdba766af0c7e3ce", "text": "Nevertheless, the concept can prompt countries to examine their financing frameworks overall, think about the strengths, weaknesses and gaps, and determine which aspects and building blocks", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c1a765c1-94f4-435d-bf36-3fec8ea67381": {"__data__": {"id_": "c1a765c1-94f4-435d-bf36-3fec8ea67381", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1477e770b24511ad2254f8e42711679ba52179bc726e883d7a0e36f77b36eb31"}, "3": {"node_id": "4ecb683c-e174-4ba7-b6c7-13ba713c6b76", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "86fcdc9af2e9871d04bdf041069fb961486def71c8e07a7bfcb112593ed320b7"}}, "hash": "b6f44d835026443804fda0956f34a3751df48df72f3f5cc8e125f196dd3d775d", "text": "should take priority in their context. It can help countries undertake reform in the short term that builds toward more integrated, holistic, effective systems over the long term. Indeed, a number of countries in the region are already using the concept to prompt this thinking (see box). Political leadership and champions from a senior level in government are essential for driving reform. Institutional and policy reform often takes an extended period of time and requires the buy-in of many stakeholders. The opportunities for reform may be infrequent, for example around major political moments such as a change in administration, response to crisis, or renewal of key policies such as a national development plan or five year plan. There may also be opportunities to reform components of the system related to particular flows or thematic areas (see below). With the need for significant political capital to drive change and infrequent opportunities to undertake reform, it is pertinent to consider how to sequence reforms, and whether certain building blocks are higher priority than others. Prioritization and sequencing should be determined at the country level, yet there are certain changes that can, once established, help to build momentum and strengthen systems more widely over time. The integrated national financing framework offers a concept to help countries improve the way they manage financing policy, by increasing alignment, strengthening the results focus and making systems more holistic. Setting three building blocks in particular in place\u2014the strategic financing policy, leadership and institutional coherence mechanisms, and results-oriented monitoring and evaluation systems\u2014can create the foundations for strengthening the system as a whole over the longer term, supporting continued movement toward an integrated national financing framework. 195. OECD, 2013, Implementing the OECD Principles for Integrity in Public Procurement: Progress since 2008. A number of countries are already taking steps to establish an integrated national financing framework The concept of integrated national financing, and an earlier draft of this report, were discussed by countries in the region at the 2016 Asia-Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility Conference, \u2018Linking development finance with results\u2019.196 A number of countries reported on the follow-ups from the development finance assessments they have undertaken (and which formed a key source for this report), including on the steps they are taking to move toward establishing integrated national financing frameworks. The government of Bangladesh is taking steps toward establishing an integrated national financing framework which can support its Seventh Five Year Plan.197 It has estimated the cost of the Seventh Five Year Plan and undertaken a review of resource mobilization from different sources, evaluating the status of its collaboration with relevant actors and how this collaboration needs to change. Bangladesh\u2019s Development Results Framework has been strengthened, to monitor the Seventh Five Year Plan and implementation of the SDGs. The National Policy on Development Cooperation and Joint Cooperation Strategy are in place to promote alignment with development cooperation providers, and a new Development Effectiveness Wing has been established in the Ministry of Finance to undertake research and provide policy support on ODA, climate finance, SSC and innovative finance. In Cambodia, the findings from the development finance assessment are prompting the government to look at strengthening the integration of planning, budgeting and financing frameworks in public finance.198 The government is looking at how it can build on successes in domestic revenue mobilization and is considering a new framework for development cooperation. Nepal and Thailand are considering how to take forward integrated national financing frameworks in support of the implementation of the SDGs. In Nepal a development finance assessment will help inform the government as it thinks about a roadmap for the preparation of an integrated national financing framework.199 In Thailand the government is considering how to build on progress with the BIO-FIN initiative and Climate Change Benefit Analysis to strengthen financing frameworks more widely.200 196.

The presentation is available here: http://www.asia-pacific.undp.org/content/dam/rbap/docs/ meetTheSDGs/Planning%20and%20Budgeting%20-%20Ladawan%20NESDB.pdf A strategic financing policy can help governments move toward a way of approaching financing that starts by asking what investments are needed to achieve results, and critically assessing which types of financing are best placed to make those investments. It builds a link between the vision for desired results over the long term, and shorter- term operational policymaking. Putting such a policy process in place can be a first step toward a more holistic financing framework as it prompts government institutions and their stakeholders to come together and define a view on the roles that different resources are best placed to play in financing sustainable development. As this is developed it can become a foundation for policies that are clearer about the role a specific type of financing should play, thereby enhancing overall alignment and complementarity between resources over time. Putting in place authoritative coherence mechanisms is a foundation for building closer alignment between results, financing objectives and policy. Experience demonstrates that coherence mechanisms grow iteratively through success: they may start with a narrow focus and expand their remit over time. In Nepal, gender responsive budgeting was rolled out among a selection of central government ministries in 2007/08, to align with the country\u2019s CHAPTER 6: INTEGRATED NATIONAL FINANCING FRAMEWORKS 79 80 ACHIEVING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE ERA OF THE ADDIS ABABA ACTION AGENDA poverty reduction strategy in which gender equality and inclusion formed one of the key pillars. Following the initial roll out, the gender responsive budgeting system has been expanded more widely across government, with supporting initiatives to build capacity among agencies to deliver it and plans to increase its use in aid management systems.201 The increased alignment that coherence mechanisms facilitate is vital for ensuring complementarity and avoiding duplication between different actors working on related agendas. Establishing monitoring and evaluation frameworks that are focused on results can become the foundation of a stronger results-oriented approach across government. Planning for and tracking progress in results-focused indicators from the beginning of a policy or investment is important for building the culture necessary to fully manage results-oriented financing strategies. Evidence from the development finance assessments finds that data and information are key enablers of more advanced government management systems, so establishing strong monitoring frameworks with supporting data systems can be a catalyst for long-term change.202 Even basic results-oriented monitoring can become a first step toward the more advanced frameworks that monitor the links between government actions, investment outputs and the outcomes and results those investments generate and contribute to. Alongside more comprehensive reforms, countries can leverage opportunities in particular areas of sectoral or thematic focus to build more integrated financing frameworks. Revisions to policies in key sectors or thematic areas present opportunities to align with overarching national development plans, strengthen coherence mechanisms, and enhance monitoring and evaluation frameworks. Sector or thematic initiatives at the regional or global level may also offer opportunities. For example, the UNDP Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN)203 works with 11 countries in the Asia-Pacific region on a model for addressing financing for biodiversity in a comprehensive manner. The approach brings together many key integrated national financing framework stakeholders: ministries of finance, economy, planning and environment, the private sector and others. The approach has similar building blocks to those of the integrated national financing framework: it analyzes current spending levels, resource needs, and builds a plan to fill the financing gaps.

Regional platforms play an important role in facilitating knowledge exchange and supporting countries as they undertake reform. They can help convene countries to share and discuss the challenges they face and solutions they are using to overcome those challenges. They can also actively collect and digest information to build an understanding of good practice and what works, and does not, in particular contexts. The development finance assessments (see box) can be used periodically by countries to undertake a thorough review of their financing opportunities, challenges and governance systems. These originated from a regional perspective on the financing landscape and institutional setup, and can help countries to determine and refine a roadmap for establishing an integrated national financing framework. Their methodology has recently been refined to focus more specifically on roadmaps toward an integrated national financing framework. 201.

UNDP, 2014, The BIOFIN Workbook: A Tool to Mobilize Financial Resources for Biodiversity and Development. New York: UNDP. See: www.biodiversityfinance.net Development finance assessments As an action-oriented diagnostic tool, the Development Finance Assessment (DFA) provides both the baseline and the road map for implementing reforms needed for countries to adopt integrated national financing frameworks as referred to in the AAAA. To stimulate further learning on what challenges will need to be addressed in developing these, UNDP can build on on-going discussions in several countries in the region and beyond that have embarked on a process towards localizing the SDGs, and exploring different avenues of mobilizing more resources to finance development. UNDP\u2019s Bangkok Regional Hub, in serving as the Secretariat for the Asia-Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility (AP-DEF) has been developing the DFA,204 a tool to respond to the growing demand from countries in the region to establish evidence and analysis, and introduce policy and institutional reforms for managing the increasing complexity of domestic and international sources of finance for development. DFAs were introduced as the very first development finance studies of their kind, seeking to bring together fragmented approaches on the use of the different sources of funds that may not all be primarily dedicated to address development. The DFA provides governments with data and analysis on the quality of their national development strategies/plans and country results frameworks, changing trends in development finance and their alignment with national priorities and results. It also helps formulate recommendations on how institutions and systems might be adjusted to ensure that different sources of development finance are managed within a coherent framework, which better supports the implementation of the SDGs. The findings emerging from DFAs provide useful data and analysis for discussing reforms at country level, and stimulating evidence-based dialogue and exchange among countries in the region that face similar change processes. Examples of DFA\u2019s impact in this area include: 1) the restructuring of government departments to take a more integrated approach to managing finance for development across institutions or bringing closer together the planning and budgeting processes; 2) the development of new integrated policy frameworks that seek greater coherence across external financial flows; and 3) proposals for new policy dialogue structures for governments and their partners, providing a multi-stakeholder platform that could be used to review SDG implementation. Before reform can begin it is important for governments to understand the status of their existing financing frameworks. Understanding the strengths, weaknesses and gaps of existing systems is an important foundation for guiding the priorities and roadmap for change. A roadmap would evaluate the extent to which each of the building blocks is functioning, and determine the ultimate goals of a reform initiative as well as intermediate steps for each block. A development finance assessment can help countries to do this. Governments may also wish to compile a dashboard of indicators that describe the status of components in each building block, and which can be monitored over time to help understand progress in establishing", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2054269e-ac4f-4e6b-abac-e94c5b4f3480": {"__data__": {"id_": "2054269e-ac4f-4e6b-abac-e94c5b4f3480", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f0de0d305a216cb40212d8ef7d7d599171201774fe8ac246fb19530a4449c765"}, "3": {"node_id": "5765e8c9-0a5e-4c4f-8ec4-e1bd5cf36fba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a40f8ef58f7ab742fa8e28f4bc44411899780ff7d6c0f24cc5c48e663be4855c"}}, "hash": "3a10ee3f6f626c5a523b5cb27371180d156ddc6ba8ce1895e25b4d2400a7c36c", "text": "an integrated national financing framework overall. Such a dashboard could be at least partially built on information from existing monitoring processes and surveys. Using a dashboard of indicators to understand the status of integrated national financing frameworks Establishing a dashboard of indicators that describes the status of each of the building blocks of an integrated national financing framework can help guide governments and monitor progress against planned changes. Governments that reform their financing frameworks will set out milestones to meet through the reform process. A dashboard could combine information gathered by existing monitoring processes with a simple framework of questions for the government unit overseeing the reform process to ask. This would build up a picture of the structures are in place in each building block and progress toward these milestones. The first building block, leadership and institutional coherence highlights the importance of structures that align policy and build coherence toward all areas of financing. Governments could monitor this by identifying which processes exist to ensure coherence between the long- term vision / financing strategy, and financing policies in each area, and assess their effectiveness. 204.

It could also capture whether clear long-term targets are set and how targets relate to the SDGs. Critical to this aspect of an integrated national financing framework is also the degree to which it is costed. The third building block, the strategic financing policy, could be summarized by outlining if such a document exists and whether it is a standalone document or incorporated into the long-term vision for results. A dashboard could capture whether the policy is based on an estimate of the costs of the vision for results, the extent to which it sets guiding targets or objectives for mobilising all types of financing and whether it outlines clear roles for the different types of financing it seeks to mobilize. The realism of the financing strategy should also be considered in light of trends in financial flows. A dashboard could help governments monitor the fourth building block, financing policies related to each area of finance, by outlining a comprehensive list of all policies related to each area of financing, covering all ministries and levels of administration. It could capture the extent to which these policies are grounded in the strategic financing policy and all mechanisms that exist to coordinate related policies or with external partners in each area. Existing external monitoring processes could feed in. The GPEDC monitoring framework captures information on the quality of public-private dialogue and policy toward and collaboration with development cooperation providers. It also captures information on systems for managing policy on gender equality (see box in chapter 5) which can be used to understand alignment between financing policy and overarching goals on gender. The World Bank\u2019s PEFA (Public Expenditure and Finance Accountability assessments), and Country Policy and Institutional Assessments (CPIA), each capture information on domestic public finance systems. They include indicators on the strengths and weaknesses of public financial management, efficiency of tax policy, administration and debt management, and coherence between national and sub-national administrations on the budget. The Open Budget Initiative also captures information on public financing, looking at transparency and participation in public finance processes. The World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Survey, IMF\u2019s Financial Access Survey and World Bank\u2019s Ease of Doing Business Index could be used to understand the business environment.

Finally the sixth building block, an enabling environment for accountability and dialogue, could be monitored by asking what processes exist for participation by civil society, academia, the private sector and other actors in the development, implementation and monitoring of financing policies. It could also draw on external processes such as the CIVICUS Enabling Environment Index207 to understand the environment for civil society. By drawing on these existing monitoring processes and developing a framework of simple questions, governments that undertake reform in their financing framework can create a dashboard of indicators to monitor key features within each of the building blocks of an integrated national financing framework. Such a dashboard would need to be supplemented by an understanding of the political importance of different mechanisms or effectiveness of each structure, but it could form an important foundation for doing so and for guiding government as it develops its financing framework. Building such a dashboard could also, if made public, support knowledge exchange and facilitation by highlighting the successes and challenges countries are facing. It can also form a basis for regular reporting to international monitoring processes, such as the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (all countries will report on progress against the SDGs for the first time in 2019) and Financing for Development follow-up process. 205.

CIVICUS Enabling Environment Index, http://civicus.org/eei/ Chapter 7: Recommendations Country-level recommendations This is an important moment for governments to assess their financing frameworks and consider how effectively they can shape and deliver financing policy for the future. Meeting the scale of ambition that countries have set for themselves will require holistic, long-term approaches that mobilize and maximize the impact of diverse forms of financing. This report has presented six core features of financing frameworks that countries are using to develop such approaches \u2013 these form the building blocks of an integrated national financing framework. Governments across the region can use this concept to help guide how they will refine financing frameworks to achieve sustainable development results. RECOMMENDATIONS: \ufffd Assess the financing framework that government has in place as a whole; what are its strengths, and what changes are needed to address future financing challenges? Consider undertaking a Development Finance Assessment. \ufffd Use the concept of an integrated national financing framework to help guide thinking about how to reform the policies and institutional structures in the financing framework, considering each of the building blocks: \u2022 Leadership and institutional coherence: is there buy-in and leadership of the financing framework from the highest levels of government? Are there effective mechanisms for aligning operational policies with long-term visions? \u2022 Vision for results: is there a long-term vision for the country\u2019s sustainable development path? Does it have buy-in from the whole of government and external stakeholders? Does it link to the SDGs? \u2022 Strategic financing policy: has the vision for results been costed? Is there guidance on the scale and types of financing that need to be mobilized and roles they should play over the long-term? \u2022 Specific financing policies: are policies across each area of finance\u2014public and private, domestic and international\u2014 aligned to the strategic financing policy and vision for results? \u2022 Monitoring, evaluation and learning: are systems for monitoring progress integrated across the financing framework? Are government actions linked to outcomes and impact on sustainable development? Are independent evaluations undertaken? What mechanisms exist to incorporate learning into future policy design? \u2022 Accountability and dialogue: are processes in place for systematic engagement with civil society, the private sector and other stakeholders throughout the financing framework, from objective setting, through policy design and implementation, to monitoring and evaluation? Regional recommendations Governments wishing to strengthen their financing frameworks can learn from one another by sharing experiences of reform. While contexts vary widely between countries, governments nevertheless face many common challenges. Sharing experience and knowledge about how one government has overcome these challenges can be invaluable in helping others determine the path they will follow. Regional platforms play a critical role in facilitating such knowledge exchange, building up an evidence base about what has and has not worked in different contexts, and supporting countries as they undertake reform.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a495df6-6ec2-4587-987b-1071df366a06": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a495df6-6ec2-4587-987b-1071df366a06", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "489841b160535367e1f210d646086e687943ab3b64c37f350cc2f4a5c0d0e84e"}, "2": {"node_id": "59ef1c7e-272b-4b3a-9575-c74b0baf217c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "744b62d4fddc68b5289da7a3c9a8ba8dbc56870abf0d17f8f52280e7d1360009"}}, "hash": "0f62b22c3ea69bd0fb0398a0e03676db6115f83ff7d5abd59399864b469e702e", "text": "CHAPTER 7: RECOMMENDATIONS 83 84 ACHIEVING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE ERA OF THE ADDIS ABABA ACTION AGENDA RECOMMENDATIONS: \ufffd The Asia-Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility (AP-DEF) convenes an annual regional forum for dialogue and knowledge", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "acd3cabc-9d8e-48d4-a22d-66ee96e93042": {"__data__": {"id_": "acd3cabc-9d8e-48d4-a22d-66ee96e93042", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f17d8dfcea8f9d120fbcedf14e96efde5ec2082c5fc8f954cfbcac8b1b9bf4d3"}}, "hash": "f17d8dfcea8f9d120fbcedf14e96efde5ec2082c5fc8f954cfbcac8b1b9bf4d3", "text": "sharing about financing challenges and integrated national financing frameworks. \ufffd AP-DEF continues to work with governments on Development Finance Assessments that develop roadmaps for establishing integrated national financing frameworks \ufffd AP-DEF develops a regional repository that responds to demand for evidence and analysis on financing challenges and policy and institutional reforms. \ufffd Engagement is strengthened between the Asia-Pacific region and regional platforms in other parts of the world, to share knowledge and lessons. Global recommendations The concept of integrated national financing frameworks developed in this report has important implications for financing and sustainable development processes globally. RECOMMENDATIONS: \ufffd Annual progress reviews of SDG 17 at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, and of the Financing for Development Agenda should review integrated national financing frameworks as a key enabler of nationally owned sustainable development strategies. \ufffd Countries work toward milestones in integrated national financing frameworks ahead of the 2019 High-level Political Forum, when all countries will report on overall SDG progress for the first time. Recommendations for development cooperation providers With renewed emphasis on national leadership over development policy, there is a greater need for development cooperation to support such leadership. Three key roles for development cooperation stand out: meeting its comparative advantage, leveraging other flows to achieve results and supporting institutional development. RECOMMENDATIONS: \ufffd Work with governments to define a long-term role for cooperation that identifies its added value in relation to other financing. \ufffd Consider how to support countries as they mobilize wider financing, to access new forms of finance and to influence how it is invested, maximizing sustainable development impact. \ufffd Evaluate the effect of cooperation on integrated national financing frameworks: is capacity being built up; how can national systems be used more to deliver development cooperation? Refining the integrated national financing framework concept This report has presented the first detailed examination of integrated national financing frameworks, a key concept for nationally owned implementation of sustainable development strategies. A number of governments are already taking this forward and working to establish integrated national financing frameworks. As this continues there is a need to further build and deepen the evidence base to refine the concept and support other governments that wish to strengthen their financing frameworks. RECOMMENDATIONS: \ufffd Continue building evidence about how countries are strengthening each of the building blocks of their financing frameworks. \ufffd Broaden the evidence base by drawing from a wider range of countries to help tailor the concept for different contexts. \ufffd Use a regional repository as a platform for sharing evidence. \ufffd Produce a regular report that provides an update on progress in establishing integrated national financing frameworks.

Progress calculations follow the methodology used by the UNDP; a full overview of this methodology is available on the UNDP website.208 The progress results are characterized as: Result Definition Achieved The target value was reached and maintained on or before 2015 according to real data. On track The target value is to be reached or surpassed on or before 2015 according to the trend model. Slow The target value will not be reached on or before 2015 according to the trend model, but there has been positive progress towards the target. No progress or regressing The target value will not be reached on or before 2015 according to the trend model, and there has been no or negative progress towards the target. Limited data are available for certain countries and indicators; where fewer than half of a region\u2019s constituent countries have data for a particular indicator the result is dropped. The calculations of the Gini coefficient as a measure of inequality use national income distribution data from the World Bank\u2019s PovcalNet. National cumulative distributions of income were calculated for years where data were available; from these, regional cumulative distributions of income were generated, from which Lorenz curves and subsequently Gini indices were calculated. Data cover 25 of the 36 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Financing flows data Analysis of financing flows has been undertaken from the recipient perspective, thus only including country-allocable resources. The data on financial flows that national policymakers use, and which are analyzed in the development finance assessments, are taken from a mixture of national and international sources. However, the data in this report are necessarily sourced from international sources only, to present data that can be aggregated to regional and subregional levels and compared across countries in the Asia-Pacific region.

The use of international data sources means that the most recent year for which comprehensive data are available is 2014. For international flows, only data on remittance inflows are available for 2015. For domestic finance data, country coverage from before 2005 is substantially more limited, thus any trend analysis including domestic resources begins at 2005. Domestic public finance Domestic public finance includes data on non-grant government revenues. Unless otherwise specified, all government revenue figures in the chapter exclude grants. To compare across countries, IMF Article IV publications have been used to source budget data for all countries. Comprehensive domestic finance data are not available for before 2005 (including for China), therefore all trend analyses including domestic finance data begin at 2005. 208. http://www.asia-pacific.undp.org/content/rbap/en/home/library/mdg/asia-pacific-mdg-2014-2015.html METHODOLOGY 85 86 ACHIEVING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE ERA OF THE ADDIS ABABA ACTION AGENDA Data are available for 31 of the 36 Asia-Pacific countries included in the report. Domestic finance data are not available for Cook Islands, DPR Korea, Nauru, Niue or Tokelau. Limited data are available for the Maldives, for 2011 to 2014 only. Domestic finance data for Brunei (which although not a developing country is included in analysis related to ASEAN countries) are not available for 2014. Domestic private finance The domestic private finance figures included in the report are estimates in lieu of comprehensive data on domestic private investment. Calculations are based on gross fixed capital formation data from the World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI), which are used to estimate total investment in each country. Foreign direct investment (FDI) sourced from UNCTAD, and public capital expenditure data sourced from IMF Article IV publications, are then deducted at the country level, to obtain an estimate for domestic private investment alone. Gross fixed capital formation data exclude certain types of investments such as land sales and purchases and all kinds of financial assets, and it does not make any deductions for depreciation of fixed assets. These estimates should therefore not be treated as precise facts about the domestic private investment taking place in each country, but rather estimates of the general trends and scale of this financing. Data are available for 22 of the 36 countries included in the report. Domestic private resources data are not available for Cook Islands, Kiribati, DPR Korea, Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau or Tuvalu. Data are limited for the Maldives: only 2005 data are available; and for Timor-Leste only 2005 to 2007 data are available. International public finance International public flows consist of: \u2022 official development assistance (ODA): ODA reported by all donors to the OECD DAC \u2022 other official flows (OOF): OOF data reported by all donors to the OECD DAC \u2022 public and publicly- guaranteed long-term debt (public long-term debt): lending from bilateral and multilateral institutions and private entities received or guaranteed by the state. All data are gross disbursements. Data on ODA and OOF are sourced from the OECD DAC, primarily from Table 2A and the CRS, and Table 2B and the CRS respectively. Figures on public long-term debt are calculated by subtracting data on ODA loans and OOF loans from data on public and publicly-guaranteed long-term debt (sourced from the World Bank WDI); this is done to avoid double counting. Any negatives are set to zero at the country level. Data on ODA are available for all countries. Data on OOF are not available for Niue and Tokelau.

Data on remittances are limited for Bhutan, Kiribati and Timor-Leste with no data from before 2006; and for Marshall Islands, Palau and Tuvalu there is no data from before 2005. Outflows of international finance Figure 1.4 includes data on outflows of international finance from Asia-Pacific countries. These consist of public flows (interest payments and capital repayments on ODA, OOF and public long-term debt); and private flows (outflows of profits on FDI, which represent profits of foreign firms based in the country that are remitted to their home country; outward investments of FDI; interest payments and capital repayments on private long-term debt; interest payments on short-term debt; and outflows of remittances). Data on interest payments on ODA are sourced from the OECD DAC Table 2A. Figures on capital repayments on ODA are calculated by combining data on \u2018ODA loan repayments\u2019 and \u2018recoveries\u2019 from the OECD DAC Table 2A. Data on interest payments on OOF are sourced from the OECD DAC Table 2B. Figures on capital repayments on OOF are calculated by combining data on \u2018Other Long Term Amounts Received\u2019 and \u2018Official Export Credit Amounts Received\u2019 from OECD DAC Table 2B. Figures on interest payments and capital repayments on public long- term debt are calculated by subtracting data on interest payments and capital repayments on ODA loans and OOF loans (sourced from the OECD DAC Tables 2A and 2B respectively) from data on interest and amortization on public and publicly-guaranteed long- term debt (sourced from the World Bank WDI). Data on outflows of profits on FDI and on short-term debt interest payments are sourced from the World Bank WDI. Data on outward investments of FDI are sourced from UNCTAD, similarly to that on inward investments of FDI. Data on interest payments and capital repayments on private long-term debt are sourced from World Bank WDI data on interest and amortization on private non-guaranteed long-term debt. Data on outflows of remittances are sourced from the World Bank Migration and Remittances database. South-South cooperation Given the lack of comprehensive and comparable data on SSC, this is not included with other international public flows and is instead analyzed separately to the extent possible. SSC data referenced in this report are sourced from the OECD DAC (Table 2A) for those countries that report to it: Thailand, Timor-Leste; and from national sources for China and India, though this is only available up to 2013 and does not allow for recipient-level analysis. All data are gross disbursements. Climate finance Data on climate-related ODA are taken from the OECD DAC CRS using the Rio markers for climate change adaptation and climate change mitigation. While there are known limitations to the use of these markers\u2014coverage and consistency of their use by donors reporting to the system is partial\u2014 these nevertheless provide the best available estimates of ODA that is relevant to climate change. Projects included in the estimate are both those for which climate change is a \u2018principal\u2019 policy objective and/ or those for which it is a \u2018significant\u2019 policy objective, that is, projects that have other key objectives but have been adjusted to incorporate climate change considerations. While the Rio marker for climate change mitigation was introduced in 1998, the marker for climate change adaptation was introduced in 2010, so any trend analysis based on the disaggregation of climate finance between adaptation and mitigation projects cannot go further back than 2010.

METHODOLOGY 87 88 ACHIEVING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE ERA OF THE ADDIS ABABA ACTION AGENDA Glossary Term Definition Blended finance The use of public-sector funds or guarantees to mobilize additional commercial capital for the financing of development projects. Bundle of ODA ODA is not a single, undifferentiated mass, but can be broken down to analyse the relative value of its constituent elements, and the relative shares of cash versus in-kind resource transfers (see also ODA). Civil society organizations (CSOs) Civil society organizations: non-market, non-state, voluntary, governed groups, organized to pursue shared interests. Examples include charities, community foundations (US), NGOs, faith- based organizations and unions. Climate adaptation financing Funding for interventions that aim to build the capacity to adapt to climate change, while reducing the vulnerabilities to shocks and stresses induced or exacerbated by it and their associated impacts. Concessionality/Concessional [financing and loans] Loans are concessional when lending conditions benefit the borrower compared with a loan from the market. These benefits can include longer repayment periods or grace period (before repayments have to begin), or reduced interest compared with commercial rates. Such concessions are typically provided directly by a government agency or, for a commercial loan, as a government grant to a lending bank. Lenders may accept in-kind repayments from developing countries. Domestic private finance Investments and financing from domestic sources. Domestic commercial investments, particularly from small, medium and micro enterprises, are the main focus in this report though the definition also includes domestic philanthropy, activities by NGOs and civil society, domestic remittances and household expenditure. Domestic public finance The resources mobilized and used by governments, including tax revenue (see below) and other forms of government revenue (see below). Unless specified otherwise, this excludes grants received by government from international sources. Extreme poverty Income poverty measured against the $1.90 a day (PPP$ 2011) threshold, particularly in relation to the goal of ending poverty by this definition by 2030. Foreign direct investment (FDI) A cross-border investment that acquires a lasting interest in the company (and country) being invested in. Such investments result in a 10% or greater level of ownership of or control over the asset being invested in. Gini coefficient A measure of inequality, usually of income or consumption expenditure, among individuals or households within an economy. The Gini coefficient compares how observed income distribution deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. A value of 0 represents perfect equality (everyone has the same income), while a value of 100 represents perfect inequality (one person has all the income). Government revenue The income of a government from either taxation, the use of the government\u2019s property, government owned corporations, or fees and fines. Grant Transfers made in cash, goods or services for which no repayment is required. Gross domestic product (GDP) A measure of economic output often used as an indicator of relative wellbeing. It includes only economic production (or \u2018value-added\u2019) within a territorial unit. Term Definition Illicit flows Illicit flows involve funds that are illegally earned, transferred, or used and cover all unrecorded private financial outflows that drive the accumulation of foreign assets by residents, in contravention of applicable laws and regulatory frameworks. The phenomenon is part of \"flight capital\"; money that shifts out of developing countries, usually into Western economies. International Aid Transparency Initiative The International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) is a multi-stakeholder initiative that seeks to increase the transparency of development cooperation to maximize impact on poverty. IATI has developed an open data standard, the IATI Standard, which enables a wide range of organizations to publish information on their development cooperation in a common, open, electronic format. The IATI Standard is based on publication of data at the level of individual activities\u2014projects and programmes\u2014and it provides timely, comprehensive and forward- looking management information that meets the needs of partner countries. International private finance Finance flows to countries from international private sources. This type of financing includes commercial investments such as FDI, portfolio equity and debt from private sources, as well as flows from individual or non-governmental sources, including remittances and private development assistance (see below).

See http:// www.unohrlls.org/en/ldc/164/. Loans Transfers either in cash or in kind for which the recipient incurs a legal debt. Long-term debt (private) A debt owed to a commercial bank or agency that has a maturity of more than one year. Maturity can be defined either on an original or remaining basis. Long-term debt (public) A debt owed to a bilateral government agency or a multilateral development agency that has a maturity of over one year. As well as debt arising from ODA and OOF, it includes former private sector debt that has been rescheduled by the official sector. Low income countries Low-income economies are defined as those with a GNI per capita, calculated using the World Bank Atlas method, of $1,025 or less in 2015; middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of more than $1,025 but less than $12,475; high-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $12,746 or more. Lower middle-income and upper middle-income economies are separated at a GNI per capita of $4,035. Thresholds are adjusted annually; these figures apply for 2016/17. Middle income countries (MICs) See low income countries. Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) A set of eight international development goals officially established following the UN Millennium Summit in 2000, following the adoption of the UN Millennium Declaration, to be met by 2015. The goals cover poverty and hunger, education, gender equality and empowering women, child mortality, maternal health, HIV and AIDS, malaria and other diseases, environmental sustainability, and a global partnership for development. GLOSSARY 89 90 ACHIEVING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN THE ERA OF THE ADDIS ABABA ACTION AGENDA Term Definition Non-governmental organization (NGO) Not-for-profit organizations involved in development and public fundraising activities. NGOs are characterized by their independence from government, and value-based actions that promote welfare or development. Non-grant government revenue The total amount of government revenue collected in a given year, excluding international grants for project or budget support. The exclusion of grants better reflects a government\u2019s available domestic public resources and avoids double counting of international assistance. Non-grant revenue includes both tax (e.g. income and VAT) and non-tax (e.g. rents/fees) components. Official development assistance (ODA) Grants or concessional loans to eligible recipients meeting criteria for the promotion of economic development and welfare from an official source (i.e. government or multilateral organization) to a set of developing countries agreed by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD. ODA includes development assistance across sectors. ODA is reported to the DAC by member governments and several regional and global institutions. In addition, several non-DAC members report spending that meets the ODA criteria, as does the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Other official flows (OOF) Transactions by the official sector with countries on the DAC list of ODA recipients that do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA or official aid, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they have a grant element of less than 25%. Portfolio equity A form of international investment that does not confer significant control or influence. \u2018Portfolio\u2019 refers to a group of assets. Investments of 10% or more of the value or control of an asset or company are considered FDI, while investments below this threshold are portfolio equity. Investors receive returns though interest payments or dividends and can use equity to spread financial risks across different markets. They can also sell their equity on to other investors. Private development assistance (PDA) International concessional resource flows voluntarily transferred from private sources to international development, including private finance channelled by corporations, foundations and NGOs. Private non-guaranteed loans (PNG) Loans that are made to private debtors that are not guaranteed by a public entity. Public & publicly guaranteed loans (PPG) Loans made to public debtors or loans to private debtors that are guaranteed by a public entity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06231246-3ac9-460d-b725-fe4765dfd651": {"__data__": {"id_": "06231246-3ac9-460d-b725-fe4765dfd651", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - Progress on establishing integrated national financing frameworks in the Asia-Pacific region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ccd4674c2ca939ed91d0e09013c28542c8329117c52bea3802cf5c80ba4e00b9"}, "2": {"node_id": "a9605dec-5e6b-4d77-8ac6-7a5116502427", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/achieving-sustainable-development-goals-progress-establishing-integrated-national-financing-frameworks-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d8e55b442e73fc7c57c05ec8d9372d1ff5c5fbc54be1a31ff113ef86b61bb2c"}}, "hash": "4829d8a3dc984f20e2399a1f42c92a9ca0be576d86d5c9c4872a9f4254a130ce", "text": "Public-private partnership (PPP) Long-term partnerships between a private party and a government agency for providing a public asset or service, in which the private party bears significant risk or management responsibility. Purchasing power parity exchange rates (PPP$) A constructed exchange rate that adjusts market-based exchange rates for the relative buying power across different countries so enabling international comparisons of welfare of inhabitants. Controlling for price levels, PPP$s measure how much money would be needed to purchase the same goods and services in two countries, and use that to calculate an implicit foreign exchange rate.

Remittances can also be funds invested, deposited or donated by the migrant to the country of origin. Short-term debt Debt that has maturity of one year or less. Maturity can be defined either on an original or remaining basis. South-South cooperation (SSC) South-South cooperation is a broad framework for political, economic, social, cultural, environmental and technical collaboration among developing countries. Involving two or more developing countries, this may be on bilateral or other bases (e.g. trilateral, sub- regional, regional, inter-regional). Sharing of knowledge, skills, expertise and resources to meet development goals is a characteristic of this form of cooperation. Tax revenue The income that is gained by government through taxation. Taxes are compulsory, unrequited amounts receivable by government units from institutional units. There is no element of direct exchange, making tax different from other transfers such as rent or fees. Technical cooperation This includes both the direct supply of experts, consultants, teachers, academics, researchers, and volunteers as part of development cooperation as well as contributions to public and private bodies for sending experts to developing countries. Triangular/trilateral cooperation An emerging form of development cooperation that normally involves a traditional donor from the OECD DAC, a non-DAC emerging donor and a beneficiary. This more common arrangement can be understood as North-South-South cooperation, though North-North- South and South-South-South may also occur.

The focus of the team expanded, additional streams of work were incorporated, and, more importantly, new staff came on board following the UNDP\u2019s 2014 restructuring process. 2015 was also a year of consolidation, and of advances in the UNDP\u2019s Governance and Peacebuilding agenda in Asia and the Pacific. A major highlight was the adoption of Agenda 2030 \u2013 a global plan of action for people, planet and prosperity. The lead up to, and following the adoption of Agenda 2030, the importance of addressing the complex governance and peacebuilding challenges for achieving sustainable development gained momentum. The influence yielded and support provided by many countries in the region towards defining the Sustainable Development Goals (particularly Goal 16 on Inclusive and Peaceful societies) illustrates the importance given to addressing governance and peace-building challenges in this region. With an emphasis on more integrated and cross-practice work, the team aims to meet the growing demand for support to address complex governance and peacebuilding challenges in the region. The integrated and cross-practice work within the team has helped to identify, analyse and develop solutions to address challenges. For instance, the rights of sexual and gender minorities is addressed not only from a human rights perspective but also from a health and development perspective \u2013 thus helping to develop innovative solutions. This annual report provides a glimpse into the complexity of the issues at hand, and the hard work and dedication of the team behind some of the achievements of the Governance and Peacebuilding team at the Bangkok Regional Hub in 2015. At the same time, the changing aid environment also means a shift in how governance and peace-building support may be provided in the future. Governments in the Asia-Pacific are now more willing to explore government cost-sharing arrangements and put in large amounts of resources to address some of the pressing governance challenges and deliver better services. UNDP will also strive to work with civil society, and other non-state actors to address issues of marginalization, exclusion, anti-corruption that are at the root of inequality in the region. It has forged partnerships with civil society actors, multi-lateral organizations, aid- agencies to continue to promote the issues of marginalization and exclusion Moving forward, 2016 promises to be a year of new initiatives and stronger cross-practice work. Currently, regional programmes on Youth, Local governance and Sustainable Development, Business, and Human Rights, with Inclusive Political Transitions in the pipeline. With support from senior management, the team and I will continue to work towards realizing the aspiration of promoting inclusive and peaceful societies in the new context of Agenda 2030. 2 INTRODUCTION 3 Over the last few decades, countries in Asia-Pacific have made tremendous economic progress and witnessed social transformation. The proportion of the population living in extreme poverty decreased from 50 percent in 1990 to 15 percent in 2012. Despite this, the region is home to about two-thirds of the world\u2019s poorest people. Inequality and disparities in access to services continue to rise. Gender based discrimination remains high and women\u2019 political participation in the region is less than the global average. Weak governance is at the core of rising inequality and unequal development in a number of countries in the region. Failure to meet the growing demand for greater public participation in decision-making processes has resulted in social disruption and political unrest with negative impacts on growth and development. The Governance and Peace-building team at the Bangkok Regional Hub (BRH) works towards strengthening political-democratic processes and governance systems that take into account voices and rights of all people for equitable and sustainable development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb2d2666-a325-41bc-aeba-c389d85fa970": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb2d2666-a325-41bc-aeba-c389d85fa970", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance & Peace-Building Annual Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3386e8d326be61c1b2ef5b4dac4e1decf4ce683450bd2f447a8c3e7d067af0f0"}, "2": {"node_id": "99fb9efa-e31e-4037-954b-4d1b2d09aefc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64fbd0886429764a86f0a31c3ca93ff206a9566591788c4584fe0f994c5d9c22"}}, "hash": "b3f46b2ecb8d63062a0df805721f461366cf2d2f2b49fedff0bbf176ae21549b", "text": "It also spearheads regional initiatives to address the complex governance challenges in the region, including on sensitive issues such as political participation and access to services for indigenous peoples, and marginalized groups, including sexual and gender minorities.

A major factor contributing to conflict and insecurity, in addition to increasing inequality, is the chronic governance challenges that hinder inclusive political participation, i.e. from electoral processes, to participation in institutions such as parliament, to stronger engagement of public (particularly youth, and marginalized social and ethnic minorities. Exclusion and failure to promote integration can lead to social dislocation and unrest. In addition, increased interconnectedness in the region also means instability in one country causes overflows to neighboring countries creating trans-border challenges and affecting peace and stability in the (affected sub) region. In line with the High-Level Panel of Experts on the Review of the UN Peacebuilding Architecture\u2019s call for a global re- commitment to preventing conflict, the Political Transitions for Resilient, Inclusive States and Lasting Peace thematic area supports an integrated approach to addressing systemic causes of conflict and promote inclusive and peaceful societies. BRH\u2019s integrated approach to strengthening inclusive political processes comprises of support to political transitions (including support to civic and youth engagement), electoral process, conflict prevention, and women\u2019s participation and leadership in political processes. POLITICAL TRANSITIONS The Mandalay Dialogue on Inclusive Political Transitions held in February 2015, brought together 12 UNDP Country Directors and Resident Representatives with academics, civil society, former government ministers, donors and media representatives to exchange knowledge and information on transitional processes, and understand the conditions under which UNDP can support sustainable political, economic and social transitions for inclusive and peaceful societies across the Asia-Pacific region. Participants at the Mandalay Dialogue identified the need for research on underlying social, economic and political factors in driving social cohesion, or conflict. They also highlighted the importance of learning from successful transitions (such as Indonesia); and building on the research to develop and/or strengthen existing tools for early warning systems, and establish regional platforms to address sensitive issues such as security sector reform, and extremism The outcomes of the Mandalay Dialogue formed the basis for UNDP\u2019s Regional Programme on Supporting Inclusive and Peaceful Societies in Asia-Pacific (SIPSAP), which focuses on four key areas: a) Conducting policy focused research on emerging issues including preventing violent extremism and political settlements; b) Connecting civil society more effectively to big data to predict and prevent conflict; c) Empowering youth innovation and leadership; and d) Supporting civil society to engage with policy makers. 2015 was the inception year for the SIPSAS programme.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bba4cf66-726a-4652-847e-6053ae713c9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "bba4cf66-726a-4652-847e-6053ae713c9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance & Peace-Building Annual Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3516c362eeb08853c315ffcd529d2cca7fe08fe3050d967157c64a109c2db5ff"}, "2": {"node_id": "663a0126-86f7-4402-a3dc-669ad437e454", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54c426f4a1561a53bd11820b1bf4728cbec14fa3170da47ce622e46ef6cfb60b"}}, "hash": "e7219766b862d03bfc2aa0982f1d2f6e6bd36404363de601c160907bfa8e1bea", "text": "2015 was the inception year for the SIPSAS programme.

Women\u2019s inclusive participation an essential piece of conflict prevention and peace-building 5 CIVIL SOCIETY Civil society organizations are critical for supporting inclusive and peaceful political transitions. In 2015, following adoption of laws limiting the space for civil society in several countries, and at the request of partner organizations, a roundtable discussion on, \u201cWorking together to address shrinking civic space in Asia\u201d, was organized in Bangkok, 10-11 August 2015. Civil society actors from Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, Vietnam Indonesia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Fiji, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Thailand, as well as speakers from governments, academia and the UN, participated in the roundtable. The event was organized in partnership with The Asia Foundation, The Asia Pacific Forum, Ford Foundation, and USAID. A background paper on Civil Society Regulation and Space in Asia was produced to stimulate the discussions on shrinking civic space at the roundtable. The roundtable helped to lay the groundwork for sustained regional cooperation between UNDP and other partners to support civil society engagement with governments at national level. The recomm-endations from the roundtable also helped to shape the SIPSAS programme. Further, following the roundtable, UNDP country offices in China, Cambodia, and Viet Nam are supporting initiatives focused on civil society capacity development, and platforms for civil society coordination and dialogue. In addition, BRH also supported several country level initiatives to strengthen civil society engagement in policy process. In China, a Massive Open Online Course for CSOs was developed and launched on Coursera platform in 2015. The course was the result of a collaboration between UNDP and 13 leading experts from esteemed academic institutions and non-profit organizations in China. 4,794 people participated in the course, more than originally expected by UNDP and 501 concluded the entire course, indicating an engagement rate of 10%, almost twice more than average for a MOOC. YOUTH Following the launch of UNDP\u2019s Youth Strategy (2014-2017), \u201cEmpowered Youth, Sustainable Futures\u201d and UNV\u2019s Youth Volunteering Strategy (2014-2017), \u201cEmpowering Youth through Volunteerism\u201d, UNDP and UNV are currently forging an Asia-Pacific regional programmatic partnership focused on empowering young people to deliver on the SDGs by 2030. The proposed programme explores ways in which young people are, and also can help in promoting the 2030 agenda, with a particular focus on youth political participation, volunteering, and innovation for sustainable development. The UNDP-UNV partnership will also contribute to the implementation of the youth component of the SIPSAS programme in 2016. Acknowledging the importance of fostering creative and innovative potential of young people, including through the use of information and communication technologies, UNDP-UNV are formalizing public-private partnership opportunities with technology firms and impact investment firms to support youth innovation and leadership. In addition, UNDP also participated in regional youth dialogues and consultations in Mongolia, Japan, Bangkok and Malaysia in 2015. As a member of the Regional Coordination Mechanism and United Nations Development Group\u2018s (RCM/UNDG) Thematic Working Group on Youth, UNDP contributed a chapter to the State of Youth in Asia and the Pacific report. ELECTIONS In 2015, UNDP partnered with International IDEA and the Electoral Integrity Project to produce the first ever curriculum on electoral security. The Secure and Fair Elections (SAFE) Workshop Model Curriculum combines academic and practitioner perspectives to provide a holistic insight into the principles, challenges and good practices related to electoral security. The SAFE curriculum can be incorporated in electoral assistance programming, and can play an important role in strengthening the capacity of election practitioners and security-sector agencies. It will further assist other national and international stakeholders interested in safe elections. Parts of it informed the UN\u2019s electoral assistance activities in support to the 2015 parliamentary elections in Myanmar. Further interest has been expressed for SAFE curriculum implementation inside and outside the Asia-Pacific region.

It will also be an instrument to facilitate south-south exchange. GENDER ENgage for Peace, Equality, Access, Community and Empowerment (N-Peace) The N-Peace Network, established in 2010, is a regional UNDP initiative managed from the Bangkok Regional Hub with support from UNDP Country Offices in six post-conflict and fragile countries in Asia: Afghanistan, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, and the Philippines. The main objective of the N-Peace initiative is to promote women\u2019s leadership for conflict prevention, resolution and peacebuilding. Specifically, the initiative works to fulfil two key objectives: (i) support the leadership of women in building peace and preventing conflicts; and (ii) provide a platform for engagement and increase dialogue between key actors working on Women Peace and Security priorities. The N-Peace network has over 2,300 members from across the Asia-Pacific region and serves as convener for women peace advocates. In addition, National Dialogues are held annually to connect women peacebuilders from participating countries. Sub-regional capacity development trainings and knowledge sharing dialogues are also held to enable capacity development. Further, the N-Peace Awards campaign advocates and promotes women\u2019s engagement in peace processes. The following N-Peace activities, in 2014- 2015, promoted south-south dialogue and strengthened relevant regional platforms for evidence-based policy and programming: \u2022\ufffd 35 women from Nepal, Indonesia, Philippines, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Myanmar were trained in strategic advocacy and mobilisation skills specifically for progressing the women, peace and security agenda in their countries (trainings occurred in Bangkok in May 2014 and September 2015). \u2022\ufffd 206 stories of Asian women peacebuilders, and some men who also advocate for inclusive peace, have been documented and shared online. \u2022\ufffd 20 short documentary films have been made of women peacebuilders, strengthening the knowledge base around successful advocacy and participation by women in peace and security decision-making in Asia and promoting women as active agents of change in their communities. \u2022\ufffd Annual online advocacy campaigns in 2014 and 2015 have resulted in over 48,000 people becoming actively engaged in supporting women peacebuilders from the six participating countries and promoting their stories of how they build peace in different ways in their communities. \u2022\ufffd October 2015: 3 N-Peace events held in New York on the anniversary of United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 to promote Asian women peace leaders and include voices from Asia in the global discussions around the progression of UNSCR 1325 and the adoption of the new UNSCR 2422 (2015). SUPPORT TO INCREASING WOMEN\u2019S POLITICAL PARTICIPATION Supporting women\u2019s political participation remains a challenging area of work for UNDP in the region. Despite advocacy efforts \u2013 such as the Regional Workshop on Women\u2019s Political Participation in Local Governance \u201cExploring the Way Forward\u201d held in Bangkok in November 2014, in collaboration with USAID, UNESCAP, UN Women Asia Pacific Regional Office and Partners for Prevention initiative \u2013 progress on initiatives around women\u2019s political participation have not had desired effect. Pending thorough evaluation of the efforts undertaken, it is likely that the affirmative actions called for by the initiatives did not gain sufficient traction at national and local level. Despite the overall lack of success, activities were supported in three countries (Bhutan, Indonesia and Viet Nam) which led to some achievements. These include: In Bhutan, UNDP and the National Commission for Women (NCWC) supported consultations on \u201cEnhancing Women\u2019s Participation in Elected Office\u201d. The outcome of these consultations, along with the recommendations from the \u201cNational Conference on Women in Politics\u201d organized by NCWC in partnership with Bhutan\u2019s Network for Empowering Women in 2014, was incorporated into the National Plan of Action on Gender Equality in Elected Offices (NAPGEEO).

It brings together teams working on Access to Justice, Human Rights and Rule of Law, HIV, Health and Development, Gender Based Violence (through Partners for Prevention programme), and UN Action for Cooperation Against Trafficking in Persons. Regional focus, under this thematic area, helped to raise the profile of several sensitive issues, including rights of sexual and gender minorities, at the national and local level. Though issues around endorsing the findings and recommendations of the regional studies (on gender based violence, land rights, sexual minorities, etc.,) by national and local governments remain, these findings have helped to advocate for policy and programme changes. HIV, HEALTH & DEVELOPMENT UNDP is a co-sponsor of the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and partners with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (Global Fund) to address vulnerability to HIV, mitigate adverse social and economic impacts, reduce marginalization and advance human rights and gender equality. UNDP also partners with WHO to strengthen national-level governance and multisectoral engagement in implementing global public health agreements, with a focus on responding to non-communicable diseases and promoting universal health coverage. In the area of HIV, Health and Development 2, together with partners, UNDP has contributed to a series of landmark developments in law and policy reform and expanded delivery of HIV services to marginalized groups. To address legal and policy barriers that hinder effective responses to HIV, UNDP, together with UNAIDS and UNESCAP, supported 15 countries to hold multi-stakeholder national dialogues and to review legal and policy barriers that limit access to HIV and health services for populations most affected by the epidemic. The dialogues and reviews respond to country commitments under the Asia Pacific Regional Framework for Action on HIV and AIDS, as well as to the recommendations of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law , and ESCAP Resolutions 66/10 and 67/9 on accelerated progress in creating enabling legal and policy environments in the region. In January 2015, the Asia-Pacific Inter- Governmental Meeting on HIV and AIDS, hosted by ESCAP with support from UNAIDS and UNDP, resulted in the endorsement of the Regional Framework for Action on HIV and AIDS Beyond 2015. This included commitments to continue \u201cnational reviews and multisectoral consultations on legal and policy barriers\u201d and to undertake \u201cnational stakeholder consultations to promote access to affordable medicines, diagnostics and vaccines,\u201d both areas where UNDP plays a lead role in the United Nations System response to HIV. To reduce stigma and discrimination in health settings toward populations most vulnerable to HIV, and increase access to health services, UNDP and WHO developed an innovative regional training package titled \u201cThe Time Has Come\u201d, focusing on men who have sex with men and transgender people.

I truly have the best schoolmates.\u201d \u201cThe focus of the PurpleMySchool campaign on reducing inequality and exclusion faced by LGBTI people resonates very strongly with UNDP\u2019s mission in Asia and the Pacific,\u201d said Edmund Settle, Policy Advisor, UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub. \u201cThe campaign has great potential to be an effective tool to promote inclusion, which in turn can help to empower LGBTI youth as key players in the region\u2019s development.\u201d In addition to individual shows of support, schools and universities are jumping on board to support the campaign in a variety of creative ways, including: Harbin Medical University, China; Tagore International School in New Delhi, India; Dagon University and East Yangon University in Yangon, Myanmar; DMMA College of Southern Philippines in Davao City, St. Peters College in Iligan City, Samar State University and Quezon City High School, Philippines; Canadian International School, Nguyen Binh Khiem High School for the Gifted and Nguyenviethong High School in Cantho City, Viet Nam. \u201cWe like purple. Not only because it is a beautiful colour, but also because it represents diversity and acceptance,\u201d said a member of Tongxingshe. \u201cWe would like to make the change ourselves, and encourage others to make a difference as well. Let us all go purple with pride, and create a harmonious and safe campus.\u201d curriculum into national training programmes; in 2015, the training package was officially adopted for health care providers in Bhutan, India, Indonesia and the Philippines. UNDP also has increased policy attention to women and girls who are most affected by HIV, as well as to the vulnerability of sex workers. This has included establishing an evidence base on stigma, discrimination and violence faced by these groups, conducting legal reviews, and empowering HIV-affected women to advocate for their rights. For example, UNDP conducted research on violence against sex workers, together with UNFPA and civil society partners. This research was recognized for its excellence through the Robert Carr Award at the International AIDS Conference in 2014. In Nepal, the country\u2019s new Constitution explicitly protects sexual and gender minorities against discrimination, in a historic victory for civil society advocates whose work is supported under the Multi-Country South Asia HIV Programme. In the months leading up to the finalization and promulgation of the Constitution, a series of sensitization and advocacy initiatives with key individuals involved in the constitutional drafting process were organized, providing information on specific technical language and evidence to support recognition of sexual and gender minority rights. Support to reduce the vulnerability of men who have sex with men, transgender people and men with high-risk behavior has had particular impact in countries where these populations have traditionally been neglected by national programmes. Through the Multi- Country South Asia Programme, service provision reached more than 40,000 people, and almost 10,000 were tested for HIV and knew their results in 2014. REDUCING INEQUALITIES AND EXCLUSION BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY The Being LGBTI in Asia regional initiative is aimed at reducing marginalization and exclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people. Initiated in 2012, the programme addresses inequality, violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status, and promotes universal access to health and social services. Building on eight national LGBTI and human rights dialogues undertaken in its first phase, the initiative in 2015 supported a high-level regional dialogue on LGBTI rights and health that represented an important step in building consensus and strengthening the movement for addressing violence and discrimination. The regional dialogue attracted 225 participants from 33 countries, including parliamentarians, representatives of government, civil society and the private sector, as well as human rights experts and development partners.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e44a8ef0-2ab3-4be3-a768-4abb6661e26d": {"__data__": {"id_": "e44a8ef0-2ab3-4be3-a768-4abb6661e26d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance & Peace-Building Annual Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d6401db765ddd44eb91a5b8ce69f794dbc32e88448ce65f8c3daa3e015b732f"}, "2": {"node_id": "02cf5f9b-ab65-4f55-a172-e8a5fcf72159", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aee4336a3a4c869c5dc764f3871cbf593a5c44f2aa99e34c4d3877d455147b9c"}}, "hash": "278e07f9b7fa29bb03dd9ec24f223a942b910f02de5021de6e509eb3c823ff49", "text": "A partnership with regional and National Human Rights Institutions resulted in development of a common action plan to promote and protect human rights in the context of sexual orientation and gender identity.

The project is positioned at the strategic intersection of trafficking patterns, policy, research, governance, coordination and direct interventions, as a facilitator and coordinator as well as expert and innovator in the GMS region\u2019s counter-trafficking efforts. UN-ACT also serves as the Secretariat for the Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative Against Tra\u00acfficking, known as COMMIT. COMMIT is an inter-governmental body based on a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that brings together the six governments in the GMS region, in a joint effort to combat human tra\u00accking. Key achievements in 2015 include: INCREASED ENGAGEMENT BET WEEN GOVERNMENTS AND CIVIL SOCIETY During the 10th COMMIT Senior Officials Meeting (SOM)/4th Inter Ministerial Meeting (IMM) that was held in Phnom Penh between the 28-30th of April, the COMMIT governments invited civil society representatives to participate for the first time. The latter was previously not adequately represented in the COMMIT process, and the governments were reluctant to engage with CSOs in anti-trafficking efforts in the region. The formation of a COMMIT Civil Society Platform (including International NGOs, local NGOs, community-based organizations, and research institutions), and the direct engagement that took place between governments and Civil Society Organizations during the SOM/ IMM meeting are therefore considered to be important milestones. COMMIT ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY ENHANCED The COMMIT Sub-regional Plan of Action (SPA): IV was developed through a participatory process that set new standards for inclusivity and participation in COMMIT, with a wide range of key anti-trafficking stakeholders including UN agencies, international organizations and civil society groups (engaged both regionally and nationally). The SPA IV further demonstrates progress towards results-based management in COMMIT with a results framework that includes measurable indicators to monitor progress, negotiated between the COMMIT governments over several days of intensive discussions. This will significantly enhance the accountability of COMMIT and strengthen its potential as a peer review mechanism, and thereby set additional incentives for delivering on commitments made. A draft standardized Monitoring and Evaluation framework for the COMMIT Process was developed by UN-ACT in 2015. The framework is expected to be finalized during the first quarter of 2016. The COMMIT Governments have agreed to report on progress made on an annual basis. A draft standardized Monitoring and Evaluation framework for the COMMIT Process was developed by UN-ACT in 2015.

CASE STUDY: Repatriation of Myanmar and Thai trafficked fishermen from Indonesia \u201cI\u2019d rather be imprisoned for three years than stay a year on board. This is hell, not the heaven that they lured me in with.\u201d \u201cWhat can I do? I owe them now, so I must stay here, but I would rather escape.\u201d These are direct quotes from some of the 46 trafficking survivors rescued from Ambon, an isolated Indonesian island. Increasing numbers of enquiries from family members and workers, along with findings from research projects, led a Thai-based organization, Labor Rights Promotion Network (LPN), to conduct a field visit to Ambon in August 2014. There, they found workers from Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia who were in condition of trafficking. When LPN returned to Thailand, an urgent working group was set up, and the government, UN agencies and CSOs cooperated to develop a strategy for interventions. With support from UN-ACT Thailand, LPN conducted a second field visit to Ambon, and 27 Thai seafarers were returned home and reunited with their family members. Information on 19 Myanmar nationals was referred to the Myanmar embassies in Indonesia and Thailand as well as authorities in Myanmar, with coordination support from UN-ACT Thailand and Myanmar. These efforts led to their successful return to Myanmar.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f80186f-b5b7-4fa0-a951-183f89097cc0": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f80186f-b5b7-4fa0-a951-183f89097cc0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance & Peace-Building Annual Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4dc3d6e11ed0c9b037ccab2ccabd17e65b9d14a8ef1b9e1b81730a04cf7fa93a"}, "2": {"node_id": "c15a30dc-fbcb-43da-9965-35ab2b349b0b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf7a1e8ecaffa3cfecbbe021f0038c797f722cb1d37f84bcc2f84ac3f5a040ac"}}, "hash": "95d1f4b9160d1800e7e1332b5eb964d7778a2a2b964657bbb1e58e42ea397fd1", "text": "These efforts led to their successful return to Myanmar.

The interventions on the prevention of VAWG are designed based on the site- specific recommendations of the UN Multi- country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific, conducted during the Phase I (2008-2013), combined with local knowledge and global evidence of what is working to prevent VAWG. Technical support to the evaluation methodology and implementation of Planim Save Kamap Strongpela project in B o u g a i n v i l l e , Papua New Guinea P4P is supporting the implementation and evaluation of a VAWG prevention project working to change social norms around gender relations and masculinities through community conversations and responding to post-conflict trauma through psychosocial support. The project involves stakeholders in communities, the Nazareth Centre for Rehabilitation and UN Women. The target groups for the intervention are women, men, youth, community leaders and Council of Elders. The P4P team worked with the partners to develop the evaluation design and tools in 2015, and supported the implementation of the baseline survey. This survey was completed at the end of December with more than more than 1,400 programme beneficiaries participating. Implementation of the intervention then began in communities on a rolling basis after each had completed the baseline survey. Violence Free Village Initiative to Prevent Violence against Women and Girls in Papua, Indonesia P4P supported the design of a VAWG prevention intervention in Indonesia. The programme focuses on group education for adolescents and engages adolescent girls and boys (ages 13-15 years and 16- 18 years, parents, religious leaders and other influential community members in participatory group education sessions to change social norms that increase the risk of VAWG in Papua province. P4P technically supported a participatory process to adapt intervention curricula for adolescents and caregivers for the Papua context using curricula that have been shown to be effective in reducing violence in Africa among adolescents. Development and implementation of a VAWG prevention intervention in Cambodia In 2015, P4P worked with UNFPA, UN Women and UNV in Cambodia to design a VAWG prevention intervention for implementation in Kampong Cham. This focused on building capacity of local partners to implement youth-centered primary prevention programs with adolescents ages 12 to 14 and caregivers, as well as engaging the community through volunteerism to change social norms around gender inequitable attitudes, including harmful masculinities and prevent VAWG. In 2015, P4P also provided technical support for the participatory adaptation of two curricula for adolescents and caregivers, on prevention of VAWG. One was entitled Shaping our Future: Developing healthy and happy relationships and the other was entitled We are Ready: Supporting teenagers\u2019 development in healthy and happy relationships. Male advocates for prevention of VAWG in Viet Nam In 2015, P4P worked with UN Women, UNV, UNFPA and the Da Nang Women\u2019s Union to develop a violence prevention intervention working with male advocates in Da Nang using the Transforming m a s c u l i n i t i e s towards gender justice curricula, which was developed by the Regional Learning Community for East and Southeast Asia (RLC) in P4P Phase I. Sixteen adult men and 8 younger men and women were trained to be group facilitators by the Da Nang Women\u2019s Union, UN Women and P4P. Project implementation began in September. Male advocates, first participate in a facilitated gender transformative process using the curricula and then carry out community outreach as advocates against violence in their community. Capacity building on prevention of violence against women P4P also supported additional capacity building in Vietnam on approaches to engage men and boys in prevention of VAWG in Viet Nam in July 2015. Twenty- one male participants and 40 female participants from government, mass organizations, academia and civil society Training to prevent violence against women and girls in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea 12 strengthened their capacity to use new approaches and develop concrete plans for involving men and boys in prevention of VAWG. For a video of the workshop, please see: https://www.facebook.com/ Partners4Prevention/?fref=ts In Bangladesh, P4P together with UNV and UNFPA supported 24 UN Volunteers to increase their capacity to promote gender equality, prevention of VAWG and volunteerism to ensure sustainability of violence prevention interventions. P4P also invested significant technical assistance and multiple team missions to support the development of the violence prevention interventions in Cambodia, Indonesia and Viet Nam.

Specific areas of achievement in 2015 include: a. Work with National Human Rights Institutions. In 2015, UNDP BRH undertook evaluation missions to assess capacity of National Human Rights Institutions in Timor Leste (jointly with Asia Pacific Forum and Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights),and in Nepal, and proposed recommendations to increase their effectiveness. In addition, a regional meeting was organized, in collaboration with Asia Pacific Forum, on the role of National Human Rights Institutions in the promotion and protection of sexual and gender minorities\u2019 rights. Following that, another regional meeting was organized for CSOs on engaging with international Human Rights mechanisms on promotion and protection of the rights of sexual and gender minorities. A new strategic framework for the engagement of UNDP CO Afghanistan in the Human Rights field (support to the NHRC, involvement in UPR and treaty reporting) was developed. The strategic framework was based on a study of all the existing projects which have a Human Rights component and contains recommendations on the areas that should be prioritized in the future. b. Support to country-office strategic thinking and programme redesign In 2015, the team assisted with the drafting of new projects to support the National Human Rights Commission in Nepal, Access to Justice and capacity building of the Justice Institutions in Timor Leste; supported restructuring of the Justice and Law Enforcement project in Pakistan and specifically assessed the feasibility of the mobile-courts component; evaluated the Human Rights work carried out by UNDP in Afghanistan and designed a strategic framework for the future engagement in this area, including support to legal aid reform; advised UNDP Sri Lanka on realignment of portfolio for access to justice, rule of law, constitutional reform, human rights and reconciliation following results of Presidential election; supported the drafting of a new Project in support of strengthening human rights in Bangladesh; Supported the drafting of a new phase of the project to support governance in Maldives including access to justice and human rights. In addition, supported the Attorney- General\u2019s Office of Bhutan on policy directions for reforming legal aid system in Bhutan, and co-organized the Regional Workshop on Integrity and Accountability in the Justice Sector (for more details about this specific work, see the section on anti-corruption) In addition, BRH is also supporting effective communication between the Rule of Law and Human Rights team in Head Quarters and the Country offices in the Region. The Human Rights and Rule of Law Team has presented and delivered trainings on issues such as the Universal Periodic Review, Rights of Indigenous People, Human Rights and Environment Business and Human Rights, Legal Empowerment of the Poor, Integrity of the Judiciary, Pro Bono Lawyering, Legal aid, etc. WOMEN\u2019S ACCESS TO LAND AND PROPERTY FROM A JUSTICE PERSPECTIVE While women represent approximately half of the population in the region, they do not have equal land and property right. In Asia only 10.7% of women own land compared to the global average of 20% and 18.6% in Africa. UNDP, in partnership with UN Women, conducted a study from Asia Pacific region on \u201cWomen\u2019s Access to Justice: Land and Property Rights in the Asia-Pacific\u201d to identify and address issues around women\u2019s land and property rights. Following a regional consultative exchange with experts in July 2014, UNDP, in partnership with UN Women and other actors, developed an agenda to develop research and identify country case studies to strengthen evidence- based approaches. In particular, UNDP supported a study on women\u2019s access to land in China, as well as facilitated the organization of some workshops in Indonesia to ensure that the perspective of indigenous women is included in the national inquiry on indigenous people\u2019s land rights. 13 2015 REGIONAL DIALOGUE ON GOVERNANCE & PEACE-BUILDING STAGE SET TO STRENGTHEN GOVERNANCE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA & THE PACIFIC In September 2015, The Asia-Pacific Regional Dialogue on Governance and Peacebuilding was held in Bangkok, Thailand.

Participants underscored the major governance challenges in the region and came up with a framework for strengthening governance and peacebuilding to achieve the 2030 sustainable development agenda in Asia-Pacific. The framework, as clarified in the outcome document of the regional dialogue or the Bangkok Communiqu\u00e9, includes three dimensions to strengthening governance for sustainable development. These are: To achieve the above, participants agreed that working across practice areas in an integrated, and interdisciplinary manner, and through forging multi-stakeholder partnerships was important. Further, support to budget and fiscal administration processes, systematic use of conflict prevention lens, and research on governance challenges in Asia and the Pacific will be prioritized as part of UNDP\u2019s support to strengthening governance and peacebuilding in the region. a) Governance for the SDGs - refers to the political process of building national and local ownership of SDGs, prioritization of SDGs, and integrating SDGs with national planning and budgeting processes, and strengthening parliamentary oversight. b) Governance of the SDGs - refers to the relevance of governance for achieving each of the 17 goals, and strengthen the linkages between the goals. UNDP can strengthen the achievement of the SDGs, specifically those in line with the organization\u2019s mandate (such as the goals on poverty reduction, and inequality), through integrated approaches that address the legal, policy, and institutional challenges. c) Governance as a SDG - refers to SDG 16 on inclusive and peaceful societies, and the support UNDP will provide to achieve the SDG 16 targets. 3) MAXIMIZE AVAILABILITY AND GOOD GOVERNANCE OF DEVELOPMENT FINANCE AT GLOBAL AND NATIONAL LEVELS The focus under this thematic area is to strengthen global and national financial frameworks to ensure overall development effectiveness and climate change resilience (including achievement of Sustainable Development Goals). This thematic areas includes regional programmes on governance of climate change finance, and development effectiveness. GOVERNANCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE FINANCE The Strengthening the Governance of Climate Change Finance to Benefit the Poor and Vulnerable programme aims to promote mobilization of climate change finance as a national priority, and strengthen national fiscal policies and budgeting processes to support pro-poor and gender responsive mitigation and adaption measures to climate change in Asia- and the Pacific. Crucially, the programme links climate change policies and plan with actual budget allocations in order facilitate efficient and effective implementation of climate change measures. Examples of interventions include: implementation of Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Reviews (CPEIR) at the national and subnational levels, introducing climate change budget tags, South-South exchange of knowledge, and etc., The programme supports focused action in six countries \u2013 Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan and Thailand. Major achievements in 2015 include: 1.) Increased traction and ownership of Ministries of Finance of climate change finance: Ministries of Finance are a critical actor in the implementation of climate change policies and plan, as they are responsible for adequate allocation of resources to responsible line ministries. The programme was instrumental in raising awareness of the impact of climate change on economic growth, conduct cost-benefit analysis of public investments vis-a-vis climate change, and mainstreaming climate change finance into budgeting processes. The work supported through this programme also contributed to designation of ministries of finance as national interlocutor (National Designated Authority \u2013 NDA) for the Green Climate Fund by 2015 in Bangladesh, Nepal, Samoa, and Viet Nam. Strengthened intra-governmental cooperation around climate change planning and budgeting: the programme brought together central and line ministries as well as departments and agencies in Cambodia and Thailand to develop integrated climate changes plans and budgets. For instance, in Cambodia, a total of ten ministries and agencies conducted climate change financing framework exercise and developed costed action plans to off-set two-thirds of the expected impact from climate change on key economic sectors. Support was also provided to measure availability of finances in the medium term (i.e. 5 years), and prioritize climate change adaption activities. In addition, a M&E framework building on International Institute for Environment and Development\u2019s the Tracking Adaptation and Measuring Development framework was also produced. The Programme has assisted Cambodia in tracking Climate Change finance in the ODA database building on the Climate Change Finance Framework methodology for identification of Climate Change expenditure. This work is related to the work on Supporting Busan monitoring and aid information management systems to assess climate finance and strengthening links to Public Financial Management.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d49f7c6-18a8-4d3f-b51f-9d391466b24a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d49f7c6-18a8-4d3f-b51f-9d391466b24a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance & Peace-Building Annual Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac6339abde9243e8485717326e7549dc568420d121bf80a3ed63d4e97497be82"}, "2": {"node_id": "b407e847-0035-47b2-b275-8f9409224f94", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a5275ef167e2f463b0c4834dbb95fc5b71d6ad6e22aaef310ffc8d3432f21bf"}}, "hash": "248a4a79e11c90006fe783aa765bb99f48946a0b107e2cbcd83bba65de28f0ce", "text": "The achievements and lessons from Cambodia influenced the formulation of the Climate Change Financing Framework in Nepal and Pakistan, as an overarching Public Financial Management reform agenda .

Increased Integrity and Accountability of Climate Change Finance: The programme is also supporting engagement of accountability actors, such as civil society organizations, state audit institutions, parliaments etc., at the regional and country level (ex: Nepal and Pakistan) to strengthen demand for climate change responsive budgeting and also 16 the accountability of the governments on climate change finance related policies and budget decisions, expenditure monitoring, reporting and evaluation. 3.) Wider application of CPEIRs both horizontally and vertically. More than 20 countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America have now produced CPEIRs with direct and indirect influence of the Programme. These include: Some countries, e.g. Pakistan and Indonesia, produced CPEIRs at the subnational level. In Indonesia, two sub-national CPEIRs were produced at the provincial level (Nusa Tengara Timur, the poorest province in Indonesia; and Bangka Belitung, a province heavily affected by mining). The CPEIR in Pakistan was conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Access to knowledge expanded across countries covered by the Programme. Regional meetings, Regional Peer Learning Network and other platforms and toolkit (such as CPEIR methodology and lessons learnt papers, Climate Change Integration Index, Climate Budget Tagging Review) now support extensive exchange of experience in integrating climate change in the national public financial management systems. The programme also supported building of cross country knowledge on climate budget tagging systems and discussions/ recommendations on advanced models. These include: publications on Climate Budget Tagging: Country Driven Initiatives in Tracking Public Expenditure; Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review: A Methodological Guidebook; and Measuring Integration of Climate Change in Public Financial Management Systems; and the datebase on CPEIR www. climatefinance-developmenteffectiveness. org/CPEIR-Database. In addition, in collaboration with UNITAR, a skills development programme on climate change finance is currently being developed to establish a cadre of trainers on climate change finance in the region. The Economic and Finance Institute in Cambodia has certified 30 trainer of trainers, who in turn are expected to support capacity development of an estimated 150 government officials. DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS UNDP BRH is the Secretariat for the Asia Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility (AP-DEF), a country-led regional platform, chaired by the Government of Bangladesh. The Facility supports regional dialogue and sharing of knowledge and experiences on development effectiveness and development finance, responding to the growing demand from countries in Asia Pacific to establish evidence and analysis, and introduce policy and institutional reforms for managing the increasing complexity of domestic and international sources of finance for development. UNDP has developed a tool to help countries construct Integrated National Financing F r a m e w o r k s to implement the SDGs \u2013 the D e v e l o p m e n t F i n a n c e A s s e s s m e n t (DFA). The DFA provides Planning, Finance and other ministries, with data and analysis on the changing trends in development finance. It also provides a set of recommendations for how to adjust institutions and systems to manage different sources of development finance within a coherent framework, which better supports the achievement of national priorities and results. Following the adoption of the SDGs and the 3rd International Conference on Financing for Development in 2015, the DFA approach supports countries to move forward with translating global dialogue and processes into concrete national reform agendas aimed at better linking development finance to results. To date, seven countries have completed or launched a DFA: Bangladesh, Fiji, Lao, Myanmar, Philippines, PNG and Vietnam. BRH provides advice and technical support to partner governments to undertake a DFA, working closely with UNDP country offices and other development cooperation actors. Strengthening the DFA methodology in assessing links between finance and results: In 2015, AP-DEF undertook a review of lessons learned from initial DFA studies. Based on the findings, and in in conjunction with a GPEDC initiative on country results championed by Bangladesh and Switzerland, AP-DEF has strengthened 17 the DFA methodology to further enhance the results orientation of the assessment approach. The revised DFA methodology looks at issues such as: trends in finance flows and their allocations to national priorities; quality of national development strategies in terms of their articulation of results and links with fiscal planning and budgeting processes. The DFA approach has raised interest beyond the Asia-Pacific, with Mozambique being the first country to undertake a DFA in Africa.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c862f92-7470-4b47-8da2-448f239fa3d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c862f92-7470-4b47-8da2-448f239fa3d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance & Peace-Building Annual Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "73ef3a8465bf9e138905ecbd46469e597a14f71791715c7f7a3e55b5410f7456"}, "2": {"node_id": "4bd2cfea-3b8c-442d-95e2-42a25bf39cb2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "047e509cee9f7b9a3854d8eff659a3b6bf40caa34c7c29a2b360c2f39b482715"}}, "hash": "5949606bd864b230a6f554554f9e9bfb48e0ae0bff190738f9ebd3392c5ce9da", "text": "In 2015, DFAs were launched in Bangladesh, Fiji and Myanmar.

Key publication: Dealing with Complexity: How Governments are Managing Financing for Sustainable Development. Lessons from Development Finance Assessments in Asia and the Pacific CONTRIBUTING TO GLOBAL DISCOURSE ON FINANCING FOR DEVELOPMENT: In 2015, AP-DEF contributed to ensuring that the global discussions on financing for development were informed by country experience and that the outcome of the 3rd International Conference on Financing for Development, which took place in Addis Ababa in July 2015, took into account country realities. In the lead-up to the Addis Ababa conference, AP-DEF organized an Asia-Pacific regional consultation, \u201cStrengthening Coherence between Financing for Development and Effective Development Cooperation\u201d, in Manila in March 2015. This forum, jointly hosted by the Governments of Philippines, Bangladesh, and Palau resulted in a set of key messages to feed into the Financing for Development Conference in Addis Ababa. AP-DEF and UNDP BRH also partnered with ESCAP to organize the Asia-Pacific High-level Consultations on Financing for Development in Jakarta, in April 2015. Following the Addis Ababa conference, AP-DEF organized a regional workshop, \u201cRealizing the Addis Ababa Action Agenda at Country Level and Using Development Finance to Achieve Country Results\u201d, in Bangkok in October 2015. Discussions focused on the links between the management of different flows of development finance and the formulation and measurement of country results; the role of DFAs in establishing evidence of development finance flows at country level and the institutions and policies which govern them; and potential next steps for strengthening alignment of finance with country results frameworks, taking into account lessons learned from performance- based budgeting. Recommendations emerging from regional consultations highlighted the importance of strengthening country systems, in particular systems for planning and budgeting given their linchpin role as a platform for linking flows of development finance to national development results. 18 4) STRENGTHEN TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL AND NATIONAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE AND EQUITABLE SERVICES Strong national and local governance systems are vital for protecting the rights of all people, for managing resources, and for delivering equitable services that are responsive to the needs of the people. Weak governance systems, on the other hand, manifest not only as weak rule of law, and corruption, but also as multi-dimensional poverty, social exclusion, weak rule of law, corruption, and human rights violations\u2013 including through human trafficking, negative law enforcement practices against vulnerable and marginalized people. UNDP BRH focuses on strengthening transparent and accountable national and local governance systems through its work on Core Government Functions (including public administration, civil service, and parliament), Anti-Corruption, Transparency and Accountability, and Local Governance and Decentralization. In addition, work on strengthening the governance of extractives sector aims at supporting transparent and accountable management of natural resources for sustainable development. CORE GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS The Core Government Functions portfolio provides policy advice and programmatic support in the area of core government functions - specifically public administration, civil service reform and parliamentary development, government accountability, and inclusiveness and responsiveness. In 2015, under this portfolio, technical advice to planning and reform processes at national level was provided in Vietnam, Pakistan, Myanmar, Bhutan, Timor Leste, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. More specifically, in Sri Lanka, following the 2015 national elections, BRH assisted UNDP Sri Lanka to provide timely support to the Parliament. The support includes: Member of Parliament orientation, detailed status quo analysis, needs assessment and the formulation of a comprehensive parliamentary support strategy, as well as assistance related to rationalizing and restructuring the committee system. In December 2015 Sri Lanka Parliament passed a motion to set up sectoral oversight parliamentary committees (including a Women and Gender Committee).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9f42c47-73ad-44e8-8fe6-6f46b21d48e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9f42c47-73ad-44e8-8fe6-6f46b21d48e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance & Peace-Building Annual Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "87c66cb77ebd8f87fee9d82ce095f9441e04b351e89556ca4c05443dd158a933"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc0667fd-9b7f-4379-aa74-77b87b15f544", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-peace-building-annual-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5af067d5c86286692822e496ac3e20846718b371af92437cabdb69683316020c"}}, "hash": "9b6b001cf2039ac160196685710184a3aa7df2f0f15cdbab62c97b8e514c2673", "text": "The role of the committees is to examine, review and report on all bills, resolutions, etc., relating to the subject of their mandate to the Parliament prior to subject being considered by Parliament.

The new parliamentary programme aims at strengthening the institution and enabling it to perform its core legislative, oversight and representational functions more efficiently and effectively and to provide the necessary political support, orientation and oversight to the overall reform, reconciliation and development agenda. It will also support activities to enhance transparency, accountability and citizens\u2019 participation in the work of Parliament. Successful implementation of this programme is expected to trigger other essential governance reforms in Sri Lanka and boost the strategic impact of UNDP\u2019s policy and programatic engagement in Asia-Pacific countries that have experienced protracted conflict and significant peacebuilding challenges. The leadership of the Parliament of Sri Lanka has endorsed the needs assessment conducted with BRH\u2019s support, and adopted the draft parliamentary strengthening strategy to inform its overall reform and international assistance focus. UNDP has also been requested by Parliament to support coordination of the overall international involvement in legislative strengthening. In addition, support was also provided to amending the Law on Elections in Vietnam; strengthening the parliamentary committee systems in Bhutan and planning for specific roles of parliamentary committees in integrating Agenda 2030 and overseeing SDGs implementation; and enhancing women representation and participation in the Parliament in Malaysia. BRH further provided strategic advice on UNDP support to civil service reforms in Pakistan, Myanmar and Bhutan. In addition, the Global Project on Gender in Public Administration (GEPA) has been assisted in 2015 to conduct a survey in 18 countries in Asia-Pacific. This initial survey aims to help developing a future global tracking mechanism that will institutionalize the monitoring of the state of gender equality in the civil service. The survey sought information on how data on civil service employees is collected, housed and updated, how many grades are available, which grades are considered decision-making level, and which is the UNDP engagement in gender projects related to public administration in each country office. BRH has been assisting with the design of a comprehensive Parliamentary Strengthening 19 4 Programme that will be launched in 2016. Successful implementation of this programme is expected to trigger other essential governance reforms in Sri Lanka and boost the strategic impact of UNDP\u2019s policy and programatic engagement in Asia-Pacific countries that have experienced protracted conflict and significant peacebuilding challenges. In Pakistan, BRH advised and supported the formulation and initiation of a government- funded public sector reforms programme entitled \u2018Reforms and Innovations in Government for High Performance\u2019. UNDP provided strategic and technical advisory support to the Ministry of Planning, Development and Reform to commence a comprehensive analysis of the public sector operating environment, identify major bottlenecks and establish reform priorities in the short and medium terms. The reform priorities include: human resource management, e-governance solutions for improved public sector performance and service delivery, and citizen engagement. UNDP supported inception and planning workshops and shared international and regional best practices and lessons learned. BRH advised on issues such as: risk assessment and management, regular and consistent engagement of a broad range of stakeholders and civil servants (including middle level) in problem and solution identification; communications and coalition building; building on and learning from past reform experiences; periodic evaluation of bottlenecks and strategic and operational adjustments as necessary. The first phase of the programme focused on forging partnerships, establishing performance contracts for a number of ministries (based on the Malaysian model) and developing a road map for civil service reforms. In addition, support was also provided to amending the Law on Elections in Vietnam; strengthening the parliamentary committee systems in Bhutan and planning for specific roles of parliamentary committees in integrating Agenda 2030 and overseeing SDGs implementation; and enhancing women representation and participation in the Parliament in Malaysia.

ANTI-CORRUPTION, TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY The Anti-Corruption, Transparency and Accountability team supports countries in the region to mitigate corruption risks in the service delivery chain through adoption of community-based approaches at the local level, and empowering citizens to monitor governments and to hold them accountable. The team also offers advice to national governments to implement their international obligations under the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), especially in the area of prevention, by involving a range of actors such as anti- corruption agencies, government, private sector, civil society and development partners. Key priority areas of work include: \u2022\ufffd Developing, implementing and monitoring anti-corruptions strategies 20 New Ways to Fight Corruption & Deliver Justice For All UNDP, together with the U4 Anti-Corruption Centre and GIZ, have joined efforts to identify new ways to fight corruption and deliver justice for all in the context of the newly approved SDG16. Representatives from the judiciary, anti-corruption agencies, UNDP, as well as development partners discussed experiences from the field in promoting integrity in the criminal justice chain in a UNDP meeting organized in September 2015 in Malaysia. Participants highlighted that corruption is a major bottleneck to ensure equal access to justice and eventually for the implementation of the SDGs. On average 1 out of 4 citizens globally report that they paid a bribe to the judiciary within the last year, making the judiciary the second-most corruption-prone sector after the police (TI\u2019s 2013 Global Corruption Barometer). While acknowledging the difficulty of the problem, participants discussed innovative initiatives from around the globe with the potential to make a difference. For example in Indonesia, people can now go online to access court documents and statistics on judgements, eliminating bureaucracy and increasing transparency. Even in challenging environments such as Afghanistan the use of local monitors of trials by Integrity Watch has resulted in marked improvement in the administration of justice. Building on these experiences UNDP is preparing a publication on A Transparent and Accountable Judiciary to Deliver Justice for All.

LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND DECENTRALIZATION The central role of local governments in promoting sustainable development is well established. The adoption of SDGs in September 2015 provided the opportunity for UNDP in Asia-Pacific to reinforce the importance of strong local governance systems to achieve the Agenda 2030 and implement the SDGs at sub-national and 22 local level. As indicated above, strong local governance systems are essential for ensuring equitable delivery of services, promote economic opportunities, increase public participation, and address exclusion and inequalities in order to maintain (and strengthen) inclusive and peaceful societies (SDG 16). To address these challenges, UNDP Bangkok regional Hub developed a \u2018Regional initiative on Local governance for the SDGs\u201d which was endorsed at the UNDP Regional Management Meeting in Kuala Lumpur (October 2015). The initiative provides a framework for UNDP country offices to strengthen local governance systems for localizing the SDGs and delivering on the 2030 Agenda. The initiative supports a four-pronged approach \u2013 1) focus on completing the decentralization reforms, 2) strengthen local public financial management systems, 3) increase horizontal linkages between different actors to promote efficient delivery of services, and 4) enhance public engagement in local decision making processes. The initiative also promotes linkages between local governance programmes and anti- corruption, social cohesion, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction projects/ programmes to both deliver on the objectives of the sector/thematic programmes at the local level, and stren
