Goal 4 \u2013 Reduce child mortality One of the most sensitive indicators of success in development is the survival rate of children, and par- ticularly of infants under 1 year old. Across the region nearly 5 million children die before reaching their fifth birthday. Target 5: Reduce by two thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-5 mortality rate For this index the 47 countries of the region with data available divide into two halves (figure I.6a). Half have already achieved their targets, and all of these now have child mortality rates below 45 per 1,000 live births. The other half, however, are in a very different position: only 4 are on track to meet the target; 14 are off track, making progress too slowly; while 3 are regressing (figure I.6b). It should be pointed out, however, that this is slow progress against a challenging target: to reduce not by half but by two thirds. In 2003, the largest number of child deaths was in India, 2.3 million, followed by China, 650,000, and Pakistan, 481,000. Of these countries, however, only China has been making sufficient progress on this indicator; indeed it is an early achiever. Both India and Pakistan are off track since they are progressing too slowly. The most shocking rate, however, is in Afghani- stan with 257 deaths per 1,000 life births: 1 child in 4 dies before reaching the age of 5 \u2013 resulting in 2003 in 340,000 deaths \u2013 and the country seems to be making scarcely any progress. Rates are also too slow in several countries in Central Asia. As child mortality rates come down, the majority of deaths take place in the earliest years, months, and even days, of life. Thus in India, while the child mor- tality per 1,000 live births in 2003 was 87, the infant mortality rate was 63, so three quarters of child deaths take place in the first year. In countries with lower rates, an even higher proportion are in the first year: in the Islamic Republic of Iran, for example, 33 out of 39. Overall therefore, the pattern for infant mortality is similar to that of under-5 mortality, though some countries that are doing well on child mortality appear to be less successful on infant mor- tality (figure I.7b). 22 Figure I.6.

Reduction in poverty and im- proved living conditions, along with improved health care, would eliminate many of these deaths. The 10 countries with the highest child mortality rates include 7 of those in the top 10 for poverty. These mortality rates also correlate strongly with the share of health expenditure in government outlay, the measles immu- nization rate, and the extent of access to clean water. The Islamic Republic of Iran, for example, after 1980 devoted more resources to health care and to the rural areas and by 2002 it was reaching 84 per cent of communities through rural health houses and the rest through rural clinics. Cambodia, however, devotes a smaller proportion of its smaller budget to health ser- vices and its high child death rate can also be linked to poor water supplies and sanitation. Goal 5 \u2013 Improve maternal health A clear sign of discrimination against women is the low priority afforded in many countries to maternal health. Each year, across the region around one quarter of a million mothers die as a result of pregnancy and childbirth. Almost all these deaths can be avoided if mothers have access to emergency obstetric care. Target 6: Reduce by three quarters, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio One of the difficulties in addressing maternal mortal- ity is that the statistics are typically very inexact. Most of the poorest countries in the region lack effective systems for vital registration, so their data on maternal deaths typically have to come from household and other surveys. But because a maternal death is less common than other forms of death an accurate pic- ture requires a very large sample size. Moreover, since definitions and methods of data collection have changed, comparisons across time and across coun- tries may not be warranted. Accepting these limitations, some the latest trends are captured in figure I.8. Even this cannot show the full scale of the problem. The highest maternal mortality rates per 100,000 live births are actually in Afghanistan (1,900), Nepal (740), Timor-Leste (660) and Pakistan (500), which are off the scale of figure I.8a, though the latter three do appear in figure I.8b.

This is still a very high figure but, even more alarming, of the 42 countries for which data are avail- able, maternal mortality has gone up in 22 of them so they are placed in the regressing zone of figure I.8b. 24 For some of these, however, the apparent increase may be the result of better reporting of deaths. Around two thirds of Asian maternal deaths, 164,000, take place in India and Pakistan, both of which are among the regressing countries. Mothers all over the world, regardless of nationality, social class or state of health can develop childbirth complications \u2013 which globally are estimated to occur in 15 per cent of all pregnancies. These typically in- clude haemorrhage, eclampsia, obstructed labour and the consequences of unsafe abortion. The difference between countries largely reflects the care available to deal with such emergencies \u2013 having births attended by skilled attendants who if necessary can refer women quickly to emergency obstetric care services. Bangladesh, for example, which is on track to meet the target, has done so at least partly because it has been able to bring care closer to mothers in rural communities. Currently only 14 per cent of births are attended by skilled personnel but between 1992 and 2002 Bangladesh increased the number of emergency obstetric care centres from 30 to 127. In Afghanistan only 11 per cent of births are attended by skilled personnel; most women have little access to antenatal or primary health care and live far from any emergency services. Goal 6 \u2013 Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases Many countries in the region have been badly affected both by the arrival of HIV/AIDS and the resurgence of other infections such as malaria, though for some diseases such as TB they have made more progress. Within this goal there are no numeric targets; the aim is simply to reduce the prevalence, so the accompanying charts show only the latest available values and the rate of change in the prevalence. Target 7: Have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS Although the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is lower in this region than in Africa, or some other parts of the world, large population sizes in Asia translate into large absolute numbers. As a result, this is where the future course of the pandemic will be determined. By 2004 the Asia-Pacific region had over 9 million people living with the disease and each year half a million people die.

In the year 2001, HIV/AIDS was thought to be cost- ing the region around $7.3 billion in loss of output and medical costs, a figure that could rise to $17.5 billion by 2010, with millions more people being pushed into poverty. However, a successful response to the pandemic should be able to contain the num- ber of new infections at 4 million, keep the death toll at 600,000 and hold the losses to around $15.5 billion. Other countries in the region should be able to draw inspiration from Thailand.

HIV prevalence among those aged 15-49 25 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH to restore its momentum. India, however, has yet to tackle the pandemic with the appropriate urgency and neither NGOs nor the Government seem to have found ways of discussing sex and sexuality and HIV/ AIDS in an open and frank manner and using a vo- cabulary that is widely understood. Target 8: Have halted and reversed by 2015 the incidence of malaria and other major diseases Malaria remains a serious problem. Around 3.3 million people are infected and each year 73,000 people die. Although there are insufficient data to calculate trends, in some countries malaria seems to be making a come- back as mosquitoes have developed resistance to DDT and other insecticides, and the parasite has developed resistance to many of the drugs that have been used for treatment. Table I.5 shows the prevalence and death rates across the region \u2013 though even these data will probably underestimate the extent of the problem since they are usually based on clinically reported cases. The highest prevalences are in the Pacific, notably Solomon Is- lands, where the disease affects 15 per cent of the population. The largest number of people sick are in Indonesia with 1.9 million people infected. The largest number of deaths are in India, more than 30,000 each year. The highest death rate, however, is in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Papua New Guinea.

As a result it has reduced morbidity by 60 per cent and mortality by 97 per cent. Tuberculosis (TB) too remains a major concern, though the region as a whole is making progress. Be- tween 1990 and 2003 the number of people infected declined from 12.8 to 10.3 million and the number of people dying each year fell from 1.1 to 1.0 million. The largest number of people infected were in the most populous countries: China, 3.2 million; India, 3.1 mil- lion; and Indonesia, 1.5 million \u2013 and these countries also accounted for around 70 per cent of deaths. All three are making progress, however. In some countries, though the prevalence has been rising, particularly in Central Asia and parts of the Pacific. Reducing the prevalence of TB depends on early detec- tion and treatment, which is now principally through the Directly Observed Treatment Short Course strategy (DOTS), which aims to offer patients the most effective treatment and minimize the emergence of further drug- resistant strains. Some countries, however, have insuffi- cient clinics or equipment needed for diagnosis. 26 Goal 7 \u2013 Ensure environmental sustainability This goal reflects the critical relationship between people and their environment. The first target is con- cerned with conserving and developing environmental resources so as to maintain livelihoods. The other aims for safe water supplies and sanitation \u2013 to enable people to protect themselves from infection and pollu- tion. Target 9: Integrate the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programmes and reverse the loss of environmental resources The first half of this goal concerns policies and programmes on sustainable development. The assess- ment here is based on the Plan of Implementation adopted by the World Summit on Sustainable Devel- opment in Johannesburg in 2002. This called on all countries to formulate national sustainable develop- ment strategies (NSDS) and to begin implementation by 2005. Each country can therefore be placed in one of the following categories: \u2022 NSDS being implemented \u2022 NSDS document approved by the Government \u2022 NSDS development in progress \u2022 Components of sustainable development in place \u2022 No action taken or no information available Countries under the first two categories can be classi- fied as early achievers; those in the third can be consid- ered on track; while those in the fourth and fifth cat- egories can be identified as off track: slow progress and regressing, respectively. The results are shown in table I.6. This shows 5 of the 55 Asia-Pacific countries to be early achievers \u2013 which makes this region the second after Europe in the proportion of countries implementing strategies. Nevertheless, this is also the region with the largest number of countries that have either taken no action or for which there is no informa- tion. The second part of this goal is concerned with revers- ing the loss of environmental resources \u2013 a long-term process that needs to start now. Progress here is also difficult to assess because of the breadth of the target and the lack of suitable data. This section focuses initially therefore on two areas where more data are available. The first is the proportion of land covered by forests. This varies enormously across the region: from 2 per cent of national territory in Afghanistan to 96 per cent in Cook Islands. Over the period 1990-2000, in the 48 countries reporting data the proportion of land forested increased in 13, remained unchanged in 17 and decreased in 18. It should be noted, however, that \u201cforests\u201d here include plantations, so the best- performing countries may have been establishing plan- tations for timber production using faster-growing va- rieties while allowing the proportion of natural forests that are high in bio-diversity to decline. The most rapid rates of deforestation have been in the Federated States of Micronesia, Myanmar, Indonesia and Malaysia. Figure I.10.

Indonesia, though, which also has a policy to protect its forests, has been unable to enforce it and has suffered from widespread illegal logging. Another, related indicator is the proportion of land that has been designated for protection in order to maintain biological diversity. No countries report that they have reduced this proportion so all would be considered as on track or early achievers. Intensive deforestation can also result in an increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as people burn wood and also remove the trees that can act as \u201ccarbon sinks\u201d. Between 1990 and 2002, average per capita CO2 emissions increased across the region from 2.2 to 2.5 tons. Of the 50 countries for which data are available, 30 are regressing, while 20 are early achiev- ers since they have managed to reduce output. Most of the increase in carbon dioxide production is the result of energy-intensive economic growth and particularly the burning of fossil fuels \u2013 as in China, for example, as well as in Malaysia and Thailand. However, most of the North and Central Asian States have reduced their emissions dramatically as a result of a contraction in economic activity and the shift away from heavy indus- try following the collapse of the Soviet Union. More impressive therefore is the achievement of Singapore, which, although it still has relatively high emissions, has been successfully reducing them by, among other things, switching from fuel oil to natural gas, enforcing strict vehicle emission standards and carrying out en- ergy audit programmes for industry, as well as encour- aging consumers to reduce their emissions through various \u201cgreen\u201d labelling schemes. Across the region, however, it will be important to step up advocacy for measures to prevent the devastation that can come from climate change. Figure I.11.

These pressures are bound to grow: the expansion of human populations and the increasing demands of both industry and agriculture are not only going to make water far scarcer they are also going to increase the dangers of pollution. While the problems of both water and sanitation vary greatly from one country to another, in almost all the developing countries there is a sharp contrast between urban and rural areas, both in current availability and potential solutions. 28 In the case of water, for example, by 2002 typically more than 90 per cent of urban dwellers had access to safe water. Of the 40 countries offering data, 31 were early achievers or on track and even those that were regressing had achieved quite high values: Nepal, for example, is regressing slightly but still has a coverage of 93 per cent. The lowest levels, around 80 per cent, were in the smaller Pacific islands such as the Marshall Islands, Kiribati and Palau, though this may be because the distinction between urban and rural areas is quite blurred. Of the large countries, coverage is also rela- tively low in Bangladesh, 82 per cent, and Papua New Guinea, 88 per cent. The situation in the rural areas is quite different, with coverage typically 10 to 20 percentage points lower. Nevertheless there has been progress and the rural- urban gaps have been narrowing. Of the 34 countries with data available, 11 are early achievers, 5 are on track and 18 are off track, of which 11 are regressing (figure I.13). Mongolia\u2019s lack of progress reflects its sparse popula- tion and poverty in the rural areas. But even relatively prosperous Thailand is failing to offer clean water to 20 per cent of its rural population; nor is it improving sufficiently quickly to meet the target by 2015. Figure I.13.

Myanmar (MMR) has already achieved its target; nevertheless, coverage is still only 74 per cent. Countries in the green zone are on track. Pakistan (PAK), for example, whose target is 89 per cent, is progressing at five or six times the rate needed to achieve it. Other large countries, like China (CHN), Indonesia (IDN) and Bangladesh (BGD), however, fall into the pink zone be- cause they are advancing too slowly at present to meet their targets by 2015. In Maldives (MDV) coverage slipped between 1990 and 2001 from 99 to 78 per cent. Notes: 1. For a more detailed explanation of these charts, see box I.1. 2.

The availability of good sanitation facilities is often lower than improved water supplies. For many coun- tries the main task in improving sanitation in both urban and rural areas is persuasion \u2013 convincing people of the value of sanitary latrines, since once they are convinced they need one, even the poorest house- holds should be able to afford the most basic systems. Indicators of major concern When it comes to meeting the MDGs each country will have its own priority indicators \u2013 but it should also be possible to identify those indicators that should be of greatest concern for the region as a whole. One approach would be to consider which indicators have the highest proportion of countries off track. This would of course be swayed to an unpredictable extent by data availability since while all countries provide the TRACKING THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC PRK 29 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH necessary data on TB, for example, fewer than one third provide data on the proportion of children reaching grade 5 in primary school. Bearing that in mind table I.7 offers a simple ranking which suggests that the most severe problems are in maternal mortal- ity and carbon dioxide emissions, with fewer problems in TB and in gender parity in education. Another ap- proach would be to rank the indicators according to the percentage of population in off track countries, though the resulting ranking would not offer much more information than would be gained just by look- ing at what is happening in China and India.

India (IND) still has relatively low urban coverage at 58 per cent, as does China (CHN) at 69 per cent. A notable performer among the early achievers is Myanmar (MMR), which between 1990 and 2002 increased urban coverage from 39 to 96 per cent and comfortably exceeded its target. Countries in the right zone are on track. This includes India (IND), which, despite the low coverage indicated in the figure above, is just progressing fast enough to be on target for 2015. Indonesia (IDN), China (CHN) and Bangladesh (BGD), however, are progressing too slowly and will probably only hit their targets after 2015.

These differences should, however, be con- sidered as reflecting the emphasis that the international community placed on these targets when setting them. A further concern about this ranking is that some of the countries that are off track on a particular indicator may be trying to improve on already respectable values \u2013 better perhaps than those of some countries that are on track. Sri Lanka, for example, has a lower rate of poverty than Pakistan, but while Sri Lanka is drifting away from its higher target, Pakistan has already achieved its lower one. One way of taking this into account is, for a given indicator, to compare the aver- age values of the off-track and on-track countries \u2013 if these are near each other, then all countries are more or less near the Asian average and so the countries that are off track do not face a serious problem. However, if the two averages are wide apart, then the countries that are off track are quite distant from the all-Asia average and so face a major challenge. In the case of TB prevalence, for example, the average values in the off-track countries are actually somewhat lower than those in the on-track ones, so the ratio between the two is less than one. For HIV prevalence there is a much wider gap: the prevalence in the off-track countries is more than five times greater than in the on-track ones, which indicates a far more serious problem. These two aspects of each indicator are illustrated in figure I.15, which groups each indicator into one of four clusters, according to the proportion of countries that are having some success with that indicator (early achiever or on track) and also the severity of under- achievement as expressed by the gap between success- ful and unsuccessful countries. Arguably the indicators of greatest concern for the region as a whole would be those in the top-right cluster since many countries are unsuccessful and are lagging far behind the others. Next, perhaps, would come those in the bottom-right cluster, which involves fewer countries, but these still lag some way behind. The fact that maternal mortality falls in the top-left cluster should not, however, dimin- ish its importance; indeed it partly reflects the fact that maternal mortality even in the on-track countries, at an average level of 342, is still unacceptably high, so for this case the measure chosen to indicate severity may not be appropriate. Countries of major concern This clustering also suggests a way of identifying the countries that are having particular difficulties with the MDGs. Of the 55 developing countries in the Asia- Pacific region around half are off track for more than half their indicators. This can, however, be narrowed down still further just by considering performance on the indicators in the high-priority cluster in figure I.15.

Five countries are not expected to achieve a single one of their targets for all high-priority indicators \u2013 Afghanistan, Timor- Leste, Papua New Guinea, Uzbekistan and Mongolia \u2013 and 14 others are off track for more than half of them. Analysis by subregion and level of development \u2013 LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS The analysis in this chapter has looked at the perfor- mance of individual countries on each indicator and then at the indicators as a whole to see which are of greatest concern across the region. This section will now focus on each subregion to highlight contrasts between countries that may have a number of similar characteristics but perform differently on the MDGs. It will also highlight three important categories of countries: least developed countries, landlocked devel- oping countries and small island developing States. These categories overlap somewhat \u2013 as indicated in table I.18. For each region there is a chart that shows for each country the proportion of indicators on which they are reporting and the proportion on which they are off track. The countries are then ranked by the proportion of indicators on which they are reporting and are off track. South and South-West Asia This is the poorest-performing subregion: the only one in which a majority of its countries, 6 out of 10, are off track for more than one third of their indicators. The slow progress here is largely because this region includes 5 of the LDCs \u2013 Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives and Nepal \u2013 3 of which are also landlocked and one of which is a small island develop- ing State. The ranking shows Nepal to be in a worse position than Afghanistan though, as is also evident from the chart. Afghanistan reports on only a small number of indicators \u2013 with no data on poverty and hunger, for example, or on education or water or sani- tation, on which it would certainly not fare very well.

Clustering the indicators by achievement and severity Each indicator is shown in two dimensions. Its position on the vertical axis represents the extent to which countries are unsuccessful with this indicator \u2013 the percentage that are off track. The horizontal axis indicates the severity of the problem in the off-track countries: using the ratio between their average values and those of the countries that are on track or are early achievers. On this basis, the indicators of most general concern would be those such as the infant mortality rate that fall into the top right cluster. The lines that delineate the clusters could be placed anywhere; those chosen here are on the vertical axis at the point beyond which 36 per cent of countries are off track and on the horizontal axis at the point beyond which the average value in the off-track countries is 50 per cent worse than in the on-track countries or early achievers. 32 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Afghanistan Timor-Leste Papua New Guinea Uzbekistan Mongolia Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Nepal DPR of Korea Maldives Tajikistan Kiribati Turkmenistan Azerbaijan Bangladesh India Pakistan Cambodia Myanmar Figure I.16.

South and South-West Asia, off-track indicators Most countries in South Asia, particularly some of the LDCs, will find it difficult to reach the majority of the MDGs. In this subregion, where around 60 per cent of workers still depend on agriculture for their liveli- hoods, growth has not been as fast as in other Asian countries and inequality is high, making it difficult to make inroads into poverty. Indeed, income poverty has gone up in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka and, on the basis of some evidence, in Pakistan as well. There are also concerns about the social indicators. Pakistan, for example, has the lowest primary enrol- ment rate in the whole region and has been making no progress in achieving gender parity. Moreover, apart from Sri Lanka, all the South Asian countries have under-5 or infant mortality rates above the Asian aver- age. For India, one of the biggest threats is HIV/AIDS. On a more positive note, the majority of South Asian countries should be able to achieve the targets on water and sanitation, and around half have also managed to halt deforestation. North and Central Asia This region has a high proportion of LLDCs, which have severe disadvantages because of their lack of territorial access to the sea, their remoteness and isola- tion from world markets and high transit costs. At the time of independence in 1990-1991 the Central Asian republics were middle-income countries with high lev- els of human development. The political and eco- nomic transitions since then have proved profoundly disruptive: between 1990 and 1995, per capita GDP nearly halved; social services were cut; and millions of people were plunged into poverty. In this region, achieving the MDG targets will in the first instance mean restoring earlier achievements. In recent years there has at least been stronger economic growth and GDP per capita is on average the highest in developing Asia-Pacific. Nevertheless education expenditure re- mains too low and public services generally are in a poor state. As figure I.18 shows, the countries of greatest concern are Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Armenia \u2013 all of them landlocked. The first two have high and increasing rates of malnutrition. In Armenia too the level of malnutrition is high, though here it is coming down. Educational standards have also slipped in a number of countries, with net primary enrolment fall- ing in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan \u2013 though, on the positive side, all the countries except Tajikistan have achieved gender parity at all levels of education. The virtual collapse of the social sector has also resulted in a general deterioration of health indica- tors; a number of countries have registered increases in infant mortality as well as in the prevalence of TB. And although the lack of data makes it difficult to draw overall conclusions, access to clean water and safe sani- tation have also become more difficult. 34 Pacific The countries of the Pacific are in many respects very different from most of those in the other subregions. The majority are SIDS and consist of scattered islands with fragile, overexploited environments, high popula- tion densities and poor infrastructure. Economically too they are vulnerable and per capita incomes have often been sustained by international investment and aid. Most people rely heavily on the public sector for the provision of goods and services and per capita health and education expenditures are generally high. Assessing progress towards the MDGs is hampered by the shortage of data. As figure I.19 shows, fewer than half the countries have data for the majority of indica- tors. None offers any information on poverty or hun- ger and few on education or gender. Papua New Guinea offers more information, though this shows that on most indicators it is off track \u2013 regressing on Tajikistan Uzbekistan Kazakhstan Armenia Azerbaijan Russian Federation Turkmenistan Kyrgyzstan Georgia 0 20 40 60 80 100 % indicator data available % off-track indicators Figure I.18.

South-East Asia, off-track indicators education, for example, and on water supplies and sanitation. Even on child mortality it is not making sufficient progress to be on track for 2015. It also faces a rising prevalence of HIV infection. Water supplies and sanitation are a problem in many Pacific countries with a number of them regressing, though Tuvalu is a notable exception; indeed for urban sanitation it is an early achiever. It should also be noted that many have managed to halt deforestation, the exceptions being Fiji, the Federated States of Micronesia, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands. South-East Asia This includes some of the more prosperous countries in the region along with some of the LDCs, so it is no surprise that success in the MDGs largely reflects this division, with Timor-Leste as the least successful and Singapore the most. Probably the most surprising feature of the figure I.20 is that Viet Nam, which is not classified as an LDC, is off track for a higher proportion of its indicators than is Cambodia, which is an LDC. This is largely because Viet Nam has fairly good values for many indicators but has not made much progress lately and in some cases has been sliding backwards. Thus for primary education Viet Nam has one of the highest enrolment rates in the region, but has slipped back to 94 per cent, hence is considered as regressing. Nevertheless there are some more urgent concerns in Viet Nam such as the rise in HIV prevalence. Cambodia, however, which through the 1990s experi- enced political instability, seems for one of the LDCs not to have done too badly. In some areas it has cer- tainly advanced, notably in turning the corner on HIV infection, but elsewhere its ranking may be boosted by the lack of data for some crucial indicators, including the $1-per day poverty line and access to water and sanitation. Child and infant mortality rates are also of great concern \u2013 already the highest in the region, bar Afghanistan. Timor-Leste, the subregion\u2019s only SIDS, and Myanmar also have high infant mortality rates, and along with the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Indonesia, the Philippines and Viet Nam, also have unacceptably high rates of maternal mortality. Another health concern is TB: prevalence in Timor-Leste, Cambodia and Viet Nam is the highest in the region. This subregion also has severe environmental prob- lems. Forest coverage is disappearing and carbon diox- ide emissions per head are rising rapidly: in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Thailand and Viet Nam, emissions per head have more than doubled. East and North-East Asia The experience of this region is dominated largely by that of China and its two special administrative re- gions. Over the past two decades, China has experi- enced very rapid economic growth that has lifted 168 million people out of poverty \u2013 but it has also faced rising income inequality and a widening gap between urban and rural areas. China is on track for, or has already achieved, three quarters of the indicators con- sidered. Where it is lacking is in access to water and sanitation; indeed the proportion of urban citizens with access to clean water actually declined over the 12- year period up to 2002 \u2013 not surprising, perhaps, given the country\u2019s rapid pace of urbanization. Another area of concern is per capita carbon dioxide emissions, which since 1990 have risen by 31 per cent. 36 The Republic of Korea has achieved most of the MDGs, though it too is lagging on environmental is- sues: per capita carbon dioxide emissions have risen by two thirds since 1990 and, although this is still one of the most-forested countries in the region, coverage has continued to decline.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc47ae13-7619-497b-9688-f0f1a0b87c65": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc47ae13-7619-497b-9688-f0f1a0b87c65", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce51ffbe5d77d4df0b8e39fb4d419a3cdb640df85698cc7b4893859cf971acc7"}, "2": {"node_id": "902aad30-f961-4435-bb80-eb5e4fdebf0e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be9da144e55d16db9a8f70365497f5af846e960ad7cfc08ea7f612e0cda30c69"}}, "hash": "ef726b82a196547176eea09aa5227b6eaf47bcc18654505c1d0fff5765172a0d", "text": "The Republic of Korea is also slow on one of the gender indicators \u2013 gender parity in tertiary education, where it ranks in the bottom quarter of all countries in the region.

It will also need to speed up progress on child mortality if it is to reach the goal by 2015. It has, however, done well on gender parity in education, for which it is an early achiever. For the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea it is difficult to assess progress since data are missing on almost half the indicators \u2013 including those on poverty and education. It is clear, however, that malnutrition has increased and that the country has made no progress in reducing child mortality. Gender disparities in MDG achievement A country\u2019s achievements on the MDGs give a good indication of how the nation is faring as a whole. However, national data often mask wide disparities within countries \u2013 between different regions and social groups. This uneven pattern of progress not only de- nies the rights of those people that it leaves behind, it also exacerbates structural problems and has a strong bearing on future national development \u2013 on its nature, its pace and its sustainability. One of the most serious and persistent disparities is between males and females. The MDGs do address this issue with respect to education \u2013 under Goal 3. The information available on Goal 3 presents a fairly positive picture in that many countries have achieved gender parity at the primary and secondary levels; in- deed in some countries secondary schools have more girls enrolled than boys. However, this goal fails to address many of the other dimensions of gender dis- parity. This section will attempt to fill some of the gaps with respect to health, employment and women\u2019s opportu- nities to control resources and the decisions that affect their lives. It should be emphasized, however, that this is based on rather limited information. Most national data are not disaggregated by gender: poverty, for ex- ample, is based on information at the household level and does not explore the often very different experi- ences of individual family members. Governments also consider some issues, such as violence against women, as too private or sensitive for public enquiry. Health The main overall health indicator is life expectancy. Women have a biological advantage that should on average enable them to live four or five years longer than men. An advantage of less than four years can be taken as a signal that women are being treated un- equally and probably that they are not getting fair and adequate access to health services. This would also incorporate the effects of high maternal mortality. The life expectancy gap would not, however, reflect the fact that in some countries selective abortion favours boys over girls. The position on the age gap and other health indica- tors is summarized in table I.9. Of the 46 countries in the region with the necessary data, 18 had a life expect- ancy gap of less than four years.

The Russian Federation is notable for a very high death rate among men which is due partly at least to lifestyle issues such as alcohol consumption and smoking. Table I.9.

Infant boys are biologically at greater risk than girls so if they do not get preferential treatment the ratio between the mortal- ity rates of boys and girls should be less than one. Of these 46 countries, 10 show rates that are abnormally high: 0.99 or above. In this case it is China that shows the highest level of discrimination, with a ratio of 1.3: the child mortality rate per 1,000 live births is 31 for boys, but 41 for girls. The neighbouring Republic of Korea shares a similar cultural attitude. Most South Asian countries also have high ratios: in Maldives, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Bhutan. Employment and wages Women\u2019s share of non-agricultural wage employment is lower than men\u2019s in every country. But it is strikingly low in some countries: in Bangladesh, for example, 24 per cent; in India, 17 per cent; in Turkey, 21 per cent; and only 9 per cent in Pakistan. Nor for most countries has the share been increasing significantly. It should be noted, however, that in a number of countries employ- ment data for women are not fully reliable, especially when they fail to cover casual, irregular or part-time work or subsistence activities. However, many of the women who are working are likely to be employed in family businesses, particularly in agriculture in the rural areas. In this case employ- ment will not be a good pointer to empowerment. A better indicator may therefore be the extent of women\u2019s participation in waged employment outside the agricultural sector \u2013 which tends to be in the urban areas and outside patriarchal controls. Figure I.22 shows this for a selection of countries \u2013 highlighting a relatively small proportion in a number of South Asian countries with the notable exception of Sri Lanka. Encouragingly, however, overall the proportion seems to be rising: among the countries reporting data, the average rose from 28.8 to 31.1 per cent. Only four countries reported falls.

In most Asian countries women working in the non-agricultural sector earn only around two thirds of men\u2019s incomes and in some cases less than half.

Women\u2019s wages as a percentage of men\u2019s in non-agricultural work, 1990 and 2000 Empowerment An important measure of women\u2019s empowerment is their status in employment, as it signals their access to ownership of assets, credit and markets. The presence of women in managerial positions is also a good indi- cator of women\u2019s general decision-making power in society. A number of these indicators are shown for a selection of countries in table I.10. This shows that women are clearly far less likely than men to be run- ning their own businesses, either as employers or as own-account workers. They are also less likely to be employed as legislators, senior officials and managers. Here, however, it is encouraging to note that, apart from Turkey and Pakistan, women in all these coun- tries made progress between 1996 and 2003. Table I.10.

This does not of course indicate how much power they have in the Government of the country. It is also quite volatile since it can change dramatically with a change of government. As figure I.24 indicates, only 6 countries had parliaments that had more than 20 per cent women, and only 2 had more than one quarter women. Surpris- ingly high on this list, given its slow progress on other gender indicators is Pakistan, though here the high representation of women may be due to the use of reserved seats for women in the national parliament. The most notable declines have been in former socialist countries, such as Armenia and Mongolia, where the 1990 figures were prior to their first democratic elec- tions; previously many of the women representatives would have been appointed rather than elected. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Viet Nam Turkmenistan Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic Pakistan China Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea Uzbekistan Singapore Philippines Republic of Korea Tajikistan Indonesia Azerbaijan Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Cambodia Russian Federation Georgia Bhutan Malaysia Thailand Fiji India Mongolia Samoa Maldives Nepal Armenia Sri Lanka Kiribati Turkey Iran (Islamic Rep. of) Vanuatu Bangladesh 1990 2005 Figure I.24.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb17c32d-282e-40a6-9a5e-5ab0d29d2c3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb17c32d-282e-40a6-9a5e-5ab0d29d2c3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ebb199bfebcf507471087879ca87c3ad3c8810d1ebf3a042c80c16db1988a9d7"}, "2": {"node_id": "930069d1-aec9-4672-8506-b4a85fc7ba01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "55688149e2952a30308410f3f257f0b194582e6ee2db75f69e4a6da865bb33dd"}}, "hash": "7bfa3b6250bbb497189f5eb446029286d8c808bd792ed2970984568d5412bbc0", "text": "of) Vanuatu Bangladesh 1990 2005 Figure I.24.

This is an issue of considerable concern for the Asia-Pacific region. Unfortunately there are insuffi- cient data for an extensive cross-country comparison, so this section is confined to 4 countries across a limited range of indicators. Proportion of people below the national poverty line For this indicator there are regional data for India, Indonesia and the Philippines. The extremes in pov- erty rates are illustrated in figure I.25, which shows the average poverty rate and the extremes for each country. India \u2013 In 1999-2000 the poverty rates ranged from less than 10 per cent in Jammu and Kashmir, Goa, Daman and Diu, Chandigarh, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi and Haryana to well above 40 per cent in the two poorest states, Orissa and Bihar. These disparities have persisted over time: the 10 poorest states in 1993-1999 were also the 10 poorest in 1999-2002. Indonesia \u2013 In 2002 the poverty rates were 11 per cent or less in the 5 richest provinces: Jakarta, Bali, South Kalimantan, Banten and North Sulawesi. But they were up to 42 per cent in the 5 poorest provinces: Papua, Maluku, Gorontalo, East Nusa Tenggara and Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam. Here too the disparities have per- sisted between 1992 and 2002: Jakarta remains by far the richest province, and the poorest remain Papua and Muluku with poverty rates above 40 per cent. Philippines \u2013 Paralleling Indonesia, in 2001 the main imbalance is similarly between the National Capital Region, with a poverty rate of 7.6 per cent, and the rest of the country, where it ranged from 21 per cent in Central Luzon to 63 per cent in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Between 1991 and 2001 there was no change in the ranking of the 3 richest regions and in 4 of the 5 poorest regions. 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 India India Indonesia Indonesia Philippines Philippines 1993-1994 1999-2000 1996 2002 1991 2000 Percentage of population below poverty line Figure I.25. Regional disparities in poverty rates, India, Indonesia and the Philippines The maximum and minimum values indicate the overall range but they do not capture distribution of poverty rates across the range: thus in principle there could be 12 very rich regions and 12 very poor ones. In fact poverty rates are distributed more evenly across richer and poorer provinces. This distribution across the regions can be captured by the \u201ccoefficient of variation\u201d (techni- cally, the standard deviation divided by the mean), which is high when the population is very polarized and low when most have similar values and the high and low values are exceptions. In India and the Philippines between the early 1990s and the turn of the millennium, while the national poverty rates went down the coeffi- cients of variation went up, indicating an overall widen- ing of disparities. In Indonesia, however, both the poverty rate and the coefficient of variation went down. Part of the problem is that the poorest regions are often not reducing poverty even at the national average rate. In India, for example, had the poorest-perform- ing regions done at least as well as the national average \u2013 reducing their poverty rate by the same proportion \u2013 the national average would have been almost 4 percent- age points lower, India would have had 39 million fewer poor people, and it would have reached its MDG target three years earlier. On the same principle, Indonesia would have had 2.7 million fewer poor people and instead of regressing it would have still have been off track but making slow progress. The Philippines too, on this basis, would have had a poverty rate 3 percentage points lower, 2.9 million fewer poor people, and would have been set to Note: This chart shows the average poverty rate and also the range of poverty rates across states in India, provinces in Indonesia and regions in the Philippines. 42 reach its MDG target more comfortably, rather than with just a few years to spare. Proportion of children underweight Here too the picture on disparities is not encouraging. For Bangladesh, India and Indonesia the poorest regions despite starting from a lower base are not improving even by the same proportion as the national average. The disparities in the proportion of children who are either moderately or severely underweight are illustrated in figure I.26.

Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Sikkim \u2013 small states in terms of population size \u2013 had rates below 25 per cent. Most of the states that had high rates in 1992-1993 continued to do so in 1998-1999. The exceptions were Sikkim, which improved its relative position by 25 places on a list of 36, and Rajasthan and Tripura, which lost 11 and 12 places respectively. Indonesia \u2013 In 2002, Yogyakarta and Bali had child malnutrition rates below 18 per cent while Gorontalo and Papua had rates above 40 per cent. However, Indonesia also demonstrates that regions that start out at the bottom do not need to stay there. Between 1992 and 2002 Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam, for example, almost halved the prevalence of underweight children and moved from close to the bottom to close to the top of the ranking. The only two provinces where the proportion rose were Central Sulawesi and Papua. As with poverty it is also possible to see what would have happened if the regions with the highest rates were able to reduce their rates by at least the same proportion as the national average. Bangladesh, which is already on track, though starting from a higher rate, would achieve the MDG target 3 years earlier. But both India and Indonesia, which at present are improving too slowly to hit the target on time, would actually achieve it 10 years earlier, and thus on time. Conclusion This brief survey has attempted to capture the progress of the countries of Asia and the Pacific to- wards the MDGs \u2013 highlighting which countries seem likely to succeed, and on which goal, and also looking across the region to see which goals overall need much closer attention. Many countries are evidently making good progress on poverty. This is encouraging, and hopefully many of the countries that are currently off track on poverty will be able to make up sufficient ground to hit the target by 2015. But it is notable that some of the countries that have had reasonable economic growth and are on target for poverty seem destined to miss other important goals related to education and health. Clearly, growth in national income and reduction in poverty, though necessary, are not sufficient. It is also vital to ensure that more of the country\u2019s resources are targeted towards achieving the MDGs. It is just as important, however, to consider the way in which these resources are invested and how progress towards the MDGs is shaped by the character and strength of national institutions. The next chapter looks more closely therefore at institutional change and specifically at the changes needed for better delivery of public services. 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Bangladesh Bangladesh India India Indonesia Indonesia 1996-1997 1999-2000 1992-1993 1998-1999 1992 2002 Percentage of children underweight Figure I.26.

The DESA database is continuously evolving; the data used include updates until 31 March 2005. The DESA database restricts the scope of analysis. First, it contains no data on indicator 18, HIV preva- lence among pregnant women aged 15-24 years, for countries in the Asia-Pacific region. This indicator has therefore been replaced with \u201cHIV prevalence, aged 15-49 years\u201d. Second, only one observation for each country is avail- able for indicator 3, the share of the poorest quintile in national consumption, indicator 17, proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel, and the two series covering indicator 21, prevalence and death rates associated with malaria. Data for indicator 3 have been obtained from the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators (WDI) database, as have data on the Gini coefficient, which is not part of the DESA database. Third, for some countries only one observation is available for specific indicators that are included in the analysis. These countries have been dropped from the analysis of those indicators. The results derived in chapter 1 should be interpreted with considerable circumspection.

A comparison over time and across countries may therefore not be warranted for each indicator. The sharp fluctuations within just a few years of the proportion of the population below $1 per day in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Pakistan, for example, are surprising, as are the find- ings on maternal mortality for a large number of coun- tries. Estimation procedures From a data analysis point of view, the chapter analy- ses two basic types of indicators. Indicators on pov- erty, enrolment rates, gender equality, mortality rates and access to water and sanitation are expressed in explicit quantitative targets. For these indicators, a his- torical annual rate of change is estimated for each country, and compared with the rate of change re- quired for the country to reach the target by 2015. The countries are then classified into four groups: \u2022 Early achievers: countries that have already met the target in the year of the latest observation, so that the required rate of change equals zero \u2022 On track: countries for which the (absolute) esti- mated rate of progress is larger than or equal to the (absolute) required rate of change \u2022 Slow progress: countries for which the (absolute) estimated rate of progress is smaller than or equal to the (absolute) required rate of change \u2022 Retrogressive: the sign of the estimated rate of progress is the opposite of the sign of the required rate of change For the remaining indicators, there is no explicit quan- titative target, so that no required rate of change can be calculated. The classification of countries is then based on the estimated rate of change alone: \u2022 Early achievers: countries for which the rate of change is positive (negative in case the target is to reduce from the baseline value) \u2022 On track: countries for which the rate of change equals zero \u2022 Retrogressive: countries for which the rate of change is negative (positive in case the target is to reduce from the baseline value) The historical rate of change is estimated by fitting a least-squares equation of the form: ln Xt = a +bt, where X is the value of the indicator, t is time and a and b are the parameters to be estimated. The esti- mated rate of change r is then obtained as: r = exp(b)\u20131, where b is the estimate of b. The regression equation is run twice: once on all the available data from 1990 onwards, and then on all the available observations from that year except the first. In case the signs of b differ, the value generated by the second run is used to calculate r. The reason for the dual run is that the first observation is often an outlier, reversing the sign of the rate of change of recent years. For countries not classified as early achievers, the re- quired rate of change r * is calculated as: r * = X* 1(2015-T) \u20131, XT where X * is the target value and T is the year of the last observation. For early achievers r * = 0. \u02c6 ( ) \u02c6 \u02c6 44 Achieving the MDGs ultimately depends on the ef- forts of communities, of families and of millions of individuals, whose determination, creativity and invest- ment of time and resources drive countries forwards \u2013 steadily building incomes and their capacity to develop and transform their own societies. But people should also be able to rely on support from their Govern- ments \u2013 to foster the institutions that will allow indi- vidual and community efforts to flourish while also taking responsibility for delivering or regulating the public services essential to the functioning of a mod- ern state. Institutions in this sense refer not just to specific orga- nizations, governmental or non-governmental, but also to the established patterns of behaviour \u2013 cultural, economic and social \u2013 the \u201crules of the game\u201d. These might be expressed formally in terms of laws or regu- lation or informally as accumulations of customs or conventions that have evolved to allow large numbers of people to live and work together, everything from languages to markets, from festivals to religions. The Asia-Pacific region has all of these institutions in rich profusion \u2013 and of every conceivable character II. Rethinking service delivery If the countries of the Asia-Pacific region are to achieve the Mil- lennium Development Goals they will need to invest sufficient re- sources. But funds on their own will not be enough.

Well-functioning institutions can help to accel- erate this progress towards the MDGs \u2013 especially those that are crucial for delivering health, education and other vital services to the poor. and scale. They include the whole spectrum of eco- nomic systems from the transition economies of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam to the free market economies of Singapore or the Repub- lic of Korea. They include thousands of languages, some spoken by many millions; others by just a hand- ful of people on small islands. And they include mul- tiple types of relationships between men and women, from the matriarchal systems of land inheritance in Bhutan to a number of countries in Central Asia where polygamous marriages are still evident. All of these institutions, which can both facilitate and obstruct progress towards the MDGs, have been de- veloped according to local situations. And they are constantly evolving to meet new conditions and op- portunities. In these circumstances there is no one optimum combination; rather, a complex and shifting variety. The task for a Government, whether through leadership, or advocacy or regulation is to try to ensure that these institutions change in ways that best serve the rights of all the country\u2019s people. At the same time, Governments themselves are institu- tions that have to reinvent themselves to meet their RETHINKING SERVICE DELIVERY 45 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH responsibilities. This means that fulfilling the MDGs will also require playing close attention to the quality of governance. This implies openness, transparency and determination to root out corruption. In addition, many countries in the region still lack staff of the capacity or calibre needed to accelerate progress \u2013 and this along with many other factors, including weak infrastructure, limits their \u201cabsorptive capacity\u201d \u2013 the ability to make the best use of new resources \u2013 whether generated locally, or from foreign investment or official development assistance. Governments will therefore need to consider many types of institutional change to make the best use of funds, function effectively and more generally to fulfil the \u201csocial contract\u201d that they have made with their citizens. This contract was echoed at the international level when all the world\u2019s Governments signed the Millennium Declaration that gave rise to the Millen- nium Development Goals, committing themselves to creating an environment \u201cconducive to development and to the elimination of poverty.\u201d Poverty means not just a shortage of income or assets but also a lack of what people need for full and satisfy- ing lives \u2013 good health, for example, education, and clean water supplies and sanitation, as well as the op- portunities and the power to participate in making the decisions that affect their daily life and work. All these aspects of poverty interact: without money it is diffi- cult to gain access to education and health care, but without education and good health it is difficult to earn a decent income. And without power it is hard to claim access to services \u2013 which in turn undermines personal dignity, self-esteem and the ability to gain the respect of others. One of the most direct ways in which Governments can address poverty \u2013 and meet the MDGs \u2013 is there- fore by ensuring the availability of services, either pro- viding them directly or sustaining a framework for provision through the private sector or civil society. This chapter, while accepting that achieving the MDGs will demand many kinds of institutional change, will therefore focus primarily on those changes required to produce services that meet the needs and priorities of all users, and especially the poor. Making services available The first task is to ensure that services are physically in place \u2013 that there is a network of schools, health facilities, and the necessary hardware for water supplies and sanitation. All countries in the region now have the basic infrastructure. Providing this is usually more straightforward in urban areas and in the more com- pact countries. It is a much greater challenge where the population is widely dispersed across difficult terrain or on small islands. In principle, a rights-based ap- proach demands that everyone be covered; in practice there are trade-offs as Governments weight up how much they are prepared to spend to achieve a given level of coverage. In some cases they will not extend services beyond the capital city \u2013 particularly for more sophisticated medical services, or for more advanced types of higher educa- tion. And they will also tend to initiate vital newer services such as the comprehensive response needed", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "194d9115-635b-4458-a586-a429c6ce476e": {"__data__": {"id_": "194d9115-635b-4458-a586-a429c6ce476e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "186f137361fa56d99d2dca49fc4f3220a96067a0bf8c77442987da43c9cbdee1"}}, "hash": "186f137361fa56d99d2dca49fc4f3220a96067a0bf8c77442987da43c9cbdee1", "text": "for the prevention, care and treatment of HIV/AIDS in the urban areas, leaving millions of rural dwellers for the time being to cope as best they can. Extending services raises questions of economic effi- ciency: Governments set priorities according to the range and the threshold, the range being the maximum distance they expect that people will travel to make use of a service and the threshold being the minimum number of users, or buying power, they consider nec- essary to make the service viable. This may be eco- nomically and politically rational but can result in wide disparities \u2013 typically between urban and rural areas. This is evident, for example, in the case of water supplies. While in urban areas coverage of improved water supplies is typically more than 90 per cent, in rural areas it can be 70 per cent or less. In the Asia- Pacific region as a whole, 670 million people lack ac- cess to improved water sources \u2013 most of them in the rural areas. Women suffer more from lack of services Even when services appear equally close to \u2013 or distant from \u2013 everyone in a given community, in practice inaccessibility hurts some groups more than others. Planners, who are usually men, tend to cater for an \u201caverage\u201d consumer who is probably a healthy rural male. As a result they may locate services out of reach of young children, for example, or the elderly or the dis- abled \u2013 and particularly of women who have different, and often greater, needs than men for most services: Health \u2013 Women tend to use health services on a more continuous basis than men. This is partly in order to care for their children \u2013 making sure they are vacci- nated against common diseases, for example, and that they receive prompt treatment for the regular illnesses of childhood, from diarrhoea, to malaria to acute res- piratory infections. But women will also be intensive users of services on their own account; when it comes to pregnancy and childbirth, for example, they rely on effective reproductive health services, including ante- natal care, and in the case of complications in child- birth on the availability of emergency obstetric care. 46 Education \u2013 Girls also have specific requirements from schools. A common problem for girls is that schools, and particularly secondary schools, may be far from their home. Parents will worry about the risks of a daily journey for their children, but particularly for adolescent girls, and as a result are more likely to keep them at home. Water supplies \u2013 Everyone needs water, but the lack of a ready supply hits hardest at women and girls because of the distribution of the workload in the household. First, because fetching water, often from long dis- tances over difficult terrain, is typically assumed to be a woman\u2019s job. Second, because women who are respon- sible for cooking and cleaning are the greatest water users. Third, because it is women who have to deal with the consequences of contaminated water when children or other family members fall sick. The lack of water thus puts a huge strain on women and also absorbs time that they could use for other purposes, for earning income, perhaps, or looking after children or for leisure and rest or, in the case of girls, for going to school. Sanitation \u2013 Inadequate sanitation is also a serious problem for women and girls, who need more privacy than men. Often they can get sufficient privacy by relieving themselves only when it is dark and may have to wake up before dawn to defecate in fields or at roadsides \u2013 when they also risk physical attack. Many women will limit their intake of food and water during the day so that they can wait until the evening. And in schools if there are no separate facilities for boys and girls, the girls may be kept from school. Quality The fact that the physical facilities are in place, of course, says nothing about the quality of the services on offer. In some cases there may be nothing at all: stories abound across the region of empty schools and abandoned clinics. To some extent this may be because Governments find it easier to raise funds from national resources, or from international donors, to build facili- ties than to find funds for subsequent running costs, especially if users do not or cannot contribute. Indo- nesia, for example, during the 1970s and 1980s suc- cessfully established an impressive network of health centres, the puskesmas, but although these were numer- ous the quality of services or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf4e6e8d-6d50-4a2a-a4f0-a1769f5fbd4f": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf4e6e8d-6d50-4a2a-a4f0-a1769f5fbd4f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ecab1f527be98c3218519eef047ca6480834d291a579ad975c7dbf93bded24dc"}}, "hash": "ecab1f527be98c3218519eef047ca6480834d291a579ad975c7dbf93bded24dc", "text": "provision did not match up to the original promise (BAS-Statistics Indonesia, BAPPENAS and UNDP, 2001). Services generally show deficiencies in terms of staff or supplies or in standards of supervision or quality control. Staff \u2013 A typical problem is a lack of staff in rural areas since it is difficult to recruit people to work in remote schools or clinics. In Sri Lanka, for example, many popular schools in the urban areas have sufficient teachers, or even a surplus, while others in remote rural areas face acute shortages. But even then the low sala- ries on offer may force teachers to take other jobs to survive, so they can frequently be absent from their posts. One study of 3,700 schools in India found that one quarter of teachers were absent at least part of the time \u2013 and that there were no mechanisms to monitor this or punish the truants (Ordonez and Sack, 2005). Another issue is the attitude of staff to users. Govern- ment staff can be arrogant or dismissive to those whom they are supposed to serve. Or if they come from the cities they can have difficulty in communicat- ing with rural people. There are also gender issues: in health services, for example, if all the staff are men, women will be reluctant to go there for examinations. Supplies \u2013 Clinics in rural areas frequently lack even the most basic medicines. This may be because of inad- equate national spending on the health system: in Myanmar, for example, per capita health expenditure is only $26 per year (UNDP, 2004). But stocks of effec- tive medicines are also affected by the priorities of international research efforts, which mean there are few affordable remedies for some of the commonest diseases such as malaria and TB. Globally, less than 10 per cent of the funding for health research is directed at improving the health of 90 per cent of the world\u2019s population (Global Alliance for TB Drug Develop- ment). Between 1975 and 1997, only 1 per cent of the drugs that reached the market were for tropical infec- tious diseases of most relevance to the poor in devel- oping countries (Global Forum for Health Research, 2004). Maintenance \u2013 A regular quality problem is that build- ings or infrastructure are poorly maintained. Again this may be due to a lack of investment. But it can also reflect a lack of local participation. At some point a local committee may have been established and trained to supervise a piped water supply for example. But if the committee members are not well motivated, or if they move from the area and are not replaced with newly trained people, water systems can become con- taminated or fall into disrepair. Standards \u2013 Poorly motivated staff and a lack of re- sources can also lead to low standards of service. For example, childbirth should be safer in hospitals than at home without a trained attendant, but often it is not, either because of low standards of hygiene, or the risks of hospital-acquired infections that are resistant to antibiotics. Similarly, standards of teaching can be RETHINKING SERVICE DELIVERY 47 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH inadequate. Classrooms are often overcrowded and hours are few. In Bangladesh, for example, average class size in primary schools is 59 children and contact time with pupils is around only two hours per day (Government of Bangladesh and United Nations, 2005). In addition many countries in the region rely on rote learning with children chanting from the black- board, rather than being encouraged to think for them- selves or to solve problems. Water supplies too can be of low quality or contaminated with substances like arsenic \u2013 a problem that affects over 200 million people in nine Asian countries. In urban areas of Asia more than half of water supplies also operate only intermittently which heightens the risk of contamina- tion (WHO and UNICEF, 2000). Matching local needs \u2013 Another common issue is that services designed or determined centrally may not be appropriate to local needs. Children in minority ethnic groups, for example, often have to learn in what might be their second or even third language. Thus, in Viet Nam, the main language of instruction is Vietnamese, which children in minority groups may not understand. In addition teachers in many countries work from a centrally planned curriculum with elements that either conflict with local customs or needs, or teach academic subjects that are irrelevant to local conditions rather than equipping children with vital life skills \u2013 and the ability to do the work needed in the rural areas.

In the case of services that affect health, there should be no compromise in the quality of es- sential services. But for some other services the situa- tion may be different: attempting to achieve very high standards can be wasteful and prevent wider coverage. A study in rural China, for example, found that when the authorities decided to replace village schools that were convenient for children and taught in local lan- guages but did not teach the full primary course, with more distant, complete schools this effectively ex- cluded many poor children, and those from ethnic minorities, particularly girls (Beynon and others, 2000). Similarly in the case of water supply it is possible to distinguish between the various purposes for which water is needed. Not all water requirements are for drinking. The bulk water needs in a household are for washing and cleaning, for which use of potable quality water may be wasteful. Water providers will under- standably want to offer high-quality supplies but in doing so may spend large sums that could have been used to provide less pure water to a larger number of people (Cairncross and others, 1999). This suggests that what is required is a flexible approach that can bring suitable services within reach of scattered populations. Bhutan, for example, despite its dramatic and vertiginous terrain, has managed to extend health services to 90 per cent of its population by creating a network of hospitals, basic health units and monthly clinics run by health workers who can within a day\u2019s walk reach them, complemented by village health volunteers. This still misses out some people such as yak herding families high in the Himalayas, but most of the seden- tary population have some access to health care. Financial barriers Many people will be unable to access services because they cannot afford them. This is most evident in the case of services provided by the private sector, where companies will want to recover costs and earn a profit \u2013 those running transport systems, for example, or private clinics or schools. But even government-provided services that are osten- sibly free can turn out to be expensive. Thus while primary education is free in most countries, parents will find themselves paying supplementary charges. In the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, as in many other countries, although parents do not have to pay fees they do have to find money for uniforms, books and supplies. Similarly in Kyrgyzstan parents and chil- dren are often subject to informal and unregulated charges for textbooks and other materials (Govern- ment of Kyrgyzstan, 2003). Patients in the \u201cfree\u201d health systems may also have to pay fees to nurses or doctors to receive treatment. Or discover that doctors will offer only a limited service in the public clinics that they will offer to supplement from their private practices. In China, for example, health-care providers get limited funding from the Government and in order to earn a living wage health- care workers rely heavily on charging user fees to pa- tients (Bekedam, 2004). People living with HIV/AIDS can also face severe problems since although the cost of antiretroviral treatment has come down it is still out of reach for the poor. Even urban water supplies, long thought of as a public good requiring essentially free provision, are increasingly being charged for. In addition to direct costs, there are also opportunity costs. If people have to travel a long distance, for example, or queue for hours to use a free service they will lose valuable income-earning opportunities or work time. Similarly, if people have to walk a long way to fetch water they will use up time that could be put to better use. In India, for example, women are thought to spend around 150 million working days per year carry- ing water, equivalent to a loss of around $200 million. 48 Poor families will also have to take into account the opportunity cost of sending their children to school. Households in many countries in the region rely on children to care for younger siblings, to do household chores such as fetching water and fuelwood, to work in the family fields or to engage in casual labour to supplement household incomes. In these circum- stances, sending them to school will imply significant short-term financial sacrifice. Legal barriers Many of the poorest families can have difficulty get- ting access to services because they do not have birth certificates.

Generally, rural parents are much less likely to regis- ter: in India the proportion of children registered in urban areas is 54 per cent but in rural areas it is only 29 per cent (UNICEF, 2005). Parents may fail to register births simply because they are unaware of the importance of this. But they can also be dissuaded by the costs if the system is highly centralized and they have to travel to a registration office. This may cause them to delay the process until they are convinced that the child will survive, or to miss it altogether. Then if they later discover that they should have registered their child they can be further discouraged by the prospect of paying a fine. However, there can also be political reasons for non-registration. Ethnic minority parents who distrust the central Gov- ernment may not wish to have their details known. Even when children originally had a birth certificate, poor or migrant families may not have anywhere to store it, so it can become lost or damaged and require an expensive replacement. The lack of a birth certificate can prevent children from getting access to school or to free health services. In Nepal, for example, a birth certificate is not offi- cially mandatory for a child who wants to enter school, but school principals frequently insist on this. And even if a school principal allows a child without a birth certificate to attend school, he or she may not allow the child to use free books, or to sit examinations or attend higher education (Plan International, 2005). The lack of vital registration systems can also have implications for the planning of services. If the age of the child population is unknown this makes it difficult to plan education services effectively. Also, many countries in the region do not have efficient systems for registering deaths. This makes it more difficult to know, for example, what maternal mortality rates are \u2013 and thus to estimate how much will need to be invested to save women\u2019s lives. Similarly with many immigrants unregistered it is difficult to assess the scale of their needs; following the Indian Ocean tsunami, for ex- ample, it will probably never be known even how many unauthorized immigrant workers died. In increasingly complex urban societies, families now need a host of other documents in their daily lives. If they do not have citizenship or other official papers they may not only be harassed by law enforcement officials but be denied access to services. Thus unregis- tered squatter families who lack building permits will find that they cannot be connected to an urban water supply, even though they could afford to pay. Among those least likely to have sufficient documents are ru- ral-urban migrants. This may be because they think they are only staying temporarily and do not wish to transfer their registration, but even those who intend to stay can have problems. In China, for example, millions of immigrants to the largest cities lack the permits that would allow them full access to services. In Mongolia too, migrant women have difficulty gain- ing access to health services (Government of Mongolia, 2004). In practice, however, security of tenure is frequently less a legal issue than a political one. Often the only way for many people in informal settlements to protect themselves against eviction is to pay politicians or hired thugs. Similarly, the way to get services may be for local leaders to ally themselves with powerful people outside the settlement, promising votes in ex- change for services. Local service providers, such as water vendors, may also have to seek patronage or protection and will pass the costs on to users. Sociocultural barriers Services in principle are available to all, but certain groups typically get inferior treatment, or are excluded altogether. Gender discrimination The largest category facing discrimination, though they can scarcely be considered a \u201cgroup\u201d since they consti- tute half the population, are women. Females even from birth can be excluded from health services in countries that show a strong preference for sons. In South Asia, for example, infant mortality rates for girls are 30 to 50 per cent higher than those for boys \u2013 a result in many cases of parents giving girls less care within the home and also of their being slower to seek medical attention for girls when they fall sick. One study in India, for example, found that for childhood illnesses, girls are 1.5 times less likely to be hospitalized than", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9956c8fe-ff3c-4803-8eac-662cbb18ec3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "9956c8fe-ff3c-4803-8eac-662cbb18ec3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "892a6aebc5529e78781b7f3770bdfa8777545ad75bc7ad60faca650a6758e786"}}, "hash": "892a6aebc5529e78781b7f3770bdfa8777545ad75bc7ad60faca650a6758e786", "text": "boys (WHO, 2005). Girls can also be poorly fed RETHINKING SERVICE DELIVERY 49 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH and grow up to be undernourished mothers who de- liver underweight babies in an intergenerational cycle of malnutrition. Girls, too have historically been less likely to be sent to school \u2013 in some cases because parents consider them a less worthwhile investment, since they can have a lower earning capacity, and in any case will leave the family home at marriage. While most countries have reduced the educational disparities between boys and girls at the primary level, disparities persist in a number of countries at the secondary level: in Tajikistan in 2001, for example, while 63 per cent of boys com- pleted secondary school, only 38 per cent of girls did so (Government of Tajikistan, 2003). Ethnic minorities Many countries in the region have ethnic minorities who have less access to services than the rest of the population. In Viet Nam, for example, primary educa- tion enrolment rates of children from ethnic minori- ties have on average been almost 10 percentage points lower than those of the majority ethnic Vietnamese population and the disparities rise the higher they go up the education system (Government of Viet Nam, 2002). Similarly in Cambodia, while the national adult literacy rate is 68 per cent it is only 27 per cent in Ratanakiri, a province with many ethnic minorities (UNICEF, 2003). People living with HIV/AIDS Even people within the mainstream population who have contracted HIV/AIDS can face discrimination when it comes to the use of public services. A survey in 2004 in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand found that one quarter of respondents told of dis- crimination by health-care workers, 15 per cent had been refused treatment or care and 17 per cent had ex- perienced delays in the provision of health care. And many people found that once their condition became known they were actually turned away from health centres (APN+, 2004). One major concern for people living with HIV/AIDS is that health-care workers will not respect their right to anonymity \u2013 and thus deter them from being tested or receiving treatment. Some HIV-positive mothers, who know they may transmit the virus to their babies, will nevertheless breastfeed them to avoid being identified as HIV-positive. Dis- crimination is also common with education systems \u2013 both for pupils and teachers. People with disabilities Over 200 million people in the region are thought to be living with disabilities, of whom over 40 per cent are living in poverty (ESCAP, 2002). Their numbers are particularly high in post-disaster areas and in post- conflict countries like Afghanistan, Cambodia, Timor- Leste and Viet Nam. People with disabilities have the same needs for health and educational services as other people, but face more challenges in securing access due to physical and social barriers. Despite improvements in legislation, people with disabilities often experience discriminatory practices and deep-rooted stigmatiza- tion. In Afghanistan, for example, at least 4 per cent of the population are disabled and are generally margi- nalized and among the poorest sections of the popula- tion (Government of Afghanistan and UNDP, 2004). Women with disabilities are among the most margi- nalized of all, as they have multiple disadvantages through their status as women and as people with disabilities. Available evidence suggests that fewer than 10 per cent of children and youth with disabilities in the region have access to any form of education, compared with an enrolment rate in primary education of over 70 per cent for non-disabled children and youth. Most educa- tion facilities for children and youth with disabilities are concentrated in special schools in urban areas, while most people with disabilities live in rural areas. Other problems include a lack of early identification and intervention, negative attitudes, exclusionary poli- cies and practices, inadequate teacher training and in- flexible curricula and classes. Accommodating children with disabilities in regular schools means removing physical obstacles and arranging suitable transport. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic is one of the more advanced countries in this respect with facilities in 78 schools in 12 of 18 provinces (UNESCO, 2001). Socially unaccepted or illegal groups Other groups that face legal barriers in getting access to services are those whose behaviour is either consid- ered socially unacceptable or is illegal \u2013 which could include men who have sex with men, injecting drug users or sex workers. They may have difficulty getting access to appropriate health services generally, but par- ticularly to services that could help to slow the spread of HIV/AIDS, such as the distribution of condoms or clean syringes \u2013 even though they may", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95e417af-bc88-4591-b713-fafced42f7a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "95e417af-bc88-4591-b713-fafced42f7a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc4b9a82b4e57ec394f5d12366e72862b97016d5466af0e1149c8b2eee069614"}}, "hash": "fc4b9a82b4e57ec394f5d12366e72862b97016d5466af0e1149c8b2eee069614", "text": "subsequently qualify for antiretroviral treatment. Political barriers The responsibility for ensuring adequate services clearly lies with Governments. Citizens surrender many of their rights to Governments in exchange for the right to protection and preservation. These rights have been asserted, for example, in the Universal Dec- laration of Human Rights, article 25 (1) of which states: \u201cEveryone has the right to a standard of living 50 adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sick- ness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.\u201d At the Millennium Summit, countries reaffirmed their sup- port for upholding the respect for the rights of all without distinction to race, sex, language or religion and promised to spare no efforts to safeguard civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. In the past many people have, however, made a distinc- tion between the political rights, which financially are relatively easy to fulfil, and social and economic rights, which can be much more expensive. Political rights require the State and others to desist from persecuting people so need not imply any great financial burden. Fulfilling the social and economic rights may require considerable expenditure, on education, for example, or health \u2013 which, it is argued, can only be fully deliv- ered in richer countries, where standards of living are higher and the Government has sufficient tax rev- enue. However, fulfilling the social and economic rights is not as daunting as it might seem \u2013 since it is possible to unpack the duties into several discrete components. In this view, Governments have four types of obligations: to respect both political and property rights; to protect these rights from abuse by others; to facilitate by build- ing infrastructure, say, or running public health cam- paigns, so as to improve people\u2019s capacity to raise their own standards of income or health; and finally to fulfil the rights of those who cannot meet their own needs by acting as the provider of last resort. These distinctions help take the edge off Govern- ments\u2019 fears of unlimited liability. Most Governments would willingly accept the first three types of duty. And in extreme circumstances they also take on the duty to fulfil; no democratic Government can now allow any of its citizens to starve to death in public. It is clear therefore that Governments and citizens have considerable leeway when it comes to providing or claiming services. As a result, deciding levels of service provision is essentially a process of political negotiation. On the one hand governments will decide what they can afford and choose to whom they will give priority. On the other hand citizens will either have to accept this or try to claim their rights to services which they are being denied. Generally, however, this process of negotiation results in much better services for the rich and powerful \u2013 and also for urban dwellers, who tend to be better orga- nized and more able to put pressure on Governments. The poorest citizens, living in remote areas, far from the seats of power and with no political or other forms of organization, are usually excluded; they may not even know what their rights are, still less be in a posi- tion to assert them. They may also internalize this sense of powerlessness, feeling that they have no right to a say. This would extend both to national-level poli- tics, where they have no say over the budgetary process that determines what proportion of national income goes to social services and to the local level, where even elected and other assemblies are dominated by local elites. How can the rights of the poor be fulfilled? One of the most general requirements is a high standard of governance \u2013 to ensure that public services are deliv- ered in an efficient, transparent and honest fashion. At present that is a distant prospect in many countries. Corruption remains a major problem across the re- gion, where bribery and favouritism can increase the cost of public works programmes by up to 50 per cent. This is common in education, for example, not just at the top level in diverting funds that should be used for buildings, equipment or supplies, but also at the local level when teachers can demand bribes from parents for school entrance or for good exam results or for books that should be provided free. Good governance is therefore one of the primary requirements.

These can be considered under a series of headings. The first would cover the range of providers who should be delivering the services; coun- tries are likely to deliver services more effectively if they broaden the range of options. A second would cover the various barriers to access and consider how these might be reduced or removed. A third would consider the political factors \u2013 to see how the poorest users might be empowered to demand and receive better services. Broadening the range of providers In most countries the main provider of basic services \u2013 particularly health, education and water supplies \u2013 is the Government. Where the Government, at the na- tional or local level, does indeed provide a good service it should continue to do so. Where it cannot do so, however, it should consider involving others, including private sector and community groups, not just to in- crease overall capacity but also better to meet the re- quirements of many different types of users. The rela- tive strengths and weakness of each of these providers may be summarized as follows (Osborne and Gaebler, 1993). RETHINKING SERVICE DELIVERY 51 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH Public sector \u2013 Governments are in a strong position to use the political process to set priorities, ensure equity and prevent discrimination. They can raise public funds to provide universal services \u2013 what are often termed \u201cpublic goods\u201d. However, they can also be overly bureaucratic and their staff may feel little incen- tive to respond flexibly to the needs of users. Private sector \u2013 Private operators tend to be more effi- cient at economic tasks \u2013 abandoning unsuccessful or obsolete activities while also innovating and replicating successful ones. They can thus adapt to rapid change and, since they are paid by results, they have an incen- tive to be responsive and customize services to the needs of users. However, since they will be seeking profits they will tend to concentrate on the lucrative markets where risks are low and there are ready rev- enues \u2013 and thus will generally ignore the needs of the poor. Civil society \u2013 Groups in civil society tend to be best at performing tasks that demand compassion and com- mitment to individuals, require extensive trust on the part of customers and clients and need hands-on, per- sonal attention. Their weakness is that they tend to operate on a small scale through stand-alone projects and can be overly dependent on external, and often foreign, funds. They may also lack a strong system of accountability either to their users or to donors. The challenge for Governments which wish to fulfil the rights of their citizens is therefore to find the optimum combination of providers who can provide the most complete and responsive service at the best price. Private sector provision Most countries have a range of private companies which will provide services that parallel the public ones. Often these have arisen because of deficiencies in public provision: either in quality because rich users would prefer more exclusive, high-quality treatment \u2013 or because there is no public provision at all. Although private provision is more extensive for the rich, it is also available to the poor, but only for services for which they can make small payments as they go along rather than having to pay large accumulated bills on fixed dates. Probably the most dramatic example of private sector service provision in recent years has been the expan- sion of mobile telephones. Here private providers have met a need that fixed public networks could not satisfy. This has made phone services much more available to the poor, either directly if they can afford a handset, or indirectly by using the phones of individuals who have set themselves up as mini-service providers. Grameen Phone, for example, a Bangladeshi company that is an offshoot of the Grameen Bank, is now the country\u2019s largest mobile phone provider. Poor women buy a handset with a loan from the Grameen Bank and then sell calls to users. Private provision can also be quite extensive in health care. In Indonesia, for example, private expenditure accounts more than four fifths of total spending on health \u2013 even the poorest fifth of the population use private services more than public services (BPS-Statis- tics Indonesia, BAPPENAS and UNDP, 2004). Simi- larly, in India, 80 per cent of households use the private sector in the case of minor illnesses and 75 per cent for major ones (WHO, 2001a). There is also significant health provision through the informal sector, particu-", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cecfffda-ea7f-4a33-9f5e-13d3f6344144": {"__data__": {"id_": "cecfffda-ea7f-4a33-9f5e-13d3f6344144", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f924ee252833940671c0b843a4ae543357758473809ccef60d94251164c92ac5"}}, "hash": "f924ee252833940671c0b843a4ae543357758473809ccef60d94251164c92ac5", "text": "larly for traditional medicine \u2013 though in a number of countries, including Bhutan and China, such traditional medicine is also provided through the public sector. Private education is less extensive \u2013 but is growing \u2013 from kindergartens to private universities. Even in the more advanced countries of the region, private provid- ers still account for a minority of schools: in Thailand, for example, they make up around 18 per cent of primary and secondary schools (Government of Thai- land, 2004). Private provision is often greater at the higher levels: thus in the Philippines 80 per cent of college and university students attend private institu- tions (Tooley, 2001). Private schools need not just be for the poor. In Andhra Pradesh in India the Federa- tion of Private Schools\u2019 Management has 500 private schools \u2013 with classes ranging from kindergarten to grade 10 \u2013 whose pupils come from poor villages and urban slums. Schools charge the pupils between Rs 25 (60 cents) to Rs 150 per month (about $3.50) and in addition offer up to 20 per cent of their places free to the poorest students (Tooley, 2000). In water supplies private involvement has historically been relatively limited. But in recent years there have been a series of partial privatizations of services in cities such as Jakarta, Phnom Penh and Manila. These have involved \u201cpublic-private partnerships\u201d in which the assets, including the network of pipes, belong to the State, which also sets the regulatory framework. The private sector then builds and operates the facility typically with a contract that runs over several decades and that sets out issues such as service quality and tariffs. Although these have improved water supplies for many people they have also created considerable controversy \u2013 particularly when companies have raised their tariffs \u2013 though these high tariffs have often been imposed by the Governments rather than by the pri- vate sector. 52 Faced with lack of services from either the Govern- ment or private utilities, especially in large urban settlements, many people have to rely on the informal sector. Small-scale entrepreneurs can provide water, often in carts or trucks to areas that have no piped supplies. This involves minimum investment in fixed capital and since the entrepreneurs are close to the community they can tailor their services to the needs of the poor and rely on informal enforcement mecha- nisms for payment. These more informal methods of distribution can nevertheless operate on quite a large scale. One family business in Manila, for example, provides water to 14 areas. This works on a pyramid system in which water from the central city supply is piped to water managers in the community, each of whom covers around 200 households, selling water to them via metered pipes or in 200-litre containers. In Sri Lanka, a similar system has been used to develop water supplies for poor communities in Colombo (box II.1). Box II.1. A pro-poor public-private partnership in Sri Lanka In Halgahakumbura, a squatter settlement in Colombo, 600 families used to receive their water through public standposts. But because the water was free, it was often wasted and the service generated no revenue for the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB). The quality of the service was also poor and people wasted time queuing and carrying water home. Establishing house connections had been considered too costly and risky because it was not clear whether people would be willing or able to pay. In 2004, under an ESCAP project, NWSDB entered into a partnership with the community, a small private company and a local NGO. The NGO first consulted the community to see to what extent they would take ownership of the scheme and be willing to pay. When this proved positive the company was awarded a concession to lay pipes in the settlement, install individual water connections and distribute water to households. The company now buys the water in bulk from NWSDB at a price set by the bidding process and then charges users for it at the official rate. Because the company is small and has low operating costs, it can make a profit on small margins. It has also opened an office close to the community to facilitate payments and deal with customers.

Informal provision has its weaknesses. Providers have little access to capital and although they have low fixed costs their labour-intensive procedures lead to higher marginal costs, so their charges can be high. Neverthe- less a study of small-scale water providers in eight Asian cities did not find any indications of profiteering or exploitation (ADB, 2004c). In addition to large-scale public private partnerships, which have had mixed results for the poor, it is also possible to create less formal partnerships, where the public sector can help to create a demand for services that the private sector can then meet. This has been demonstrated in sanitation, for example, which has a soft component in raising awareness for behaviour change and a hard component in the provision of systems. Once the Government has helped create a demand for low-cost systems the private sector can step in and meet it. In Myanmar, for example, the Government embarked on a massive social mobiliza- tion programme: between 1996 and 2000 it imple- mented a campaign by health workers in 174 town- ships, and from 1998 it has organized an annual Na- tional Sanitation Week. In response the private sector was able to take advantage of these efforts by produc- ing many thousands of plastic toilet pans and selling them at affordable prices. The actual construction of latrines was almost entirely the responsibility of house- holds, which either installed them themselves or hired local builders. Civil society provision Responding to weak or inappropriate government- provided services, many organizations of civil society, whether community organizations or NGOs, have stepped in either to fill the gaps or to provide alterna- tive models. NGOs have the advantage that they are very flexible and can complement government services. However, in most countries they are typically on a small scale and offer services that are valuable but fragmented. Al- though some work on the basis, for example, of user payments or of types of mutual assurance often they remain dependant on external funding. RETHINKING SERVICE DELIVERY 53 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH A number of Governments in the region have never- theless recognized the strengths of NGOs and have worked in partnerships with them to extend public services. In Bangladesh, for example, the NGO BRAC works with the National TB Programme in 60 thanas covering a population of 14 million people. BRAC trains young women to become community voluntary health workers \u2013 resulting in an impressive 92 per cent completion rate for TB treatment. BRAC\u2019s health work- ers have also worked with the Government to extend the reach of child immunization programmes (WHO, 2001b). In Cambodia, too, there have been successful experiments in contracting health delivery in remote areas to NGOs. These resulted not just in a greater take- up of services but in savings for the users; people in contracted-out districts lost about 15 per cent less time on illness and seeking health care compared with people in other districts (Bhushan and others, 2002). In addition, Governments have been able to enter into partnerships with community organizations. In Sri Lanka, for example, the National Housing Develop- ment Authority provided local communities with funds and technical assistance to build public toilets and other facilities. This practice has now been adopted by local bodies \u2013 on the grounds that local people are best placed to decide on where the facilities should be and how best to look after them. If a par- ticular community does not have the labour or skills to do the work itself it can still have it done by a contrac- tor or by another community that has already done such work (Pathirana and Yap, 1992). Another striking example of this is the Orangi Pilot Project in Pakistan, which started with the construction of a sanitation system in an informal settlement and has since ex- panded to other areas with health and other services (box II.2). Box II.2. Orangi Pilot Project The Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) was launched in 1980 by Akhtar Hameed Khan, a social scientist, to offer the 1.2 million inhabitants of the largest informal settlement in Karachi, Pakistan, more opportunities to improve their own living conditions \u2013 recognizing that neither the Government nor non-governmental organizations alone had the capacity to solve problems on the scale required, but that more progress could by made by taking advantage of the resources and knowledge of communities. After extensive consultation, house owners in Orangi expressed their willingness to assume responsibility for the construction and maintenance of a community sanitation system that could", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac838e28-a523-498a-a7f1-064d915d97bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac838e28-a523-498a-a7f1-064d915d97bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c32d41107a0226328f3e56a2804879396629962237f8e1e8cf3ad4b2744df30"}}, "hash": "9c32d41107a0226328f3e56a2804879396629962237f8e1e8cf3ad4b2744df30", "text": "be linked with the government-provided trunk sewers and treatment plants. They organized themselves in lanes of 20-40 houses \u2013 groups small enough to build mutual trust but large enough to introduce economies of scale \u2013 and paid for and constructed an efficient and effective system of sewerage for 90,000 families. Among other things this has contributed to a significant reduction in disease and a decline in infant mortality. OPP has since evolved into an internationally known community development movement and has expanded into health and family planning, building technology, education, and credit and income generation. The model has also been adapted in other settlements in Karachi and elsewhere in Pakistan and it has influenced development approaches internationally. OPP has clearly demonstrated how Governments and communities can work well together by dividing their responsibilities, the Government taking on the more technically complex large-scale construction of main drains and treatment plants that are essentially public goods, while local communities and households invest in the infrastruc- ture close by that benefits them directly. Critics have argued that this model provides Governments with an excuse for not providing services. OPP responds that communities should only be asked to do the \u201cinternal\u201d development, while the \u201cexternal\u201d work should be done by the Government. This requires, however, that the Government be prepared to recognize work done by community organizations in extralegal settlements. Overcoming access barriers As well as taking a more flexible approach to service provision Governments can also attempt to address some of the barriers that deny the poor access to services \u2013 trying to reduce financial and legal barriers while also adapting services to make them more acces- sible to poor users. Removing economic barriers Many people do not get services simply because they cannot pay or because the opportunity costs of using services are just too high. This not only denies the rights of individuals to services but also damages the pros- pects of the country as a whole \u2013 since future progress in human development depends on a healthy and well- 54 educated population. Most Governments accept this and agree that everyone should have access to primary education, basic health care (for example Thailand, box II.3) and adequate water and sanitation. They would also agree that costs to households should not be a barrier \u2013 since education, for example, brings benefits to the country as a whole. ILO has, for example, calculated that over a 20-year period the economic benefits to Nepal of 100 per cent school enrolment would be double the costs of lost child labour wages (Gilligan, 2003). Never- theless, countries find it difficult to work out the best arrangement for achieving universal access. RETHINKING SERVICE DELIVERY Box II.3. Thailand\u2019s 30 baht health scheme Thailand has become one of the first middle-income developing countries to introduce a universal health-care system. Previously it had six health insurance schemes that covered around 80 per cent of the population, but these tended to overlap and were not very equitable. In 2001, however, Thailand introduced a new scheme to provide all citizens with equal access to health care and protect them from financial losses due to illnesses. This also marked a shift of funding from large urban hospitals to primary health care. Users pay only 30 baht (75 cents) per visit, though the poor pay nothing at all. The benefit package includes inpatient and outpatient treatment at a registered primary care facility and referral to secondary and tertiary care facilities, as well as dental care, health promotion and prevention services, ambulance fees and drug prescriptions. By 2004, 47 million people were getting health security from the 30 baht scheme and 13 million from other schemes \u2013 meaning that 99 per cent of the Thai population are now covered. The scheme has proved very successful and user satisfaction is high. The main difficulty is long-term financial sustainability. Some hospitals have incurred large debts because, among other things, the number of people covered has increased much faster than the budget allocation. To reduce the financial burden and staff shortages, particularly in the rural areas, the Government has, however, started to provide additional funding to cover 21 per cent of the salaries of health workers in public health facilities. Free services \u2013 The simplest option would be to supply all such services free. This may, however, result in considerable wastage \u2013 of water, for example. More- over, even the poor may actually prefer to make some payment so as not to appear second-class citizens \u2013 especially if this entitles them to superior and timelier service.

General subsidies \u2013 In this case the charges are reduced for all users of the service. The charges still have to be at a significant level, since collecting small sums may cost more than the revenue. But even where charges are at a more viable level a subsidy across the board can be inefficient since it covers the whole population, poor and non-poor \u2013 and in most countries in the region the poor are actually in a minority. Variable subsidies \u2013 This involves a variable tariff that increases with the number of units used, on the as- sumption that the poor will be low-volume users. This \u201cincreasing block tariff\u201d has, for example, been used for water supplies in Bangalore, India, and in Kathmandu, Nepal; it helps at least some of the poor who have taps in their homes though in fact those who gain most are the non-poor (ADB, 2004c). Targeted subsidies \u2013 This can be done, for example, by issuing cards or vouchers to the poor to entitle them to free or reduced services. However, it is difficult to identify the target group accurately, particularly the poorest of the poor, who may be \u201cinvisible\u201d and diffi- cult to reach. This is the approach typically taken with food subsidies, though the targeting is not generally very precise since vouchers and cards also finish up in the hands of the non-poor and often do not reach the poor at all. One study of the food distribution system in India, for example, found that they covered between 34 per cent and 52 per cent of the non-poor and excluded between 24 per cent and 98 per cent of the poor (World Bank, 2003). Self-targeting \u2013 This involves providing a service that only the poor are likely to use. For food distribution, for example, this can be achieved by subsidizing the type of food the poorest are most likely to eat \u2013 such as the lower grades of rice. In the case of urban water supplies, one way of targeting is to make water free only from public tap-stands. Community-based insurance \u2013 Wealthier patients can often buy insurance policies to meet unexpected health bills. For community health schemes, for example, this works rather like standard health insurance, except that the 55 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH schemes are small, affordable and community-man- aged. They have been introduced by the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and by the NGO, SEWA, in India, as well as in Cambodia, India and Viet Nam. These provide some coverage but they can be expensive to run, suffer from poor management and also offer a small risk pool so a general epidemic in that community would soon exhaust the funds. Some of these disadvantages could, however, be overcome by networking the schemes or by linking them to formal systems. As well as reducing the direct costs of services in these ways, Governments can also attempt to reduce the opportunity costs of services \u2013 particularly the time taken to reach them. The most direct way of doing this is by extending the network to bring services closer to communities. But it is also possible to consider mobile services, such as satellite or outreach clinics that might reach distant villages once a month. Alternatively, Gov- ernments can consider investing in better-integrated and more affordable transport networks. Government can also address the opportunity cost of sending children to school. One option is to provide free school meals as an incentive for attendance. In India, for example, the National Mid-day Meal Programme has improved nutrition and the learning achievements of school-going children and, more importantly, their en- rolment and attendance in schools (Government of India, 2002). Bangladesh has gone further with a Food for Education Programme that gives a monthly food ration to families who send their children to school; the families can either consume the food or sell it for cash. This too has been shown to boost attendance, especially by girls (Ahmed and del Ninno, 2002). Removing legal barriers Many poor people cannot get access because they lack the official identity papers that entitle them to health or education services. This is often the case for rural- urban migrants or for unauthorized migrants from other countries. Thailand, which is thought to have at least 1 million migrants from Myanmar and elsewhere, has addressed this through a Migrant Health Project working with NGOs and the International Organiza- tion for Migration to offer accessible and culturally sensitive health services, including treatment for TB and HIV/AIDS (IOM, 2001).

India, for example, has a well-estab- lished national registration campaign operating in 15 languages across almost every medium from TV spots to posters, to stickers, to billboards. The Philippines too conducts a mass campaign every February \u2013 desig- nated \u201ccivil registration month\u201d (UNICEF, 2002). People in urban slum areas also have problems getting official connections to water or electricity supplies. If they cannot demonstrate ownership of a property then neither public nor private utility companies will contem- plate connecting them. One option is to integrate extra- legal agreements into a single formal system. However, this needs to be done carefully if it is not to undermine the existing system; as arrangements become more formal so the value of property rises and could be pushed beyond the reach of many people. Instead the aim should be to build bridges between the legal and extralegal systems, so as to draw on the benefits of both. A useful starting point is to review the regulations on service provision to identify those elements \u2013 whether laws, regulations, standards or procedures \u2013 that tend to exclude the poor (Payne and Majale, 2004). This type of \u201cregulatory audit\u201d would identify the institutions in- volved and assess what it would cost for the poor to meet the regulatory requirements. The auditors could present their findings to all stakeholders and decision makers to explore the possibilities for adjusting the regulatory framework to the realities on the ground. Another alternative is to work in a more flexible way when delivering services \u2013 so as to maximize the benefits for the society as a whole. Thailand, for example, has taken this approach when confronted with the HIV/ AIDS epidemic. Prostitution is illegal in Thailand; nev- ertheless, the Government, accepting that one of the main routes of transmission was through commercial sex, ran a high-profile campaign to get sex workers and their clients to use condoms. Similarly, in Bangladesh, the NGO, CARE, while not condoning illegal behaviour has recruited injecting drug users to educate others about the dangers of HIV/AIDS (box II.4). Making services more appropriate Another way of connecting people better with services is to make them as appropriate as possible to local needs. While it is useful to set national standards to guarantee quality these will be counterproductive if they actually discourage people from using services. This can happen in education systems, for example, when timetables and curricula that have been set cen- trally do not meet local circumstances. A better ap- proach is to mandate only some core standards and parameters while giving local schools the flexibility to adapt other lessons to local needs. It is also important to teach children as far as possible in the language that they use at home, so it is often better to recruit local teachers who are familiar with the language and customs \u2013 and who will be more accept- able and accountable to the local community. As many teachers as possible should also be women since this will make it easier for girls to attend school. 56 Parents will also be more likely to send their children to school if they are being taught skills that will be useful in their daily lives \u2013 if, as well as acquiring basic literacy and numeracy, children are learning about the local environment, for example, or issues related to health, hygiene and sanitation. Teachers and parents can also consult on the most appropriate school timetables and vacation periods which could take into account demands on children\u2019s time for fetching water in the morning, perhaps, or for selling goods on the weekly market day. They can also discuss how to make the school a safer environment for girls, with adequate fencing and secu- rity and separate toilet facilities. As well as making government schools more appropri- ate it is also possible to improve standards in other traditional forms of education as in Islamic madrasas or Buddhist temple or monastery schools. Koranic schools in Uttar Pradesh in India, for example, have introduced a literacy component. In addition, children and young adults who have missed out on primary education should have the op- tion of attending non-formal schools whether run by the Government or NGOs. Mostly these concentrate on functional literacy and numeracy. Non-formal edu- cation should, however, always be considered as complementary to formal primary education, rather than as a replacement for it, and children who enrol in NFE classes should then be able to move to formal education when the opportunity arises. Health systems too can be better adapted to local needs if local people, and particularly women, are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a55d4e13-c594-441d-be5b-91410bd7d627": {"__data__": {"id_": "a55d4e13-c594-441d-be5b-91410bd7d627", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f288476cc1c0cf3ccf74ae629d1834dd0103bf9e0096b3c86cab70d12716d27"}}, "hash": "0f288476cc1c0cf3ccf74ae629d1834dd0103bf9e0096b3c86cab70d12716d27", "text": "closely involved \u2013 helping to identify the health re- quirements, influence the range of services that are provided and take responsibility for management. Thailand and many other countries in the region train village health volunteers to provide both preventive and simple curative services. Local medical services can also make use of paramedics. In India, the Small Scale Rural Surgical Clinics in West Bengal are usually run by a single experienced doctor who builds up a local team of paramedics (Government of India, 2002). In Bangladesh the NGO Gonoshas- thaya Kendra, or People\u2019s Health Centre, has trained young unmarried women as agents of change within their own communities; they can speak to rural women directly and address their specific needs. Employing non-professionals does bring some risks, so workers will need to be closely monitored and evalu- ated to ensure that they give high-quality care. To en- sure that they keep working, it is also important to make the non-professionals know they are valued. They should therefore also be offered suitable salaries and good working conditions along with opportunities for career development (UNFPA, 2005). Empowering users The most effective way to ensure that local services are appropriate and effective is to empower the users. But local involvement should not be seen as a way for central Government to reduce costs or to disregard its responsi- bility to ensure access to services for all. Rather the aim should be to develop the capacity of communities to establish their own priorities, make their own plans and then claim their entitlements from the Government. Empowerment involves the acquisition of new capaci- ties, the establishment of new institutions, the promo- tion of new ways of working within existing organiza- tions and the provision of new rules for inter-organi- zational relationships. It requires changes in values and norms regarding respect and the distribution of power between social groups, so that none is marginalized and loses the right to be heard. NGOs have often served as catalysts in this process \u2013 adopting a rights-based approach as \u201cclaim-making\u201d organizations for the poor, arguing for better access to RETHINKING SERVICE DELIVERY Box II.4. Drug users as outreach workers The NGO, CARE Bangladesh, has demonstrated the value of employing drug users to contact other drug users to transmit important health messages. CARE identified 42 locations in Dhaka that were being used for selling and injecting drugs. Then it trained 12 of the active injecting drug users to serve as outreach workers \u2013 providing other users with information on HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases while also distributing condoms and clean syringes. The NGO stipulated, however, that the workers followed strict rules: don\u2019t inject while working; don\u2019t carry drugs while working; and don\u2019t get involved in criminal activities. By June 1999, the project had reached some 2,000 injecting drug users per day and subsequently grew to include 11 drop-in centres and 50 peer outreach workers. It also trained 160 volunteers as peer educators as well as 20 medicine- shop sellers. After the Dhaka experience, CARE Bangladesh launched similar programmes in Rajshahi, Chapai Nawabganj and Char Narendrar. 57 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH services and generally for a more inclusive style of development. They can also help to organize the poor to carry out small-scale self-help projects that can help to overcome psychological barriers and build self-con- fidence. But this should only be a transitional phase. Eventually communities have to link all their initiatives with government policies and large-scale programmes from which they can draw financial resources and tech- nical assistance. Community involvement should also extend to imple- mentation. When there are public works to be carried out, such as the building of new schools, communi- ties should be able to adopt their own approach. They should, for example, be able to choose the contrac- tors. This not only guarantees a better result but also generates a sense of pride and ownership. The same should apply to the running of services. As far as possible, schools for example, should be under the control of the local community, through parent- teacher associations and other groups that can work in cooperation with teachers and also hold them to account. All this will only be possible, however, if communities have the capacity for this degree of supervision and monitoring \u2013 to be able to talk on an equal footing with teachers, for example, or medical staff (box II.5). They should therefore be able to benefit from educa- tion and other capacity-building programmes. Box II.6.

Involving temples and mosques in health care For its health-care programme in Kirivong district of Cambodia an NGO has established a network that includes 91 temples and five mosques. Each health centre has a management committee (HCMC) consisting of commune chiefs, health centre staff and one male and one female representative from each temple and mosque. Each temple and mosque has a health action group, which consists of two HCMC members, a monk and a nun at temples or the imam and two mosque volunteers. The system promotes sound management, accountability and community ownership and facilitates communication between the community and the health centre. In consultation with village chiefs, the HCMC coordinates an equity fund, managed by the temple or mosque and financed by community contributions, to exempt the poorest from user fees. The health action group encourages better utilization of preventive health-care services, leads peer group discussions and supplements their income by social marketing of home-birth kits and oral rehydration solutions (Jacobs, 2002). One way of monitoring services is through cus- tomer surveys. Some Indian cities have experi- mented, for example, with sample surveys whose re- sults can then be presented in the form of a \u201creport card\u201d, not just to the service providers but also to the press, NGOs and other interest groups (Paul, 1998). The aim is to increase public awareness about the performance of providers while also challenging them to be more efficient and respon- sive (box II.6). 58 Users also need more information generally about gov- ernment performance in order to hold it accountable. Efforts to assess progress towards the MDGs have highlighted the need for good data \u2013 for Governments to be able to plan their work and for the public to be able to hold them to account. It is particularly important that data be disaggregated by sex, region, income and ethnic group in order to be able to judge the impact of policies and investments on different population groups. Decentralization and local governance Ultimately, all services are delivered locally so should work best if they are under democratic local control. One way of achieving this is to decentralize authority to the lowest level possible. Many Governments in the region have been carrying out programmes of decen- tralization. One of the most sudden and dramatic was in 2001, when Indonesia reassigned 2.2 million central civil servants to the districts and municipalities, which then took over responsibility for over 16,000 service facilities (UNDP, 2004). Here, as elsewhere the results have been mixed. As with public-private partnerships, many Gov- ernments have decentralized without establishing the necessary institutions and regulatory frameworks. Broadly, there are three overlapping types of decen- tralization (Mehrotra, 2005). The first, and weakest, form is administrative decentralization when the Gov- ernment transfers responsibility for carrying out cen- trally directed policies to local bodies that may simply be the local representatives of sectoral ministries. The second is political decentralization where those who are in charge are elected locally rather than being ap- pointed by the centre; even so they may not have very much say over how services are delivered and may still have to follow central mandates. The third, and stron- gest, form is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2826eeb-ff5e-4709-8938-5f9ab0d054bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2826eeb-ff5e-4709-8938-5f9ab0d054bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fbe4e6a8a0db8b8c511eda211227201f2be9dcaa2de58b7665064037522f0505"}}, "hash": "fbe4e6a8a0db8b8c511eda211227201f2be9dcaa2de58b7665064037522f0505", "text": "fiscal decentralization where an elected local body also can collect local taxes and set its own budget, which could also include freedom in the use of block grants received from the centre. In practice many programmes have not moved much further than ad- ministrative decentralization, leaving local bodies rela- tively little freedom to develop services in the way they see fit. Governments have a number of reservations about full decentralization: Exacerbating inequalities \u2013 A centralized system allows the Government to redistribute national income so that some regions effectively subsidize others. To avoid this, a decentralized system needs a consistent way of equalizing expenditures. Viet Nam, for example, has a system of interprovincial transfers though these still need to be further refined and targeted to those in greatest need in the most isolated parts of the country (Government of Viet Nam, 2002). Lack of capacity \u2013 A second concern about decentraliza- tion is that locally elected politicians or administrators may not have the skills to manage what could be quite large sums of money or the skills to supervise the work of employees in different sectors. Most decentraliza- tion programmes recognize this and include an ele- ment of capacity-building. Capacity-building is also needed higher up the system \u2013 to train people at the centre how to devolve power effectively. Irresponsibility \u2013 A third concern is that local leaders may act irresponsibly \u2013 overspending while under- taxing or using funds to construct impressive buildings or infrastructure rather than for the less visible but more valuable development of services. Countering such tendencies again means ensuring an open and transparent system that empowers users, particularly women. A study of women representatives in Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan, for example, has shown that they have effectively mobilized resources for employment, health, sanitation, small roads and educational opportunities (ADB, 2004b). Corruption \u2013 Finally there is the risk that local govern- ments may be captured by local elites or that funds will disappear through corruption. This is true even at the lowest levels. The poor are no more or less altruistic than the non-poor. Decentralization can thus improve delivery of services to the poor. But there is no guarantee. To ensure that it works in favour of the poor, decentralization has to be a balanced process. It needs to be accompanied by extensive capacity-building for both the local govern- ment and citizens. And it must take into account subnational inequalities in capacity and resources. Especially important is the quality of governance at both the national and local levels. For service delivery this will also mean ensuring that a higher proportion of women are elected to what are often male-domi- nated assemblies. Decentralization therefore needs to be accompanied by a realistic assessment of community dynamics and motives and an effective process of capacity-building, not just for local officials but also the communities themselves, and particularly their women members, so that they are sufficiently empowered to hold local offi- cials to account. Conclusion: an adaptive approach Conceptually at least, the simplest approach is to set national standards and then extend the corresponding government services across the country until everyone is covered. The poor, however, are not a homogeneous RETHINKING SERVICE DELIVERY 59 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH group and in many countries the demands of eco- nomic efficiency would entail reaching the poor last of all. Instead, Governments should consider an adaptive approach. This will require a series of institutional changes to make essential services available every- where while also being more flexible and responsive. 1. Broaden the range of providers \u2013 Governments have the responsibility to ensure that everyone has access to basic services, but they may not be the most appropri- ate providers. Instead, Governments should identify their own strengths and weaknesses, along with those of other providers, private and non-governmental, and plan for a combination of service deliverers. In addi- tion to providing, Governments should also concen- trate more on facilitating. 2. Establish standards \u2013 Governments should establish key national standards along with consultations through which service provision can be adapted to local conditions so as to provide everyone with cover- age that both the provider and the user can afford without compromising quality. In the case of educa- tion, for example, this might involve incomplete schools that have one or two teachers covering a range of classes \u2013 or even a system of distance learning. However, this should not be seen as a cheap or easy option that would offer a poor service. In fact under these circumstances ministries of education would need to give extra training to teachers, who have to be highly skilled", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56530c07-c687-42f0-b6b2-1d8a8cc4f7b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "56530c07-c687-42f0-b6b2-1d8a8cc4f7b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf4b245ac5c362dd76df8a8656a5a7c878d8b6b565e2f0b9a0622ff29c262ba5"}}, "hash": "cf4b245ac5c362dd76df8a8656a5a7c878d8b6b565e2f0b9a0622ff29c262ba5", "text": "to be able to cope with multiple grades in the same classroom; they would also need to pay them more if they were working in remote communities far from home. Similarly, in health services, some rural communities would receive their first line of services from outreach clinics or paramedics who would also need commensurate training and support. 3. Plan linkages and upgrades \u2013 The different levels of services should always be interlinked. Thus children who are receiving non-formal education should have the opportunity to transfer to formal schools through a system of equivalency in examinations. Correspond- ingly, within the health services, women giving birth at home should nevertheless have access to systems of emergency obstetric care. These incremental ap- proaches should also be set within a longer-term strat- egy: of replacing incomplete community schools with full primary schools; of replacing paramedics with fully trained health workers; and of replacing rural tap stands with regular piped water supplies. 4. Devise relevant regulations \u2013 The regulatory framework should always ensure public health and safety and be enforced and applied consistently. But it should also be relevant and realistic and sufficiently dynamic to adapt to ever-changing realities on the ground. Thus, Govern- ments should not demand of private providers stan- dards so high as to stifle the emergence, say, of private kindergartens or primary schools for poor children. Inevitably, as with drug abuse and sex work, for ex- ample, there will also be cases where policy objectives in one area conflict with regulations in another. This will requires clear vision and decisive leadership to deter- mine how the public interest might best be served. 5. Keep learning \u2013 Governments which want to ensure the best-possible service provision need to become dynamic learning institutions, constantly gathering the necessary data and experience, and disseminating and using it at all levels \u2013 local, national and international. 6. Empower users \u2013 The most important step, however, is to empower users to hold Governments and service providers to account. This will mean making systems and planning for service provision much more open and transparent \u2013 disclosing details of contracts for service provision, for example, and publishing statis- tics on coverage and quality. It will also mean devolving decision-making on services to lower levels of govern- ment that are more accessible to users \u2013 while also creating appropriate channels for public consultation and involvement. As this chapter has illustrated, many of the obstacles to effective service delivery are not financial but insti- tutional. Resources are vital and, as people\u2019s needs and aspirations change, public services will always be able to absorb more funds than are immediately available. But just as important is to improve the coverage and quality of services by opening them up to fresh op- tions, attitudes and ideas. 60 If countries are to be able to take full advantage of the kinds of institutional change that will promote the MDGs, particularly through the delivery of services, they will also need to invest more resources. This was highlighted in March 2005, when the Secretary-Gen- eral of the United Nations presented his report to the General Assembly entitled \u201cIn larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all\u201d, which looked at the potential for greater flows of ODA, for debt relief and for the funds that could be generated by a more equitable system of international trade. On ODA, for example, it argued that donors should estab- lish targets for achieving 0.7 per cent of gross national income. On trade it called for successful completion of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations and also for duty-free access for all exports from the least developed countries. However, many of these opportunities for coopera- tion between richer and poorer countries identified by the Secretary-General at the global level also have great resonance within this region, where countries vary enormously in their capacities. Some, like Japan, Aus- tralia, the Republic of Korea and Singapore, are well integrated into the global economic system and have substantial human and financial resources. And many III. Working together \u2013 opportunities for regional cooperation To accelerate progress towards the MDGs, the countries of Asia and the Pacific will need to invest greater resources and reshape their institutions. Most of this action will need to take place at the national level. Nevertheless, there are also opportunities for con- certed international action \u2013 for South-South cooperation across the region, as countries work together for their mutual benefit, on a whole host of issues, from trade to development assistance, to mi- gration to countering corruption. others are rapidly approaching a similar status.

Despite these differences, these countries often have a great deal in common: shared histories, for example, and common or similar languages and cultures. And as neighbours they have long experience of working to- gether to defuse tensions, promote trade or assist in times of disaster. So too with the MDGs they can explore new options for mutual cooperation. Some of these will involve the richer countries helping the poorer ones. Partly they will be acting out of en- lightened self-interest \u2013 preferring to have neighbours that are growing, integrated and successful, rather than isolated, stagnant and unstable. But they will also feel a moral obligation to help neighbouring peoples who live in poverty and deprivation. They will not of course be starting from scratch. The region has many well-tested subregional forums and mechanisms for cooperation, including the Associa- tion of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). The countries also cooperate through a WORKING TOGETHER \u2013 OPPORTUNITIES FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION 61 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH number of international institutions, including the Asian Development Bank, the United Nations Eco- nomic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and the regional centres of the United Nations Devel- opment Programme and other United Nations agen- cies, all of which have their core areas of expertise. The purpose of this chapter is not to suggest new organizations but rather to highlight some key areas of potential cooperation that would have a strong bearing on the achievement of the MDGs. Much of this will be in pursuit of what might be termed \u201cinternational public goods\u201d \u2013 such as mon- etary cooperation and environmental security \u2013 goods that once provided can be shared by everyone across the region. By analogy countries can also work together to eliminate \u201cinternational public bads\u201d such as pollu- tion, communicable diseases or trafficking in persons. The suggestions in this chapter deal with: 1. Gaining more resources through trade, foreign direct invest- ment and official development assistance 2. Encouraging Asian monetary cooperation 3. Regularizing labour migration 4. Creating an Asia-Pacific grain security system 5. Agreeing to compacts to tackle the HIV/AIDS pandemic 6. Aiming for green growth 7. Improving governance by fighting corruption and promoting e-governance 8. Strengthening cooperation between regional institutions Institutional change to gain more resources for attaining the MDGs Countries that are off track on many MDG indicators often lack the necessary finance. Greater regional coop- eration can increase the resources at their disposal in a number of ways: by expanding trade and increasing foreign direct investment, and through official develop- ment assistance \u2013 as well as by strengthening transport and other cross-regional infrastructure. Institutional change in all these areas can help to accelerate growth and reduce poverty, while also boosting government rev- enues that can be invested in better services for the poor. Intraregional trade The most dynamic economies of the region have built their success on trade with countries all over the world. Increasingly, however, the developing countries of Asia and the Pacific have been intensifying trade be- tween themselves. This is evident from figure III.1 which shows that from 2001 the developing and LDCs of Asia and the Pacific were importing more from each other than they were from countries elsewhere in the world: during the 1990s, their imports from other Asia- Pacific countries grew at an annual average 10 per cent \u2013 2 percentage points faster than imports from coun- tries outside the region. China and India have been among the prime movers here, but many other coun- tries have also contributed. The region\u2019s least developed countries have also been participating in this intraregional trade, though primarily as importers (figure III.2). Bhutan, for example, receives most of its imports from India, while Myanmar\u2019s two main trading partners are Singapore and Thailand.

When it comes to exports, the least developed coun- tries increasingly send most of their goods to countries outside the region (figure III.3). But for a number of these countries the export picture changes when it incorporates exports in energy and services. For en- ergy, this would include exports of natural gas from Myanmar to Thailand and exports of electricity from Bhutan and Nepal to India and from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to Thailand. Service exports from LDCs consist primarily of tourism. For a num- ber of countries \u2013 Bhutan, Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Maldives and Nepal \u2013 tourism, mostly from the Asia-Pacific region, is the first or sec- ond-largest source of foreign exchange. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic in 2004, for example, had energy and tourism receipts of around $200 mil- lion \u2013 far in excess of garment exports of $50 million. Service exports also include parts of the remittances of migrant workers, which are covered in a later sec- tion of this chapter. WORKING TOGETHER \u2013 OPPORTUNITIES FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION 63 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH These data cover only trade reported in official trade statistics. In addition there are large informal flows of goods across the often long and porous borders in Central Asia, South Asia and the Greater Mekong Subregion. Intraregional flows have been boosted by China\u2019s ef- forts to expand trade links with smaller countries. China has, for example, initiated the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement. Although this does not be- come fully effective until 2010, China has already signed a number of \u201cearly harvest\u201d agreements that provide advance tariff elimination for most countries on some agricultural products by 2006. In addition, China has provided \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d status to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Cambodia without requiring reciprocal concessions. India\u2019s contribution to intraregional trade has been smaller: it still gets more than two thirds of its imports from outside the region. Nevertheless, India too is opening up more to goods from Asia and the Pacific. On average, between 1992 and 2003 the developing countries of the region have been increasing their ex- ports to India by 16 per cent per year and the least developed countries by 17 per cent. Intraregional trade is thus extensive and growing. But it could be expanded still further if countries made more efforts to dismantle tariff barriers. The extent of these is illustrated in figure III.4. Trade-weighted tariffs vary greatly from one country to another, in both their sizes and patterns. India applies the highest tariffs, with rates of 25 per cent and above, while at the other end of the scale are Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Macao, 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 World Asia-Pacific developing Asia-Pacific LDCs Asia-Pacific LDCs Asia-Pacific developing Hong Kong, China Singapore Papua New Guinea Philippines Malaysia Indonesia China Sri Lanka Thailand Russian Federation Republic of Korea Pakistan Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic Viet Nam Islamic Republic of Iran Nepal Bangladesh Cambodia Bhutan India Figure III.4.

Through the ASEAN Integrated System of Preferences, for ex- ample, for goods coming from Cambodia, the Lao 64 People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam, Thailand offers reduced tariffs of 0 to 5 per cent. This applies mainly to agricultural products and garments. It also offers concessions to Bangladesh for some of the same exports. In addition, Thailand is committed to a \u201cone-way free trade agreement\u201d that applies a zero tariff to nine agricultural exports from Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Myanmar. Thailand\u2019s low tariffs on imports from LDCs are un- precedented for a middle-income country, especially since it is offering them on agricultural products and garments which it also produces and exports. How- ever, there is no evidence that Thailand has been hurt by this. This is partly because goods from these coun- tries amount to only 1.8 per cent of total imports, but also because Thailand also gains from these imports. Thai food processors benefit from agricultural imports and imported garments are part of a supply chain leading to Thai exports. The middle-income countries and other developing countries in the region would help the least developed countries to achieve the MDGs if they emulated Thai- land and reduced their barriers on imports from these countries, particularly for agricultural and labour-in- tensive manufactured goods. They could also take a different attitude to trade agree- ments. Rather than pursuing more bilateral agreements they should put more effort into implementing the existing subregional agreements such as the ASEAN and SAARC free trade areas, while at the global level pressing for a successful conclusion of the Doha Round. They can also build on the modest progress made under existing agreements such as the Bangkok Agreement, the Bay of Bengal Initiative and the ASEAN-China FTA \u2013 as well as encourage the pros- pects for an ASEAN + 3 FTA and ASEAN-India FTA among others. The least developed countries themselves should also try to consider how their own trade regimes could better promote the MDGs by, for example, collectively agreeing to lower their import duties on capital and intermediate goods. Trade would also expand if goods could travel more rapidly and cheaply across better infrastructure. Coun- tries should therefore work more closely together on projects such as the Asian Highway Agreement, while including feeder roads to connect isolated rural com- munities. Similarly in the Pacific there could be initia- tives to start or expand \u201csea corridors\u201d. In addition, all countries would benefit from more rapid customs clearance. They could also consider linking electricity grids and water resources. Foreign direct investment Much of the flow of international trade in the region is linked with foreign direct investment (FDI), which likewise helps to promote economic growth, increase employment, improve infrastructure and widen access to information. Many countries in the region have emerged as major intraregional investors such as Malaysia and Thailand, alongside the higher-income investors such as Hong Kong, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Singapore. But one of the largest is China itself, which has rapidly expanded its foreign direct investment in Asian countries \u2013 to $1.5 billion in 2003-2004 (China Daily, 2004). Cumulatively, China\u2019s investments in the developing countries in the region in recent years in- clude (Frost, 2004): \u2022 Indonesia \u2013 $600 million in the oil industry \u2022 Philippines \u2013 $950 million for nickel production \u2022 Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \u2013 $63 million for hydropower and $5 million for minerals explora- tion \u2022 Cambodia \u2013 $40 million for garment production \u2022 Thailand \u2013 $258 million for textiles, garments and home electrical appliances \u2022 Malaysia \u2013 $387 million for manufactured products, including electronic parts for export to China Table III.1 shows the importance of Asian FDI in three least developed countries and in Viet Nam. Thai- land is the largest single investor in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (World Bank, 2004) and Malaysia is the largest single investor in Cambodia. Asian inves- tors, primarily the Republic of Korea, also accounted for most of the FDI in Viet Nam. Only in Myanmar did more than half of FDI come from outside the region. India has invested relatively little in the region. In 2002, of total approved FDI outflows of over $1.4 billion, less than $200 million went to developing countries in Asia. India has invested, for example, in power produc- tion in Bhutan and Nepal as well as in plants in Bangladesh that use natural gas to produce fertilizer and electricity. How this investment will help to accelerate progress towards the MDGs will depend to some extent on the sectors at which it is directed.

Some invest- ment, particularly in hydroelectric power, can also im- prove infrastructure through rural electrification. The least developed countries themselves can maxi- mize the benefits by coming to more explicit agree- ments with investors. For mining and other natural resource investments, for example, they should agree on measures to minimize the negative environmental impacts through site restoration, as well as ensure that there are complementary investments, such as in rural electrification, that will benefit local communities. Official development assistance Official development assistance is assumed to origi- nate primarily from the developed countries, either within the region or elsewhere. In fact, some of the middle-income and even lower-income countries in the region also provide substantial support to the least developed countries. Among the main donors are In- dia, China and Thailand (table III.2). As this table indicates, most of the flows are to countries with which the donors share borders. India, for example, gives more to Bhutan alone than it gives to all non- neighbouring countries. Table III.1.

Note: These flows refer to various years between 2001 and 2004, but in the case of Thailand to 2002-2003. Unfortunately, information on ODA within the region is scarce, fragmented and incomplete. Thailand is the only developing country in the world to have, with the United Nations, published a report on its contribution to Millennium Development Goal 8, which is con- cerned with international cooperation (Thai Ministry of Finance and United Nations, 2005). This includes a full description of the country\u2019s development assis- tance programmes. China and India do not publish corresponding reports, so information on their ODA has to come largely from sources in the receiving coun- tries. For the LDCs concerned, China, India and Thailand are by far the largest donors. India\u2019s assistance to Nepal, for example, makes it by far the largest donor and its aid to Bhutan \u2013 $50 million in 2003-2004 \u2013 was more than that of all other foreign donors combined. India has also provided Bhutan and Nepal with large soft loans for the construction of hydroelectric projects; though the terms of these loans would qualify them as ODA the details have not been published. Similarly, China is the largest donor to Myanmar and the second-largest donor to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Thailand is the largest donor to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and the second-largest donor to Myanmar. Interestingly, Viet Nam, which itself receives ODA from China and Thailand, was the fifth-largest donor to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, ahead of several OECD countries.

For the MDGs, just as important as the volume of aid are the targets and sectors at which is being directed. ODA from China, India and Thailand to the least developed countries is generally for infrastructure, hy- droelectricity, health, education and agriculture, thus helping to improve institutions and the delivery of basic services, as well as lowering access costs and improving flows of information. Clearly, intraregional ODA has considerable potential for boosting the MDGs \u2013 and should receive much more attention. It would help if the donor countries published comparable and complete information that could be publicized. This would then enable greater analysis of how such ODA assists in the achievement of the MDGs. In parallel with the declarations of the OECD coun- tries, all countries in the region should now aim to increase their ODA for the landlocked and low-income countries of the region to 0.7 per cent of GDP. Encouraging Asian monetary cooperation One of the most serious MDG setbacks for many countries was the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1999, which pushed a number of countries off track. Coun- tries should also therefore consider how they can coop- erate better; either to prevent such a crisis recurring on such a scale or to address such crises as do emerge. One opportunity for doing so is through monetary cooperation and the creation of facilities that would supplement assistance from the International Mon- etary Fund. The opportunity for creating this kind of facility has been increased as the region has steadily built up substantial reserves. China, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan, Province of China along with Malaysia and Thailand and some other countries now have foreign exchange reserves that col- lectively are worth around $3 trillion. Japan\u2019s reserves are $700 billion and China\u2019s $500 billion. An Asian monetary facility is not a new idea. Japan first suggested something along these lines in 1998; indeed it subsequently created a bilateral swap network that may evolve into a fully fledged institution. There have also been a number of initiatives for economic coop- eration that have helped to prepare the ground. In 2000, for example, the ASEAN +3 finance ministers established the Economic and Policy Dialogue, which meets every six months. In the same year they also established the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI) to create a system of currency swap arrangements within the ASEAN +3 countries. Subsequently they set up the Asian Bond Markets Initiative to create bond markets in local currencies. Then in May 2005 they took a number of measures to strengthen the CMI, including better surveillance and collective decision-making for the 16 bilateral swap agreements that were by then in force as well as doubling the size of the swaps. A strengthened CMI and other regional mechanisms offer great promise. During the previous financial cri- sis the affected countries had to turn to the IMF. In future any country in the region that anticipates diffi- culties should be able to turn for support to additional sources within the region to help to nip the problem in the bud. The time is now ripe for such cooperation. As the earlier section in this paragraph indicated, the countries of Asia and the Pacific are now much more closely integrated through trade and investment. China, in par- ticular, along with the other main trading countries in the region would have a great interest in preventing a repeat of the 1997 meltdown. As well as using the accumulated reserves to ensure monetary stability, it should also be possible to use some of the reserves for productive investment, par- ticularly in the region\u2019s infrastructure. This will require more attention to developing capital markets for infra- structure financing. Recent estimates suggest that around $200 billion is needed annually to upgrade and develop infrastructure, while the funds currently avail- able from both public and private resources are only around $50 billion (Kim, 2005). If countries could devise a mechanism for switching reserve funds for this kind of investment it would have enormous ben- efits for trade and development, helping to reduce poverty and achieve the MDGs. Regularizing labour migration Millions of workers have left home for other countries within the region, either temporarily or permanently in search of work. In the past, many migrants from the region went to the Middle East and beyond. And many still do so, from Filipinos heading for the United States to Pacific islanders heading for Australia or New Zealand.

WORKING TOGETHER \u2013 OPPORTUNITIES FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION 67 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH Thailand and the Philippines, for example, now often send more workers to other Asian countries than to the Middle East. Indonesia too has as many migrant workers elsewhere in Asia as it has in the Middle East. The scale of the flows is difficult to estimate since many of these migrations are unauthorized, but table III.3 assembles data from various sources to offer an overall picture of intra-Asian migration to the main host countries. And this covers only the main receiving countries; even some of the less developed countries also receive migrants. Bangladesh in 2002, for example, had an estimated 122,000 workers from Myanmar. Cambodia has around 1 million workers from Viet Nam, and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic has around 80,000 Chinese and 15,000 Vietnamese. Migra- tion flows also take place in multiple directions and many countries are both senders and receivers. Thai- land, for example, as well as hosting over 1 million people from Myanmar, also has 340,000 Thais working in Hong Kong, China, Japan, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, Province of China.

Note: These include estimates of both official and unauthorized migration. They may also be disputed: the figures for Bangladeshis in India, for example, are from the Indian Government, whereas Bangladesh says that none of its nationals are working illegally in India. The Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic estimates the number of its nationals in Thailand at 200,000. Table III.4.

Note: For sending countries includes people migrating beyond Asia. Another important characteristic of flows from Asia is that a high proportion of the migrants are women, primarily for domestic work with smaller numbers for factory work and entertainment. Some of the available information is collected in table III.4. This table does not include unauthorized workers or women who have been trafficked for sex or other forms of exploitative labour. Labour migration has many links with the MDGs. For the host country these can be both positive and nega- tive. On the positive side, immigrants are typically do- ing work that nationals decline, so this new labour force should help to boost economic growth and re- duce poverty. On the other hand their arrival can put pressure on services in the countries they move to \u2013 on sanitation services, for example, or water supplies \u2013 68 and they add an extra dimension to the challenge of dealing with HIV/AIDS and other communicable dis- eases. For the source countries too, there are losses and gains. On the one hand they may be losing skilled and edu- cated workers who could have been contributing to national development. And the families left behind can also suffer, particularly if the mothers depart and chil- dren are neglected. On the other hand when people return from abroad they can return with new skills and knowledge \u2013 and may also have higher expectations of the quality of medical care and nutrition for their children and will press their own Governments to raise standards. The other major benefit from international migration for the source country is remittances. The scale of remittances is also difficult to estimate since, like the workers themselves, they often move through unofficial channels. But even official flows are substantial \u2013 and frequently dwarf flows of foreign direct investment or official development assistance. Most of the remittance flows into Asian countries still come from outside the region: the Philippines, for example, gets over $7 billion in remittances each", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68e91282-54f4-4126-b8f6-1e31b41f4b46": {"__data__": {"id_": "68e91282-54f4-4126-b8f6-1e31b41f4b46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f5bbd82beb19400e534421c2bed78e58f25c9d39ebeea0799dcf845e8a22769e"}}, "hash": "f5bbd82beb19400e534421c2bed78e58f25c9d39ebeea0799dcf845e8a22769e", "text": "year from the United States alone and India gets around $12 billion annually from the Middle East (Asian Migrant Centre, 2003). Nevertheless the flows from other Asian countries are also consider- able (table III.5). In the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Re- public, for example, remittances are more than 70 per cent larger than net earnings from garment exports. Given the scale of remittances and migration and the likelihood that it will persist for some years to come, the challenge for Governments is to make the best use of them \u2013 maximizing the benefits for both source and destination countries and minimizing the risks for mi- grants and their families. One of the most important steps would be to make realistic assessments of the needs for migrant labour and ensure that as much of this as possible takes place through legal channels. At present migration can be very difficult, both when departing and arriving. Most of the least developed countries in the region do not allow workers to leave without proper papers, official permission and sometimes an exit visa that is both difficult to get and expensive. Then host countries can make it even more difficult to get a work permit or other residence documents. In trying to evade controls, many workers fall prey to unscrupulous labour agents. And if they are unautho- rized immigrants they are also in danger of being ex- ploited by employers and they will have little or no access to health care or schooling for their children. It will always be difficult to balance the interests of both source and destination countries \u2013 and of the national and immigrant workforces. But a number of countries in the past have applied policies so restrictive that they damaged the interests of both the host coun- try and the immigrant workforce. It would be better if much more of today\u2019s migration were authorized and a number of countries and terri- tories have indeed been trying to regularize at least part of their immigrant workforces. Singapore, Hong Kong, China, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan, Province of China are the most advanced in regulariz- ing their semi-skilled and unskilled workforces. Malay- sia too is trying to move toward regularization while still struggling to cope with large numbers of unautho- rized migrants. Japan is now seriously considering regularization of unskilled migrant workers. Thailand also has a policy of regularizing informal migrants after the fact, as long as they register and pay for work permits. To facilitate this, Thailand has negotiated and signed memorandums of understanding on labour co- operation with Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Demo- cratic Republic and Myanmar. India allows workers legally from Nepal but not from Bangladesh. The source countries could also do much more to improve the situation of their workers. At present, only the Philippines and Thailand have regularized most or all of their nationals working in other coun- tries in Asia and the Pacific. Viet Nam has regularized workers going to Malaysia, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of China, but not those working in Cambodia or the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Table III.5. Migrant remittances from other Asian countries Millions of dollars Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (2003) 100 Nepal (2002) 1,050 Philippines (2002) 810 Thailand (2002) 1,350 Viet Nam (2004) 1,500 Sources: ILO, 2005; Asian Migrant Centre, 2003; Vietnamese Ministry of Labour, 2003. Remittances have an important bearing on the MDGs. First because they can offer direct support to families in poor rural communities, who can use them both for day-to-day survival and for investing in the health and education of their children. They can also invest funds in community enterprises: some migrants from Nepal working in India, for example, invest their earnings back home in rotating savings and credit associations (ILO, 2003). Remittances have also proved to be not just a larger, but also a more reliable, source of foreign exchange than either FDI or ODA. WORKING TOGETHER \u2013 OPPORTUNITIES FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION 69 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH The LDCs have the most work to do \u2013 but perhaps also the greatest incentive to act, since they have to deal with both the departure of their own nationals and the arrival of workers from other countries. A good first step would be to sign MOUs with the main destination countries as part of the regularization process. This issue would also benefit from improved regional cooperation \u2013 to manage intraregional flows better and improve the welfare of migrants. Creating an Asia-Pacific grain security system Across the region in 2002, around 542 million people are eating less than the daily minimum energy require- ment", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50682a0d-bb32-45af-961c-7016bd3bd471": {"__data__": {"id_": "50682a0d-bb32-45af-961c-7016bd3bd471", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Future within Reach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/future-within-reach", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b17661c0a3e588ede1058d64cfc0bf4a848a5cd793ed04d471a62653e0b88704"}}, "hash": "b17661c0a3e588ede1058d64cfc0bf4a848a5cd793ed04d471a62653e0b88704", "text": "\u2013 and 104 million children under 5 are undernour- ished. The causes of hunger and malnutrition are many and complex. Both adults and children will often go hungry even when there is food available simply be- cause they cannot afford to pay for it. Reducing hunger and malnutrition is thus intimately linked with a reduc- tion in income poverty and as well as improvements in many other aspects of national development, particu- larly health and education and the rights of women. Nevertheless, a number of countries in the region do actually run short of food at certain times, and in certain parts of the country. China, for example, should in normal circumstances be able to feed its people. But between 2000 and 2003 for four consecu- tive years it suffered from a series of natural disasters, and as result of this and a steady decline in available land the gap in food production has been around 15-20 million tons per year (Shengjun, 2004). National Governments will, of course, have to take measures to ensure grain security in their own coun- tries. Nevertheless, countries in the region can also cooperate for this purpose. They can, for example, make investments in and share information on tech- nology and marketing with joint ventures to boost productivity and usher in a \u201csecond green revolution\u201d in the Asian and Pacific region. They should also be able to cooperate on quality control, including proto- cols for GM foods. In addition, they can also remove various forms of protection and segmentation so as to permit farmers both to sell on their local markets and to export. And they can also improve roads and other transport infrastructure to allow for the more efficient distribution of grains around the region. One major new initiative, however, should be to estab- lish an Asia-Pacific International Grain Bank (APIGB). The surplus countries would be able to sell grains to this while deficit countries could access grains at times of distress \u2013 which they could distribute at least partly through public food distribution systems. APIGB would pay fair prices for grain, which is likely to be culturally acceptable in various parts of the region. Prices for both buying and selling would be determined each year by a board with members from each of the countries. Grains will be stored in the countries where they are purchased until they are needed elsewhere, perhaps in the government granaries that store national buffer stocks. Such a system could also be linked with the activities of the World Food Programme. Initial financing for the Bank could come from the accumulated foreign currency reserves mentioned in the section on monetary cooperation. Countries could then either purchase grains, or borrow from the Bank, for later repayment in comparable grains or in hard currency. APIGB could also incorporate some of the elements of a grain market, with a credit system and spot and futures transactions. In addition the countries of the region could establish early warning systems to notify each other of risks from natural and man-made disasters, for example, or of likely volatility in international grain markets to help them to ward off potential crises in grain security. Tackling the HIV/AIDS pandemic and other diseases As chapter 2 of this report has indicated, Asia and the Pacific is emerging as an epicentre of the global HIV/ AIDS pandemic. Apart from imposing an enormous burden on health services, and causing very high pro- ductivity losses, as well as physical and emotional suffer- ing, the pandemic is also pushing millions more people into poverty. Without comprehensive prevention and treatment responses, more than 2 million new infec- tions will occur and nearly a million people will die from AIDS in 2010. The annual financial losses are expected to amount to US$ 19 billion in 2010 and US$ 27 billion in 2015 (UNAIDS, 2005). It has been estimated, for example, that in every year between 2005 and 2015, if appropriate interventions are not in place, HIV/AIDS will account for slowing poverty reduction by 23 per cent in India, 38 per cent in Thailand and by up to 60 per cent in Cambodia (UNAIDS and ADB, 2004a). Despite the scale of the disaster, Governments in many countries have been surprisingly slow to act. In addition to taking emergency measures at the national level they should also consider the options for amplify- ing national actions through regional cooperation. Such measures could include: 1. Declaring HIV/AIDS a regional emergency The regional political institutions should officially de- clare HIV/AIDS a regional emergency and mandate an emergency response.

Bodies such as ASEAN and SAARC can advance in- tergovernmental cooperation by articulating clear ac- tion plans with fixed milestones. ASEAN set a good example with its Work Programme on HIV/AIDS II (2002-2005), which supported the implementation of the 7th ASEAN Summit Declaration on HIV/AIDS (November 2001, Brunei Darussalam). The SAARC summit to be held in Dhaka in November 2005, and the ASEAN summit to be held in Kuala Lumpur in December 2005, offer further opportunities for some of the most vulnerable countries to act in concert. 2. Developing pro-poor regional compacts for prevention and treatment By rapidly and simultaneously bringing both preven- tion and treatment to scale, the region could cut annual AIDS-related costs by over US$ 4 billion in 2010 and over US$ 10 billion by 2015. The countries of the region, as both producers and consumers of com- modities vital for tackling the epidemic, should there- fore sign compacts to ensure that these are available at affordable prices to vulnerable communities. On the preventive side there are a number of priori- ties: condoms and lubricants for the promotion of safe sex; antibiotics for the treatment of the sexually trans- mitted infections and opportunistic infections that are often associated with HIV/AIDS; and substitute drugs for injecting drug users that they can take orally, such as methadone and buprenorphine. China, India and Thailand are major producers of these pharmaceuti- cals and should aim to make the region self-sufficient so as to bring down prices and make these items widely available to the poor. China, India and Thailand, the major producers of these pharmaceuticals, should enter into a compact to supply these pharmaceuticals at cost price to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic. As far as treatment is concerned, a number of govern- ments have declared that they will supply anti-retroviral drugs free to all who need them. The rest should also do so \u2013 taking advantage of falling prices and the extensive international mechanisms for disseminating the necessary technical information. Many people are now concerned that international trade agreements will require countries in the region to enact patent legisla- tion that will increase drug prices. Nevertheless, there are mechanisms within the trade-related intellectual property rights (TRIPS) agreement and the Doha Dec- laration that can be used to keep the prices of anti- retrovirals and related drugs within reach of the poor- est countries. Again China, India and Thailand are the major producers and should, with other producers, sign a compact aiming to make the region self-sufficient and keep the prices down. 3. Creating an Asia-Pacific intergovernmental collaboration mechanism to fight HIV/AIDS Confronting the pandemic across the region will cost at least $5 billion annually by 2007 (UNAIDS and ADB, 2004b). Considering US$ 5 billion is only 0.2 per cent of gross national income for the region, middle-income countries should be able to mobilize their own resources for comprehensive HIV/AIDS programmes. But lower-income and least developed countries would need international assistance. It is nec- essary therefore to create an intergovernmental col- laboration mechanism like an \u201cAsia-Pacific Facility\u201d to fight HIV/AIDS, to mobilize funds, help to scale up prevention, treatment and care, mitigate its impact, as well as conduct monitoring and evaluation. In order to garner support for such a mechanism, which could be linked with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, leaders from the Asian and Pacific region could take advantage of international meetings, such as the sixty-second session of ESCAP, to be held in Jakarta in April 2006, and the United Nations General Assembly special session to be held in New York in June 2006, to review progress in implementing the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS. 4. Taking concerted action on other diseases HIV/AIDS is frequently associated with other com- municable diseases such as TB, so action against HIV/ AIDS should be part of a broader effort for the sur- veillance and control of communicable diseases gener- ally. TB itself, after a 40-year decline, is now resurging.

Left unchecked, NCDs could usurp health service resources needed for tackling com- municable diseases. Furthermore, in recent decades NCDs once viewed as \u201caffluent lifestyle\u201d problems have also percolated to lower socio-economic groups. The rising prevalence of tobacco consumption and un- healthy diets among poorer groups are among the risk factors. Obesity, particularly child obesity, lies at the root of the alarming NCD epidemic. Today in China, 90 million people are obese and by 2010 this will rise to 200 WORKING TOGETHER \u2013 OPPORTUNITIES FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION 71 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH million. Productivity losses and health-care system costs occasioned by diet-related NCDs alone already amounted to 2.1 per cent (US$ 15.1 billion) of China\u2019s GDP a decade ago. This is indicative of the damage that NCDs could wreak (Popkin and others, 2001). To combat the double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases, countries need to col- laborate more closely to strengthen public health sys- tems and improve surveillance and control of diseases in both human and animal populations, as well as health promotion. Such collaboration could include: \u2022 Standards \u2013 Develop regional public health stan- dards that encompass, inter alia, animal husbandry, agricultural practices, air quality, drinking water, as well as food safety and nutritional content (e.g., low salt, sugar and fat), and introduce a multi-level mechanism to monitor and promote adherence \u2022 Health promotion \u2013 Share regionally experiences on the promotion \u2013 through all institutions of gov- ernment, the private sector, the mass media and civil society \u2013 of responsibility for personal health measures, including healthy diets, as well as physi- cally active and balanced lifestyles \u2022 Early warning systems \u2013 Forge linkages at the re- gional, subregional, national and local levels to strengthen early warning systems on emerging in- fectious diseases in both human and animal popu- lations, and rising NCD epidemics \u2022 Surveillance \u2013 Develop tracking measures for dis- ease surveillance to identify the social, economic and other sectoral drivers and the causes of chang- ing patterns in old and new diseases \u2022 Communications \u2013 Improve international communi- cation mechanisms for rapid and appropriate re- sponses to the spread of infectious diseases \u2013 so as to quell rumours while ensuring that the public have accurate information on the extent of the problems and how to respond. This should be combined with efforts to coordinate risk management \u2013 including at border checkpoints and airports Aiming for green growth Across the region, the rapid increase in agricultural and industrial production and the associated consumption are putting increasing pressures on the environment. For example, concentrations of suspended particles and nitrogen dioxide now exceed WHO standards in over half the reporting cities in the region. Many areas are running short of water: in South Asia alone during 2000-2004, more than 462 million people were affected by drought. And over 28 per cent of the region\u2019s land is now degraded to some degree. Nevertheless, in order to reduce poverty and meet the needs of current and future populations the countries of the region will need to pursue even greater eco- nomic growth. Over the next 10 years the total popula- tion of the region is expected to expand by 415 million \u2013 adding to the demands for adequate food, clothing, housing, water, and environmental and transport infra- structure, along with other basic needs. The challenge now is to find ways of achieving this growth, while limiting the use of natural resources and cutting pollution, and generally keeping within the region\u2019s ecological carrying capacity. This will mean moving on from the conventional paradigm of \u201cgrow first and clean up later\u201d to a new paradigm of \u201cgreen growth\u201d that harmonizes economic growth with envi- ronmental sustainability.

Improving governance Many countries are off track on the MDGs not just because they lack financial resources, but because they do not have the human resources to push the process forward or because they are hampered by inefficiency and corruption. 72 A regional convention on the elimination of corruption One of the reasons why service delivery is poor is that resources are dissipated through corruption. The 2004 corruption perceptions ranking for countries in Asia and the Pacific produced by Transparency International is shown in table III.6 and ranks 145 countries on the basis of the perception of corruption arriving at a score between 0 and 10. Of the economies listed from Asia and the Pacific, only 5 managed scores of 5 or above. Table III.6.

Note: The full ranking has 145 countries. A number of countries have the same rating and thus the same ranking. Many countries in the region are poor not just because they have been slow to develop but because their assets are improperly used or appropriated. Indeed, often they are asset-rich and yet capital-poor because the processes for translating assets into capital are blocked by inadequate or corrupt legal systems. As a result, public servants and others can shield their activities from the public gaze and appropriate these assets for themselves. Although the scale of the ensuing damage will never be known, one estimate puts global losses from corruption at $13 trillion (De Soto, 2003) of which a substantial proportion will be in the Asia- Pacific region. The most effective anti-corruption measures need to be taken at the national level. But these must be complemented by international cooperation. So far, one of the most important regional measures has been the Action Plan for Asia and the Pacific that was adopted in Tokyo in December 2000 by representa- tives from the countries in the region as a result of an ADB/OECD initiative (box III.1). This had three pil- lars: developing effective and transparent systems for public service; strengthening anti-bribery actions and promoting business operations; and supporting active public involvement. The United Nations Convention against Corruption is currently in the process of ratification, but what is needed now is an Asia-Pacific convention on the elimi- nation of corruption. This should cover agreements on, among other things: \u2022 Law enforcement \u2013 Ensuring cooperation between law enforcement agencies on the apprehension and prosecution of corrupt officials \u2022 Information-sharing \u2013 Allowing countries formally to share data, information and knowledge on corrup- tion, including information on corrupt public offi- cials and others who are likely to flee across na- tional borders \u2022 Extradition and trial \u2013 Establishing treaties to permit people charged with corruption in their country of origin to be extradited or, if they have subse- quently acquired citizenship of their host country, to be tried there WORKING TOGETHER \u2013 OPPORTUNITIES FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION 73 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH Box III.1. The ADB/OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative The ADB/OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative is helping to promote regional cooperation in the fight against corrup- tion in the Asian and Pacific region.

To date, 21 countries (including Australia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Cook Islands, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Samoa, Singapore and Vanuatu) have endorsed the Action Plan and started implementing priority areas of reform to fight corruption. The Initiative is aimed at fostering both regional and country-specific policy reforms. This strategy is tailored to policy priorities identified by endorsing countries and provides the means by which Governments, international organizations and other partners of the Initiative can review progress achieved. A key activity of the Initiative is a biannual conference bringing together representatives of governments, business, trade unions, media, and civil society from Asia-Pacific countries, ADB, OECD and other agencies. A steering group meeting is held twice a year to assess progress made in implementing the Action Plan, to facilitate policy dialogue and exchange experience among endorsing Governments on successes and problems and to promote dialogue with representatives of the international commu- nity and business sector to mobilize donor support. To address capacity constraints and difficulties in combating corruption, the Initiative plans to undertake specifically designed training programmes on topics selected by the steering group such as forensic accounting, mutual legal assistance, public opinion surveys and public procurement. The Initiative will address the needs of endorsing Governments, which intend to ratify the United Nations Convention against Corruption by adapting the provisions to their laws and institutions. \u2022 Freezing assets \u2013 Agreeing that upon conviction, the assets of corrupt officials of one country held in another should be frozen and eventually repatriated \u2022 Endangered species \u2013 Eliminating collusion between corrupt officials that permits illegal international trading in endangered species Signing such a convention would send a strong mes- sage across the region that the days of unbridled cor- ruption are over. Creating an e-governance coalition Countries will be able to move more rapidly towards the MDGs if they can make better use of information and communication technology (ICT). Elements of \u201ce-governance\u201d can not only make services more effi- cient but also, by making government functions more transparently, fundamentally alter the relationship be- tween citizens and the State. Some examples of the ways in which governments can use ICT to interact more fully with their citizens are shown in box III.2. The countries of Asia and the Pacific do, however, differ greatly in their capacity to introduce elements of e-governance. Some are world leaders in the develop- ment of both hardware and software, while others lack not just the technology but also the infrastructure to support it. As a result while some countries have al- ready advanced towards e-governance, others have yet to start. This suggests many areas of opportunity for regional cooperation, including: \u2022 Developing a coalition of providers \u2013 Countries, such as India and the Republic of Korea, that have abun- dant software capabilities and those, such as China, with extensive hardware capabilities, can, in a new form of South-South cooperation, help other countries in the region to advance more rapidly and realistically. Apart from benefiting the recipi- ent countries and helping them to initiate systems of e-governance this should also help to create new markets for the providers \u2022 Addressing gender gaps \u2013 In the past, few women and girls in the region have reached positions of influ- ence in science and technology. Even if they start out with the best of intentions they are frequently lost along the way in what has been called the \u201cleaky pipeline\u201d. Some of this is due to social attitudes, to weaknesses in the education system or to the way academic or technical appointments are made. Institutions in the region should draw up common plans to address these issues 74 \u2022 Create teleservices \u2013 People living in remote areas should be able to take advantage of ICT to gain access to services such as medical care and school- ing from a range of national and regional providers \u2022 Use ICT to control communicable diseases \u2013 The diseases that threaten the region could be addressed more effectively by rapid exchange of data and informa- tion and by coordination of measures to tackle the outbreaks These are just a few of the ways in which countries can come together at the regional level to enhance their mutual use of ICT. But this is an area of ceaseless innovation \u2013 generating new ideas and options that all countries need to monitor and take advantage of.

Within a framework of cooperation, regional institu- tions and international organizations can play the roles for which they have core competencies and enjoy com- parative advantage. For example, to catalyse infrastruc- ture projects, ADB should have a major role to play. When it comes to HIV/AIDS, the resources and ex- pertise of UNAIDS and WHO should be brought to bear. Similarly, in matters of governance, support from UNDP would be most appropriate. Thus, a coalition of regional institutions and international organizations can support Governments throughout the Asia-Pacific region. ESCAP, as the regional arm of the United Nations, should coordinate the coalition. A future within reach The eight actions outlined in this chapter all have great potential for enhancing regional cooperation. Some simply highlight existing initiatives, suggesting that they be developed or expanded. Others would set the countries of the region off in new directions. But all add to the provision of international public goods \u2013 and all are doable. Experience has shown what is pos- sible given determination and commitment at the na- tional level. All these efforts can, however, be greatly enhanced by concerted regional action. The Millennium Development Goals have helped many countries to galvanize their development efforts \u2013 of- fering a space in which all sections of society can come WORKING TOGETHER \u2013 OPPORTUNITIES FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION 75 A FUTURE WITHIN REACH together to debate national and regional priorities. But they will only finally serve their purpose if they focus attention on the remaining gaps, and on the changes needed to meet the rights of everyone \u2013 especially the poorest and most vulnerable. 2015 is only 10 years away. Advocacy for greater resources is already under way, through the Millennium Project, for example. But these resources need to be complemented with appro- priate institutional changes to ensure that all these goals are within reach. 76 ADB, 2004a.

At this horizon is a world half as afflicted with poverty as the one we experience now. To ar- rive at this moment of achievement, though, we must first cross the water barrier. We must strive to meet MDG Target 10: To halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation. The strong correlation between water and poverty proves that when water is inac- cessible and unfit, it is a barrier. But when it is avail- able and clean, water is a bridge to even greater security and prosperity for the poor. For Asia and the Pacific, home to the majority of the world\u2019s poor, MDG Target 10 is an especially am- bitious but critical goal. The number of people with- out improved water supplies in the People\u2019s Republic of China alone is nearly as large as the number of underserved in the entire African continent. Into the countdown to 2015, what progress does the Asia and Pacific region register in meeting MDG Target 10? What more is required? How will meet- ing MDG Target 10 advance countries toward achiev- ing all eight MDGs? This report offers answers to these questions. Prepared by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and World Health Organization (WHO), it uses the latest data avail- able to measure each country\u2019s progress toward MDG Target 10 and analyzes whether it will be achieved. The results show a mixed picture. Some countries have already met the target; others are on track; others are likely to miss it in 2015. Some countries even show a decrease in coverage. The analysis in this report figures the econom- ics of change\u2014how much it will cost to ensure each country in the region meets MDG Target 10.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df021706-e786-438b-a7c1-e296a316fd87": {"__data__": {"id_": "df021706-e786-438b-a7c1-e296a316fd87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia Water Watch 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b16e0148cdf595e64fa45c7cd541a45d1b0734a7ba18df586a75261058b09150"}, "2": {"node_id": "96557eec-2184-410f-be8f-7a31d3a56171", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d46036867d7375401dd5e3cf130dfae75699aabcdbd308f3ecbcf9ff59c8627"}}, "hash": "eef7abc1b288e39f3efa0f7f0f461cf419f6865dcc6b15620b03a2fd93f3e38a", "text": "Con- sidering the economic returns of improved access to water on productivity and growth at both macro and micro levels, the paper argues that \u201cit is the height of economic irrationality to not invest in these vital services.\u201d The correlation between water and each of the eight MDGs is explicitly", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56e4ffaa-b58a-4bb6-85b5-e0740f2e0c03": {"__data__": {"id_": "56e4ffaa-b58a-4bb6-85b5-e0740f2e0c03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia Water Watch 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62523e641dc5bdd4aec445e3ab6a22fd28d0d1df756d64d2fa7f6b2177ff8eed"}, "3": {"node_id": "8afca22a-4e2b-4708-ba47-027c9a4d9714", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f04e2883de78973df9a94effaa0107d97755eb870ed4d3f28da31c6eeee80df5"}}, "hash": "5c4ccc639c346f22583d58858a840755aa32be9114ae34bffd0fee7ef9524883", "text": "drawn in the report, showing water as a bridge to meeting all other MDGs.

The MDGs do not claim to capture all aspects of poverty reduction. They are, rather, a way of understanding what must be done if poverty is to be reduced. And momentum is building, along with the hopes and concerns for those countries that seem on target and those that lag behind. The Asia and Pacific region plays a pivotal role in the MDG commitment. The region is home to the majority of the world\u2019s poor. In the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) alone, the number of people without access to clean water supply is nearly as large as all of the underserved in Africa. The progress this re- gion makes will define the entire global community\u2019s success in achieving the am- bitious targets the MDGs have set for 2015. In the five years since the MDGs were identified in the 2000 UN Millennium Dec- laration, Asia and the Pacific have shown remarkable progress. The region has been reducing poverty by attacking it on many fronts\u2014through sound economic policies, development strategies, and targeting spe- cific characteristics of poverty, such as hun- ger and disease. Water supply and sanitation improvements are proving to be keys that unlock many aspects of poverty. MDG Target 10 calls for the world to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drink- ing water and improved sanitation. The MDGs and associated targets are an oppor- tunity for prioritizing water on the basis of its ability to impact overall poverty and contribute to significant socioeconomic and environmental gains.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8afca22a-4e2b-4708-ba47-027c9a4d9714": {"__data__": {"id_": "8afca22a-4e2b-4708-ba47-027c9a4d9714", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia Water Watch 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62523e641dc5bdd4aec445e3ab6a22fd28d0d1df756d64d2fa7f6b2177ff8eed"}, "2": {"node_id": "56e4ffaa-b58a-4bb6-85b5-e0740f2e0c03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5c4ccc639c346f22583d58858a840755aa32be9114ae34bffd0fee7ef9524883"}}, "hash": "f04e2883de78973df9a94effaa0107d97755eb870ed4d3f28da31c6eeee80df5", "text": "Target 10 also presents a particularly formidable challenge for Asia.

This report assesses the region\u2019s pros- pects of reaching Target 10 by 2015. It does not just consider the target\u2019s literal call to halve the number of underserved by 2015. True progress must be comprehensive and considerate of all who lack these vital ser- vices. For this reason, the report looks at the rate of a country\u2019s progress in improv- ing both urban and rural coverage. 1 CHAPTER MDG Target 10 calls for the world to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanita- tion. 2 Asia Water Watch 2015 The report utilizes coverage data from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanita- tion in assessing the progress and defining the 2015 projections. It also utilized WHO data2 on cost estimations for meeting Tar- get 10 specifically in Asia and the Pacific. This report estimates that meeting Target 10 will cost as low as $8 billion annually. The higher the investment, though, the higher the technology and assured quality and quantity. Target 10 calls for the most basic technology. Equally important to the progress and prospects of the region is the rationale this report presents for investing in the water sector. It is not investing for water\u2019s sake, but for poverty\u2019s sake. Benefits of Water for Poverty Reduction Investing in the water sector is investing in all of the MDGs, not just Target 10. And the impact of water sector investments di- rectly targeted at poor consumers is any- thing but subtle. Safe water supplies immediately improve people\u2019s health and save them time, which they can use to study, or improve their livelihoods, so they can earn more, eat more nutritiously, and enjoy more healthy lives. Improved sani- tation protects the poor from socially and physically degrading surroundings, health risks and exposure to dangerous environ- mental conditions. Investments in better water resource management further ad- dress a host of concerns related to socio- economic and environmental dimensions, such as conflicts over water rights, con- tamination of water sources by animal/ industrial waste and agricultural chemicals, and sustainability issues related to water quantity in rural and urban areas. The multiplier effect makes it easier to understand how $1 invested in the water sector turns into $6. All too often, though, the expectation and analysis of benefits from water supply and sanitation projects are limited to the most common intended result\u2014better health. There are many other benefits from water sector investments, such as increased agricultural outputs and income when the rural poor gain access to irrigation. Water sector investments also improve levels of gender equality and edu- cational attainment because the poor have the time and good health to attend school and participate in economic activities, and by doing so, prove their worth by becom- ing cash-earning members of their house- holds and communities. By meeting Target 10, countries im- prove their likelihood of meeting the other MDG targets and goals. ADB\u2019s review of six water supply and sanitation schemes3 identified a range of social and livelihood benefits in addition to the health benefits that were the original rationale for the projects (Box 1). The nongovernment or- ganization (NGO) WaterAid assessed the impacts of water supply projects in a num- ber of countries and found a wide range of impacts on many aspects of life. Similar impacts have been found by other organi- zations. The benefits and related research prove the economic viability of water and sanitation investments to significantly re- duce poverty and increase productivity. For this reason alone, it is important for stake- holders to understand the water and pov- erty connection. This report makes a strong case for valuing and prioritizing water sec- tor investments and reforms by advancing the analysis beyond the domain of Target 10 to consider water\u2019s role in creating the conditions for meeting the other MDGs. Water Sector Reforms and Poverty Reduction For water supply and sanitation to dra- matically reduce poverty, a greater com- mitment of resources and political will are needed, and urgently. They are the precon- ditions to building institutional capacities, improved governance and investment flows, which are all a part of the larger reform work that must happen for water supply and sanitation to play its role in reducing poverty.

Are Countries in Asia on Track to Meet Target 10 of the MDGs? 3 mated. Recent studies4 conducted jointly by the United Nations Economic and So- cial Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) point out the need to formulate, implement and manage water supply and sanitation programs in strate- gic approaches of socioeconomic develop- ment. This requires complex and multi-dimensional reforms. There is grow- ing realization that the barriers to achiev- ing this are frequently political and institutional, rather than economic or physical. A number of agencies are collaborat- ing to help key stakeholders, particularly governments in their reform efforts, to understand the water-poverty relationship. ADB and the Poverty Environment Part- nership (PEP)5 (of which ADB and UN agen- cies are members) have collaborated in the Water and Poverty Initiative and come up with a framework for understanding this relationship. The report of the UN Mil- lennium Project Task Force on water and sanitation and the WHO/ UNICEF JMP Meeting the MDG Water and Sanitation Target: A Mid-Term Assessment of Progress report6 also provide key insights into how water and sanitation relate to poverty. The analyses in these different sources are consolidated here. Four key dimensions of poverty are used in the PEP conceptual framework: \ufffd Enhanced livelihoods security. The ability of poor people to use their as- sets and capabilities to make a living in conditions of greater security and sustainability. This analysis should address all aspects of their livelihoods, including the use of domestic water supplies for productive activities. A number of agencies are collaborating to help key stakeholders, particularly governments in their reform efforts, to understand the water-poverty relationship. Studies by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and WaterAid on the impact of their projects on the communities in different parts of the Asia region found that multiple benefits were the norm, including many that had not been antici- pated or invested in. These benefits, which af- fected many aspects of life, included: \ufffd Time saved, along with reduced fatigue from not having to collect water from, on aver- age, 6 kilometers away: this was often the benefit most valued by the community. The savings were usually directly translated into productive activities, especially by women. \ufffd Health benefits, including lower medical expenditure and the reduction of the long- term debilitating effects of diseases such as endemic dysentery and worm infestations. \ufffd Improved income opportunities from home- based livelihood activities that used the new water supplies, such as vegetable and live- stock production, brick and pot making, and operating food stalls. \ufffd Multiplier effects throughout the local economy from increased incomes and new enterprises based on improved water supplies. \ufffd Local organizations set up to build and run water supplies were often the basis for wider social mobilization, and led to the empower- ment of women and greater social cohesion. \ufffd Savings and credit groups led to the devel- opment of wider access to credit among the communities and improved financial man- agement skills. In urban areas, poor house- holds also saved on the cost of water, as before they had to pay informal providers high prices. \ufffd The new skills, organizations and social co- hesion, along with increased economic mo- mentum, had impacts on the wider political and social system, including at times in- fluencing government policies and bring- ing about more balanced representation.

Investments in the water sector (for both supply and sanitation) must utilize strategies that directly, and even disproportionately, benefit the poor. To effectively target the poor, though, their needs and abili- ties to contribute must be understood, which requires their direct involve- ment as stakeholders in consultation and implementation processes. Beyond being just recipients of investments, the poor must be seriously and genu- inely valued for their multiple abili- ties as shareholders of knowledge, participants in implementation, and caretakers of investment outputs\u2014the very systems they will use and de- pend on into the far future. Their needs vary within communities and locations, requiring a more complete understanding of the full range of costs and benefits associated with dif- ferent options for improving water supplies and sanitation. Water Management and Poverty Reduction It is important for Asia and the Pacific to understand the links between water resource management, water supply and sanitation, and these wider development processes if the region is to meet its MDG aspirations and obligations. Many parts of Asia and several Pacific Islands face critical and worsening problems in the availability, re- liability and quality of water and in envi- ronmental degradation and health risks from poor sanitation option that is avail- able to them. These problems are likely to worsen in the coming decade, despite (and, in some cases, partly because of) their oth- erwise positive development trajectory. The Millennium Declaration and the policies and strategies of many organiza- tions like ADB, UNDP, UNESCAP, and WHO address the challenge of water re- source management and water supply. The Millennium Declaration calls for \u201csustainable water management strate- gies at the regional, national, and local levels that promote both equitable access and adequate supplies.\u201d ADB\u2019s water policy7 sees water as a socially vital eco- nomic good that needs careful manage- ment to sustain equitable economic growth and reduce poverty. Similarly, the Human Poverty Index8 developed by UNDP identifies access to safe water as a key indicator of poverty. Underlying the issues and relationship of water resources management and wa- ter supply is the view that water man- agement must have two attributes. First, it must be integrative: looking at all as- pects of water resources and their uses at different institutional levels. Secondly, it must be targeted: focused on specific ac- tions that provide for the needs of the poor in an equitable and effective manner. In this context, it may be noted that several Are Countries in Asia on Track to Meet Target 10 of the MDGs? 5 countries and organizations in the region have been developing strategic approaches to integrated water resources manage- ment as recommended by the UN Gen- eral Assembly at its Nineteenth Special Session. In this connection, UNESCAP has developed a set of guidelines on strategic planning and management of water re- sources9 in 2003 and applied it in pilot studies on integrated water resources management in 17 countries in the re- gion. ADB has also helped advance inte- grated water resource management (IWRM) in the region in two ways: through its Water for All Policy that gives high priority to fostering IWRM and through its initiation of the Network of Asian River Basin Organizations. The MDG Water Supply and Sanitation Target Target 10: To halve, by 2015, the pro- portion of people without sustainable ac- cess to safe drinking water and sanitation, is actually defined by two in- dicators\u2014one for safe drinking water and the other for improved sanitation. Ulti- mately, a country must meet both indi- cators to qualify for achieving the entire Target 10. This report looks at the region\u2019s progress and prospects toward each indi- cator and applies the indicator for mea- suring rural and urban coverage. Analyzing a country\u2019s progress of Target 10 can render a number of scenarios. A country may be on course to meeting one of the indicators in rural areas but not urban areas. A country may be on course toward meeting one indicator and not the other. This report does not credit a country with being on track toward achieving Target 10 or its indicators unless adequate progress is being made in both urban and rural areas. The drinking water indicator was in- cluded as a high priority issue in the Mil- lennium Declaration, while the sanitation indicator was added after much debate in the World Summit on Sustainable Devel- opment (WSSD) in Johannesburg in 2002.

It would involve a number of social and fi- nancing activities for those facilities to be sustainable and deliver the desired im- pact. The Plan of Implementation10 cited the following examples of activities that investments must support: \ufffd development and implementation of efficient household sanitation systems; \ufffd improvement of sanitation in public in- stitutions, especially schools; \ufffd promotion of safe hygiene practices; \ufffd promotion of education and outreach focused on children as agents of be- havioral change; \ufffd promotion of affordable and socially and culturally acceptable technologies and practices; and \ufffd development of innovative financing and partnership mechanisms. Target 10 presents formidable chal- lenges to Asia and the Pacific. This report provides a detailed analysis of progress since 1990, the reasons for good or poor progress in the subregions, and the im- plications of the progress. The challenges are not confined to one aspect of life, can- not be addressed by one sectoral agency, and are found in all levels of society. The UN Task Force Report captures the mul- tiple and multi-level character of these challenges well, emphasizing in particu- lar the institutional and political issues that are a focus of this report: \u201cIn order to put forward effective recommendations for action to meet the MDGs, it is first neces- sary to analyze what is holding us back. Understanding why two in every ten people in the developing world lack access to water supply, and five in ten lack access to sani- tation services, is fundamental to identifying effective strategies for meeting Target 10. Clearly, the ex- planations vary across communi- 6 Asia Water Watch 2015 ties, countries, and regions, but a common set of political, financial, institutional, and technical chal- lenges confronts most developing countries in their quest to expand water supply and sanitation ser- vices.\u201d11 Effective and affordable strategies to address these different areas where action is needed present major challenges in the poorest countries of Asia, where institutions are at their weakest and progress toward Target 10 most distressing. Of the two, challenges around meeting the sanitation target are the greatest\u2014coverage levels are only half those of drinking water and the rate of progress in working toward the MDG target is noticeably slower. Indeed, the WHO/ UNICEF report12 suggests that for most Asian countries, their prospects are good for reaching the water supply in- dicator, but bleak for the sanitation indi- cator unless major changes are introduced with urgency. What is clear is that actions to achieve both the water supply and the sanitation indicators of Target 10 must be imple- mented without delay. This presents a mi- lieu of challenges for countries and governments to manage. Ideally, water supply and sanitation projects should be implemented in as far advance of the 2015 deadline as possible for their im- pacts to register on the other MDG tar- gets. Yet, the impact of these projects that deliver water supply and sanitation ser- vices are not likely to be sustainable if they are not accompanied by reforms that build the capacity of institutions and en- hance investment flows. These reform tasks take time to work through and can- not be implemented too quickly, although they are urgently needed. Governments, therefore, should immediately prioritize water sector reforms to maximize their ongoing implementation of water supply and sanitation projects. What is clear is that actions to achieve both the water sup- ply and the sanita- tion indicators of Target 10 must be implemented with- out delay. This pre- sents a milieu of challenges for countries and gov- ernments to manage.

In 2002, 82% of the region\u2019s population had gained access to improved water supplies, an increase of approximately 758 million people since 1990 (Table 2).13 The most dramatic improvement was in urban water supply coverage, where 368 million people, an overall increase of 35%, gained access to improved drinking water supplies. Despite progress made between 1990 and 2002, approximately 669 million people in the region were without access to safe drinking water, with nearly half of them in East and Northeast Asia. This is still a large number of people, representing the majority of the estimated 1.1 billion people globally without adequate water supplies. These aggregate figures also mask dramatic disparities between the subregions, between nations within subregions, and between urban and rural areas within countries. It is important to clarify what quali- fies as safe water, which Target 10 specifi- cally calls for. It is, unfortunately, extremely difficult to confidently and sta- tistically assure safe water. Countries may at the national level, and certainly at the local level, test to ensure that a water sup- ply is in fact safe.

Box 2 on page 13 discusses these types of tech- nology that greatly increase the likelihood that the water delivered from them is safe. For these reasons, this report prefers the language of \u201cimproved\u201d water supply and uses the WHO\u2019s definition14 of improved water supply as being characterized by (i) a significant increased probability that the water is safe, (ii) that it is more ac- cessible, and (iii) some measures against contamination are being taken to protect the water source (e.g., stand post, borehole, protected spring or well, or collected rain- water). Of course, improved water supply does not guarantee safe water supply, but it assumes a greater likelihood that a source is clean because of the level of technology used. Improved water supply is simply the best measurable standard. Therefore, the coverage and cost projections in this report are based on standards of improved access for both water supply and sanitation. There are many places where water quality is a concern, with the water available not meet- ing international guidelines for bacterial or chemical pollutants.15 Similarly, in urban areas in particular, supplies are often rarely 24 hours a day. For example, in Delhi, only 1% of those people with wa- ter supply connections enjoy 24-hour ser- vice availability. In Karachi, Dhaka, and Kathmandu, the figure is less than 1%.16 It is typically low-income areas that have the most unreliable access, with the only alternative being to buy water from in- formal vendors at prices much higher than those charged by utilities. The WHO defines improved sanita- tion17 as generally involving better, private access and safer disposal of excreta through BOX 2: Definition of \u201cImproved\u201d Water Supply and Sanitation Source: Hutton, G. and Haller, L.

The facilities used for both improved water supply and sanita- tion are basic and low technology, but must be properly constructed and prop- erly maintained. The analysis done for this report is based on the coverage rates for 1990 and 2002, the most recent data for most coun- tries, and projected coverage rates for 2015.18 Analysis is provided for total, urban, and rural rates of change. Not all countries had baseline data in 1990, so most of the analysis is limited to the 34 countries with baseline data. Countries that either lack baseline data or have al- ready achieved 100% coverage in 2002 are most often excluded from the analysis. The mixed picture of progress and prospects begins to appear as one takes a closer look at the trends in coverage rates between Asia and the Pacific\u2019s five subre- gions, the countries within those subre- gions and between urban and rural areas (See Tables 3A and B). Of the 34 countries that provided baseline data in 1990 for the water supply indicator and did not have 100% coverage in 2002, only 10 countries will likely achieve or exceed the water supply indicator of Target 10 for both rural and urban coverage: Azerbaijan, India, Micronesia, Myanmar, Nepal, PRC, Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, Turkey, and Tuvalu. Of those 10 coun- tries, four countries are projected to achieve 100% improved water supply cov- erage in both urban and rural areas be- fore 2015: India, Micronesia, Myanmar, and Tuvalu. Based on data trends from 1990 to 2002, more countries are likely to meet the water supply indicator in ur- ban areas than in their rural areas. Several countries are actually showing a decline in coverage rates (Annex C). Of the 34 baseline countries, five countries are regressing in urban coverage (Bangladesh, Cook Islands, Indonesia, Nepal, and PRC) and two countries are regressing in rural coverage (Northern Mariana Islands and Palau). Four countries are regressing in both urban and rural coverage\u2014Maldives, Marshall Islands, the Philippines, and Sa- moa. A regression in coverage should not be mistaken as a case of a country not making any progress in expanding cover- age. Most likely, coverage rates are in- creasing but not at a rate that keeps pace with population growth. In areas where populations are rapidly swelling, particu- larly urban areas, coverage rates must expand at an even faster rate to maintain course for Target 10. Worth noting, though, is that coverage rates in the small Pacific island countries may be slightly skewed because certain areas cannot be as definitively categorized as either rural or urban. Population wise, the PRC and India dominate their subregions and the whole of the Asia and the Pacific region. Collec- tively, in 2002, they accounted for 60% of the region\u2019s population and 38% of the global population. Both countries have made remarkable progress in water sup- ply coverage during the 12-year period. Yet, the question remains whether this rate of progress is enough for these two coun- tries to meet Target 10 of the MDGs. East and Northeast Asia With baseline data: CHINA, PEOPLE\u2019S REP.

When excluding those countries with 100% coverage or no baseline data, the regional analysis zeroes in on only two countries, the PRC and Mongolia. The PRC dominates this subregion in geographic and population size, account- ing for 86% of the subregional popula- tion. Yet, a subregional analysis of the growth in water supply coverage is solely a reflection of the PRC; Mongolia has not improved upon its 1990 numbers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f126ae41-fe9b-4526-8891-8063c68e0a9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "f126ae41-fe9b-4526-8891-8063c68e0a9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia Water Watch 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9386e9a1209d0de90e6b11bd4c160d9842bdf883d7f5361c01570a3f3e6da5cb"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff683170-81a5-4b1e-914e-f637ddfa3993", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b29ad7f5d1f07ae60c50e8b87ee4b26da5d16f4532e96c0fd41d1059b0d5c4e"}}, "hash": "38ca4958584c05459db5667a12d690d474aba348bffcc1a690fe6316b2e431fb", "text": "At best, any expansion in coverage is only going 12 Asia Water Watch 2015 Table 3-A: COVERAGE AND PROJECTIONS for 2015 \u2013 URBAN WATER SUPPLY (in thousand) Legend: \ufffd = on track \ufffd = off track a Does not have complete baseline data Notes: 1.

Mongolia\u2019s lack of progress, however, is likely related to its sparse population that is largely spread out in rural areas. The PRC extended access to total im- proved water supplies on an annual com- pounded rate of less than a percent\u2014just 0.8%, which still amounts to a 10% total increase in total supply coverage between 1990 and 2002. The PRC\u2019s urban cover- age has declined at an annual compounded rate of 0.7% for a total regression of 8% over the 12-year period. Despite the de- clining coverage rate, the actual number of served populace has actually increased at an annual rate of over 3% between 1990 and 2002. This translates to an additional 141 million people gaining ac- cess to improved water supply in the 12- year period. Assuming this rate is maintained in the next 12 years, urban coverage in the PRC will reach approxi- mately 98% in 2015, a remarkable feat given the rapid urbanization predicted for the country over the next decade or so. Progress in the PRC\u2019s rural areas is the result of over 1% compounded annual increase, which has meant a 9% total in- crease in the past 12 years. Projections put the PRC\u2019s rural coverage at 85% by 2015 if past coverage rates continue. Beyond the incredible percentage growth in the rural areas, the greatest gains in real numbers were made in the cities.

It also hosts great disparities in coverage between countries and between urban and rural areas. There has been a lack of any change in coverages of Papua New Guinea, the most populous country in the subregion after Australia and New Zealand. Papua New Guinea\u2019s total coverage in 2002 was only 39%, with 88% coverage in urban areas, but only 32% coverage in rural areas, one of the lowest figures globally. Projections for 2015 see little change in coverage of Papua New Guinea. The Marshall Islands has been expe- riencing an unusually substantial rever- sal. From already high coverage rates in 1990, coverage rates are dramatically re- gressing. From 94% total water supply coverage in 1990, Marshall Islands lost Overall, the region\u2019s picture of stymied progress is a reflection of compounding factors\u2014pollution, overexploitation of ground water, dilapidated systems, and insufficient levels of investment.

The country\u2019s ur- ban coverage rates fell at an even faster rate at 1.4% to imply a 17% decrease in urban rates, resting at just 80% cover- age. Fortunately, its rural rates show only\u2014yet still unacceptably\u2014an annual regression of 0.2% for a total 2% drop from 1990 figures, resting at 95% coverage. Several countries that once trailed this former leader in the subregion for water supply coverage now surpass it. Samoa also experienced regression in all catego- ries, but did not suffer as much of a set- back as the Marshall Islands. Despite many disappointing cases of performance in this subregion, there are instances of progress. Kiribati\u2019s average an- nual growth rates put it on track to meet the Target 10 indicator in rural areas, but is slow in cities. Kiribati is making inroads in rural coverage, reaching 53% in 2002, which is still low but a noteworthy increase from 33% coverage in 1990. Kiribati\u2019s progress in urban coverage, however, is not experiencing the same growth, up only 1% in 2002 to 77%. Micronesia is excelling in both urban and rural coverage at rates that make it an early achiever of the Target 10 water supply indicator. Tuvalu is on track to meet the water supply indicator in both urban and rural areas, but could easily achieve 100% total coverage given its high rate of coverage in 1990 and moderate rate of increased coverage over the 12 years. Overall, the region\u2019s picture of sty- mied progress is a reflection of compound- ing factors\u2014pollution, overexploitation of ground water, dilapidated systems, and in- sufficient levels of investment. The fail- ure to even come remotely close to achieving Target 10 weakens the Pacific\u2019s defense against overall poverty.

Bangladesh would have also shown dramatic improvements, from around 70% to over 90%, if ground- water sources in some areas had not been identified for arsenic contamination, lead- ing to the reclassification of many hand pumps as being unsafe. Maldives has also experienced an unfortunate severe down- turn in its nearly 100% coverage levels in 1990. Its once respectable rural cover- age level of 99% in 1990 is just 78% in 2002. Rural coverage in Maldives de- creased on an average 2% annually to a total decrease of 24% in rural supply. To a far lesser degree, its urban water sup- ply decreased by only 1%, yet the total effect of the country\u2019s regression meant that total water supply coverage decreased by 16% over the 12 years.

Further threat- ening Nepal\u2019s progress is a civil conflict that began in the mid 1990s, which led to restricted access to many parts of the country, particularly in the western re- gion.

Projections based on past coverage growth rates indicate that Malaysia and Thailand are likely to either approach or reach 100% coverage in urban areas by 2015, but their rural areas will elude Tar- get 10 achievement. No country in this subregion is likely to meet the indicator in rural areas. A further area of concern is that while Indonesia and the Philippines both had relatively high urban coverage in 1990, both regressed (although their actual numbers of people with access may have increased). Both countries are also regressing in rural coverage levels. Viet Nam shows no change. Countries in South- east Asia are by far more likely to achieve the water supply indicator in their urban areas than rural areas. Are Countries in Asia on Track to Meet Target 10 of the MDGs? 17 Sanitation Coverage: Progress and Prospects AT FIRST GLANCE, the picture of progress for improved sanitation coverage in Asia and the Pacific might appear to have changed little\u2014stuck at irredeemably low levels that require difficult amounts of financing to launch momentous change by 2015. For many, this impression would seem logical and the result of a historical oversight to improve sanitation coverage despite linking them to water supplies programs and projects. The focus of policy and investments has tended to be on improving water supplies while sanitation coverage has fallen far behind. As of 2002, one third of Asia and the Pacific lacked access to clean water, but one half of the region had no access to the most basic sanitation facilities. A huge proportion of the population is living in conditions that pose high risks to their personal and environmental health. Taking a closer look, though, substantial changes have been made in securing sani- tation coverage between 1990 and 2002. Coverage levels remain low in 2002, yet in many cases, they are respectable im- provements upon the 1990 figures (Table 4). In fact, many countries are expanding access to improved sanitation at rates that far exceed their efforts in water supply coverage. Compounded annual increases in access have been as impressive as 27%. Assuming that trends continue and that no major barriers to progress take place in the coming years up to 2015, major- ity of the countries with complete baseline data will likely meet their respective lev- els to achieve the Target 10 indicator for improved sanitation in at least their ur- ban or rural areas (Tables 5A and B).

Meeting the sanitation indicator is only a milestone en route to truly respectable and widespread humanitarian change. MDG target levels by no means represent acceptable levels of coverage. They do, how- ever, represent achievable levels if countries commit the resources and power to accom- plish them. As of 2002, less than half of the region\u2019s population had access to im- proved sanitation facilities\u2014nearly 2 bil- lion of the 2.6 billion people unserved worldwide. This total sanitation figure masks dramatic regional disparities be- tween rural and urban populations. In 2002, urban sanitation coverage had reached 76%, while in rural areas the fig- ure was a pitiful 32%. The rates of increase range from 0.1% to 27% (Annex C). It is worth noting that the disproportionate at- tention urban areas receive for improved sanitation is not without some justifica- tion. Urban dwellers face greater health 3 CHAPTER Many countries are expanding access to improved sanita- tion at rates that far exceed their efforts in water supply coverage.

The analysis in this chapter follows the same methods used for measuring progress and prospects for the water supply indica- tor (Endnote 18). In this case, improved sanitation involves better access and safer disposal of excreta through facilities such as septic tanks, simple pit latrines or venti- lated improved pit latrines (Box 2).

By 2002, the PRC increased its total sanitation access by 67%\u2014the result of a 6% compounded annual rate of expansion. In its urban areas, total coverage grew by 8% (from 23% to 44%) over the 12-year period. the PRC increased rural sanitation coverage by a remarkable 150% from the lowly level of just 7% in 1990 to 29% in 2002. The percentages of increase repre- sent incredible amounts of people. Over- all, about 300 million people in the PRC gained access to improved sanitation fa- cilities during this period. Although a markedly lower percentage than rural gains, the 8% growth in urban sanitation coverage is remarkable given the rapid rate of urbanization in the PRC. The 13% annual increase in rural sanitation trans- lates into nearly 174 million rural Chi- nese gaining access, yet sanitation coverage in rural areas still only reached 29% in 2002.

Kiribati had some of the lowest baseline figures in 1990 in its subregion, as well as the whole of Asia. Total sanitation coverage was just 25% in 1990, with urban coverage at 33% and rural coverage at 21%. Kiribati made far greater progress in its urban areas than rural areas. Urban coverage rose almost 60% at a compounded rate of 5% annu- ally, while rural coverage rose just 5% at 0.4% annually.

Its sanitation coverage level is the same as Sub-Saharan Africa. Of the countries with baseline data in South and Southwest Asia, five will achieve the Target 10 sanitation indicator in at least urban or rural areas if they continue at their current rate of growth. India, Paki- stan, and Sri Lanka will likely achieve the improved sanitation indicator in both ur- ban and rural areas if they continue ex- panding access at their 1990-2002 rates. In Pakistan, total coverage has risen from its 1990 level of 38% to 54% in 2002. In urban areas, it is projected to achieve 100% access to improved sanitation. Sri Lanka is the only country in the subre- gion on course toward 100% total im- proved sanitation coverage by 2015. Bangladesh will likely achieve the sani- tation indicator only in rural areas, yet this is a remarkable feat given that its 6% average annual increase\u2014if contin- ued\u2014will more than double its coverage level by 2015. This means access will be provided to more than 110 million people by the end of the MDG period. Despite their high coverage rates, Iran and Turkey are not projected to halve the remaining proportion of their people with- out improved sanitation. Nepal, with lower coverage rates than others in its Despite some regression, the majority of countries in the (Pacific) subregion are increasing coverage levels in both urban and rural areas.... 22 Asia Water Watch 2015 subregion, will also not improve at rates needed to meet Target 10. Iran figures show no progress in coverage levels and Turkey has been regressing in all cover- age levels, which will leave approximately 15 million people without improved sani- tation in 2015. Although projections are reserved for countries with baseline data, Afghanistan\u2019s total sanitation coverage of only 8% deserves attention. In rural ar- eas of Afghanistan, only 5% of the popu- lation had access to improved sanitation in 2002. Few places in the world face such scarce and alarming coverage levels.

Indonesia is the only country with baseline data not likely to achieve the Tar- get 10 sanitation indicator in either rural or urban areas. There was some increase in urban coverage levels, but there was no change for rural coverage levels. If Indo- nesia continues at the rate it has been go- ing since 1990, it will have one of the lowest rural coverage rates in all of Asia and the Pacific, with just 42% of its rural population having access to improved sani- tation. Urban coverage rates are headed toward the same conclusion, with only 76% of Indonesia\u2019s urban dwellers having ac- cess to improved sanitation in 2015, which is also one of the lowest projected sanita- tion coverage levels in all of Asia and the Pacific. Projections are not possible for Cam- bodia, Lao PDR, or Timor-Leste because they lack sufficient data. These low-income countries did have data in 2002, which are the lowest coverage levels in all of Asia and the Pacific. Cambodia had a 16% total cov- erage level, with urban coverage much higher than rural coverage\u201453% and 8% respectively. Lao PDR had 24% total im- proved sanitation coverage, with 61% of its urban populations covered and 14% of its rural populations covered.

JUST WHAT IS THE COST OF MEETING TARGET 10 in Asia and the Pacific? The price tag is surprisingly affordable. A regional, recurrent investment of just $8 billion a year would ensure that Asia and the Pacific meets Target 10 and continues to expand coverage beyond 2015 (Table 6). The greatest proportion of the bill belongs to the South and Southwest Asia subregion, followed by East and Northeast Asia, where the greatest numbers of unserved people are found in India and the PRC. And because Asia bears the majority of the world\u2019s poor, this region achieving Target 10 represents a significant achievement toward attaining the global target. The achievability and affordability of meeting Target 10 in Asia and the Pacific raises an interesting possibility: Political leaders can afford to confidently set more ambitious targets than the MDGs and advance their countries toward greater levels of social and economic development. It is not a matter of possibility, but a matter of willingness. The costs of providing access to safe water and adequate sanitation vary from high, when high standards are applied and so- phisticated technology is used, to substan- tially lower costs, when simple technology that demands low maintenance is used. In this analysis, improved water supply and sanitation refers to low technology im- provements, such as those discussed in pre- vious chapters, which would satisfy Target 10. A WHO study19 on the costs and ben- efits of water and sanitation improvements at the global level presented cost estima- tions on the following four interventions: 1. Intervention 1\u2014Reaching Tar- get 10: Halving the proportion of people without sustainable access to both safe water supply and improved sanitation (water and sanitation MDG targets); 2. Intervention 2\u2014Improved Water Supply and Sanitation for All: Sustainable access to safe water and im- proved sanitation for everyone; 3. Intervention 3\u2014Improved Water Supply and Sanitation for All Plus Disinfection: Providing disinfection at point-of-use over and above increasing access to improved water supply and sani- tation20; and 4. Intervention 4\u2014Piped WSS for All Plus Primary Treatment: Providing regulated piped water supply in house and sewage connection with partial sewerage for everyone.21 According to the WHO report, the funding or investment requirements for these four interventions cover: \ufffd Investment costs: Planning and su- pervision, hardware, construction and house alteration, protection of water sources and education that accompanies an investment in hardware. \ufffd Recurrent costs: Operating mate- rials to provide a service, maintenance of hardware and replacement of parts, emp- tying of septic tanks and latrines, regula- tion and control of water supply, ongoing protection and monitoring of water sources, water treatment and distribution, and continuous education activities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8185546-e954-4ea0-8883-621829ebc9e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8185546-e954-4ea0-8883-621829ebc9e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia Water Watch 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6541adbd00c8dc8dc56fdcfa7961fd17a67b0d292505df9d91ece9d604513e7e"}, "2": {"node_id": "ceecbdf1-17ce-4b86-9182-f9e54dd19aa5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0811c76fccf5bae58c6ec7790434c9c460223dc0fa722b83ae240254da549d8"}}, "hash": "9374ec521e362943b282aec7572d94f3c054dc4839f237248513a6a846b848e0", "text": "4 CHAPTER The achievability and affordability of meeting Target 10 in Asia and the Pacific... is not a matter of possibil- ity, but a matter of willingness. 24 Asia Water Watch 2015 The investment costs were annualized and added to the recurrent costs to obtain final total costs per intervention per year,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac3c6352-5491-46f0-a332-97ecad6875fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac3c6352-5491-46f0-a332-97ecad6875fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia Water Watch 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6e38149825878608248becf7b132dc53029e563ab4415aa490a2c8e671280abb"}, "3": {"node_id": "24d97d0e-0b6a-4443-a5b0-5ddab56ecb16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a9a3a8e23cbf4221bccca07e947b5bbd9dc61fb0d1053c1294c5288b0ef6f3b0"}}, "hash": "d2765cb873cacfd24da4cab383c1cf6a6c81428fc1f39b15ead2a389dd124a20", "text": "based on the life of the technology and a discount rate of 3%. Each intervention and its related costs and impact are discussed below. Table 6 presents the cost estimations for each of the four interventions by subregion. Intervention 1\u2014$8 billion annually. The intervention that would satisfy Tar- get 10 requires the least amount of an- nual recurring investment at $8 billion. These cost figures reflect the definitions of improved and safe water supply and sanitation given in the previous chapters, with adequate but not high cost technolo- gies that involve, for example chemical water supply treatment or primary wastewater treatment. There are many examples where lower cost technologies can be used, with this particularly true for rural areas, where family labor is of- ten used and where local entrepreneurs make materials and construct services themselves. The cost estimates used in this analysis and elsewhere can be found in Hutton and Haller (2004).22 The WHO re- port presents the annual costs of each type of improved technology per person reached. Table 7 presents the figures for Asia. From Table 7, one can see that a range of options are available, but that sanitation interventions are clearly more costly, with the cheapest option of a small pit latrine starting at almost $4. Most of the options for improved water supply are well under $4, starting as low as $0.25. The investment levels for sanitation, how- ever, are still affordable. Yet, the compara- tive figures provide a good insight as to why the rates of change for sanitation For Asia and the Pacific as a whole, the levels of invest- ment needed to achieve the MDGs are affordable.

The key is how to stimulate these investments from as wide a range of sources as possible, including consumers themselves and the private sec- tor, as well as from governments and the international community. Indeed, it is likely that the actual levels of investment made in water supplies and sanitation in the region will be far greater than this as many people will reflect their new pros- perity in decisions to invest in far higher levels of technology and service than those represented by the basic cost calcu- lations made here. Of course, that more is spent does not mean that more people are reached and it is the poor, those who are not in a position to choose expensive solutions, whose needs are the greatest cause for concern. The majority of Asians can and will look after themselves. Gov- ernments and the international commu- nity must focus their attention on those sections of society who cannot provide for their own needs under existing service delivery systems. The achievability of these investments raises the possibility of political leaders across the region setting targets that are more ambitious than those found in the MDG targets: remove forever the misery and adverse economic consequences of in- adequate water and sanitation in the re- gion that contains the majority of the world\u2019s poor. Indeed, some governments have already set targets that are more am- bitious than the MDGs: for example, Viet Nam\u2019s development goals aim to exceed the MDG targets by 2010 and provide safe water and improved sanitation for the whole country by 2020. In the international community, the central importance of improving access to safe and adequate water supplies and im- proved sanitation for poverty reduction is recognized, and, indeed, is one of the most frequently cited issues in the wider debate on poverty reduction. There are concerns, though, that this recognition of water\u2019s importance is not being matched by in- creased commitments of funds for the sec- tor. Indeed, there is evidence of reversing trend, with declining levels of funding sup- port from the international community.23 There are still other concerns that the sec- tor is neglected in the preparation of pov- erty reduction strategy papers, which set key priorities in national poverty reduc- tion strategies and provide a framework for donor support24. The following chap- ters build a case for investing in water by looking at the sheer economic benefits water brings to all major characteristics of poverty. The analysis shows strongly that reducing poverty increases economic productivity, and at levels that far surpass the initial investments. Are Countries in Asia on Track to Meet Target 10 of the MDGs? 27 Maximizing Target 10: Reaping the Full Social and Economic Benefits INVESTING IN WATER is investing in poverty reduction. In fact, $1 spent on improv- ing water supplies and sanitation buys the poor at least $6 in time and health sav- ings. The first chapter of this report discussed the purpose of prioritizing improved water supply and sanitation facilities\u2014they are gateways to widespread poverty reduction. We have measured the progress of Asia and the Pacific and made projec- tions of who is on course to meet Target 10 and who is not. We know what it will cost to ensure every country arrives at the target\u2014$8 billion annually. Now why? Why invest so much in the water sector when there are other sectors demanding equal or more resources? This chapter explains what investments in water will buy for the people of the regional economies. The hundreds of billions of dollars and millions of productive days that water offers are waiting to be realized. By building a rationale of water\u2019s benefits on each MDG and providing a cost benefit analysis, this chapter presents a strong case for investing in water. To not do so, the data argues, is the height of economic irrationality. And, to not do so urgently is a waste of opportunity to reap the social and economic benefits of water. Improving water immediately brings the poor better health, more productive hours in a day, higher wages, more time in school, and better educational attainment. The first MDG target, to halve by 2015 the proportion of the world\u2019s people liv- ing on less than $1 a day, requires sus- tained economic growth in countries across Asia and the Pacific. The existing record on this is patchy, with some coun- tries facing considerable challenges in achieving such sustained progress.

Investments in two key areas will greatly advance countries toward reducing poverty: Agricultural water supply and domestic water supply. Investments in these two areas will foremost improve their health through food security and increase their opportunities for greater income-gen- erating livelihoods. Through these invest- ments, the poor can become more productive workers and become engines for overall economic growth. Agricultural water supply and ru- ral poverty. Technically, the scope of Tar- get 10 is limited to increasing access to drinking water. Yet, traditionally, the wa- ter supply subsector includes water for ir- rigation and agricultural uses, as well as domestic use, as the context for monitor- ing access to drinking water. Improved ac- cess to agricultural water is also highly effective intervention for improving the poor\u2019s income, nutrition, and health. In most parts of Asia and the Pacific, the poor are heavily concentrated in rural areas, and not where the capital intensive, high pro- ductivity agriculture is found. Yet, agricul- ture will continue to be a key sector where the rural poor work. Limited access to ru- ral water supply, particularly irrigated fields, reduces the viability of agricultural activities for the rural poor. A wide variety of water management strategies could be adopted to address these problems, such as improving and expanding irrigation sys- tems across more farming land where pos- sible, improving rainwater harvesting and on-farm water management in rain-fed agriculture, crop diversification, and im- provements to crop strains. By improving rural water supply, a major determining characteristic of poverty is alleviated\u2014hunger and food security for the poor. The second MDG target calls for reducing by half, by 2015, the proportion of the world\u2019s people who suffer from hunger. Food security, in part, depends on national production and distribution capabilities, including government famine relief sys- tems. This is critically important for af- fordable food for both the rapidly grow- ing numbers of urban poor and rural populations in times of hardship, such as droughts and other disasters. Reliable wa- ter for subsistence agriculture, home gar- dens, livestock, fisheries, tree crops, and the sustainable production of other foods gathered in common property resources are potential options that can contribute to improving the food security of those most vulnerable to hunger. In rural ar- eas, food insecurity should primarily be tackled at the local level, so that specific sections of the poor, such as landless fami- lies, female-headed households, rainfed farmers, livestock herders, and other vul- nerable people, are targeted by interven- tions. Domestic water. Both the rural and urban poor depend on small, home-based enterprises where they, themselves, are the entrepreneurs. The poor have been indus- trious in using domestic water for a range of enterprises\u2014vegetable gardens, plant and tree crops, livestock, aquaculture, handicrafts, pottery, brick making, and leather goods, and providing such services as hair salons, laundries, and eateries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d7a457a-6a62-4621-8564-137e9fe535c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d7a457a-6a62-4621-8564-137e9fe535c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia Water Watch 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a64067c4a28104180b32c08d9ab8cf9dd7b38ad424ff262a3878e1b3349ee297"}, "2": {"node_id": "f134ca64-79c1-4e85-94f0-88059b588e3c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f589658e17433aec8bdeddcdab58f366908ef8f50a0a0630b5e4564d53bce37"}}, "hash": "6a1c7621bfab5632b5041d5a80df85c56a69d656283ed8505450b7de98efc0fd", "text": "Simi- larly, ecologically sustainable sanitation experiences show many productive uses for waste, whether from the recycling of nu- trients or the use of biogas as an energy source.

Initiatives to quantify these water-dependent home-based livelihood activities and include them in the calcula- tion of benefits of water supply and sani- tation investments are needed and should be a focus of cooperation between govern- ments and national and international de- velopment partners. Domestic water has traditionally been written off as a nonproductive cost\u2014 some- thing used only for consumption purposes. So, analysis of the benefits attached to do- mestic water has typically been limited to improvements in health and increases in time available and capacities for produc- tive activities. Not including the income- generating effect of domestic water supply limits the analysis. Yet, the time and health savings on their own generally justify in- vestments in water and sanitation. There is one main variable typically used to estimate the cost benefits of better access to clean, reliable water supply and improved sanitation\u2014 time savings. These time savings are traditionally split into two main types: gains related to lower mor- bidity and fewer deaths, and gains related to less distance and energy spent fetching water. Time savings represents an additional resource, which can be valued based on minimum wages. From this, it is estimated that the annual value of adult days gained from meeting Target 10 would be $323 million, rising to almost $647 million when improved water supply and sanitation are provided for all (Annex D). Due to the con- siderable health impact from disinfecting water at point-of-use (households), the value of productive days gained would be over $1.8 billion, and would reach $2.8 billion when regulated piped water supply in house and sewage connection with par- tial treatment for everyone is provided. East and Northeast Asia would benefit the most in terms of the value of productive days gained per year. The second major benefit of improv- ing access to water and sanitation derives from the time savings associated with closer location of the facilities. Time savings oc- cur from the relocation of a well or bore- hole to a site closer to user communities, the installation of piped water supply in houses, and closer access to latrines. They translate into increased production, higher school attendance, and more leisure time. The annual value of these time sav- ings, spread over the entire population of the Asia and Pacific region, would amount to $54 billion for achieving Target 10 and $109 billion to improve water supply and sanitation for all. When regulated piped water supply in house and sewage connec- tion with partial treatment is provided for everyone, $241 billion are generated from time savings. The economic and political significance of these potential benefits are tremendous. Essentially, every dollar invested in meet- ing Target 10 generates $6 in economic re- turns\u2014and that is just in terms of time savings. As stated earlier, Target 10 requires an annual investment of $8 billion. Once Target 10 is met, an economic benefit of over $54 billion is returned annually. Pro- viding total coverage generates even greater levels of benefits. It is the height of economic irrational- ity to not invest in these vital services\u2014as there are few other areas of investment that will generate as high a rate of return and that are as effective at targeting the spe- cific needs and capabilities of the poor.

As such, investments in water supply and sanita- tion are self-selecting to the poor and are of significance in terms of targeting invest- ments directly to poverty reduction. The poor themselves, who lack decent water supplies and sanitation options, almost al- ways prioritize water when asked what are their needs. Improving Health and Hygiene Of all the social sectors, the water supply and sanitation target\u2014Target 10\u2014obvi- ously affects the three health-related MDGs and their associated targets. By 2015, the three health-related MDGs hope to: \ufffd Reduce by two thirds the death rate for children under the age of 5 years \ufffd Reduce by three fourths the ma- ternal mortality ratio \ufffd Have halted and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/ AIDS, malaria, and other major diseases. Assisting the poor in their fight against diseases and high mortality rates, water is crucial to improving nutrition and food security. By making them healthier, the poor reduce their chances of falling ill\u2014and too often fatally\u2014to a wide range of con- ditions and diseases. The greatest threat posed by waterborne and water-washed diseases is infectious diarrhea\u2014the biggest killer of young children. Improved quanti- ties and quality of domestic water and sani- tation will directly reduce child deaths. As the WHO Director-General puts it:27 \u201cWater and sanitation is one of the primary drivers of public health. I often refer to it as \u2018Health 101,\u2019 which means that once we can se- cure access to clean water and to adequate sanitation facilities for all people, irrespective of the difference in their living conditions, a huge battle against all kinds of diseases will be won.\u201d His views are echoed by Secretary-Gen- eral of the United Nations Kofi Annan: \u201cWe shall not finally defeat AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, or any of the other infectious diseases that plague the developing world until we have also won the battle for safe drinking water, sanitation, and basic health care.\u201d Role of Awareness. Providing access alone will not deliver on water\u2019s promise to dramatically improve the poor\u2019s health. Behavior must change. Health and hygiene awareness campaigns must be waged in local communities to educate them on the different health and hygienic practices that should go along with the new and im- proved water services and facilities they receive. Government officials and services providers should not be excluded from this process of awareness raising. They too must understand, plan, and commit re- sources to the important role that aware- ness building plays in maximizing new services introduced in communities. There are many examples of successful aware- ness-raising approaches in this area. Role of local water, environmental management. As communities become more informed about personal health and hygiene, they also need to be educated on new ways of managing their surroundings. Local water quality must be protected from potentially hazardous environmental ele- ments, such as waste from livestock, pol- lution from farming and local industries, and potential habitats for parasites and dis- ease vectors, such as mosquitoes and worms. Protecting local water resources and surrounding environments at the lo- cal levels protects human health. Malaria is a scourge that will only be successfully addressed through water management that removes their breeding habitat. Similarly, water management will reduce vulnerabil- ity to a range of other diseases such as tra- choma and schistosomiasis for which water is a vector. Regional Prospects of Water\u2019s Im- pact.

Providing basic water and sanitation for all\u2014not just the half called for in Target 10\u2014would double these numbers and greatly reduce infant and child mortality. Cost savings benefit. Avoiding illness naturally saves time and money for both the health sector and to patients themselves. The most significant source of cost savings comes from the reduced number of treat- ments for diarrheal cases. Patients avoid costs incurred by seeking treatment, which includes expenditures on care, drugs, trans- port and the costs of opportunity lost to the time spent on seeking care. These cost savings were calculated by multiplying the cost of a health service unit by the number of cases averted. Past studies do not include data on the number of health visits per case, so it was assumed that 30% of the people with a diarrheal case would visit a health facility. Meeting Target 10 would save Asia and the Pacific $2.5 billion per year. An additional $2.6 billion would be saved every year if improved water supplies and sanitation were provided for all (Annex F). To further note, these health care sav- ings would continue long after the bulk of investments have been made to meet Target 10. That a significant proportion of these savings would go to poor people, who suffer most from the problems and would save most from their removal, has further implications for the poverty re- duction benefits of improved water sup- ply and sanitation. Improving the Lives of Slum Dwellers The urban poor suffer from poor quality and unreliable water services. In many major South Asian cities, only 1% or less of those fortunate to even have connections receive 24-hour water supplies. In worse conditions, slum dwellers without connec- tions regularly queue for long periods to collect water from private vendors. Most often, they are paying the most\u201410 times or more than what better off people with connections to central utilities pay. Few of the urban poor have access to sanitation, and many areas where the poor live are vulnerable to floods and contamination from polluted waters. Providing reliable, affordable and ac- cessible water supplies, improved sanita- tion, and protection from floods and pollution is a direct contribution to the MDG of improving the lives of slum dwell- ers. To do this requires substantial invest- ments in infrastructure and reforms in urban governance. In urban areas of Asia and the Pacific, between 1990 and 2002, nearly 384 million people gained access to water and nearly 369 million gained access to sanitation. Although this is an impressive number of people, the rate of increase has barely kept pace with the growth of urban populations. In 1990, 95% of urban residents had access to im- proved water supply. Twelve years later, in 2002, 94% had access\u2014although a reduc- tion of only 1%, this is an indication of population growth outpacing services. Sanitation coverage increased from 70% in 1990 to 75% in 2002. Meeting the urban sanitation challenge is particularly daunting, as the disposal of contaminated wastewater in densely populated areas is both expensive and technically challeng- ing and the scope for sustainable revenue to pay for these services is limited. There are examples of successful actions to ad- 32 Asia Water Watch 2015 dress these issues (Box 3) but as Bhatia26 says: \u201cDespite all the ideas and \u2018pilot\u2019 projects, approaches have not proved to be replicable, sanitation policies are ab- sent or not put into practice, investment remains mainly external and limited, and local subsidies have not been sustainable.\u201d In the words of UN Secretary General Kofi Annan: \u201cThere is a tragic disparity be- tween its human importance and its po- litical priority.\u201d The scope for improving these systems is great. There are examples, however, of where municipal authorities, often with the support of international development part- ners, have made great strides in both ex- tending coverage and improving services (see Box 4). Improving Education and Gender Equality Education is key to any poverty reduc- tion strategy and is increasingly empha- sized by national governments and donors as an area where new efforts are needed. The importance of education is reflected in MDGs to ensure that, by 2015, chil- dren everywhere will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling and progress is made towards gender equal- ity and the empowerment of women, In 1993, the people of Phnom Penh lacked reli- able water supply.

PPWSA earned riel (KR)0.7 billion ($175,400), against an operating cost of KR1.4 billion ($350,900). What was needed, Mr. Chan says, was a complete restructuring of the orga- nization to increase revenue and rehabilitate PPWSA\u2019s distribution network and treatment plants. In cleaning up PPWSA, Mr. Chan also sought to supply clean and safe water directly to poor families. Now, more than 10 years on, each of the 82,000 PPWSA connections in Phnom Penh is metered, and 70% of the city is connected to the water distribution network. \u201cProbably the most difficult of all,\u201d says Mr. Chan, \u201cwas to increase the water tariff to cover its cost.\u201d By 2001, after phased increases, PPWSA\u2019s revenue covered the cost of supply. PPWSA\u2019s distribution network was rehabilitated and an effective maintenance system was in- stalled. By 1996, with a $20 million Asian De- velopment Bank loan and funding from the World Bank, France, and Japan, PPWSA em- barked on renewing and rehabilitating its distri- bution network, a task completed by 2002. New treatment plants were built and old ones reha- bilitated. In restructuring PPWSA, Mr. Chan gave higher management more responsibility. Sala- ries were increased, by up to 10 times, and per- formance-based bonuses were introduced. Those who performed badly were penalized. PPWSA started to install water meters and set up an in- spection team to stop illegal connections. It re- vised and improved its consumer files and began to educate the public of the importance of paying their water bills. The bill collection improved from 50% in 1993 to 99% in 2004. The success of reforms in the PPWSA shows that an efficient and sustainable urban water utility can be created even in challenging circumstances, so long as leadership and political will exist and the needs of consumers are put first.

The project has directly benefited over 5000 schoolchildren and indirectly over 13,000 local community members by helping them to build latrines. Funds from WaterAid Australia have supported the building of 84 latrines in 14 primary schools in the Eastern Highlands province of the country.

Establishing sound personal hygiene habits at a young age is vital so that children Source: WaterAid Water for Life website: http://www.wateraid.org.uk/ 34 Asia Water Watch 2015 of girls do not have to spend study time collecting water. Better water supplies and sanitation in schools, poorer rural areas in particular, are also important in ensur- ing school attendance. Without these im- proved facilities, cultural barriers in a number of Asian countries prevent girls from attending school. The benefits of improved water sup- plies and sanitation in both the homes of children and in school can be measured by calculating the numbers of school days that would otherwise be lost to ill- ness (see Annex G). The data show that tens, or even hundreds of millions, of school days could be gained every year from water supply and sanitation invest- ments, having a tremendous impact on the education of children. These days gained can be valued in terms of the fu- ture productivity of better-educated chil- dren. The value of these school days gained ranges from $232 million to $2 billion annually depending on the level of inter- vention. Gender Balance. Community orga- nizations for water management are of- ten important mediums for improving the social capital of women, leading to more balanced gender roles. The experiences of NGOs, such as the Bangladesh Rural Ad- vancement Committee and the Self-Em- ployed Women\u2019s Association in Gujarat, India, provide models that initially orga- nize women around water, acting as a catalyst to wider processes of empower- ment and development. The widespread rep- lication of these examples and other NGO experiences in South Asia show that scal- ing up is not necessarily a problem, even in areas that are more socially conserva- tive. The time and drudgery women save The Asian Development Bank-assisted Com- munity-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Project is to support the Government in ex- panding the coverage of improved water sup- ply and sanitation facilities to underserved populations, especially in poor and remote ar- eas, and in improving health and hygiene prac- tices related to waterborne and sanitation diseases. The project was designed in close con- sultation with a wide range of stakeholders. Socially excluded castes and disadvantaged eth- nic groups are specifically targeted to benefit from these investments, which will help rec- tify historically inequitable access to many social services, including water supply and sanitation. The project builds on lessons learned and best practices to incorporate features such as (i) ensuring diversity in all decision making; (ii) demand-driven and participatory delivery and management using nongovernment organiza- tions (NGOs) and community-based organiza- tion; (iii) NGO supported community-based planning, implementation, and management; (iv) support to decentralization built into de- sign; and (v) a program orientation. Under this project, NGOs are helping the beneficiaries form water user groups, which will be responsible for construction, as well as operation and main- tenance of water supply systems. Community water user and sanitation committees must have, at least, a proportional representation of poor, deprived castes, and of ethnic minority groups. Moreover, at least 50% of the execu- tive and general members of these committees must be women. The committees will decide on the type of technology used and will be re- sponsible for implementing the schemes. Low- income families will receive payments for 50% of the time they spend working on the project, and receive concessionary loans and subsidies to support latrine construction.

Because of women\u2019s central role in collecting and using water, they are central actors in improving water supplies and sanitation. They are the main stakeholders and it is essential that they be placed at the center of decision mak- ing when planning and implementing sys- tem improvements. It is understandable why women place such a high priority on improving water supplies and sanita- tion facilities. They carry tremendous bur- dens to provide water and care for the health of their families. It should also be understandable then why improving wa- ter supplies and sanitation facilities is cen- tral to addressing gender issues. Are Countries in Asia on Track to Meet Target 10 of the MDGs? 37 Defining the Challenges: Where Change is Needed WE HAVE SEEN THAT in many parts of the Asia and Pacific region, and for the region as a whole, the prospects for reaching at least the MDG target for water supply are good. The situation for sanitation is less positive, though even here there are a number of countries where it can be expected that the target will be achieved. Many of the countries likely to reach all of Target 10 are ones where the situation is already relatively good and where the prospects for continued development and growth suggest that the needed resources and institutions will ensure continuing progress. Several of these countries are large, including the big two\u2014the PRC and India, implying that their achievement will also push for the accomplishment of Target 10 at the global level. Attaining the MDG targets will be an important milestone in the process of socioeco- nomic and environmental development in these countries, but continuing commitment will be necessary to maintain the momentum of the achievement of the MDGs. Achieving the MDG targets is still not the end of the story, including the end of the need for significant investments in water supply and sanitation. Even in countries where Target 10 and the MDGs are met, there will often be communities and areas that will still face problems. Target 10, like most other targets, only aims to halve the number of people without access to water and sanitation. In most countries, many millions of people will not have their needs met despite the MDG targets being achieved. Given that it is likely to be the poorest people, often living in the most challeng- ing locations and whose needs are unmet, the challenges of providing improved wa- ter supply and sanitation for all of the people of Asia and the Pacific will still be significant. Other countries in the region face a variety of challenges in reaching the MDGs. As we have seen, for some countries in Asia and the Pacific, the pros- pects of attaining Target 10 are remote unless major changes are made in the ways water supply and sanitation ser- vices are delivered. This is particularly true for sanitation, where current trends suggest that there is little or no prospect of the 2015 target being reached without these changes. What changes need to take place to ad- dress these challenges? Clearly and now widely accepted is the understanding that the principal challenges will not be tech- nological\u2014 the hardware of water supplies and sanitation\u2014but rather the soft issues: How can water supply and sanitation pro- grams be organized and financed? How can people be trained, organized, and motivated to install, use, and maintain the facilities? How can institutions develop more and better incentives and make improvements more sustainable? These questions are not new, and indeed have been recognized as pivotal since the Water Supply and Sanita- tion Decade in the 1980s. That they are familiar does not negate their relevance or importance, for the challenges the ques- tions present are still to be met in many parts of the Asia and Pacific region. 6 CHAPTER Target 10... only aims to halve the number of people without access to water and sanita- tion (and) the chal- lenges of providing improved water supply and sanita- tion for all of the people of Asia and the Pacific will still be significant. 38 Asia Water Watch 2015 Priority Action Areas Box 7 sets out the 10 priority action ar- eas identified by the UN Water and Sani- tation Task Force in their final report for the Millennium Project.

UN, New York. Are Countries in Asia on Track to Meet Target 10 of the MDGs? 39 The focus on increasing choices for people as consumers of services implies a different role for governments. Instead of seeing their main task as building more facilities, government agencies should concentrate on creating an effective policy, legal and regulatory environment in which all sections of the community, in- cluding local communities and the private sector, can play an active role in improv- ing access to safe water and improved sani- tation. In defining the trajectory of and pri- orities for change, decision makers need to address a range of issues in the follow- ing four core areas that reflect the key constraints identified in the UN MDG Task Force report: 1. Policy, legal, and regulatory reform is an essential pre-condition for sustainable and effective change in Asia and the Pacific. Governments are the cen- tral actors because they are responsible for defining the framework within which water supply and sanitation provision takes place. This framework houses the set of laws and regulations that determine the responsibilities and rights of differ- ent sections of society to access these ser- vices, as well as determine the quality of standards these services must maintain to protect users and environments. These laws and regulations are further priori- tized by the policy framework for the sec- tor and for related sectors such as health, education, ecosystems conservation, and household-based livelihood activities that use domestic water.

This is particularly true for targeting government and donor re- sources for investments, awareness rais- ing and community mobilization. 2. Planning and technology choices must ensure that the national le- gal and policy framework is put into prac- tice. Governments need to ensure that the planning systems surrounding their pro- grams, including programs supported by donors, reflect the policy priorities. They do this by having explicit poverty targets and providing options that reflect the needs and capabilities of the poor. Above all, the goal should be to make the full range of technology and management choices available to poor people and to planners. This should include developing innovative and, where possible, low cost technical choices that can be afforded and imple- mented by poor communities. For water supply, this should include approaches such as small piped networks for, in par- ticular, areas of urban fringes and densely settled rural areas, as well as innovative technologies to ensure adequate water quality. For sanitation, ideas for ap- proaches that accomplish both safe use of wastewater and excreta and ecologi- cally sustainable sanitation need to be scaled up to a level where they make a real impact at a national level. 3. Financing mechanisms26, in- cluding supportive investment environ- ments (especially ones that encourage small private sector investments) and ef- fective cost recovery mechanisms are ap- proaches that will address major challenges in many places. Two aspects of this issue are particularly important: a) The establishment of more effec- tive and diverse credit and financial man- agement systems that are accessible to and affordable by the poor. This is essen- tial to generate as high a level of cost re- covery as possible. In many cases, the poor are willing to pay for better water and sanitation. The appropriate financial mechanisms are needed to deliver the improved access to them. b) The development of a regulatory regime in which investments by the pri- vate sector, and especially by local small- scale entrepreneurs, are encouraged. A key aspect of this is the reform of government regulations in order to enable private sector\u2019s engagement in the water sector. This should be accompanied by the devel- opment of targeted programs to encour- age entrepreneurial development. 42 Asia Water Watch 2015 makers, central ministries, local govern- ment agencies, and the support given by international development partners; (iii) the private sector; and (iv) relevant interna- tional stakeholders. People, communities, and civil society This fundamental group of stakeholders comprises the very families we are try- ing to extend access to safe and sufficient water and improved sanitation, the orga- nizations that represent and involve them and organizations from the rest of soci- ety that support the poor. These commu- nities and organizations are central to any development of water supply and sanita- tion. In particular, working with local people provides \ufffd Knowledge of their real needs and priorities, the condition and sustainability of local water resources, the many types of long-standing and effective solutions to their problems and the local traditions and customs that need to be understood if awareness programs are to be effective. \ufffd Skills of many sorts, including the practical skills of masonry and plumbing needed to build and maintain water sup- ply and sanitation facilities, the skills needed to make home-based livelihood ac- tivities viable, and organizational skills needed to plan, construct and operate wa- ter supply and sanitation facilities. \ufffd Resources from the people them- selves, which experience in many parts of the region show that people are both will- ing and able to pay for water supplies and sanitation where the technology choices and materials are appropriate and avail- able. \ufffd Augmentation of knowledge, skills, and resources of local people through their willingness to work with civil society, which are in turn effective at introduc- ing innovations that ensure these local assets can be used more effectively. They are also often important in assisting to develop community-based organizations that are fair and representative, and can play a key role in assisting local commu- nities to relate to government agencies and other external organizations. The discussion about local communi- ties, and even the poor, does not mean to generalize them as a homogeneous group. They are differentiated along gender, eco- nomic, and social lines. These different groups often have extremely different, even conflicting, needs and interests. It is con- sequently essential to ensure that organi- zations that purport to represent the poor are indeed representative of all sections of the poor and not just some dominant in- terests.

Particular attention needs to be paid to the regulatory and in- stitutional context for ensuring that ap- propriate financial mechanisms exist. Are Countries in Asia on Track to Meet Target 10 of the MDGs? 43 \ufffd Directly investing in water sup- ply and sanitation in key areas. This in- cludes (i) urgently investing in water supply and sanitation facilities in schools, health care facilities, and other public places; (ii) targeted programs of invest- ments that aim to reach places where pri- vate initiatives and the market are not likely to provide solutions, including serv- ing and subsidizing the poorest of the poor and investing in areas such as large rural settlements, cities, and peri-urban areas where the only viable options are multi- household facilities. A key issue is the nature and effectiveness of cost recovery mechanisms if the investments are to last. \ufffd Providing financing and credit for investments made by others, whether com- munities, the private sector or other or- ganizations. This can take many forms, including the existing banking systems, di- rect credits to NGOs or other organiza- tions, and dedicated credit systems established under projects and others. There is a need to make such systems flex- ible, appropriate to the needs of the poor (with issues such as collateral a particu- lar concern) and, above all, permanent. Far too many credit systems have been set up under projects only to wither away once the project support is over. \ufffd Advocacy, education, and aware- ness connected with issues of health and hygiene promotion, ensuring environmen- tal sustainability, informing people of their rights and responsibilities, and assisting communities to access government pro- grams and other resources. Ministries and agencies with responsibilities in the health and education fields have a particularly im- portant role in this area. \ufffd Monitoring and enforcement of regulations concerning key issues, such as water quality and wastewater disposal, technical standards for facilities, any regu- lations to ensure fair financial conditions for investments and service provision, and the registration and regulation of organi- zations that represent local communities (Endnote 15 on WHO Guidelines). \ufffd Supporting innovations through both research and development that gen- erate new options and, perhaps more im- portantly in the short term, establish conditions where good practices can be scaled up to a level where they make a real and sustainable impact on the ground. Lo- cal universities and other research institu- tions are of pivotal importance here. Because the water sector and all its varied subsectors (supply, sanitation, irri- gation, drainage, resource management, etc.) are often divided between many dif- ferent government departments and agen- cies, reforms and the regular overseeing of these subsectors can be extremely frag- mented. Governments need to establish apex bodies that bring inter-government coordination. In the area of investments, different tiers of government consequently have a complex and pivotal role in ensur- ing that investments are made and other aspects of water supply and sanitation de- velopment are implemented in ways that are fair, sustainable, and efficient in eco- nomic, environmental, and social terms. Although governments do have an impor- tant role in the direct implementation of some types of investment, this is not their primary role, but one of many roles. Private Sector The private sector has increasingly been recognized as having a key role in water supply and sanitation development. The private sector takes different forms and can perform a variety of roles. The one that has attracted the most attention (and criti- cism, whether justified or not) is where large private corporations, including mul- tinationals, have taken over the manage- ment", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3a9ca74-5b8f-4c4a-b19d-36c581dcc5cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3a9ca74-5b8f-4c4a-b19d-36c581dcc5cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia Water Watch 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e90e87fec1c2541607f427e2d1753cf81b1b7dab50cfc00c9737270153009a9b"}}, "hash": "e90e87fec1c2541607f427e2d1753cf81b1b7dab50cfc00c9737270153009a9b", "text": "of water utilities in major cities. The experience in these ventures has been mixed, but lessons are being learned and there is scope for improving approaches for the engagement of appropriate private sec- tor corporations in many rapidly growing urban areas. This high-profile role of the private sector is not, by a long way, the most im- 44 Asia Water Watch 2015 portant one in water supply and sanita- tion provision in Asia and the Pacific. Of far greater importance, whether judged economically or by numbers of people served, is the role of local, generally small, entrepreneurs in providing a wide range of services to support and make invest- ments in and the operation of water sup- ply and sanitation facilities. Small, local private sector entrepreneurs provide the following range of services in water sup- ply and sanitation: \ufffd Manufacturing and distribution of materials and equipment, including pipes, latrine pans, pumps, bricks, water tanks, and many others. The availability of these materials through local retail outlets is es- sential if people are to invest directly in addressing their needs. \ufffd Constructing and maintaining fa- cilities, including drilling wells, laying pipes, building latrines, and all other as- pects of the work needed to turn invest- ments into facilities. These can be communal or individual, but the existence of the skills and equipment among local small businesses to build and look after water supply and sanitation facilities is essential for the sustainability of invest- ments. \ufffd Service providers in the form of water sellers, whether they are the opera- tors of small piped schemes or vendors who bring water to people\u2019s homes. These are often small and informal, and are often the only reliable source of water in low-income urban areas. They can be efficient, but are often extremely expensive. Despite this, they provide a service when no others are available. \ufffd Providing inputs and markets for the goods and services produced in home- based livelihood activities that depend on domestic water supplies. The viability of these livelihood activities depends on the availability of the inputs and good access to markets, which are most often local. The scale of such small-scale private sector involvement is extremely difficult to estimate, but in many countries appears to be large, often larger than the services provided by government agencies if mea- sured by number of people connected or served. These local investments also tend to be economically efficient to provide fa- cilities at a lower unit cost than those pro- vided by government or through donor projects and to be sustainable and respon- sive to consumer needs and demands. Such investments can also be important in generating local economic development through the multiplier effects they gen- erate. The private sector, and especially local entrepreneurs, has long been ne- glected in many government and donor activities in the sector. It is essential that this is reversed, and the private sector be recognized as a key stakeholder in the sec- tor if the MDG targets and the needs of the poor are to be met efficiently and sustainably. Relevant International Stakeholders The international community has been playing a major role in creating an envi- ronment conducive to partnerships, com- mitment, investment, and accountability in development. The important challenges discussed in the previous section also re- quire involvement of the relevant inter- national stakeholders to monitor, promote, and support the process of de- veloping the region\u2019s water sector and ad- vancing it toward the MDGs and sustainable socioeconomic growth in the region. The title of this chapter asked, \u201cWho should do what?\u201d The discussion above gives some answers to this question. In many ways, we need integrated approaches where different stakeholders work together and are driven from below. Indeed, this could apply to almost any sector and are conventional wisdoms of international de- velopment approaches. This familiarity does not invalidate them, however\u2014the need for these approaches has been recog- nized in principle but all too often not fol- lowed through into practice in a comprehensive manner. There are ele- Are Countries in Asia on Track to Meet Target 10 of the MDGs? 45 ments of these approaches in almost all countries. What is needed is for these el- ements to be drawn together into a co- herent national strategy. This will create the conditions where the levels of invest- ments needed to achieve and surpass Tar- get 10 can be realized throughout Asia and the Pacific. As it is, great progress is being made in the region. But more can be done where governments, supported by international development partners, act to ensure that the capabilities and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de1a1b60-faec-4e05-8b01-a8d25577e799": {"__data__": {"id_": "de1a1b60-faec-4e05-8b01-a8d25577e799", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia Water Watch 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b18b1f31142b9a9d5b645fa134c699a6eb88eb71a9959026fb3be4fbcb1c9453"}, "3": {"node_id": "1d655b75-6780-4df5-8179-f376fce91431", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-water-watch-2015", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "208c6ae25bff6bbe8608dae2d029debd69af23c3fc7e60a3e329fcc625d84487"}}, "hash": "f118e30ce602495b325210661a58c489e3d2e96250b108dc0f2c4d9126ff44b3", "text": "re- sources of all sections of society are uti- lized to their full potential for a sector that is one of the keys to the reducing the poverty of hundreds of millions of people in the countries of Asia and the Pacific. Next Steps The immediate next steps of all four key stakeholder groups should be in the direc- tion of aggressive sanitation interventions to meet Target 10, or at least come closer than what the dismal projections warn. It has long been argued that sanitation should be promoted as part of integrated rural development plans and programs, urban upgrading, or primary health care, or at least together with water supply and hygiene education (Cairncross, 1992). The belief was that by combining sanita- tion with water supply, it would prevent it from being neglected. There is increas- ing concern, however, that this is not al- ways the case. There have been cases where the implementing agency has ap- propriate staff or structures for one com- ponent but not the sanitation element. Also, just because several interventions are planned together does not mean they progress at the same speed. As Cairncross points out, the pace of sanitation imple- mentation is set not by administrative ability to provide facilities but by con- sumer demand so that it rarely matches the progress of other measures. Clearly, each case must be weighed on its own merits and an analysis of the local situation. There may also be practi- cal reasons for water supply and sanita- tion to be dealt with separately. 46 Asia Water Watch 2015 Endnotes 1.

the RCB team\u2019s major advisory and knowledge services as well as other activities in support of Country Offices (COs) in the Asia-Pacific region from January to December 2005. This report is divided into sections by practice: governance, energy and environment, crisis prevention and recovery, (tsunami, avian influenza and the South Asia earthquake response), and management, and by focus areas: ICT4D and South-South Cooperation, communications and knowledge services (expert referrals, knowledge products and events). Regional programme financial status and staff build-up are also covered. The Asia-Pacific Region in 2005: An Overview 2005 was a year that witnessed Asia's valiant efforts to rise above the tsunami waves set off by the earthquake off the Sumatra coast on 26 December 2004, and scale Himalayan heights to bring succour to the victims of another major earthquake that struck Pakistan and Kashmir on 8 October 2005. The tsunami of 26 December 2004 was a natural disaster of unprecedented scale, in terms of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d111fa30-a8a3-4ce7-b469-0575bb5748a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "d111fa30-a8a3-4ce7-b469-0575bb5748a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centre-bangkok-annual-report-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok Annual Report 2005", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centre-bangkok-annual-report-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb84961560cc1915bd7945024abf8a9a49722fb5dc8aa18d468f6f3a0df4ca2a"}}, "hash": "fb84961560cc1915bd7945024abf8a9a49722fb5dc8aa18d468f6f3a0df4ca2a", "text": "the number of lives that it took, and the millions left homeless from Aceh in Indonesia to Andhra Pradesh in India. Aceh and North Sumatra lost the greatest number of lives. The tsunami took lives that could have been saved, if only the region had recognised sooner the real extent of its connectedness, and had taken steps to put in place warning systems for natural disasters. The Special ASEAN Leaders\u2019 Meeting held in Jakarta on 6 January 2005 recognised that the devastation would need an unprecedented global response to assist national governments\u2019 efforts in emergency relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction that could take five to ten years, and agreed to establish a warning system for the region. The World Conference on Disaster Reduction, held in Kobe, Japan, in January 2005, adopted the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015, calling on all countries to integrate disaster risk into political agendas and national policies. The tsunami catastrophe exposed critical weaknesses in governance in the affected countries, forcing some to address long-lasting internal conflicts with greater urgency, but also with a renewed sense of reality. In Indonesia, the Government has reached a tentative peace accord at Helsinki with the separatist Free Aceh Movement (GAM) to end 30 years of fighting. In Sri Lanka, the Government agreed to a joint tsunami relief-monitoring mission with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), despite strong opposition from within its ranks and continuing uncertainty over prospects for constitutional resolution of the conflict. In Thailand, the Government has shown more sensitivity to the human rights of tsunami victims, including migrants who had earlier been slated for deportation. The Maldives is among the worst affected with per capita reconstruction costs estimated to be higher than in other countries. The tsunami response in the Maldives (and in the other countries) should result in a more efficient and transparent public procurement system. In India, Hindus, Muslims and Christians helped one another as never before to overcome entrenched forms of discrimination based on religion, gender and caste. The importance of governance of the kind that is responsive, accountable, participative and transparent, to secure the well being of people, during disasters and in normal times, has come to the forefront. There have been other upheavals in national governance. The Maldives People\u2019s Assembly is considering constitutional reforms to strengthen fundamental rights, entrench multiparty democracy, separation of powers, effective parliamentary governance, judicial independence, and human rights. Mongolia has blazed a trail by formally adopting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and an additional goal on the Millennium Declaration\u2019s commitment to democracy, good governance and human rights. Bhutan has initiated a 4 process of securing public consent and legitimacy to a new constitution to replace absolute monarchy with a constitutional monarchy, human rights guarantees, democratic elections, and a two-party political system, enabling an effective opposition to the party in power. The presidential election in Iran passed off peacefully, but discussions over the nuclear programme continues to keep Iran in the news. There have been some setbacks during the report period. In Thailand, a different kind of crisis is festering, as the government takes a hard-line approach to Muslim rebellion in the far South. The National Reconciliation Commission (NRC) has warned the Government against excessive use of emergency powers. In Nepal, a coup on 1 February 2005, in which the King took over absolute power, has demonstrated the vulnerability of democracy to crises of legitimacy, brought about most often by inequity and discriminatory treatment of population groups and regions. The Philippines witnessed another upsurge of \u201cpeople\u2019s power\u201d against the President following allegations of electoral malpractices. The importance of constitutionally established means for bringing about changes in political leadership has come to the fore. Apart from political and natural disaster shocks of the kind mentioned above, the region remains vulnerable to economic and humanitarian shocks. Memories of the Asian financial crisis, and before that, the \u201coil shocks\u201d, have not faded. In 2005, rising oil prices continue to be a major threat to economic development. HIV/AIDS is a threat to the prosperity of India and China. Avian influenza threatens to explode into a pandemic in Southeast Asia, from which the numbers of victims could dwarf those of the tsunami. However, the rising awareness of its seriousness among Asia-Pacific decision-makers and senior officials, in both national governments and international bodies, has triggered unprecedented regional cooperation in making large-scale preparations. The UN General Assembly recently endorsed a declaration made by Small Island Developing States (SIDS) requesting expanded trade opportunities, assistance in coping with sea-level rise, and other adverse consequences of climate change, and for renewable energy and cleaner fossil fuel technologies.

But importing countries are allowed to set exceptions, applied to crucial products such as textiles, sugar and rice. With unfinished business from Hong Kong, and a U.N. General Assembly five-year review of the Brussels action plan in September 2006, much remains to be done to benefit the LDCs most in need of economic justice and international support. Globalisation has highlighted the importance of regional cooperation. Cooperative mechanisms, such as ASEAN and SAARC, continue to retain sensitivity about principles of sovereignty and non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other states. Conventional approaches to South-South cooperation should give way to innovations. \u201cIn an increasingly interconnected world, progress in the areas of development, security and human rights must go hand in hand\u201d (In Larger Freedom, Kofi Annan, 2005). The potential of ASEAN for moving Myanmar towards democracy, respect for human rights, and good governance, is a case in point. Governance in Asia-Pacific has become an important \u2018global public good\u2019. Uneven development, corruption and consequent lack of legitimacy of the state, are the most serious among the dangers faced by many countries in the region. These factors, more than any others, tend to produce the phenomenon of \u201cfragile states\u201d. Asian countries are addressing these problems, and realise that the achievement of the MDGs, uniformly across population groups and regions is critical. Throughout the region, there is a strong link between poverty, gender inequity and the poor survival rates and wellbeing of the region\u2019s children and women. 5 The importance of multi-sectoral success for the achievement of the MDGs and the critical need for democracy, development, fulfilment of human rights and good governance, emphasised in the Millennium Declaration and at the Millennium Summit, and reiterated in In Larger Freedom, are evident all over Asia. 6 Democratic Governance Strategic Objectives in 20051 1. Increased effectiveness of representative bodies at central and sub-national levels to perform their democratic functions and enhance national poverty reduction goals 2. Poor and disadvantaged groups including indigenous peoples, empowered to seek remedies for injustices and justice institutions enabled to be responsive to claims, consistent with international human rights norms Public administration reform for efficient, effective, responsive and pro-poor public services promoted at central and local levels Increased effectiveness of representative bodies at central and sub-national levels to perform their democratic functions and enhance national poverty reduction goals Representative systems at local and sub-national levels were given a special focus in 2005 both at a programming and policy advisory level. A regional retreat on Representation in Decentralised Governance and Local Service Delivery was held in June 2005, with case studies to be prepared as a result of participant feedback on improving and widening representation at local levels and in turn improving accountability. Leveraging the consolidated regional practice on representation in decentralised governance, the RCB has provided advice to a number of countries. The Government of the Maldives has decided to create local governance authorities with local councils established and empowered drawing on the advice provided by an RCB-led team. The RCB Governance team under this objective also focused on the role of parliamentarians in conflict and post-conflict situations, with case studies from nine COs considered completed and disseminated. These findings will be fed into a donor meeting in Brussels in early 2006. The RCB sponsored the participation of members of electoral commissions from seven Asian countries to attend a meeting of the Asian Association of Electoral Commissions (AAEA) held in Taipei. Policy advisory services in the area of local governance have been provided through missions to Nepal, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Iran and the Maldives. In Sri Lanka, Maldives and Thailand, the local governance dimension of tsunami recovery received special attention. Advocacy work has been undertaken to promote the ratification of the UN Convention against Corruption. The RCB sponsored parliamentarians from ASEAN to Manila for the first meeting of Southeast Asian Parliamentarians against Corruption (SEAPAC). It resulted in a Constitution for SEAPAC, and the Manila Declaration against Corruption and Action Plan for Follow Up. Another area being pursued is on Parliamentary Knowledge Services. The Canadian Parliamentary Centre is undertaking a study on comparative experiences of parliamentary knowledge services for the Asian region. The study will be completed in early 2006 and is expected to assist COs in further developing this hitherto under-emphasised area of parliamentary development.

The RCB is also focussing on Youth and Young Leaders. Responding to the identified need to look at the linkages between youth, governance and the achievement of the MDGs (a priority reaffirmed by the DG Advisory Panel), RCB, assisted by UNDP Philippines, held an initial 1 As described in the RCB work plan approved by the Management Board on 2 May 2005. 7 Planning Meeting on Developing a Plan of Action on Youth, Governance and the MDGs for Asia and the Pacific on 12-14 December in Manila. Participants from the region included representatives from five COs in the region, and the Regional Centre in Colombo. Representatives from UNDP Argentina and the Bratislava Regional Centre as well as the Global Youth Action Network and Philippine organizations also participated, enriching the discussion with perspectives from other regions, youth and civil society. The meeting served to identify current needs with regard to youth and governance in the region as well as to identify outputs and activities, and the way forward in this area. The meeting also served as a first step in building a community around this area. A Leadership Training Event encompassing five days was held in Thailand for Young Leaders from 20 countries in the Asia Pacific region, focussing on leadership skills, ethics, governance, human rights and negotiation. A cross-section of leaders from all walks of life (parliamentarians, NGOs, private sector, international organizations, etc.) were invited after nomination by UNDP COs. Follow-up activities on regional and national levels will be supported in 2006. Poor and disadvantaged groups including indigenous peoples, empowered to seek remedies for injustices and justice institutions enabled to be responsive to claims, consistent with international human rights norms The promotion of inclusive governance and rights-based approaches (RBAs) including institutional strengthening particularly for disadvantaged groups was emphasised in 2005 within the area of Access to Justice and Human Rights. A regional initiative was launched to document cases of inclusive governance for disadvantaged groups as a collaborative effort between the Asia Regional Governance Programme (ARGP), Asia Pacific Gender Mainstreaming Programme (APGMP) and the Regional Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Programme (RIPP) together with ten COs in the region. In Maldives, the RCB also supported the first National Human Rights Survey of Maldives, through both policy advice and funding, and the inclusion of RBA in the National Development Plan. Policy advice has been provided to the Maldives\u2019 Ministry of Justice on its justice reform programme. Advice has been provided to Bhutan on its constitution, as well as to India and Cambodia on A2J. The regional publication \u201cProgramming for Justice: Access for All - A Practitioner\u2019s Guide to a Human Rights Based Approach to Access to Justice\u201d has been completed and distributed to COs. Its launch took place together with training on RBAs to Access to Justice (A2J) on 22-24 September 2005 in Phnom Penh. Eighteen COs from Asia-Pacific attended, together with government representatives and resource people from academia and civil society. In cooperation with Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), a regional consultation on \u201cLessons Learned from RBAs in the Asia Pacific\u201d was held on 19-21 September 2005 with representatives from UN agencies and NGOs in the region. A follow-up phase will be carried out with funding from UNICEF, UNESCO, SIDA, OHCHR and UNDP to pilot RBA activities in several countries in Asia. This inter-agency collaboration on human rights is a unique arrangement that should be replicated elsewhere. In the area of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights and Development, technical assistance was provided to Indonesia with advice to the CO on policy and programming, and briefings with the Ministry of Social Affairs and the National Human Rights Commission, resulting in endorsement of the Programme. A study of national and local government regulations and laws affecting indigenous peoples is underway with involvement of Indigenous People\u2019s Organisations and relevant government counterparts.

In response to a request received from indigenous peoples\u2019 organisations at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in May 2005, a process of dialogue with international financial institutions, complemented by training sessions on the RBAs is in process. A regional workshop attended by representatives of the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and indigenous leaders from throughout the region was held, and a task force established to develop a training manual for awareness raising and capacity development among indigenous organizations. The Asia Regional Governance Programme (ARGP) support to the Philippines CO enabled UNDP to join the World Bank and ADB as co-sponsor of a conference of chief justices, organised by the Philippines Supreme Court on 28-30 November. The conference attracted 150 participants, including 29 chief justices, most of them from the Asia-Pacific region. The UNDP Administrator delivered a video-recorded message to the conference focusing on the links between judicial reforms, human rights and human development. The Manila Declaration, adopted by the conference, signals the commitment of judiciaries in the region to accelerate judicial reforms, aimed at improving access to, and better delivery of, justice, especially to the poor and other disadvantaged groups. One session was devoted to the UNDP Asia-Pacific Access to Justice (AP-A2J) network, and the programming guide on the human rights based approach, and introduced to delegates by Justice Kenneth Hayne, High Court of Australia. The conference created the Asia Pacific Judicial Reform Forum to follow up on the Manila Declaration. In 2006, the ARGP, along with APDIP, anticipates support for a tool-kit on judicial reforms to be produced under the auspices of the newly established forum. RCB, in collaboration with the Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, (IDEA) Stockholm, and the Institute for Constitutional Development (INCOD), responded to demand from many countries in the region for comparative lessons from other regions on constitution- making processes. With ARGP support, an inter-regional workshop on the subject was organised in Pretoria, South Africa on 8-10 December. Indonesia \u2013 Promoting indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and development Indigenous peoples are among the most culturally diverse, yet most impoverished. The challenge is to give voice to indigenous peoples and build more inclusive governance structures. UNDP is piloting a regional programme on indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and development using the human rights based approach and multi- stakeholder dialogue, including with IFIs and UN ECOSOC\u2019s Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. It is unique to Asia, and the first of its kind in the UN system. Result \u2013 In Indonesia, RCB policy support catalyzed the Government, the National Commission on Human Rights and indigenous organizations to come together, and a new law accommodating the needs and aspirations of indigenous peoples is being formulated. 9 e-Government and e-Governance In partnership with the China\u2019s State Council Informatization Office (SCITO), UNDP China and Cisco Systems organised the 2nd annual Asia-Pacific Public Services Summit in Beijing to address key critical questions on implementation challenges of e-government applications and the need for public sector reform and good governance. The summit was attended by some 160 participants from 18 Asia-Pacific countries (http://www.apdip.net/news/appss1). APDIP and RCB\u2019s governance team has initiated two regional initiatives on Networking of Asian Parliamentarians and a Judicial Reform Network of 21st Century (JRN21). In addition an initiative on pro-poor public service delivery through e-governance was conceptualized. In cooperation with United Nations Centre for Regional Development, APDIP is implementing a project on Capacity Building of Asia-Pacific e-Government Initiatives with 13 participating countries each contributing two case studies. APDIP also contributed to a number of e- government conferences as keynote speaker and resource people among others the International Symposium on E-government in Seoul (8 November 2005) and COMNET Viet Nam (14-15 December 2005). Public administration reform for efficient, effective, responsive, and pro-poor public services promoted In the Public Administration Reform and Anti-Corruption area, beyond the above-mentioned cross-practice linking of parliamentarians and anti-corruption, support has been provided to, among others, Mongolia, Lao PDR and Sri Lanka\u2014the latter with regard to tsunami recovery.

Anti-corruption activities are thus an important area of RCB\u2019s work in the Asia-Pacific. The RCB advisory services fielded by the Mongolia CO have supported Mongolia\u2019s anti-corruption working group. Additional inputs have come from an RCB demand-driven comparative study and the fostering of partnerships with UN Office for Drugs and Crime, the ADB-OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia-Pacific, Transparency International and others. Result \u2013 Mongolia became the first country to adopt an MDG9 on democratic governance and zero tolerance for corruption. The Mongolian parliament has now ratified the UN Convention Against Corruption and is currently debating a new anti-corruption law. The sharing of the Mongolian MDG 9 experience within Asia-Pacific has captured the attention of Samoa and Timor-Leste, and has also led to the establishment of a new regional community of practice on \u201cIntegrity in Action\u201d, through which capacity will be built for implementation of the UN Convention Against Corruption. 10 poorest countries in the world, 14 of which are in the Asia-Pacific region. Cross-practice activities in this service line are increasingly being undertaken with the RCB Capacity Development team. Missions of a multi-disciplinary nature, consisting of members from different practice teams within the RCB, were undertaken to Sri Lanka and Timor-Leste. In Timor-Leste, a comprehensive programme to strengthen national capacities for public service management has been developed, and is currently being discussed with the Government and other development partners. The RCB also provided advice on the design of an institutional support project to the Office of the President. The RCB also focuses on analysing policy lessons on local service delivery for attainment of the MDGs. The objective of the exercise is to document and disseminate specific operational and policy lessons, especially in rural areas, both from the supply and demand side, on improving access to those local services necessary for poverty reduction and attainment of the MDGs. The RCB is also engaged in the financing aspects of local service delivery for the MDGs. It has drafted the new global primer on Fiscal Decentralisation and Poverty Reduction, and has moderated a UNDP Global Network discussion on the topic. The regional practice team is defining the UNDP niche and entry points in this area. To this end, a regional workshop was held in December on \u201cFinancing Local Service Delivery for the MDGs: Challenges and Opportunities\u201d in New Delhi at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP). This was a joint initiative of the RCB and UNCDF, in partnership with the NIPFP. Fifteen countries participated. There were two substantive themes of the presentations and discussions: the financing of service delivery/fiscal decentralization, and institutional issues (e.g. accountability) around decentralization. RCB also presented its proposal for country case studies follow-up to be undertaken during 2006. In this regard, a parallel complementary study is also underway to analyse experiences with participatory monitoring of service delivery. Public-Private Partnerships for Urban Environment (PPPUE) PPPUE\u2019s activities complemented the Governance Team\u2019s efforts in the area of public sector reform promotion for efficient, effective, responsive and pro-poor services at central and local levels.

At the country level, the Programme through its Flexible Response Mechanism (FRM) facility supported: a) the Bhutan CO in implementing a project on \u201cDeveloping a Policy Framework for Public-Private Partnerships for Urban Environment Management in Thimphu\u201d. Key project outputs are: a Steering Committee; a video programme on Urban Waste Management issues within the Bhutanese context produced and aired on National TV; and an initial review of the existing laws, rules, regulations and policy on urban services was completed; b) the Iran CO in exploring new approaches that entail the participation of the private sector and civil society in the delivery of basic urban services to poor and informal settlements of two selected municipalities. Key outputs are: the PPPUE toolkit \u201cTools for Pro-Poor Municipal PPP\u201d translated and published in Farsi (Persian) and disseminated through the Iran Association of Municipalities; two regional multi- stakeholder workshops. Technical support and guidance was provided to COs in the region in developing their PPPUE projects and to effectively apply for its second wave of Innovative Partnerships Grant (IPG) support. Cambodia, India and the Philippines COs were selected to receive the Grant to test- experiment with PPP arrangements of delivering services to the poor. CO focal points together with their lead implementing partner organisations\u2019 representatives were invited to attend a week-long orientation meeting in Johannesburg, where PPP concept, frameworks and options, its pro-poor and MDG dimensions, and implications for policy, institutional and regulatory changes were examined. The Programme\u2019s efforts were also directed towards an analysis of demand in the region for such support, and areas were identified for intervention. Aid Coordination and Management The RCB\u2019s Aid Coordination team has focused since March 2005 on responding to the pressing needs of tsunami-affected countries to enhance their national aid coordination capacities. UNDP proposed a package of aid coordination support at the High-Level Coordination Meeting on Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Tsunami-affected Countries hosted in March 2005 by the ADB in Manila. In April 2005, UNDP received requests for support from the Governments of Sri Lanka, Maldives and Thailand. These centred on assisting these Governments in reinforcing their coordination staff and capacity, and customising a tsunami resources and results tracking system to meet their specific needs. By June 2005, customised versions of the Development Assistance Database (DAD) were installed and operational within the Government departments in all three countries and available on-line to the public. In September 2005, the Government of Indonesia requested the RCB to provide similar policy and technical support to its reconstruction authority in Aceh (BRR). The Recovery Aceh/Nias Database (RAN, as the DAD is called there) was publicly launched in Aceh on 28 October 2005. Data on all projects is accessible to all through the Internet, either by accessing the four operational DADs directly or through the Government-run websites, with weekly reports published automatically to the site. \u2022 Indonesia: http://rand.brr.go.id/RAND/ \u2022 Maldives: http://dad.finance.gov.mv/ \u2022 Sri Lanka: http://dad.tafren.gov.lk/dad/ \u2022 Thailand: http://dadthailand.mfa.go.th/dad/ 12 The country-level tsunami work has been brought together within a single window whereby data on resources and results from all four countries can be analysed through maps, charts and reports in the Regional Tsunami DAD based in the RCB (http://tsunamitracking.undp.or.th/dadregional).

In each country, the RCB and CO collaboration seeks to develop a package of support that is tailored closely to the specific national requirements. The package marries capacity development measures and policy advice with customised aid and budget tracking technology. The Governments of Maldives, India and Vietnam have expressed their interest in fostering the linkage between official development assistance (ODA) and the respective national public investment programme through a more sophisticated public finance management system. In December, the Aid Coordination team organized a Knowledge Sharing Workshop on Lessons Learnt on Tsunami Aid Coordination in Bangkok, which brought together aid coordination advisers and practitioners from different countries. Gender Mainstreaming The Asia Pacific Gender Mainstreaming Programme (APGMP), hosted at the Regional Centre in Colombo (RCC), has been working closely with regional programmes and practice teams based at the Regional Centre in Bangkok. In addition, the two Bangkok-based members of the Gender team have been providing continuous policy support and technical backstopping to COs in the region on documents, policy notes and in developing proposals for funding. In the area of governance, APGMP is currently working with the regional programmes on governance and indigenous peoples on a regional series highlighting inclusive governance which will feature case studies from Afghanistan, Iran and Tonga. These focus on exploring issues on women\u2019s access to resources and basic rights as well as the reasons for their exclusion from the democratic processes. The gender programme in partnership with the Regional Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Programme (RIPP) has initiated a country-exchange between Bangladesh and Malaysia to train indigenous women in decision-making and provide them with the opportunity to learn from each others\u2019 experiences and facilitate a broader comprehension of their rights towards building their capability to protect such rights when violated. The APGMP completed a training workshop on Gender Responsive Budgeting to provide a platform for government representatives, CSOs, researchers and academics from 14 countries in the region to dialogue on work that has 13 already been done in countries in this area and to develop a way forward on gender responsive budgets, and the availability and use of disaggregated data. The APGMP also partnered other regional programmes to carry out a training course for young leaders in governance. There is a special emphasis on young women in order to further capacitate them with leadership skills in their area of work as parliamentarians, journalists, activists, etc. In other practice areas (ICT, Energy and Environment), the Gender team co-hosted a workshop on \u2018Mapping Gender in the Information Society\u2019 with APDIP in Bangkok as a preparatory meeting for the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS). It brought together activists from the academic and grassroots level to dialogue on the gender perspectives of the WSIS and to articulate the gender concerns that exist in the information society into the WSIS debate. Furthermore, the Gender team provided technical support to the Energy and Environment team to reflect gender perspectives in the energy rapid assessment and gap analysis initiative for the region. The two regional centres also co-hosted a regional gender thematic trust fund project. As part of the project, a synthesis paper on gender mainstreaming in UNDP practice areas was completed through ten country cases from the region. This was subsequently shared at a regional workshop with participation from 14 COs, both regional centres and HQs. Capacity Development in the Governance Programme Area Capacity development has been increasingly positioned as cross-cutting to other practice areas and this is reflected in the integrated work plan of the Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo. The tsunami brought to light critical capacity gaps in the area of governance, further detailed below in the Crisis Prevention and Recovery (CPR) section. Significant capacity development inputs have been provided in the areas of legislatures and elections. COs also demanded enhancement of capacities for working on indigenous peoples\u2019 issues including strengthening of the policy framework pertaining to indigenous peoples. Capacity 2015 has looked to pilot innovations and new approaches in development that lend themselves to scaling up and enhancing knowledge. Lessons from on-the-ground initiatives and from policy forums have been captured and codified into programming guidelines, toolkits and other resource materials that help to \u2018operationalise\u2019 capacity development. The focus of capacity development support to the Governance team has been in the area of public sector management (PSM). The Capacity Development team has been supporting the development of three country programmes in Sri Lanka (related to tsunami", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "106f1d23-a8b3-45c8-99de-40903c8a294f": {"__data__": {"id_": "106f1d23-a8b3-45c8-99de-40903c8a294f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centre-bangkok-annual-report-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok Annual Report 2005", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centre-bangkok-annual-report-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "344a2326d320f26971215e9eb3b53e43603e8885dab1f2054506868b62f2391e"}, "3": {"node_id": "817d2f1a-a9fa-4daf-a677-24925caa679c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centre-bangkok-annual-report-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "832b40c379976f1ec014ec9c601888168abc2825cf888d1d95b1fac06175e021"}}, "hash": "2ee42bf8f35e392398ec3c974cabd7b419ddf317e3aba8827c179cc5787bdc23", "text": "recovery), Timor-Leste and Afghanistan. In each of these cases, support to developing programmes with a thrust on developing national capacity was emphasised. The particular focus of the Capacity Development team has been to provide know-how on capacity assessments that establish baseline capacities in the civil Bangladesh and Malaysia \u2013 Strengthening the role of women in decision-making Women need to be involved in decisions that affect them, their families and communities. Indigenous women face the triple burden of discrimination on the basis of gender, ethnicity and social status. Building on UNDP country office and civil society efforts, a training programme, aimed at developing women\u2019s confidence and capacity to engage in decision-making, has been conducted in indigenous peoples\u2019 areas in Bangladesh (Chittagong Hill Tracts) and Malaysia (Sabah). The training is oriented to informing them of their rights, thereby raising awareness of their position and potential in society. The training is complemented by enabling women from the two areas to exchange experiences. Results \u2013 Women have been enabled to play a meaningful role in decision-making, and have learned from each other\u2019s skills and experiences. 14 service and forward planning. This support comes in the form of providing toolkits and hands on advice to Ministries and/or actors in the civil service. In the area of Local Governance, the team has recently started an initiative with the Galing Pook Foundation in the Philippines to institute an award recognising innovations in capacity development at the local level in support of achieving the MDGs. In the Access to Justice area, the Capacity Development team has delivered sessions on integrating capacity development and rights-based approaches in development. In Cambodia, Capacity 2015 in partnership with the country office has developed a video on the experiences and lessons learned in strengthening capacities of the government\u2019s local fisheries offices and the communities in managing community fishery resources.

National policy frameworks that reflect environmental and energy access considerations in poverty reduction and sustainable development strategies established 2. Access to energy services, electricity or cleaner fuels in rural areas increased 3. Governments and local communities empowered to better manage biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides. National policy frameworks that reflect environmental and energy access considerations in poverty reduction and sustainable development strategies established The environment-poverty linkage was the main focus of the environmental mainstreaming work. A project development workshop was held in Bangkok involving CO focal points and major development partners (ESCAP, UNEP, ADB and IUCN) in March 2005. The Poverty Environment Initiative (PEI) was subsequently launched at the Ministerial Conference on Environment and Development in Seoul in April 2005. PEI meetings were held in Bhutan and Bangladesh to provide a dialogue space for the integration of environmental concerns of the poor into national policy planning and to create a better understanding of how poverty- environment (P-E) activities have been carried out in the region. These meetings were also attended by representatives from Mongolia, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal. A preparatory assistance (PA) document was drafted in collaboration with the RCC and COs. The PA contemplates support to a number of studies on poverty \u2013 environment linkages, in relation to UNDP programmes. In addition, the environment-governance linkages were explored with a view to embracing community-based approaches to natural resource management and sustainable development through policy recommendations and practical measures that will emphasise access, control and management of natural resources as well as the role of formal and informal institutions in shaping people\u2019s resource endowments and entitlements. Specific activities included: preparatory work for cross-border community dialogue in the Lower Mekong region; the completion of five environmental governance case studies at the local level in Nepal, Philippines, Samoa, Thailand and Mongolia; a launch of seven environmental governance pilots in Sri Lanka, Maldives, Timor-Leste, China, Pakistan, Indonesia and Cambodia; targeted policy advice to UNDP Indonesia on mainstreaming environmental strategy and tsunami response; and, review of Cambodia National Sustainable Community dialogues across frontiers Communities sometimes suffer in silence. Along both banks of the huge Mekong river, villagers are concerned about the steady erosion of the river which is literally eating into their livelihoods. The RCB\u2019s regional environmental governance programme was launched to empower local communities to take part in the decision making processes that may impact the environment, and to ensure fair access to natural resources. One of its initiatives relies on RCB working with local UN volunteers identified by the country offices of Thailand, Lao PDR, and Cambodia to facilitate community-to- community dialogues among three river-bank communities. Results \u2013 Communities discovered many commonalities through their talks and exchanged ideas. They learned, were empowered, and have developed strategies based on which they are taking their causes to their respective local authorities. 21 Development Plan and Sri Lanka\u2019s MDG Report. National Capacity Self Assessment (NCSA) project development support and implementation assistance, which helps countries to identify their capacity development priorities in order to effectively fulfil their global environmental commitments, were provided to 30 countries in the region As a follow up to the NCSA process, support to the development of GEF funded cross-cutting capacity development projects were provided to five countries \u2013 Philippines, Cambodia, Bhutan, Lao PDR and Vietnam. Support for mainstreaming played a key role in the RCB\u2019s efforts to assist country offices in the region with programming, including the development of a major mainstreaming programme in Afghanistan, and virtual support in Cambodia and Sri Lanka.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d345b8ed-fc53-46f3-89d6-645f2808c004": {"__data__": {"id_": "d345b8ed-fc53-46f3-89d6-645f2808c004", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centre-bangkok-annual-report-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok Annual Report 2005", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centre-bangkok-annual-report-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7c7b8ecd5f083df3e17d1d866c25296ff87c63881b9d09db27770bd1ad2bf224"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ae3e6c1-cf9e-40d6-946c-5866b7fdb752", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centre-bangkok-annual-report-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ffacde19b7479d05cff77b1bacd9d5af9d847d88e918ea9c265ef00043a37715"}}, "hash": "69cd72cd9fb998c412f2b9db489626376faafe7c6afb6e042be8b9e015f2928e", "text": "Under the Regional Energy Programme for Poverty Reduction (REP-PoR), technical assistance was provided in the implementation of an ongoing project on the development of national energy policies and strategic action plans covering 14 Pacific Islands Access to energy services, electricity or cleaner fuels in rural areas increased In the area of energy and climate change, the focus was on poverty reduction and environmental sustainability.

These three policy studies will: 1) analyse the impact of rising oil prices on the poor and the implications for the achievement of the MDGs; 2) analyse cross-border energy trade and its impact on the poor; and 3) undertake a regional mapping of options to promote private investments in alternative energy sources for the poor. In addition the Energy Team contributed to the development of the GEF Programming Toolkit on the Productive Uses of Renewable Energy, which is currently being finalised by UNDP/GEF. Capacity development activities were formulated to support UNDP COs and host countries in the region to respond to multilateral conventions and energy access issues to meet MDGs. Policy advice and technical support were provided to Bangladesh, Cambodia and Pakistan to prepare medium-term country strategy papers on energy and climate change. Joint missions by the energy and environment team were conducted to prepare an E&E country programme framework for Afghanistan and a GEF country strategy framework for Indonesia. Technical support was also provided to Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Philippines and Vietnam in the finalisation of country case studies and the design of project concept notes for rural energy services under the Global Village Energy Partnership (a UNDP and World Bank joint initiative). Energy-poverty and climate change workshops were organised collaboratively, benefiting 76 professionals \u2013 CO focal points and national counterparts from Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Philippines, Vietnam, India, China, Malaysia, Pakistan, Maldives, Bangladesh, Iran and Thailand. Country-specific trainings were also provided to: 42 professionals in Mongolia on methodologies to identify development objectives supporting clean energy use, energy resource needs and technology assessment at national and sector levels; while 15 professionals in Timor-Leste were trained on methodologies to identify energy needs, resource and technology assessment at the community level including identification of villages for programme implementation. Other country level project development and policy advisory support is outlined in below table. Technical assistance was also provided per the table below to several countries in the performance of their GEF project implementation reviews. Moreover, several UNDP COs were assisted in the preparation of their second national communications proposal on Climate Change in compliance of host country commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC). 22 The Community of Energy Sub-Practice in Asia-Pacific Region (CEPAP) has been instrumental in promoting the exchange of information and lessons learned in an effective way supporting the work of the REP-PoR, as well as in the development of three UNDP/GEF regional initiatives on: (1) Energy Standards and Labelling (Asia); (2) Energy Systems Optimisation (Asia); and, (3) GHG Abatement through Renewable Energy (the Pacific). The Gap analysis of the REP-PoR identifies country level gaps in institutional, policy, technology, capacity and access to knowledge and information limiting access to energy for the poor and has been completed in 15 Asian countries and 14 Pacific Island countries. The country reports are currently being summarised for publication. A synthesis report is also under preparation, drawing on key gaps that deter access to energy for the poor in the region. The Pacific Rapid Assessment and Gap Analysis report was finalized at the end of December followed by a Gender and Energy Add-on Report. This rapid assessment provides the baselines and a framework for programming of energy services provision for the poor at the country level in the Pacific. The Energy component of the Energy and Environment Thematic Trust Fund (TTF) launched its fourth round funding globally in October 2005. The winners for the funding announced in December include Bhutan, Cambodia, China, Nepal and Timor-Leste. In this regard, technical support was provided for the design of project concept notes, coordination for the funding submission and the formulation of the project documents. The TTF funded projects are expected to start in February 2006. Governments and local communities empowered to better manage biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides Environmental management of the region\u2019s vast resources and rich biodiversity presents the greatest challenge, particularly when this responsibility needs to give priority to the enhancement of livelihood opportunities and security of people living on the margins of poverty. Capacity development and technical assistance were given to China in the formulation of a national- level agricultural diversity conservation project, and to Bangladesh and Bhutan in the formulation of projects on agro- biodiversity conservation and eco-tourism. Similar assistance was given to India in GEF projects on medicinal plants, markets access, wetlands conservation and conservation of traditional rice varieties.

Most of these resources, be they fisheries in China or forests in Indonesia, are under threat. The project and policy legs of UNDP have not always been in sync and, hence, the impacts have been sub-optimal. The pooling of resources at the RCB has allowed a move towards a more integrated and strategic approach. RCB is helping the China CO develop a ten-year Government-donor Partnership for conservation. As part of its knowledge management mandate, RCB has assessed the contributions of biodiversity to the MDGs, largely relying on cases from the treasure trove of the GEF programme portfolio and are translating them into policy recommendations. Result \u2013 UNDP has long been a major channel for environmental funding in the Asia-Pacific. But by linking our programming to policy advice the RCB has helped steer the agenda and become an important player in environmental policy. The Partnership in China has attracted more than US$75 million in funding to date. Importantly, more than a dozen Government line agencies and even more international partners are aligned around a common framework for conservation funding: an unprecedented achievement in China. 23 affected Sri Lanka on the conservation of coastal forests. Fourteen countries received technical advisory support for the preparation of their 3rd National Reports to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, as part of their commitment to the global convention. Lead support was provided in the assessment and preparation of the environmental damage chapter of WB/ADB/UNDP report and of UNDP India\u2019s Recovery Framework document, as well as a review of all other chapters. Other technical assistance that was provided to COs includes: the preparation of protected area governance case studies for Cambodia and Malaysia and M&E support to Nepal, Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Mongolia and China. In the second half of 2005, significant technical assistance was provided to 17 countries in the region in developing and submitting Project Implementation Reviews of on-going GEF-funded projects. These reviews highlighted the progress and impacts of UNDP\u2019s GEF-funded portfolio of conservation projects, and formed the basis for overall sub-regional project impact reports that summarised UNDP\u2019s contribution to GEF implementation in the region. Both within and outside UNDP, partnerships were forged and strengthened to enhance the impact of on-going and planned programme initiatives. Partnership discussions were held with a diverse array of organisations including sister multilateral agencies (the World Bank, UNEP and IFAD), international NGOs (IUCN, the Nature Conservancy, Wildlife Conservation Society, WWF and Conservation International) and regional institutions (Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre, RECOFTC and ASEAN Secretariat), while within the RCB, cross-practice links were developed with the Regional Indigenous Peoples Programme amongst others. Increasingly, RCB support in the areas of biodiversity and NRM focused on developing more programmatic and strategic portfolios for our clients. In Indonesia, a RCB team developed a GEF Strategy, and in India support was provided to streamlining the GEF biodiversity portfolio. In addition, lessons from UNDP biodiversity projects were distilled for a note on Biodiversity and MDGs, and an assessment of governance issues in protected areas. Capacity Development in the E&E Programme Area The above-mentioned Regional Environmental Governance Programme case studies from five countries reveal strong demand for community capacity to engage and influence policy dialogue/debate around E&E issues. Pilot projects have been initiated to develop the capacity of the state to engage in environmental governance. The trans-boundary community dialogue initiative for the Lower Mekong River Basin Area reveals the primary importance of supporting links across country borders. Support has been provided to Philippines, Cambodia, Bhutan and China to formulate new programmes for capacity development based on the GEF-NCSAs and for GEF funding. Capacity 2015 has provided technical inputs in strengthening local government and community capacities for participating in environmental management and monitoring and addressing poverty concerns through effective natural resources management.

Strengthen national mine action management and technical expertise Strengthen capacities for the development of post-conflict recovery frameworks, reintegration programmes and conflict prevention and peace building Activities to meet this objective have been under the management of BCPR HQ working directly with COs. In the Pacific activities have been implemented through the Pacific Sub- Regional Centre in Suva (PRSC). In collaboration with PSRC, CPR advisers have been supporting the PNG CO to develop a comprehensive Crisis Prevention and Recovery Programme for BCPR funding. Strengthen disaster risk management and recovery capacity at regional, national and local levels Activities in support of the above objective to enhance disaster risk management and recovery capacity have been dominated by the Indian Ocean Tsunami Disaster, the Pakistan/Kashmir earthquake and avian influenza. While the entire UN system, in fact the entire world, has joined together in response to the tsunami disaster and in support of the tsunami affected countries, UNDP has taken a major role in tsunami recovery efforts. All of the RCB practice teams have contributed to these corporate efforts. Immediately following the tsunami disaster, the RCB formed a response team to coordinate the wide range of activities and share information to enhance the RCB support within the broader UNDP and UN System response to the tsunami disaster. The Crisis Prevention and Recovery (CPR) practice has played a major role in providing additional recovery capacity to UNDP COs. In turn, the COs are supporting the development of additional recovery capacity within the national and local governments in the affected countries. The two CPR Regional Disaster Reduction Advisors (RDRAs) for Asia were immediately assigned to two of the affected countries, with one deployed to Sri Lanka and the other supporting Thailand CO. The other affected countries were supported with Advisors sent from headquarters. All of the affected countries had immediate CPR surge capacity added to their operations within days of the event. The Advisors assisted the COs with technical backstopping of TRAC 1.1.3 emergency cash grants, the development of the flash appeal inputs for the COs, and also supported general situation reporting as well as advice on longer- term recovery programming. Most of the Delhi-based RDRA\u2019s work has focused on recovery support to capacity building for risk reduction the Tsunami affected countries (India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives). At the regulatory policy level, worthy of note is CPR support to Sri Lanka CO with the development of a Disaster Management Act, which was passed by the Government in May 2005. This support included policy dialogue and liaison with the relevant government counterparts and support in the drafting of the bill. In the last quarter of 2005 the CPR Adviser provided substantial inputs for a Sri Lanka Government Disaster Reduction Management Road Map as well as drafting support. As important is RDRA\u2019s support to Sri Lanka for the conceptualization and implementation of capacity building initiatives in DRM. 40 In the Maldives, CPR practice team has been providing TA for capacity building initiatives in DRM and support for the implementation of the CO DRM work plan. Moreover, CPR mobilized DRM experts to take forward the DRM agenda in the Maldives and, provided support for the development of disaster information systems and early warning systems and multi-hazard risk assessments. The RCB also conducted comparative research on engaging CSO\u2019s for Sri Lanka and provided short lists of recommended experts based on collated rosters of existing and new experts to assist with recovery planning, programming and implementation, with candidates provided to each country. In addition to the assistance provided directly to the tsunami-affected countries, the CPR team also actively engaged in International Early Warning System Development Workshops; participated in the World Bank-UNDP Joint Assessment Mission in India as well as in the joint OCHA/UNDG/UNDP Recovery Coordination Needs Assessment Mission to Sri Lanka, Maldives and Indonesia; and designed the UNDP Regional Capacity Building Programme for Tsunami Recovery. Launched in October 2005, this Regional Capacity Building Programme will support further regional recovery and risk reduction efforts. The programme\u2019s main objectives are to help increase the capacity of countries affected by the Indian Ocean Tsunami to undertake post- disaster recovery, and to mitigate the risk that would ensue from any future natural disasters. To achieve these goals, the programme will focus on: improving information management systems for disaster and beneficiary tracking; helping improve Early Warning Systems and ensuring that notions of risk reduction are integrated into future recovery and development projects; as well as by offering opportunities for training and learning to national and regional natural disaster experts.

Following these missions, Country Offices have confirmed the relevance and timeliness of implementing the specific component activities. Work plan preparation for 2006 commenced in December 2005 and will be finalised in January 2006 Delhi based CPR RDRA also mobilized funds and provided conceptualization support to the CO for EWS initiatives in Tamil Nadu and provided a vital link between the Tsunami Regional Programme and the UN System Recovery initiatives in the Tsunami affected states. In Pakistan, Delhi-based CPR adviser and Team provided post earthquake coordination and early recovery support to UNDP Pakistan and are currently providing TA for the establishment of a Enhancing Aid Transparency in the Tsunami Countries Days after the Tsunami struck, aid coordination shot to top of agenda for Governments struggling to coordinate hugely increased resources & actors. At the ADB Conference in Manila in March 2005, UNDP offered technical assistance which included people and the Development Assistance Database (DAD) \u2013 proven in Afghanistan. The Response from Governments was an emphatic \u201cyes\u201d. Within 10 days, RCB fielded missions to Sri Lanka, Maldives, Thailand, and Aceh joined in August. Critical partnerships have benefiting from strong personal engagement of UN Special Envoy President Clinton \u2013 who signed 130 letters asking Ministers and NGO heads to back the DAD. Results \u2013RCB established and funded 4 world class systems to track Tsunami resources and results \u2013 each customised to meet national requirements. Mutual accountability of Governments to donors, and donors to governments has been enhanced. There is systematic downward accountability to affected communities (including access to gender disaggregated data). The DAD helps Government, donors, and citizens answer questions like: what are donors doing? Are there any results? Will it benefit me? How do we unblock bottlenecks? 41 comprehensive DRM Programme, aimed at enhancing the capacities of both UNDP as well as national and local level government agencies. In Iran, the CO and the government agreed on a 5-Year DRM Programme, which was officially signed in January 2006. BCPR Delhi provided conceptualization support for the Programme document. Support was provided to Bhutan with the implementation of two PAs \u2013 Urban Earthquake Vulnerability Risk and Integrated Disaster Reduction Management. Both these initiatives were supported financially, technically and to a certain extent operationally by CPR Team in Delhi. This has resulted in shifting UNDP Bhutan/Government policy thinking on the need for a DRM Road Map and a comprehensive DRM Capacity Building Programme. A unique opportunity for disaster risk reduction has engaged the CPR practice since June 2005. The rising awareness of the seriousness of Avian Influenza (AI) and the potential it creates for a catastrophic pandemic influenza to emerge has caused the UNCTs in Southeast Asia to organise sub- regional meetings on the topic. At the request of the RCs in the \u201cfrontline\u201d avian influenza countries, an ad-hoc UN regional interagency team has been established to provide technical support to the national-level avian influenza and pandemic influenza preparedness efforts. The teams are lead technically by WHO on the human health and FAO on the animal health, with UNOCHA providing contingency planning expertise, UNDP providing risk reduction expertise and UNICEF providing Information, Education and Communication (IEC) expertise as well as health sector programmatic expertise. The Bangkok-based Regional Disaster Reduction Advisor has facilitated the coordination of the team\u2019s activities and participated in three joint missions in support of Vietnam, Cambodia and Lao PDR. The effective role played by the CPR adviser in facilitating Inter-Agency Coordination, has led to the establishment of a new BCPR funded position - Regional Inter-Agency Coordinator on Avian and Human Influenza - reporting to the UN System Influenza Coordinator. Selected in December 2005, the AI Coordinator will commence duty in January 2006 and will work out of the regional UNOCHA office. In addition to tsunami, earthquake and avian influenza pandemic preparedness efforts, the CPR Advisors supported broader disaster risk reduction efforts in the region.

Broad inter-ministerial coordination for avian influenza control and for pandemic influenza preparedness also leveraged UNDP\u2019s substantive experience with disaster management and governance. Results \u2013 A better level of pandemic preparedness has been achieved regionally and globally. Governments have produced draft contingency plans, with donor backing. Inter-agency cooperation has improved regionally and at the country level with clear agreement on WHO and FAO in the technical lead; UNICEF providing strong Information/Education/Communications support; and UNDP providing disaster management expertise with OCHA supporting contingency planning efforts. 42 regional offices in Bangkok, and strengthened existing relationships with UNESCAP. Interaction with UNESCAP included attending a national level workshop in Vietnam as part of the CPR supported UNESCAP implemented project on Methodologies for Assessing the Socio- Economic Impacts of Disasters (tailoring the ECLAC methodology to Asia). Engagement with regional institutions has resulted in the production of two significant documents: (1) \u201cGender Dimensions in Disaster Management: A Guide for South Asia\u201d produced in partnership with the Intermediate Technologies Development Group (ITDG); and, (2) a \u201cPrimer on Integrated Flood Risk Management in Asia\u201d produced in partnership with the ADPC. The Advisors also provided direct technical advice to Iran, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Indonesia COs for their programmes to support national and local capacity building for disaster risk management. In the case of Pakistan, the RCB support focused on practical advice on how to establish an effective and efficient aid coordination mechanism immediately after the devastating earthquake. Moreover, the Delhi-based Regional Disaster Reduction Advisor has been fully occupied with post-earthquake coordination and provision of early recovery support to UNDP Pakistan since October 2005. Strengthen regional and national mine action management and technical expertise In order to address the effects of threats posed by landmines and unexploded ordnance to human safety, and to contribute to peace, confidence building and recovery and development activities, the Regional Mine Action Advisor (MAA) supported COs and country team efforts in strengthening national mine action capacities including policy development, planning, management and training. The MAA completed a major four-month intervention to establish a new mine action management and capacity building project to support the Government of Afghanistan assume responsibility for the current UN (DPKO) managed mine action programme. Concurrently, direct technical advice was also provided to Lebanon and Iran on their National Mine Action Programmes, with particular emphasis on enhancing national capacity to manage, coordinate and monitor mine action legislation, policy, and strategic planning. In addition, support was provided in a range of areas; including resource mobilisation, programme development, implementation and M&E. Support was also provided to a range of stakeholders including: COs, Government Mine Action Programmes, NGOs and other enterprises, enabling the countries to carry out mine action planning including establishing operational goals to reduce and eliminate landmines and other Explosive Remnants of War (ERW), in compliance with UN policy, the Ottawa and CCW Conventions. In the third and fourth quarters of 2005, continued mine action support was provided to programme transition in Afghanistan, with support to the newly recruited UNDP Capacity Development Advisor based in Kabul. Advisory and technical support was also provided to the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Thailand Mine Action Centre. Both briefing and workshop support were provided to the global meeting of national Mine Action Directors and UN Advisors in Geneva on 19-24 September 2005. Direct support to the Mine Action Unit Team in New York middle management course conducted in Bangkok included presentations and administrative support to the 29 October post course workshop. Follow-up mission to Afghanistan was undertaken in mid December and concurrently commenced planning for a project reformulation mission to Iran for January 2006. 43 Capacity Development in the CPR Programme Area The work of the CPR area has been clearly oriented towards capacity development.

From early January 2005, the Management Practice Team (MPT) on mission status helped establish a \u201csituation war room\u201d for a multi-practice Tsunami Response Team (TRT) of the RCB. Reporting to the HQ Tsunami Task Force (TF), the MPT undertook CO capacity assessments to appraise CO staffing and funding requests, while advising and supporting management in identifying and rapidly deploying staffing resources and training teams to fill capacity gaps of the tsunami-affected COs. It also proposed re-prioritisation and simplifications in the RCB procedures and organisation of the pro-bono services of Deloitte & Touche to cope with increased workload in the RCB and four COs. Other Outputs included: Increased programme delivery capacity support packages organised and deployed to the four priority COs: Indonesia \u2013 on procurement quality; \ufffd Maldives \u2013 on drastic up- scaling of a very small office and private sector partnerships (best practice top prize at RBAP Knowledge Fair); \ufffd Sri Lanka \u2013 Atlas training, model and procedures resulting in six of eight sub- offices using Atlas with level of managers approving transactions; and, \ufffd Thailand \u2013 re-orientation of staff capacities to new programming modalities, partnership arrangements (including the private sector and NGOs) and complex implementation arrangement requirements. In order to strengthen management practice functions in other COs and Regional Centres based on demand, plans were elaborated during the April 2005 RR/DRR and Knowledge Fair Maldives\u2014Surge capacity to respond to crisis and recovery When the tsunami hit, UNDP/Maldives faced the challenge of responding to the catastrophe while possessing an existing capacity for an annual delivery of only USD 1.3 m as well as constraining ICT connectivity in the multi-island country. In response to the CO\u2019s request for support, RCB put together a SWAT team that, working with numerous other UNDP actors and other partners, including the pro-bono contribution from Deloitte and Touche, managed to rapidly produce needed operational capacity despite a limited local skills market. Results \u2013A credible well-managed programme has been built that now sustains a $20-$30M annual delivery. A hard won improvement in connectivity has also benefited UN organisations working in the Maldives. 47 for conducting integrated CO capacity building based on the \u201cToolkit for Managing Change and professionalisation\u201d in project management and other management sub-practices Outputs during the year included: (a) Improvement oriented CO Action Plans developed and were resource persons at Myanmar sub-regional learning event of ASEAN \u201clate-comers\u201d (Mekong Plus) group of five COs: Myanmar, Vietnam, Lao PDR, Cambodia and Mongolia. Later followed by a mission to Bhutan. (b) Learning launched for PRINCE2, and draft Results Management Guide self-study course leading to project management certification. Led by participants of the above six COs plus Thailand.

Advocacy and advice to HQs helped assure HQ priority for Tsunami reporting, resulting in: (i) a new project at HQ to transfer Atlas data to the Development Assistance Database (DAD) system which the MPT had supported for the system to become corporate; (ii) a decision and TORs for the additional Tsunami financial analysis capability established at RBAP HQs; and, (iii) contributions to leveraging the pro-bono services of Deloitte & Touche, including address of strategic programming and implementation issues and Atlas support. This included: adding Thailand and, by extension, RCB, to the 3 priority Tsunami COs; the development of CO Business Process Maps using the Toolkit for Managing Change (TMC); and project management related query reports from Atlas. The MPT also assisted the RCB Communications Advisor to obtain information useful for reporting on 12 months of tsunami-related work, including response to inquiries from the media. With the South Asia Earthquake, the MPT responded promptly to Pakistan with urgent support that included advice on implementation arrangements for emergency procurement of tents by other entities, on management of cash accounts and special project banking arrangements, and on UNV policies and procedures. Policy Advice and draft Guidelines and contributions Notes were provided to the following HQ units: BDP, various BOM units, BRSP, RBAP, and DGO. The topics covered included parts of the new Prescriptive Content/Guidelines, such as Programming and Implementation Arrangements. The RCB-MPT has assumed a lead role in supporting UN Reform simplification and harmonisation initiatives, in particular in serving as 48 RBAP focal point for the UNDG initiative \u201cHarmonised Arrangements for Cash Transfer to Implementing Partners (HACT)\u201d. In November 2005, with the arrival of the MPT leader, efforts resumed to form a full MPT at the RCB.

Support development of locally relevant content, awareness and advocacy initiatives, and promote knowledge management to facilitate greater e-services. Study best practices related to e-Governance initiatives and access to information policies when making ICT work for the poor The Asia Pacific Development Information Programme (APDIP) (www.adip.net) continues to deliver on its objectives through activities that involve awareness raising and advocacy, promoting ICT for development (ICT4D) policies and dialogue, building capacities, research, knowledge sharing and networking. APDIP relocated from its office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to the RCB in late April 2005. Apart from completing pre-determined and \u2018self-standing\u2019 programme activities developed for 2005, APDIP also actively initiated activities in collaboration with other practice areas from both RCB (Governance) and RCC (HIV/ AIDS and Gender). Dedicated practice area focal points were also appointed in APDIP to help the various practice teams in the RCB and RCC to further mainstream ICT4D components within their respective practice areas. Five key areas for APDIP have been on a) e-Government and e- Governance; b) ICT and Poverty Alleviation; c) Free and Open Source Software Alternatives for Development; d) Internet Governance; and e) Gender Dimensions of the Information Society. The following highlights some of the achievements of APDIP in 2005. The APDIP also continues to manage the one-stop shop and reference point of ICT4D Resources and key regional and national e-Government/ e-Governance related data, programmes, best practices and resources specific to the Asia-Pacific region. Policy Development and Dialogue APDIP aims to raise the awareness of ICT4D through promoting policy options; providing technical advisory services aimed at building capacities in the formulation and implementation of policies; and supporting efforts to share knowledge and lessons-learned through APDIP organised events, policy advice and publications. In total, an estimated 1,790 policy-makers and senior management from governments, CSOs, and national and media institutions participated in 25 events that the APDIP organised in 2005. Five thematic examples of major regional/ global events organised by APDIP in 2005 to engage senior policy-makers were: ICT For Development On the occasion of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), held in Tunis, APDIP promoted UNDP\u2019s ICT4D initiatives in the Asia-Pacific region through the organization of and participation in a wide range of events and an exhibition at the UNDP \u201cSharing the Future \u201c Pavilion. In addition, APDIP organized and co-organized a number of parallel events, most notably related to Free/Open Source Software, Internet governance, and ICT for poverty alleviation. 51 Free and Open Source Software Alternatives for Development In partnership with the Cambodian Government the 2nd Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) consultation was held in Siem Reap, Cambodia where more than 111 Free and Open Source Software policy makers and practitioners from 20 Asia-Pacific countries participated in a regional consultation on the way forward to further enhance the documentation, advocacy, and capacity building initiatives on FOSS in the region. The event was inaugurated by the Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia. Internet Governance Continuing its work on Internet governance, through the Open Regional Dialogue initiative, (ORDIG) APDIP provided substantial input to the UN Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG). APDIP\u2019s input culminated in a paper submitted to WGIG for its deliberation and final report to the UN Secretary-General. The paper was the result and conclusion of a year-long process that included consultations in partnership with UNESCAP and others; a region-wide, multilingual survey, issue-based research, and online consultation. A number of notable outputs stemmed from the ORDIG initiatives, including a regional declaration \u2013 the Tehran Declaration, endorsed by governments from around the region; a multi-media training toolkit for policy- and decision-makers; country specific reports; research papers; and a primer aimed at raising awareness on the issues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "029db9c9-7c38-4a7d-8657-3031f81b64ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "029db9c9-7c38-4a7d-8657-3031f81b64ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centre-bangkok-annual-report-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok Annual Report 2005", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centre-bangkok-annual-report-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ef861082ecf34a90c4648ed48d0ec5598fc07c2c7ee0d2a87059979bb944bb2"}, "2": {"node_id": "30585afb-4fc8-4891-8ebf-dff7af04649e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centre-bangkok-annual-report-2005", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd860395ed2d40d050a39c54f9cf936bd86ae6ca32f8d0d3bf279acc02c1897a"}}, "hash": "75fa96173313f66fb6e5d57b1e27efbeda9d9fad50b74153ef5fcf5b869de4bb", "text": "Access to ICTs APDIP provides expert advisory services and technical advisory assistance to promote equity, especially in terms of gender balance in information flows and public access to information, focussing on the poor and marginalized; support local innovation on appropriate tools; and share \u2018best practices\u2019 via APDIP organised events; grants; on-the ground innovative projects; and publications. a) Research and Development on Innovative Technologies APDIP continues to support a multi-stakeholder ICT Research and Development grant Initiative - with an aim to promote R&D of innovative technologies and ICT4D projects within the region.

In spite of this, the sheer lack of visibility of HIV/ AIDS issues in the mainstream media remains a huge challenge. The ICT4D team (RCB) and the HIV/AIDS team (RCC) initiated a massive HIV/AIDS campaign with 6 partners (encompassing UN agencies, UNDP COs, INGO and private sector), and 12 participating national broadcast partners. The total investment is USD 1.7 million, with RCB's ICT4D programme's catalyst contribution at USD 40,000. National broadcasters from 12 countries were brought together to learn from previous HIV/AIDS-related productions, and to assist them to develop scripts of the most appropriate messages for their individual countries. Results \u201312 unique stories were aired on 1 December 2005 in conjunction with World Aids Day to an estimated 500 million viewers, with the broadcast also being distributed free in the region to national broadcasters and to CSOs for use in advocacy workshops. All partners have committed to promoting the content in major international and regional HIV/AIDS conferences in 2006.

APDIP provides advisory services for COs in programmatic ICT areas such as overall programme development and project document and proposal reviews. In addition, the team continues to serve as a general conduit for COs to link to resources and experts within the APDIP network.. The team manages the network of UNDP ICT Programme Officers/Focal Points in Asia-Pacific to address various programmatic issues relating to mainstreaming ICT for development, UNDP corporate framework on ICT for development, and topical ICT for development trends. APDIP also actively provided technical back-stopping and policy advice to UNDP COs; sister UN agencies; governments; and civil society organisations in other regions (Latin America and Africa). In addition, the team advised the UN systems on the development of new FOSS based website and back-end systems as well as provided consultations to the UN Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) on APDIP\u2019s Open Source projects, case studies and use for JIU to prepare the Unit\u2019s report on the Policies of United Nations System Organisations toward the Use of Open Source Software. Regional Linkages and Synergies APDIP has also partnered with UNESCAP, UNIFEM, UNICEF, ITU, UNAIDS, UNCRD and UNESCO in initiating, supporting and collaborating on regional ICT4D issues. APDIP continues to work with regional professionals and CSOs for research and content development activities, fielding missions and facilitating a variety of workshops and seminar activities. The team also partnered with several key regional CSOs to build their capacities to engage policy-makers on debating the larger issues of development with cross links to issues related to the MDGs and sustainable human development 53 Missions: Programme Development/Technical Backstopping/Policy Advice Services cited below include both missions and virtual technical backstopping.

In Thailand, the advisory assistance of the SSC team led to the following projects being implemented in collaboration with Thai NGOs \u201cLivelihood Restoration of Fishery Communities in Affected Coastal Villages in Phang Nga Bay and Ranong Province (covering some parts of Phuket)\u201d; \u201cLivelihood and Ecology Restoration in Nine Tsunami-affected Sub-districts in Phang Nga Province\u201d; and, \u201cIndigenous Livelihood Restoration and Sustainable Ecology for Lanta Islands.\u201d In Indonesia, the South-South resources supported the recruitment of a Technical Advisor on Disaster Risk Management based in Aceh. Some of the significant results achieved include development of a regulatory mechanism for the Indonesian Bureau of Recovery and Reconstruction for quality of design for construction resistant to natural hazards; planning a centre of excellence at Syiah University for demonstration of the design of buildings that will withstand tsunami and earthquakes; assessment of building plans for government, UNDP and UN habitat as well as assessment of 10 proposals in \u201c Developing Community based Risk Reduction in Aceh and West Sumatra Provinces\u201d. The lack of international organizations and development agencies based in the Maldives prior to the tsunami meant that experienced staff in disaster risk management and recovery was virtually non-existent. The arrival of too many organisations at once made the situation worse. The South-South resources therefore supported national, regional and southern staff in the areas of shelter, helping affected families in 58 islands repair or reconstruct their houses. The resources were also used to support the rehabilitation of infrastructure, especially harbours destroyed by the tsunami. Lastly, South-South resources were provided for implementation support. The team assembled was responsible for procurement, financial management and How South-South Cooperation Complements Disaster Response and Risk Management Developing countries are unfortunately more vulnerable to disasters, yet often have important experience to share about how to reduce risk and how to cope. Local communities are first to suffer, but also the first to respond to disasters before any outside help arrives. South-South exchanges have leveraged existing knowledge and experiences to minimise vulnerability to hazards and better respond to crisis. In the aftermath of the Tsunami, the RCB tsunami response team identified critical positions to be supported in country offices, and 22 southern experts were deployed to Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand to help country offices programme resources and implement projects. The RCB engaged southern consultants to conduct training sessions for the private sector and government in Sri Lanka. Results \u2013 CO capacity was strengthened with targeted southern experts, and communities response and preparedness for natural disasters was enhanced. 57 other related services to ensure the UNDP office coped with sudden increase in resources from $1.5 million to $30 million for 2005. In the aftermath of the tsunami, UNDP and the other UN agencies took a lead role in housing construction, livelihood restoration, capacity building of community-based organisations and environmental issues. The demands of the recovery programme placed a burden on the UNDP country office. The South-South resources were used to fund a number of posts critical to the design and implementation of projects under the tsunami recovery programme. Some of the key achievements include UNDP taking a lead role in the establishment of the Government\u2019s Disaster Management Centre; organising of people\u2019s consultations on disaster management, with over 1100 meetings conducted; providing technical assessments on flash appeal projects; and preparing proposals for regeneration of damaged coastal ecosystems. In Sri Lanka, South- South resources were also used to train UN and Government representatives on alternative disaster damage assessment methods. Public and private sector representatives were trained in disaster risk management. In partnership with BRSP, South-South resources were used to provide Private sector partnership advisory services at the Regional Centre in Bangkok and the COs in Indonesia and Sri Lanka. The results of this work are documented under the Private sector Partnerships section. The SSC Unit works with other partners to advance the Hyogo Framework of Action (HFA) formulated by the World Conference for Disaster Reduction in January 2005. The Unit developed the preparatory assistance phase of a Global Facility that will address disaster risk management at community level. In this area, the team has: \u2022 Visited selected communities and consulted the local governments in the Philippines and China to study their pioneering approach in community based environmental monitoring and preparedness.

The first three months of 2005 were committed to staffing skilled Communications Officers on the ground in the tsunami-affected countries. Direct referrals from the Communications Advisor were hired in Aceh and Bangkok and on a revolving basis in Colombo and Male. An additional staff member was added to the Communications office in the Regional Centre to support tsunami outreach. With the team in place, a UNDP Tsunami News Network was launched. For one month, UNDP had a story each day from at least one of the tsunami countries. Press calls were fielded around the clock.

The first event was a dynamic, people-to-people knowledge sharing gathering between some 220 UNDP colleagues, with 55 CO \u201cgood practices\u201d exhibited and for sale as well as global and regional knowledge products on display. The Knowledge Fair was part of the broader region- wide meeting organised for UNDP Resident Representatives and Deputy Resident Representatives from Asia-Pacific\u2019s 25 UNDP COs, thus complemented and enlivened the discussions. The Fair yielded a number of achievements as well as key lessons learned, some of which were: \u2022 The Knowledge Fair was successful in creating a new demand for knowledge management, helped strengthen the Mutual Support Initiative and created a market place where COs are rewarded for sharing relevant knowledge; \u2022 It was suggested that future cluster meetings could be shaped around this type of fair and around similar knowledge activities to stimulate real-time exchange of experiences and knowledge and the creation of mutually beneficial communities of practices; and, \u2022 Practice presentations at the cluster meetings were reinforced by products and good practices displayed at the fair. The Knowledge Services Team tailored a one day partnership building and knowledge management workshop for 40 UNESCAP officials to demonstrate UNDP\u2019s knowledge management experience and to facilitate UNESCAP\u2019s own knowledge management strategy. The team also designed and facilitated a three-day sub-Regional Competency building Training Workshop in Hanoi for 20 national staff from Lao PDR, Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam in the areas of building and sharing knowledge and learning; UN core values; team building; and, task management. The team has been involved in supporting Knowledge Fairs in the Pacific (Samoa, Papua New Guinea and Fiji), and recently participated in and presented UNDP\u2019s network experience at the annual Knowledge Management Asia 2005 conference. Furthermore, the team co-negotiated and attended an inter-regional workshop on Global KM Framework (Bangkok, Beirut, Bratislava, Colombo, Johannesburg, Panama and Headquarters). Knowledge sharing for development One of UNDP\u2019s comparative advantages lies what we gain from experience. But the \u201cknowledge premium\u201d derives from sharing it. The RCB\u2019s \u201cregional advantage\u201d allows us to translate country level experience into policy advice for use elsewhere, and it helps us to turn policy advice into options and programmes in countries and regionally. In April, the first ever UNDP-internal Knowledge Fair was organised with RR/DRRs from the 25 Asia-Pacific COs. In addition to a wide display of publications and other resources, 57 country-level \u201cgood practices\u201d were were bought and sold in a people-to-people marketplace game. Awards were given to the best sellers as well as for best impact, ease of replication and best packaging. Results \u2013 Countries and colleagues were connected, and learned from each other. RR/DRRs put their \u201cresource mobilisation\u201d skills to the test.

An Asia-Paci\ufb01c UNDP-internal Knowledge Fair was organized in Bangkok from 27-29 April 2005 as part of the broader region-wide meetings organised for UNDP representatives (Resident Representatives and Deputy Resident Representatives) from Asia-Paci\ufb01c\u2019s 25 UNDP Country Of\ufb01ces, which took place from 27 April to 2 May 2005. The Asia Paci\ufb01c Knowledge Fair was a pilot effort, and featured those practices based at the Regional Centre in Bangkok (Governance, Energy and Environment, Crisis Prevention and Recovery, Cross - cutting practices: including Gender and Capacity 2015, ICT4D as well as the Management Practice) and also those based in the Regional Centre in Colombo (HIV-AIDS, Poverty/MDGs, Trade and Investment). The fair featured \u201cgood practices\u201d from 24 UNDP Country Of\ufb01ces in the Asia Paci\ufb01c, as well as a broad selection of global and regional knowledge products. The objectives of the Asia-Paci\ufb01c UNDP-internal Knowledge Fair were to: \u2022 Stimulate CO-CO exchange of knowledge\u2014sharing of country level development knowledge and experiences across countries \u2022 Strengthen the practices in the region\u2014improving the strategic focus and quality of the practices \u2022 Convey CO needs to regional centres\u2014improving regional centres\u2019 understanding of country level and client CO needs for better-tailored regional centre services and work planning \u2022 Highlight available regional centre services\u2014enhancing client understanding of services and products available from regional centres The CO \u201cGood Practice\u201d Marketplace game To stimulate interaction among participants and support knowledge management related activities in Asia and the Paci\ufb01c, a CO \u201cGood Practice\u201d Marketplace game was organized. The game operated as an interactive marketplace, where Country Of\ufb01ce \u201cGood Practices\u201d were bought and sold with specially created knowledge cheques. The COs who received the most knowledge cheques by the end of the Knowledge Fair were the winners of the game and awarded cash prizes to be used for knowledge management related activities in their country. Like any trade fair or marketplace, the Asia-Paci\ufb01c Knowledge Fair had dedicated spaces or stalls to exhibit different types of knowledge and resources. These were based on UNDP\u2019s practice areas of Crisis Prevention and Recovery, Energy & Environment, Governance, and Management practice. The Fair also featured stalls from the Regional Centre in Columbo and in select cross-cutting areas. Each Country Of\ufb01ce in Asia and the Paci\ufb01c was requested to identify and share its \u2018good practices\u2019 in the above- mentioned practice areas. While it was recognised that some of the Good Practices had relevance to more than one practice area, organising them by booth helped facilitate the accessibility of knowledge products for participants. Only two Good Practices per country were included in the Marketplace Game as indicated later. However, all Good Practice submissions - including those not included in the Marketplace Game - were displayed at the Knowledge Fair and are included in this Compendium. This compendium was compiled unedited from entries on the Knowledge Fair website. 9 Awards in the CO \u201cGood Practice\u201d marketplace game Congratulations to the winners of the Marketplace Game. In addition to the main awards for the \ufb01rst three places (of 20,000, 10,000 and 5,000 USD), there were 3,000 USD awards for four Special Awards and special recognitions for three \u201cPearls of Knowledge\u201d.

SAMOA Batman to the Rescue - FOR SALE Niue was devastated by Cyclone Heta. In addition to infrastructure damages, the natural environment was also particularly affected. Speci\ufb01cally, the \ufb02ying foxes, pigeons and the avifauna of Niue were highly affected as their habitats were destroyed by the cyclone. Further, there was no food for these animals as all the fruit trees were damaged. In a response to save the birds, pigeons and in particular the \ufb02ying foxes, a local environmentalist with the assistance of the UNDP-GEF Biodiversity project assisted by feeding the birds and the bats with fruit cans. It was the best available alternative at a very critical time. SAMOA Champions The pro\ufb01ling of champions is a mini-programme within the overall regional programme currently executed through the Secretariat of the Paci\ufb01c Regional Environment Programme and covers 14 Paci\ufb01c Island Countries. It entails advance ownership by local champions to managing resources, speci\ufb01cally improving the management of waste, water and coastal \ufb01sheries. By pro\ufb01ling local champions, communities are made aware of a leader in 17 resource management who they can easily identify with and thus, improve the working relationship with other local resource users in managing the resource. The champion programme aims to award outstanding person(s) who are making a positive contribution to sustainable management of resources. SAMOA Headless Chicken Running The lessons learned from the NBSAP framework can be applied to improve other national plans that very often seem unsustainable and uncoordinated. The use of strategies within other national plans to achieve desired outcomes is lacking and absent in most PICs, a condition symptomatic with \u201cheadless chicken\u201d running in an uncoordinated fashion and in all directions. In this practice, the UNDP CO in Samoa is leading the charge in advising countries to be strategic by mirroring the format of the NBSAP process when preparing other national environment plans and strategies. SAMOA Opening The Box - FOR SALE UNDP CO in Samoa has initiated \u201cOpening the Box\u201d support to countries implementing GEF funded projects by introducing streamlining of project funds to maximize on cross-cutting bene\ufb01ts. This greatly improves the inter-relationship of all GEF focal areas by building partnership on substantive gains that creates availability of funds for other priority areas. Namely, projects such as NBSAP, POPs and NAPA are cooperating together to co-\ufb01nance related activities bene\ufb01cial to all three such as procurement of of\ufb01ce equipment, uses of equipment, establishing the Ministry\u2019s website etc. This evidently gives rise to the thinking outside the box where projects funds are normally managed separately from each other given that the three GEF focal areas are housed in different Ministries. In the case of Samoa, these projects are all accommodated in the Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and Meteorology and thus provides for the opportunity to streamline funds. SAMOA South-South Cooperation In strengthening south-south cooperation among Paci\ufb01c Island Countries, UNDP CO in Samoa strongly encourages sharing of resources and knowledge across borders irrespective of their LDC or SIDS status. UNDP strives to use opportunities by negotiating with countries to share resources and technical expertise made available to LDC and/or SIDS countries by UN agencies and funds. In this case, UNDP CO in Samoa negotiated the participation of Niue\u2019s POPs Team to the upcoming UNITAR training for the development of POPs National Implementation Plans (NIP). In addition, the Technical Cooperation between Developing Countries (TCDC) fund by UNDP and donors provided the opportunity for practical attachments by Policy Analyst and Planners for the Governments of Niue and Cook Islands to exchange valuable knowledge between countries experience in national planning, aid coordination and resource allocation as a viable means to advance MDG achievements.
