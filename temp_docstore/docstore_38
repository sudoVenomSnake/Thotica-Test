The proposed NbS intervention focussed on creating an integrated management model offering a long-term management strategy for the coastal wetlands found in the Gulf of Oristano \u2013 a new regional park. It contributed to balancing social and environmental needs and paved the way to recognise the economic and cultural potential of the wetlands. Since the implementation of activities is still ongoing, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment was used Figure 7: Area archeologica di tharros, San Giovanni di Sinis, Cabras, Italy (\u00a9 L\u00e9onard Cotte, Unsplash) 18 to identify entry points to strengthen the NbS intervention. This analysis was carried out by the UNEP Regional Activity Centre for Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP/RAC) of the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) of the UN Environment Programme and recommendations published in a report.[18] Table 4: Characteristics and benefits of the Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Adequate adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status Implementation of the NbS intervention is ongoing. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped identify the key societal challenges that needed addressing. These management plans also provided insights into human activities in the region, such as aquaculture and fishing. General information on drivers and responses of the identified societal challenges was gathered; however, there was no data specific to the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. An area for improvement identified as part of the self- assessment relates to strengthening the links to human wellbeing outcomes. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The aim of the intervention was to overcome fragmentation between the various wetland ecosystems in the Gulf of Oristano. The collaboration established among 11 municipalities through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract helped advance coordination, including across sectors. Further, interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems fed into the design of the intervention and considered various activities, including fishing, flood risk management, agriculture and tourism among others. Vulnerability and risk maps were developed. However, it was recommended that additional data be gathered to understand risks across the catchment and better define the adaptation and resilience actions to climate change, including related to connectivity between wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped understand the current state of wetland ecosystems and biodiversity in the region. Regular monitoring is 19 ecosystem integrity ensured through an integrated information system, the Oristano Wetland Observatory. In addition, the implementation of a Wetland Index is planned. Options to enhance integrity of the wetland ecosystems were implemented. These included the restoration of ecological connections, creation of buffer zones and preservation of native habitats. Key biodiversity outcomes: \uf0b7 Strengthened conservation of coastal and marine habitats; \uf0b7 Reinforced resilience to climate change impacts; \uf0b7 Reduced water consumption, abstraction, pollution and contamination. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable This criterion turned out to be the weakest for this NbS intervention. No specific cost-effectiveness study was conducted. Cost-benefit analyses and consideration of alternatives were conducted only for a limited number of the wetlands found in the Gulf of Oristano. The long-term resourcing of the NbS was partially secured through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract. Additional resourcing is expected through the new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 as well as through the new funds from the Recovery and Resilience Plan that is currently being developed. Moreover, the institution of a new protected area (regional park) will be an instrument to attract new funds and ensure the ongoing management of wetlands. A full economic analysis was suggested as a priority action going forward to secure the continuity and sustainability of the NbS intervention.

Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits A basic analysis of the rights, usage of and access to land and resources was done. It revealed that the regional government owns the wetlands, while surrounding areas are either under public or private ownership. Concessions are given to fisher cooperatives. The results of the self-assessment revealed a major shortcoming in agreeing limits of trade-offs and related safeguards. This aspect was included as a priority action moving forward. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based The Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract defined guidelines and actions that steered the definition of intended outcomes and actions and informed 20 on evidence monitoring and evaluation of the intervention. The Integrated Information System developed as part of the initiative provided uniform and regular data on the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. The collected information will be used for regular monitoring over time. However, no concrete plan of how the monitoring may trigger an adaptive management response was prepared. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract is an important document supporting the implementation of integrated, coordinated and collaborative approaches at scale. The Contract is an important legal instrument as it reinforces the commitment towards joint policy action to overcome fragmentation of coastal wetlands management, looking towards the establishment of a new regional protected area, which is the first aim of the Action Plan attached to the Contract. It provides the foundation for NbS actions in the Gulf of Oristano. In addition, national and global targets were key reference points for the design of the NbS intervention and Ramsar information sheets were updated for the six Ramsar sites. A new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 is under preparation by the regional government. Steps will be taken to integrate the results of the NbS intervention into the strategy to promote its long-term continuity. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Defining priority and corrective actions to strengthen the intervention. An analysis of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 indicators that have been insufficiently or only partially addressed helped to make recommendations for improvement and to identify concrete corrective actions to strengthen the implementation of the NbS intervention.[18] This demonstrates how the self-assessment can be used to strengthen the design and implementation of NbS interventions. Strong legal basis. The adoption of the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract by the 11 municipalities provided an important legal basis and framework to advance integrated management of six wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. It provided strategies and actions that support ongoing efforts toward the establishment of a new regional park. 3.4 Sustainable aquaculture and innovative seaweed farming in Zanzibar Location: Zanzibar, Tanzania Main implementing organisation: International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Other implementing organisation: Ecosystem-based Aquaculture Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Commission on Ecosystem Management (IUCN CEM) Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 2 (solution for sustainable management of restored and managed ecosystems, including innovative land-use planning protocols) 21 Case overview: Since 1990, Zanzibar has become a primary seaweed producer in Africa. Seaweed farming activities are usually small-scale and carried out in the intertidal zones largely in marine conservation areas, near mangroves and coral reefs. Eighty-eight per cent of seaweed farmers are women, making this an important activity to elevate their economic status and role in the community.[19] Climate change, the absence of producer associations, difficulties in accessing international markets and insufficient protection of coastal ecosystems have contributed to a decline in the production of higher-valued seaweeds. While the co-management approach applied in Zanzibar aims to protect coastal ecosystems and habitats, enhance artisanal fisheries and mariculture, shortcomings in the management remain.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bdfae222-ed06-4d7e-ac7e-49ff995440b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "bdfae222-ed06-4d7e-ac7e-49ff995440b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-collation-case-studies-submitted-wcpa-task-force", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "OECMs: Collation of Case Studies Submitted to the WCPA Task Force", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-collation-case-studies-submitted-wcpa-task-force", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef49aaeb519fe2d562e4ee92892a0172d4d4cf50c21b4889e5a195b745009bdf"}, "2": {"node_id": "27339484-831a-4c7d-8264-a4fc784b1d05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/oecms-collation-case-studies-submitted-wcpa-task-force", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a6de82434cdf829a709aef5a397829e699368fc3c89cf64cc0633c878cf38082"}}, "hash": "1b77c276ec4cd88faf5c13ce18c57825d10efdfb8fab0a95b73e4e82248fa064", "text": "New approaches to aquaculture and marine conservation have emerged only recently (in terms of concrete projects since 2014), with the case in Zanzibar serving as a first attempt to test the level of adherence of seaweed farming with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39.

It should also be noted that the self-assessment was carried out as a desk review. Further, means of verification were not always available, as data relating to certain indicators were not gathered. To conduct a more comprehensive assessment, local stakeholders should be involved as key informants. Nevertheless, the self-assessment provided insights into areas for improvement as to how interventions are designed, implemented and monitored. It also provided insights into knowledge and data gaps, which prompted critical questions and corrective actions that need to be addressed going forward. Intervention status Initial activities are completed. Future actions, research and knowledge needs are being assessed. Figure 8: Women working in seaweed farms in Pemba, Zantibar (\u00a9 R. le Gouvello) 22 Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges The societal challenges were identified, documented and prioritised through a theory of change exercise. This included a stakeholder workshop and engagement with local authorities to verify the information. Several studies provided insights into the positive outcomes of mariculture and seaweed farming, which included gender equality, economic revenues provided to women and the consequences on their life, including increased autonomy, empowerment and role in the communities. Although there was an understanding of the internal and external risks of the intervention, the SWOT analysis carried out for the Zanzibar case showed that a number of weaknesses and threats have not yet been addressed. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The application of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) ensured a recognition of interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems. A more holistic approach should be applied in future interventions to take into account the impact of value chains and access to markets for local livelihoods. Some synergies across sectors were identified. However, since the theory of change exercise was not completed due to time constraints, complementary interventions were not integrated fully into the design of the intervention. It was recommended to work with stakeholders to complete this exercise and achieve synergies for future interventions, especially between aquaculture, marine conservation and other relevant sectors. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. The analysis of the biodiversity benefits achieved through this intervention were largely based on a desk review of existing literature and information rather than a specific assessment, monitoring framework or thorough and collective effort with key informants and stakeholders. As was highlighted in a recent study published by IUCN, criterion 3 is the most difficult to achieve for seaweed farming and aquaculture.[19] There is a clear need to establish measures to reduce, control and mitigate impacts on biodiversity. Moreover, better documentation of the ecological state of the ecosystem, ecosystem connectivity and assessment of impacts is required. In this regard, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is an important tool to call attention to these issues and helps improve interventions that would otherwise cause harm to coastal and marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable Seaweed farming is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market. The intervention did not carry out a global value chain assessment or detailed 23 assessment of climate change impacts. These could have provided insights into the economic feasibility and sustainability of the intervention, especially with regards to supporting the livelihoods of local women, who predominantly engage in seaweed farming. In addition, alternative scenarios and options need to be explored going forward to identify the most suitable, sustainable and economically viable solution in the specific context. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes Co-management approaches were applied in marine conservation areas. These involved the government and local communities, often with international support. They demonstrated the willingness of the Government of Zanzibar to implement blue growth strategies that are inclusive of local communities and aim to build a sustainable future. The need to further increase and improve the participation of women and aquaculture farmers in decision-making, to enhance transparency and to provide access to information, was highlighted. There are also opportunities to enhance cooperation across jurisdictional boundaries. Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. While there was a reported willingness from the Government of Zanzibar to consider relevant trade-offs, the limits of these trade-offs and associated safeguards were not clarified. Existing cost-benefit analyses have not yet considered environmental aspects that would trigger corrective action.

By completing the self-assessment under the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39, it was possible to make concrete recommendations on how to improve the balancing of trade-offs, while ensuring the sustainability of the intervention. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The Government of Zanzibar put in place a blue growth strategy, which considers the challenges of seaweed farming, including related sustainability concerns. However, there is as yet no evidence of a formal mechanism to monitor and evaluate interventions on a regular basis to determine adaptive management responses. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context Since the 1980s, the Government of Zanzibar encouraged multi-use marine protected zones, which were included in relevant sectoral laws and policies. A blue growth strategy and regulations support seaweed farming practices and the achievement of global targets. The means by which lessons learned are captured and communicated have been highlighted as an area for improvement. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) 24 Lessons learned: Taking corrective action. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 served as an important tool to reflect on Nature-based Solution design, implementation and monitoring challenges. It provided insights into areas that require corrective action, the collection of additional evidence and means of verification and involvement of local stakeholders. In this manner, the self- assessment results will inform future work on aquaculture and seaweed farming in Zanzibar (and elsewhere) and help improve intervention design, implementation and monitoring frameworks. Reviewing the understanding of the NbS criteria and indicators. Several rounds of discussions, guided by IUCN expert reviewers, were held on the rationale and means of verification provided per indicator. These revealed that the criteria were sometimes understood and interpreted differently by different people, impacting the assigned rating. This demonstrated the complexities associated with assessing whether an intervention can be considered a Nature-based Solution and the need for thorough and guided consideration of each indicator. Continued engagement. A new agenda of research and development work has emerged, including dialogues around NbS criteria and indicators with stakeholders in Zanzibar and local communities. This could contribute to a future roadmap for Zanzibar and a framework for regular self- evaluation. 25 4 Summary of results First, case studies offer important opportunities for exchange of experiences, reflection on different approaches applied in different contexts as well as lessons learned with regards to opportunities, challenges and needed corrective actions. The agreed documentation framework and resulting prototype database of case studies based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 and elements from the PANORAMA: solutions for a healthy planet case study database, greatly support the analysis and comparability of experiences by offering common and robust parameters for benchmarking interventions.5 Second, there is tremendous strength in inclusive governance and open, transparent and participatory approaches that draw on local and/or traditional knowledge, engage Indigenous people, local communities and traditionally under-represented groups, such as women and youth. As illustrated in the Guatemala and Zanzibar cases, women in particular can benefit from enhanced opportunities, social status and income generated through NbS, when the design accounts for their role and inherent gender gaps. Third, scale is an important success factor. Small-scale, time-bound, pilot and project-based interventions often fail to address the full complexity of societal challenges and rarely produce the biodiversity and human wellbeing outcomes expected from the NbS. Finally, an enabling institutional, legal and policy environment provides the backbone for the implementation of and investments in NbS by making nature an ally in addressing societal challenges. Supportive, clear and coherent legal and policy frameworks can further enhance and facilitate coordination across relevant sectors and actors as well as protect the rights of affected and vulnerable communities that benefit directly or indirectly from an intervention. 5 More reflections on the benefits of the prototype database see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions, reference [11] 26 References [1] Mace, G.M.

Case studies can be a useful tool to illustrate the value of NbS interventions. They demonstrate the elements that are essential for the successful design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of NbS and thus enable learning from experiences in different contexts. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is particular suited to document the positive contributions of NbS. Based on its science-based and widely consulted criteria and indicators, the Standard helps verify NbS applications and promotes comparability as well as a coherent and consistent framework for benchmarking interventions.

NbS emerged from this deeper understanding as a way to operationalise the Ecosystem Approach, with the primary goal of applying conservation approaches to safeguard society (see Figure 1).[1, 2, 3] Figure 1: Nature-based Solutions to address societal challenges. The seven societal challenges indicators are climate change adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk reduction, economic and social development, human health, food security, water security and environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. (\u00a9 IUCN) More recently, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 1 This IUCN definition was endorsed by IUCN\u2019s 1,400 members at the 2016 World Conservation Congress in Resolution 069; an expanded definition was recently adopted at UNEA-5.2 in the resolution entitled Nature-based Solutions for supporting sustainable development 2 Services (IPBES) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognised NbS and their role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity protection and contributions to people.[4] Moreover, the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), held in Nairobi in the first quarter of 2022, adopted a resolution on Nature-based Solutions for Supporting Sustainable Development.[5] An assessment of NbS requires a consistent and common framework that helps document the positive contributions of NbS to green economic development, ecosystem management, climate change and other societally desirable outcomes. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is a valuable tool to verify a range of NbS applications. [6] The eight criteria (see Figure 2) and 28 indicators of the Standard provide clear, science-based and widely consulted parameters for benchmarking NbS interventions.[6, 7] The interdependent and non-hierarchical nature of its eight criteria implies that to be in adherence an intervention has to at least partially address each criterion. As a result, inadequacy in just one criterion means that the intervention in question is not in adherence with the Standard and therefore cannot be verified as an NbS. Figure 2: The eight criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 (\u00a9 IUCN) Adherence with the Standard means that the NbS action sufficiently addresses critical environmental, social and economic dimensions (aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)), legal and policy considerations, inclusive governance and participation aspects. Due to its compatibility with the ISEAL Alliance Code of Good Practice, the Standard provides the necessary focus on achieving impact at scale, preventing misuse and applying safeguards for the verification and/or subsequent improvement of interventions to be considered NbS. The process-oriented quality of the Standard also provides additional value for analysing and extracting key lessons learned from case studies. It allows reflection on and increases understanding of challenges and opportunities, differentiates between strong and weak NbS interventions, and provides room for corrective and adaptive management and learning throughout the intervention cycle. 3 The international case studies presented here provide insights into particular success factors and challenges for NbS interventions and, thus, promote and enhance uptake, implementation and financing of NbS. Further, they support an effort to build a prototype database of NbS cases using the Standard as a lens through which to understand verification and lessons learned. 4 2 Methodology The prototype database of NbS cases was conceived through an agreed documentation framework, the selection of illustrative international case studies, and the analysis and presentation of five international case studies in accordance with the documentation framework. Inclusivity and gender considerations were given particular attention and wherever possible, disaggregated data is provided. By highlighting the inclusion of different knowledge systems and participation in decision-making of those affected by NbS interventions (including Indigenous peoples and local communities, women and youth), the case studies demonstrate the critical importance of inclusive governance for the success of an NbS intervention. They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8786a0a0-aac8-4685-923c-f31a2730a9be": {"__data__": {"id_": "8786a0a0-aac8-4685-923c-f31a2730a9be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-7-equity-conservation-what-why-and-how", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN WCPA Technical Note Series No. 7 Equity in conservation \u2013 what, why and how?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-7-equity-conservation-what-why-and-how", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4b93cfccec1bbce90dac685efc2ee7d4893731323780587de11631b938684bb"}, "2": {"node_id": "b53a35b1-3fb2-4fc3-b87e-14bad0e4aff8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-7-equity-conservation-what-why-and-how", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f6c5927b440b4bb00e8d0480a6ab94b741c672d5b3ad6c14f9599bf84bc7e8f5"}}, "hash": "640a56ebd4ed3c005db1675d77c319409d5867279773dfd37ec57ad9cf4bfd02", "text": "They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.

To facilitate this, a combined template \u2013 the documentation framework \u2013 was developed to ensure that the required information would be collected and collated. In order to ensure this framework was complementary with the most relevant databases, a mapping of NbS resources from the EU project NetworkNature was utilised (not yet publicly available).[10] Subsequently, relevant information from the case studies related to the documentation framework was gathered. The case study documentation framework captures key information about each of the case studies. It was designed to combine inputs from the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39 and the information required by the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database to help classify each of the case studies (see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions[11]). 5 2.2 Case study selection and documentation The case study selection process focussed on identifying and agreeing on the five most relevant international case studies. It was agreed that the selected cases should provide a good representation across societal challenges, ecosystems and sectors. The initial longlist of international case studies was drawn from cases that had already undergone a full assessment with the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39. In accordance with the classification discussed in Section 2 of the CCICED Special Policy Study Report on \u201cValue Assessment of Nature- based Solutions\u201d, discussions with the Special Policy Study team and the availability of sufficient qualitative and quantitative information, five case studies were selected, analysed and documented. The results can be found below and on the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database.[12] Identify priority databases \u2022 Use NetworkNature mapping to identify three priority databases (e.g. PANORAMA) Extract documentation framework \u2022 Collect the documentation required for PANORAMA, finding gender disaggregated data where possible \u2022 In addition, gather gender relevant data inspired by the questions supplied by the CCICED Toolkit on Gender Equality and Environmental Sustainability Combine into standardized template \u2022 Combine these frameworks to create an overarching template for the selected case studies.

An increase in the number of coastal flooding events and overwashing occurring several times per year, exacerbated by sea level rise and climate change, established that the existing shingle bank was insufficient to protect against floods. This posed significant actual and potential risks to life and caused damage to property and infrastructure. Additionally, coastal squeeze caused losses of coastal habitat. In response, the Environment Agency of the United Kingdom delivered a GBP 27 million project to realign the defences inland, providing significantly improved flood defences to allow for managed flooding. The intervention created 300 hectares of habitat (183 of which is intertidal, including mudflat, salt marsh and transitional grassland), protection of more than 300 homes, road infrastructure and a wastewater treatment plant and a boom to local tourism and recreation, with 22,000 visitors each year. The main positive impacts of the Figure 5: Aerial view of the intervention area taken in September 2013 (\u00a9 Environment Agency of the United Kingdom) 8 Medmerry managed coastal realignment include improved flood risk management, creation of wildlife habitats, enhanced landscape quality and provision of recreational facilities. Table 2: Characteristics and benefits of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Strong adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status All major NbS restoration activities have been completed and monitored. The focus is now on the continuous sustainable management of the intervention area. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges At the project planning stage, local communities, government representatives and statutory organisations were involved in the development of a vision for Medmerry, highlighting a wide range of impacts, including societal and environmental. The vision exercise highlighted disaster risk reduction, especially flooding, as a major priority. Additionally, environmental assessment data of flood events (the most serious recent event before the start of the project occurred in 2008 and caused over GBP 5 million in economic damage and required evacuation due to risk of life[14]), flood risk mapping and modelling confirmed flooding as the main societal challenge. These assessments were based on global best practices. Impacts of climate change were found to be an exacerbating factor. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale During the planning phase, a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out and a full risk register developed. To achieve flood reduction and environmental improvement, 200 miles of the UK coast were assessed to determine the most promising opportunities for NbS, considering landscape, impacts on people and surrounding habitats. In addition, wider impacts across the region were assessed in accordance with the National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England, including people, businesses, infrastructure and environments. While the coastal realignment provided many new business opportunities, these were not considered in depth during the planning phase. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The expected impacts on the ecosystems in the intervention areas were captured in an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). These included mitigation measures for any risks to biodiversity during construction. For 9 instance, water voles were translocated prior to the start of the works.

Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes The project placed particular emphasis on stakeholder engagement and participation of local communities in all phases of the project. This included proactively providing information about the benefits of the coastal realignment, gaining widespread support for the intervention and seeking community views and inputs. A comprehensive stakeholder analysis allowed a mapping of how best to engage with the different stakeholders. The Medmerry Stakeholder Advisory Group was established, made up of key individuals of the local community, including Parish Councils, local businesses and residents most affected by the coastal realignment. The Advisory Group helped shape the 10 design of the project and met regularly to discuss any issues and concerns. Although a complaints procedure was in place, which enabled affected individuals to raise concerns through an independent ombudsman, more could have been done to ease the associated bureaucratic burden. The active and intentional involvement of the local community and subsequent support generated, contributed significantly to the success of the project. [15] Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits The costs and benefits of the NbS intervention were mapped in line with UK government assessment criteria and included the surrounding areas of the intervention site (landscape level). Annual meetings with stakeholders ensured that the NbS intervention provided the expected benefits. Public access (footpaths, cycle paths and bridleway) to the newly established nature reserve was enhanced and recreational areas provided, while maintaining a balance between recreational activities and undisturbed conservation areas. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The expected benefits were documented in the planning phase and baselines established. These informed the ongoing monitoring of NbS impacts. Immediately after project completion, a five-year monitoring programme was implemented. Annual reports summarised findings and lessons learned, which were shared and discussed with local stakeholders, external consultants, academia and risk management authorities in south England. Approaches to project planning and implementation were adjusted as needed. For instance, the approach applied to engaging the local community was adapted based on early experiences and analysis of challenges and barriers. [15] Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context While lessons learned have been captured in annual reports and through the monitoring framework, these have only been shared with a limited audience. The main benefits that have been communicated relate to reduced flood risk and created habitat. The success of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment along with other NbS interventions informed the organisational national strategy and increased the focus on NbS nationally. The project was characterised by comprehensively considering climate change and biodiversity throughout the design, implementation and monitoring phases. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Participatory and collaborative approaches. Inclusive governance and collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, especially the local community, ensured effective assessment of societal challenges and priorities in the given context, increased understanding and acceptability of the proposed solution and enabled effective planning, implementation and maintenance/management of the NbS intervention, with a possibility for creative problem-solving. 11 Transparency.

The negative impacts caused by increased flood risk also caused transboundary challenges between Vietnam and Cambodia. Based on documented farmer knowledge and experience, IUCN promoted and improved locally-practiced, flood-based (wetland) agriculture and livelihood models in the Vietnamese provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap and Long An. Flood-based livelihoods were encouraged as a financially viable, low risk alternative to triple rice cropping, to enhance economic and social resilience as well as to conserve and restore the biodiversity found in Mekong Delta freshwater wetlands/floodplains. The NbS intervention considered three systems - floating rice systems, lotus farming systems and rice aquaculture systems. Due to increasing weather extremes, hybrid solutions were also explored (combination of dykes and floodplains), to enable controlled flooding and adaptive approaches to overcome risks of drought and to manage the arrival and recession of floods. While the main focus of the NbS intervention was on farmers adding an additional flood-based crop in open flood (no dyke) and flood control zones (low dyke), the utility of replacing low value irrigated crops with higher value flood-based crops in closed control zones (high dyke) was also considered. In order to achieve the full set of biodiversity and human wellbeing benefits derived from moderated floods, interventions need to be scaled up across the entirety of the Mekong Delta floodplain. To do so, a follow-up project is currently being developed under the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Table 3: Characteristics and benefits of flood-based agriculture in the upper Mekong delta floodplain based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Adequate adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status The concept of flood-based agriculture as an NbS emerged as part of a larger Programme of Work starting with the 2013 Mekong Delta Plan, which leveraged a number of projects that explored its feasibility. Initial studies of farmer initiatives and proof of concept in IUCN pilot sites were completed between 2015 and 2018. These fed into the design and implementation of similar projects in the region (e.g. those by the World Bank, IUCN and FAO).

Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges The major flood in 2011 demonstrated the increased damages incurred due to loss of floodplains/retention areas in the Upper Mekong Delta caused by an intensification of rice farming. A debate over the sustainability of intensified rice farming policies that use poldering emerged.

Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The design of the intervention recognised the challenges across the Mekong Delta, which were also captured in the 2013 Mekong Delta Plan.

The economic component was not sufficiently considered in the design of the initial intervention, though marketable products were identified. While initial IUCN pilot interventions remained limited and small-scale, collaboration across similar projects and recent policy developments currently support the development of a large-scale intervention across the 1.4 million ha of the Upper Mekong Delta floodplain. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The focus of the intervention was on modified wetland ecosystems (formally zoned as agricultural land under private tenure) and thus excluded practices carried out in protected and conserved areas. In light of the extensive scientific evidence on the risks of rice intensification, it was possible to assess the status of ecosystems as well as drivers of change and biodiversity loss. Due to the rather small scale of the IUCN pilot interventions, no concrete data or monitoring frameworks to capture the positive biodiversity outcomes were implemented. Instead, outcomes were captured in general terms, including provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural functions of the floodplain. Detailed 14 monitoring for potential, unintended adverse consequences on nature arising from the intervention was not carried out. Key investments in biodiversity outcomes[16]: \uf0b7 Investments into 450 ha of flood-based livelihoods to enhance ecosystem functions of floodplains, which resulted in the conservation or restoration of approx. 6.7 million m\u00b3 of flood retention capacity supporting aquifer recharge, the reduction in land subsidence and the conservation or restoration of aquatic habitat/biodiversity; \uf0b7 additional benefits were observed from wild fisheries, mitigation of river erosion through the re-establishment of natural hydrology of seasonal flooding and increased land fertility, including through sediment deposition due to the seasonal flooding. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable A feasibility study for a GCF proposal revealed that several hundred thousand farmers and a number of downstream towns would benefit financially from flooding if seasonal flood-based agriculture were applied. In addition, cost- benefit analyses were carried out on the profitability of flood-based crops and the cropping system as a whole in comparison to mono-rice cropping. The NbS intervention did not consider the development of clear value chains and business models, which hampered securing long-term funding sources to maintain the NbS. Instead, the intervention relied on short-term, project-based grant funding. The planned GCF project could help overcome some of these shortcomings. Key expected economic benefits[16]: \uf0b7 flood-based livelihoods have the potential to be 1.5 to five times more profitable than intensive rice cropping; \uf0b7 floating rice systems could generate around USD 6,400 per ha per year, while triple rice cropping systems generate only USD 3,100 per ha per year; \uf0b7 where farmers add a flood-based crop in open flood or flood control zones, additional income between USD 2,293 \u2013 USD 5,744 per ha per year could be generated depending on the flood-based agriculture system applied[17]; \uf0b7 in open flood and flood control zones, no investments need to be made towards flood management, while in closed control zones (high dykes), sluice coordination by the local government is necessary; flood-based agriculture could serve as an incentive to stop conversion of low dykes to high dykes, which in turn helps preserve the floodplains in the Upper Mekong Delta. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and No grievance mechanism was put in place for the IUCN pilot NbS interventions, due to the small-scale and limited number of farmers involved. A grievance 15 empowering governance processes mechanism was put in place for the larger scale World Bank ICRSL project implementation as was required by World Bank safeguard policies. A stakeholder analysis provided insights into which stakeholders were directly and indirectly affected. Stakeholders provided inputs into the regional vision and plans for phasing out intensive triple rice crop farming. In addition, since farmers have private tenure over their land, farmer participation in decision-making and ownership of such decisions was essential. National Resolution 120 entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d and Decision 593 defined the roles and responsibilities of different actors in decision-making processes and recognised the need for policy reform rather than small-scale community- based solutions.

However, it is not yet operational. This constitutes a shortcoming for the NbS intervention. For the World Bank ICRSL project, social and environmental safeguards were put in place. However, the limits of trade-offs were not discussed in detail. In some areas a hybrid model was used, with low dykes controlling the timing of flood arrival/recession to support double-cropping and flood-based cropping (instead of the traditional third rice crop). In the case of lotus farming systems, flood-based agriculture enabled diversification of activities, including fish raising, ecotourism and recreational opportunities. In the future, value chains, especially for rice production, will need to be considered in more detail to support the new flood-based agriculture model and gain support from rice exporters. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence While National Resolution 120 provided an enabling policy environment for flood-based agriculture, examples of interventions that ran counter to the resolution remained. This weakened the impact of the NbS intervention and underlined that monitoring needed to be improved. There is no evidence as to whether there has been a government response to adapt the approach. Limited technical and institutional capacity was identified as a key factor. Lessons learned from the IUCN pilots and experiences from other similar initiatives are shared regularly at the Mekong Delta Development Partners Working Group and Annual Mekong Delta Forums. Further, the emerging interest from academia in flood-based agriculture is already producing relevant data and information. Additionally, the preparation of the planned Green Climate Fund 16 proposal considers the above challenges. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The NbS intervention built on the 2013 Mekong Delta Plan, which recommended high-value double rice cropping in combination with seasonal flood-based agriculture/aquaculture to manage flood risks. This influenced the promulgation of National Resolution 120, entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d; this policy was adopted in November 2017 and stipulates that nature-based adaptation models should be selected that are environmentally sound and achieve sustainable development based on \u2018actively living with the floods\u2019. The Mekong Delta Forum provided a space for knowledge exchange on lessons learned and endorsement of a common vision for the Upper Mekong Delta, including a move to more natural land and water uses. An IUCN-led Green Climate Fund proposal is under preparation to ensure continuity of efforts and to address transboundary challenges. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Legal and regulatory framework. Supportive legal and policy frameworks opened up opportunities for a change in land use and facilitated partnerships across related initiatives for the adoption of flood-based agriculture in open flood and flood control zones. A need for market incentives. The NbS intervention in Vietnam could have profited from a more holistic approach regarding the diversification of marketable products derived from flood-based agriculture to provide additional market incentives. Through consultations and analysis of lessons learned, market access and a lack of value chain development were identified as the greatest challenges for scaling up flood-based agriculture. This is influencing the design of the future Green Climate Fund project. Overcoming small-scale and time-bound interventions. A hybrid system of flood-based agriculture with some flooding control system of low dykes could help manage risks of early/heavy floods and droughts. The highest potential lies in the closed flood zones with high dykes through the opening of sluices during seasonal floods to restore the flood retention area. However, existing projects have not yet addressed this potential. This demonstrates that for NbS interventions to achieve positive impacts at scale, small-scale (often focussed on pilots), project-based and time- bound interventions are not sufficient to address complex societal challenges. Nevertheless, partnerships between related interventions in the region contributed to institutional and policy development as well as supported greater cross-sectoral coordination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ecef48c-b78e-4059-9664-10bfde31562a": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ecef48c-b78e-4059-9664-10bfde31562a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-7-equity-conservation-what-why-and-how", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN WCPA Technical Note Series No. 7 Equity in conservation \u2013 what, why and how?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-7-equity-conservation-what-why-and-how", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bcab26619a0961c59b3944bd22387d02327c11e6d8b6ff8e1d46cd36d02c3f69"}, "2": {"node_id": "621860e1-6919-4d88-9548-7837ba9356c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-7-equity-conservation-what-why-and-how", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09eb9d0b96e4c0885e01bbf7776f4717abb9a05985ca804e2c37bf6a705df0f6"}}, "hash": "332159c0f84e8d7d8c6540a3514332113f9587b4422493f594df7cf600801933", "text": "17 3.3 Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management Location: Gulf of Oristano, Sardinia, Italy Main implementing organisation: MEDSEA Mediterranean Sea and Coast Foundation Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 1 (solution that makes better use of existing natural and protected ecosystems) Case overview: The Gulf of Oristano is home to a number of freshwater and coastal wetlands.

It contributed to balancing social and environmental needs and paved the way to recognise the economic and cultural potential of the wetlands. Since the implementation of activities is still ongoing, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment was used Figure 7: Area archeologica di tharros, San Giovanni di Sinis, Cabras, Italy (\u00a9 L\u00e9onard Cotte, Unsplash) 18 to identify entry points to strengthen the NbS intervention. This analysis was carried out by the UNEP Regional Activity Centre for Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP/RAC) of the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) of the UN Environment Programme and recommendations published in a report.[18] Table 4: Characteristics and benefits of the Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Adequate adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status Implementation of the NbS intervention is ongoing. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped identify the key societal challenges that needed addressing. These management plans also provided insights into human activities in the region, such as aquaculture and fishing. General information on drivers and responses of the identified societal challenges was gathered; however, there was no data specific to the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. An area for improvement identified as part of the self- assessment relates to strengthening the links to human wellbeing outcomes. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The aim of the intervention was to overcome fragmentation between the various wetland ecosystems in the Gulf of Oristano. The collaboration established among 11 municipalities through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract helped advance coordination, including across sectors. Further, interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems fed into the design of the intervention and considered various activities, including fishing, flood risk management, agriculture and tourism among others. Vulnerability and risk maps were developed. However, it was recommended that additional data be gathered to understand risks across the catchment and better define the adaptation and resilience actions to climate change, including related to connectivity between wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped understand the current state of wetland ecosystems and biodiversity in the region. Regular monitoring is 19 ecosystem integrity ensured through an integrated information system, the Oristano Wetland Observatory. In addition, the implementation of a Wetland Index is planned. Options to enhance integrity of the wetland ecosystems were implemented. These included the restoration of ecological connections, creation of buffer zones and preservation of native habitats. Key biodiversity outcomes: \uf0b7 Strengthened conservation of coastal and marine habitats; \uf0b7 Reinforced resilience to climate change impacts; \uf0b7 Reduced water consumption, abstraction, pollution and contamination. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable This criterion turned out to be the weakest for this NbS intervention. No specific cost-effectiveness study was conducted. Cost-benefit analyses and consideration of alternatives were conducted only for a limited number of the wetlands found in the Gulf of Oristano. The long-term resourcing of the NbS was partially secured through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract. Additional resourcing is expected through the new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 as well as through the new funds from the Recovery and Resilience Plan that is currently being developed.

Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits A basic analysis of the rights, usage of and access to land and resources was done. It revealed that the regional government owns the wetlands, while surrounding areas are either under public or private ownership. Concessions are given to fisher cooperatives. The results of the self-assessment revealed a major shortcoming in agreeing limits of trade-offs and related safeguards. This aspect was included as a priority action moving forward. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based The Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract defined guidelines and actions that steered the definition of intended outcomes and actions and informed 20 on evidence monitoring and evaluation of the intervention. The Integrated Information System developed as part of the initiative provided uniform and regular data on the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. The collected information will be used for regular monitoring over time. However, no concrete plan of how the monitoring may trigger an adaptive management response was prepared. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract is an important document supporting the implementation of integrated, coordinated and collaborative approaches at scale. The Contract is an important legal instrument as it reinforces the commitment towards joint policy action to overcome fragmentation of coastal wetlands management, looking towards the establishment of a new regional protected area, which is the first aim of the Action Plan attached to the Contract. It provides the foundation for NbS actions in the Gulf of Oristano. In addition, national and global targets were key reference points for the design of the NbS intervention and Ramsar information sheets were updated for the six Ramsar sites. A new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 is under preparation by the regional government. Steps will be taken to integrate the results of the NbS intervention into the strategy to promote its long-term continuity. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Defining priority and corrective actions to strengthen the intervention. An analysis of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 indicators that have been insufficiently or only partially addressed helped to make recommendations for improvement and to identify concrete corrective actions to strengthen the implementation of the NbS intervention.[18] This demonstrates how the self-assessment can be used to strengthen the design and implementation of NbS interventions. Strong legal basis. The adoption of the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract by the 11 municipalities provided an important legal basis and framework to advance integrated management of six wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. It provided strategies and actions that support ongoing efforts toward the establishment of a new regional park. 3.4 Sustainable aquaculture and innovative seaweed farming in Zanzibar Location: Zanzibar, Tanzania Main implementing organisation: International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Other implementing organisation: Ecosystem-based Aquaculture Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Commission on Ecosystem Management (IUCN CEM) Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 2 (solution for sustainable management of restored and managed ecosystems, including innovative land-use planning protocols) 21 Case overview: Since 1990, Zanzibar has become a primary seaweed producer in Africa. Seaweed farming activities are usually small-scale and carried out in the intertidal zones largely in marine conservation areas, near mangroves and coral reefs. Eighty-eight per cent of seaweed farmers are women, making this an important activity to elevate their economic status and role in the community.[19] Climate change, the absence of producer associations, difficulties in accessing international markets and insufficient protection of coastal ecosystems have contributed to a decline in the production of higher-valued seaweeds. While the co-management approach applied in Zanzibar aims to protect coastal ecosystems and habitats, enhance artisanal fisheries and mariculture, shortcomings in the management remain.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48452863-f0d3-41d8-b421-c4b96ea3c15d": {"__data__": {"id_": "48452863-f0d3-41d8-b421-c4b96ea3c15d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-7-equity-conservation-what-why-and-how", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN WCPA Technical Note Series No. 7 Equity in conservation \u2013 what, why and how?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-7-equity-conservation-what-why-and-how", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ece983ee194fceb8e54c1e5eabfd9721a5dd9fbc39ce2b20f16ef5addc9b2aca"}, "2": {"node_id": "555d9d14-acc5-4362-b84e-6fe010f960f7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-7-equity-conservation-what-why-and-how", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30301440e3132df7a31129f6f7ccb91a17be787cdf66b6f7d6324412ca38e625"}}, "hash": "025f8829503b0a6ca109da56aff7b35607813c57e47c07ec995ebf3a06b22f85", "text": "New approaches to aquaculture and marine conservation have emerged only recently (in terms of concrete projects since 2014), with the case in Zanzibar serving as a first attempt to test the level of adherence of seaweed farming with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39.

It should also be noted that the self-assessment was carried out as a desk review. Further, means of verification were not always available, as data relating to certain indicators were not gathered. To conduct a more comprehensive assessment, local stakeholders should be involved as key informants. Nevertheless, the self-assessment provided insights into areas for improvement as to how interventions are designed, implemented and monitored. It also provided insights into knowledge and data gaps, which prompted critical questions and corrective actions that need to be addressed going forward. Intervention status Initial activities are completed. Future actions, research and knowledge needs are being assessed. Figure 8: Women working in seaweed farms in Pemba, Zantibar (\u00a9 R. le Gouvello) 22 Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges The societal challenges were identified, documented and prioritised through a theory of change exercise. This included a stakeholder workshop and engagement with local authorities to verify the information. Several studies provided insights into the positive outcomes of mariculture and seaweed farming, which included gender equality, economic revenues provided to women and the consequences on their life, including increased autonomy, empowerment and role in the communities. Although there was an understanding of the internal and external risks of the intervention, the SWOT analysis carried out for the Zanzibar case showed that a number of weaknesses and threats have not yet been addressed. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The application of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) ensured a recognition of interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems. A more holistic approach should be applied in future interventions to take into account the impact of value chains and access to markets for local livelihoods. Some synergies across sectors were identified. However, since the theory of change exercise was not completed due to time constraints, complementary interventions were not integrated fully into the design of the intervention. It was recommended to work with stakeholders to complete this exercise and achieve synergies for future interventions, especially between aquaculture, marine conservation and other relevant sectors. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. The analysis of the biodiversity benefits achieved through this intervention were largely based on a desk review of existing literature and information rather than a specific assessment, monitoring framework or thorough and collective effort with key informants and stakeholders. As was highlighted in a recent study published by IUCN, criterion 3 is the most difficult to achieve for seaweed farming and aquaculture.[19] There is a clear need to establish measures to reduce, control and mitigate impacts on biodiversity. Moreover, better documentation of the ecological state of the ecosystem, ecosystem connectivity and assessment of impacts is required. In this regard, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is an important tool to call attention to these issues and helps improve interventions that would otherwise cause harm to coastal and marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable Seaweed farming is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market. The intervention did not carry out a global value chain assessment or detailed 23 assessment of climate change impacts. These could have provided insights into the economic feasibility and sustainability of the intervention, especially with regards to supporting the livelihoods of local women, who predominantly engage in seaweed farming. In addition, alternative scenarios and options need to be explored going forward to identify the most suitable, sustainable and economically viable solution in the specific context. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes Co-management approaches were applied in marine conservation areas. These involved the government and local communities, often with international support. They demonstrated the willingness of the Government of Zanzibar to implement blue growth strategies that are inclusive of local communities and aim to build a sustainable future. The need to further increase and improve the participation of women and aquaculture farmers in decision-making, to enhance transparency and to provide access to information, was highlighted. There are also opportunities to enhance cooperation across jurisdictional boundaries. Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. While there was a reported willingness from the Government of Zanzibar to consider relevant trade-offs, the limits of these trade-offs and associated safeguards were not clarified. Existing cost-benefit analyses have not yet considered environmental aspects that would trigger corrective action.

By completing the self-assessment under the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39, it was possible to make concrete recommendations on how to improve the balancing of trade-offs, while ensuring the sustainability of the intervention. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The Government of Zanzibar put in place a blue growth strategy, which considers the challenges of seaweed farming, including related sustainability concerns. However, there is as yet no evidence of a formal mechanism to monitor and evaluate interventions on a regular basis to determine adaptive management responses. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context Since the 1980s, the Government of Zanzibar encouraged multi-use marine protected zones, which were included in relevant sectoral laws and policies. A blue growth strategy and regulations support seaweed farming practices and the achievement of global targets. The means by which lessons learned are captured and communicated have been highlighted as an area for improvement. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) 24 Lessons learned: Taking corrective action. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 served as an important tool to reflect on Nature-based Solution design, implementation and monitoring challenges. It provided insights into areas that require corrective action, the collection of additional evidence and means of verification and involvement of local stakeholders. In this manner, the self- assessment results will inform future work on aquaculture and seaweed farming in Zanzibar (and elsewhere) and help improve intervention design, implementation and monitoring frameworks. Reviewing the understanding of the NbS criteria and indicators. Several rounds of discussions, guided by IUCN expert reviewers, were held on the rationale and means of verification provided per indicator. These revealed that the criteria were sometimes understood and interpreted differently by different people, impacting the assigned rating. This demonstrated the complexities associated with assessing whether an intervention can be considered a Nature-based Solution and the need for thorough and guided consideration of each indicator. Continued engagement. A new agenda of research and development work has emerged, including dialogues around NbS criteria and indicators with stakeholders in Zanzibar and local communities. This could contribute to a future roadmap for Zanzibar and a framework for regular self- evaluation. 25 4 Summary of results First, case studies offer important opportunities for exchange of experiences, reflection on different approaches applied in different contexts as well as lessons learned with regards to opportunities, challenges and needed corrective actions. The agreed documentation framework and resulting prototype database of case studies based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 and elements from the PANORAMA: solutions for a healthy planet case study database, greatly support the analysis and comparability of experiences by offering common and robust parameters for benchmarking interventions.5 Second, there is tremendous strength in inclusive governance and open, transparent and participatory approaches that draw on local and/or traditional knowledge, engage Indigenous people, local communities and traditionally under-represented groups, such as women and youth. As illustrated in the Guatemala and Zanzibar cases, women in particular can benefit from enhanced opportunities, social status and income generated through NbS, when the design accounts for their role and inherent gender gaps. Third, scale is an important success factor. Small-scale, time-bound, pilot and project-based interventions often fail to address the full complexity of societal challenges and rarely produce the biodiversity and human wellbeing outcomes expected from the NbS. Finally, an enabling institutional, legal and policy environment provides the backbone for the implementation of and investments in NbS by making nature an ally in addressing societal challenges. Supportive, clear and coherent legal and policy frameworks can further enhance and facilitate coordination across relevant sectors and actors as well as protect the rights of affected and vulnerable communities that benefit directly or indirectly from an intervention. 5 More reflections on the benefits of the prototype database see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions, reference [11] 26 References [1] Mace, G.M.

Case studies can be a useful tool to illustrate the value of NbS interventions. They demonstrate the elements that are essential for the successful design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of NbS and thus enable learning from experiences in different contexts. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is particular suited to document the positive contributions of NbS. Based on its science-based and widely consulted criteria and indicators, the Standard helps verify NbS applications and promotes comparability as well as a coherent and consistent framework for benchmarking interventions.

NbS emerged from this deeper understanding as a way to operationalise the Ecosystem Approach, with the primary goal of applying conservation approaches to safeguard society (see Figure 1).[1, 2, 3] Figure 1: Nature-based Solutions to address societal challenges. The seven societal challenges indicators are climate change adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk reduction, economic and social development, human health, food security, water security and environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. (\u00a9 IUCN) More recently, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 1 This IUCN definition was endorsed by IUCN\u2019s 1,400 members at the 2016 World Conservation Congress in Resolution 069; an expanded definition was recently adopted at UNEA-5.2 in the resolution entitled Nature-based Solutions for supporting sustainable development 2 Services (IPBES) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognised NbS and their role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity protection and contributions to people.[4] Moreover, the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), held in Nairobi in the first quarter of 2022, adopted a resolution on Nature-based Solutions for Supporting Sustainable Development.[5] An assessment of NbS requires a consistent and common framework that helps document the positive contributions of NbS to green economic development, ecosystem management, climate change and other societally desirable outcomes. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is a valuable tool to verify a range of NbS applications. [6] The eight criteria (see Figure 2) and 28 indicators of the Standard provide clear, science-based and widely consulted parameters for benchmarking NbS interventions.[6, 7] The interdependent and non-hierarchical nature of its eight criteria implies that to be in adherence an intervention has to at least partially address each criterion. As a result, inadequacy in just one criterion means that the intervention in question is not in adherence with the Standard and therefore cannot be verified as an NbS. Figure 2: The eight criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 (\u00a9 IUCN) Adherence with the Standard means that the NbS action sufficiently addresses critical environmental, social and economic dimensions (aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)), legal and policy considerations, inclusive governance and participation aspects. Due to its compatibility with the ISEAL Alliance Code of Good Practice, the Standard provides the necessary focus on achieving impact at scale, preventing misuse and applying safeguards for the verification and/or subsequent improvement of interventions to be considered NbS. The process-oriented quality of the Standard also provides additional value for analysing and extracting key lessons learned from case studies. It allows reflection on and increases understanding of challenges and opportunities, differentiates between strong and weak NbS interventions, and provides room for corrective and adaptive management and learning throughout the intervention cycle. 3 The international case studies presented here provide insights into particular success factors and challenges for NbS interventions and, thus, promote and enhance uptake, implementation and financing of NbS. Further, they support an effort to build a prototype database of NbS cases using the Standard as a lens through which to understand verification and lessons learned. 4 2 Methodology The prototype database of NbS cases was conceived through an agreed documentation framework, the selection of illustrative international case studies, and the analysis and presentation of five international case studies in accordance with the documentation framework. Inclusivity and gender considerations were given particular attention and wherever possible, disaggregated data is provided. By highlighting the inclusion of different knowledge systems and participation in decision-making of those affected by NbS interventions (including Indigenous peoples and local communities, women and youth), the case studies demonstrate the critical importance of inclusive governance for the success of an NbS intervention. They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a65bbeb-a74e-45a4-b062-9b54ba3d8f3b": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a65bbeb-a74e-45a4-b062-9b54ba3d8f3b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-6-recognising-and-reporting-other", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN WCPA Technical Note Series No. 6 RECOGNISING AND REPORTING OTHER EFFECTIVE AREA-BASED CONSERVATION MEASURES", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-6-recognising-and-reporting-other", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6afa3dfa8f06d4e5811c6fe857e8451ddd5c3cb1c7c36422710ae2ccf87f503"}, "2": {"node_id": "899ed766-4c5c-4443-b493-d5d251b81ccc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-6-recognising-and-reporting-other", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6e14b465cbc8ee976853d3e25214c330bac2884afc6e853cdc978aa633730c73"}}, "hash": "5b4a9bb7d471e999450156f1b00beb2b2b56f25c4a9034d8e833ee7e1f56377f", "text": "They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.

To facilitate this, a combined template \u2013 the documentation framework \u2013 was developed to ensure that the required information would be collected and collated. In order to ensure this framework was complementary with the most relevant databases, a mapping of NbS resources from the EU project NetworkNature was utilised (not yet publicly available).[10] Subsequently, relevant information from the case studies related to the documentation framework was gathered. The case study documentation framework captures key information about each of the case studies. It was designed to combine inputs from the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39 and the information required by the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database to help classify each of the case studies (see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions[11]). 5 2.2 Case study selection and documentation The case study selection process focussed on identifying and agreeing on the five most relevant international case studies. It was agreed that the selected cases should provide a good representation across societal challenges, ecosystems and sectors. The initial longlist of international case studies was drawn from cases that had already undergone a full assessment with the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39. In accordance with the classification discussed in Section 2 of the CCICED Special Policy Study Report on \u201cValue Assessment of Nature- based Solutions\u201d, discussions with the Special Policy Study team and the availability of sufficient qualitative and quantitative information, five case studies were selected, analysed and documented. The results can be found below and on the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database.[12] Identify priority databases \u2022 Use NetworkNature mapping to identify three priority databases (e.g. PANORAMA) Extract documentation framework \u2022 Collect the documentation required for PANORAMA, finding gender disaggregated data where possible \u2022 In addition, gather gender relevant data inspired by the questions supplied by the CCICED Toolkit on Gender Equality and Environmental Sustainability Combine into standardized template \u2022 Combine these frameworks to create an overarching template for the selected case studies.

An increase in the number of coastal flooding events and overwashing occurring several times per year, exacerbated by sea level rise and climate change, established that the existing shingle bank was insufficient to protect against floods. This posed significant actual and potential risks to life and caused damage to property and infrastructure. Additionally, coastal squeeze caused losses of coastal habitat. In response, the Environment Agency of the United Kingdom delivered a GBP 27 million project to realign the defences inland, providing significantly improved flood defences to allow for managed flooding. The intervention created 300 hectares of habitat (183 of which is intertidal, including mudflat, salt marsh and transitional grassland), protection of more than 300 homes, road infrastructure and a wastewater treatment plant and a boom to local tourism and recreation, with 22,000 visitors each year. The main positive impacts of the Figure 5: Aerial view of the intervention area taken in September 2013 (\u00a9 Environment Agency of the United Kingdom) 8 Medmerry managed coastal realignment include improved flood risk management, creation of wildlife habitats, enhanced landscape quality and provision of recreational facilities. Table 2: Characteristics and benefits of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Strong adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status All major NbS restoration activities have been completed and monitored. The focus is now on the continuous sustainable management of the intervention area. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges At the project planning stage, local communities, government representatives and statutory organisations were involved in the development of a vision for Medmerry, highlighting a wide range of impacts, including societal and environmental. The vision exercise highlighted disaster risk reduction, especially flooding, as a major priority. Additionally, environmental assessment data of flood events (the most serious recent event before the start of the project occurred in 2008 and caused over GBP 5 million in economic damage and required evacuation due to risk of life[14]), flood risk mapping and modelling confirmed flooding as the main societal challenge. These assessments were based on global best practices. Impacts of climate change were found to be an exacerbating factor. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale During the planning phase, a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out and a full risk register developed. To achieve flood reduction and environmental improvement, 200 miles of the UK coast were assessed to determine the most promising opportunities for NbS, considering landscape, impacts on people and surrounding habitats. In addition, wider impacts across the region were assessed in accordance with the National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England, including people, businesses, infrastructure and environments. While the coastal realignment provided many new business opportunities, these were not considered in depth during the planning phase. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The expected impacts on the ecosystems in the intervention areas were captured in an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).

Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes The project placed particular emphasis on stakeholder engagement and participation of local communities in all phases of the project. This included proactively providing information about the benefits of the coastal realignment, gaining widespread support for the intervention and seeking community views and inputs. A comprehensive stakeholder analysis allowed a mapping of how best to engage with the different stakeholders. The Medmerry Stakeholder Advisory Group was established, made up of key individuals of the local community, including Parish Councils, local businesses and residents most affected by the coastal realignment. The Advisory Group helped shape the 10 design of the project and met regularly to discuss any issues and concerns. Although a complaints procedure was in place, which enabled affected individuals to raise concerns through an independent ombudsman, more could have been done to ease the associated bureaucratic burden. The active and intentional involvement of the local community and subsequent support generated, contributed significantly to the success of the project. [15] Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits The costs and benefits of the NbS intervention were mapped in line with UK government assessment criteria and included the surrounding areas of the intervention site (landscape level). Annual meetings with stakeholders ensured that the NbS intervention provided the expected benefits. Public access (footpaths, cycle paths and bridleway) to the newly established nature reserve was enhanced and recreational areas provided, while maintaining a balance between recreational activities and undisturbed conservation areas. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The expected benefits were documented in the planning phase and baselines established. These informed the ongoing monitoring of NbS impacts. Immediately after project completion, a five-year monitoring programme was implemented. Annual reports summarised findings and lessons learned, which were shared and discussed with local stakeholders, external consultants, academia and risk management authorities in south England. Approaches to project planning and implementation were adjusted as needed. For instance, the approach applied to engaging the local community was adapted based on early experiences and analysis of challenges and barriers. [15] Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context While lessons learned have been captured in annual reports and through the monitoring framework, these have only been shared with a limited audience. The main benefits that have been communicated relate to reduced flood risk and created habitat. The success of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment along with other NbS interventions informed the organisational national strategy and increased the focus on NbS nationally. The project was characterised by comprehensively considering climate change and biodiversity throughout the design, implementation and monitoring phases. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Participatory and collaborative approaches. Inclusive governance and collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, especially the local community, ensured effective assessment of societal challenges and priorities in the given context, increased understanding and acceptability of the proposed solution and enabled effective planning, implementation and maintenance/management of the NbS intervention, with a possibility for creative problem-solving. 11 Transparency.

The negative impacts caused by increased flood risk also caused transboundary challenges between Vietnam and Cambodia. Based on documented farmer knowledge and experience, IUCN promoted and improved locally-practiced, flood-based (wetland) agriculture and livelihood models in the Vietnamese provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap and Long An. Flood-based livelihoods were encouraged as a financially viable, low risk alternative to triple rice cropping, to enhance economic and social resilience as well as to conserve and restore the biodiversity found in Mekong Delta freshwater wetlands/floodplains. The NbS intervention considered three systems - floating rice systems, lotus farming systems and rice aquaculture systems. Due to increasing weather extremes, hybrid solutions were also explored (combination of dykes and floodplains), to enable controlled flooding and adaptive approaches to overcome risks of drought and to manage the arrival and recession of floods. While the main focus of the NbS intervention was on farmers adding an additional flood-based crop in open flood (no dyke) and flood control zones (low dyke), the utility of replacing low value irrigated crops with higher value flood-based crops in closed control zones (high dyke) was also considered. In order to achieve the full set of biodiversity and human wellbeing benefits derived from moderated floods, interventions need to be scaled up across the entirety of the Mekong Delta floodplain. To do so, a follow-up project is currently being developed under the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

Initial studies of farmer initiatives and proof of concept in IUCN pilot sites were completed between 2015 and 2018. These fed into the design and implementation of similar projects in the region (e.g. those by the World Bank, IUCN and FAO).

The economic component was not sufficiently considered in the design of the initial intervention, though marketable products were identified. While initial IUCN pilot interventions remained limited and small-scale, collaboration across similar projects and recent policy developments currently support the development of a large-scale intervention across the 1.4 million ha of the Upper Mekong Delta floodplain. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The focus of the intervention was on modified wetland ecosystems (formally zoned as agricultural land under private tenure) and thus excluded practices carried out in protected and conserved areas. In light of the extensive scientific evidence on the risks of rice intensification, it was possible to assess the status of ecosystems as well as drivers of change and biodiversity loss. Due to the rather small scale of the IUCN pilot interventions, no concrete data or monitoring frameworks to capture the positive biodiversity outcomes were implemented. Instead, outcomes were captured in general terms, including provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural functions of the floodplain. Detailed 14 monitoring for potential, unintended adverse consequences on nature arising from the intervention was not carried out. Key investments in biodiversity outcomes[16]: \uf0b7 Investments into 450 ha of flood-based livelihoods to enhance ecosystem functions of floodplains, which resulted in the conservation or restoration of approx. 6.7 million m\u00b3 of flood retention capacity supporting aquifer recharge, the reduction in land subsidence and the conservation or restoration of aquatic habitat/biodiversity; \uf0b7 additional benefits were observed from wild fisheries, mitigation of river erosion through the re-establishment of natural hydrology of seasonal flooding and increased land fertility, including through sediment deposition due to the seasonal flooding. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable A feasibility study for a GCF proposal revealed that several hundred thousand farmers and a number of downstream towns would benefit financially from flooding if seasonal flood-based agriculture were applied. In addition, cost- benefit analyses were carried out on the profitability of flood-based crops and the cropping system as a whole in comparison to mono-rice cropping. The NbS intervention did not consider the development of clear value chains and business models, which hampered securing long-term funding sources to maintain the NbS. Instead, the intervention relied on short-term, project-based grant funding. The planned GCF project could help overcome some of these shortcomings. Key expected economic benefits[16]: \uf0b7 flood-based livelihoods have the potential to be 1.5 to five times more profitable than intensive rice cropping; \uf0b7 floating rice systems could generate around USD 6,400 per ha per year, while triple rice cropping systems generate only USD 3,100 per ha per year; \uf0b7 where farmers add a flood-based crop in open flood or flood control zones, additional income between USD 2,293 \u2013 USD 5,744 per ha per year could be generated depending on the flood-based agriculture system applied[17]; \uf0b7 in open flood and flood control zones, no investments need to be made towards flood management, while in closed control zones (high dykes), sluice coordination by the local government is necessary; flood-based agriculture could serve as an incentive to stop conversion of low dykes to high dykes, which in turn helps preserve the floodplains in the Upper Mekong Delta. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and No grievance mechanism was put in place for the IUCN pilot NbS interventions, due to the small-scale and limited number of farmers involved. A grievance 15 empowering governance processes mechanism was put in place for the larger scale World Bank ICRSL project implementation as was required by World Bank safeguard policies. A stakeholder analysis provided insights into which stakeholders were directly and indirectly affected. Stakeholders provided inputs into the regional vision and plans for phasing out intensive triple rice crop farming. In addition, since farmers have private tenure over their land, farmer participation in decision-making and ownership of such decisions was essential.

However, it is not yet operational. This constitutes a shortcoming for the NbS intervention. For the World Bank ICRSL project, social and environmental safeguards were put in place. However, the limits of trade-offs were not discussed in detail. In some areas a hybrid model was used, with low dykes controlling the timing of flood arrival/recession to support double-cropping and flood-based cropping (instead of the traditional third rice crop). In the case of lotus farming systems, flood-based agriculture enabled diversification of activities, including fish raising, ecotourism and recreational opportunities. In the future, value chains, especially for rice production, will need to be considered in more detail to support the new flood-based agriculture model and gain support from rice exporters. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence While National Resolution 120 provided an enabling policy environment for flood-based agriculture, examples of interventions that ran counter to the resolution remained. This weakened the impact of the NbS intervention and underlined that monitoring needed to be improved. There is no evidence as to whether there has been a government response to adapt the approach. Limited technical and institutional capacity was identified as a key factor. Lessons learned from the IUCN pilots and experiences from other similar initiatives are shared regularly at the Mekong Delta Development Partners Working Group and Annual Mekong Delta Forums. Further, the emerging interest from academia in flood-based agriculture is already producing relevant data and information. Additionally, the preparation of the planned Green Climate Fund 16 proposal considers the above challenges. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The NbS intervention built on the 2013 Mekong Delta Plan, which recommended high-value double rice cropping in combination with seasonal flood-based agriculture/aquaculture to manage flood risks. This influenced the promulgation of National Resolution 120, entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d; this policy was adopted in November 2017 and stipulates that nature-based adaptation models should be selected that are environmentally sound and achieve sustainable development based on \u2018actively living with the floods\u2019. The Mekong Delta Forum provided a space for knowledge exchange on lessons learned and endorsement of a common vision for the Upper Mekong Delta, including a move to more natural land and water uses. An IUCN-led Green Climate Fund proposal is under preparation to ensure continuity of efforts and to address transboundary challenges. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Legal and regulatory framework. Supportive legal and policy frameworks opened up opportunities for a change in land use and facilitated partnerships across related initiatives for the adoption of flood-based agriculture in open flood and flood control zones. A need for market incentives. The NbS intervention in Vietnam could have profited from a more holistic approach regarding the diversification of marketable products derived from flood-based agriculture to provide additional market incentives. Through consultations and analysis of lessons learned, market access and a lack of value chain development were identified as the greatest challenges for scaling up flood-based agriculture. This is influencing the design of the future Green Climate Fund project. Overcoming small-scale and time-bound interventions. A hybrid system of flood-based agriculture with some flooding control system of low dykes could help manage risks of early/heavy floods and droughts. The highest potential lies in the closed flood zones with high dykes through the opening of sluices during seasonal floods to restore the flood retention area. However, existing projects have not yet addressed this potential. This demonstrates that for NbS interventions to achieve positive impacts at scale, small-scale (often focussed on pilots), project-based and time- bound interventions are not sufficient to address complex societal challenges. Nevertheless, partnerships between related interventions in the region contributed to institutional and policy development as well as supported greater cross-sectoral coordination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4dc1f7c5-d046-423b-96c1-de0b2e746700": {"__data__": {"id_": "4dc1f7c5-d046-423b-96c1-de0b2e746700", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-6-recognising-and-reporting-other", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN WCPA Technical Note Series No. 6 RECOGNISING AND REPORTING OTHER EFFECTIVE AREA-BASED CONSERVATION MEASURES", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-6-recognising-and-reporting-other", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c1ebddb1fc82454a07a57335d9fdb29a55dd46421faff553c20b67eaaedb4a63"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc24a6d7-211a-4675-b7b6-f29f3d44f641", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-6-recognising-and-reporting-other", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49e95beee639cc5a36ef89e55c3f07b145add6284ca35edd6d0803fdff672559"}}, "hash": "eb4174fb411ed68f2b399b39344eb8e250f2d393cbf2ecb20077efda1346b48a", "text": "17 3.3 Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management Location: Gulf of Oristano, Sardinia, Italy Main implementing organisation: MEDSEA Mediterranean Sea and Coast Foundation Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 1 (solution that makes better use of existing natural and protected ecosystems) Case overview: The Gulf of Oristano is home to a number of freshwater and coastal wetlands.

It contributed to balancing social and environmental needs and paved the way to recognise the economic and cultural potential of the wetlands. Since the implementation of activities is still ongoing, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment was used Figure 7: Area archeologica di tharros, San Giovanni di Sinis, Cabras, Italy (\u00a9 L\u00e9onard Cotte, Unsplash) 18 to identify entry points to strengthen the NbS intervention. This analysis was carried out by the UNEP Regional Activity Centre for Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP/RAC) of the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) of the UN Environment Programme and recommendations published in a report.[18] Table 4: Characteristics and benefits of the Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Adequate adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status Implementation of the NbS intervention is ongoing. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped identify the key societal challenges that needed addressing. These management plans also provided insights into human activities in the region, such as aquaculture and fishing. General information on drivers and responses of the identified societal challenges was gathered; however, there was no data specific to the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. An area for improvement identified as part of the self- assessment relates to strengthening the links to human wellbeing outcomes. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The aim of the intervention was to overcome fragmentation between the various wetland ecosystems in the Gulf of Oristano. The collaboration established among 11 municipalities through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract helped advance coordination, including across sectors. Further, interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems fed into the design of the intervention and considered various activities, including fishing, flood risk management, agriculture and tourism among others. Vulnerability and risk maps were developed. However, it was recommended that additional data be gathered to understand risks across the catchment and better define the adaptation and resilience actions to climate change, including related to connectivity between wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped understand the current state of wetland ecosystems and biodiversity in the region. Regular monitoring is 19 ecosystem integrity ensured through an integrated information system, the Oristano Wetland Observatory. In addition, the implementation of a Wetland Index is planned. Options to enhance integrity of the wetland ecosystems were implemented. These included the restoration of ecological connections, creation of buffer zones and preservation of native habitats. Key biodiversity outcomes: \uf0b7 Strengthened conservation of coastal and marine habitats; \uf0b7 Reinforced resilience to climate change impacts; \uf0b7 Reduced water consumption, abstraction, pollution and contamination. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable This criterion turned out to be the weakest for this NbS intervention. No specific cost-effectiveness study was conducted. Cost-benefit analyses and consideration of alternatives were conducted only for a limited number of the wetlands found in the Gulf of Oristano. The long-term resourcing of the NbS was partially secured through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract. Additional resourcing is expected through the new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 as well as through the new funds from the Recovery and Resilience Plan that is currently being developed. Moreover, the institution of a new protected area (regional park) will be an instrument to attract new funds and ensure the ongoing management of wetlands. A full economic analysis was suggested as a priority action going forward to secure the continuity and sustainability of the NbS intervention.

An analysis of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 indicators that have been insufficiently or only partially addressed helped to make recommendations for improvement and to identify concrete corrective actions to strengthen the implementation of the NbS intervention.[18] This demonstrates how the self-assessment can be used to strengthen the design and implementation of NbS interventions. Strong legal basis. The adoption of the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract by the 11 municipalities provided an important legal basis and framework to advance integrated management of six wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano.

Seaweed farming activities are usually small-scale and carried out in the intertidal zones largely in marine conservation areas, near mangroves and coral reefs. Eighty-eight per cent of seaweed farmers are women, making this an important activity to elevate their economic status and role in the community.[19] Climate change, the absence of producer associations, difficulties in accessing international markets and insufficient protection of coastal ecosystems have contributed to a decline in the production of higher-valued seaweeds.

It should also be noted that the self-assessment was carried out as a desk review. Further, means of verification were not always available, as data relating to certain indicators were not gathered. To conduct a more comprehensive assessment, local stakeholders should be involved as key informants. Nevertheless, the self-assessment provided insights into areas for improvement as to how interventions are designed, implemented and monitored. It also provided insights into knowledge and data gaps, which prompted critical questions and corrective actions that need to be addressed going forward. Intervention status Initial activities are completed. Future actions, research and knowledge needs are being assessed. Figure 8: Women working in seaweed farms in Pemba, Zantibar (\u00a9 R. le Gouvello) 22 Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges The societal challenges were identified, documented and prioritised through a theory of change exercise. This included a stakeholder workshop and engagement with local authorities to verify the information. Several studies provided insights into the positive outcomes of mariculture and seaweed farming, which included gender equality, economic revenues provided to women and the consequences on their life, including increased autonomy, empowerment and role in the communities. Although there was an understanding of the internal and external risks of the intervention, the SWOT analysis carried out for the Zanzibar case showed that a number of weaknesses and threats have not yet been addressed. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The application of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) ensured a recognition of interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems. A more holistic approach should be applied in future interventions to take into account the impact of value chains and access to markets for local livelihoods. Some synergies across sectors were identified. However, since the theory of change exercise was not completed due to time constraints, complementary interventions were not integrated fully into the design of the intervention. It was recommended to work with stakeholders to complete this exercise and achieve synergies for future interventions, especially between aquaculture, marine conservation and other relevant sectors. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. The analysis of the biodiversity benefits achieved through this intervention were largely based on a desk review of existing literature and information rather than a specific assessment, monitoring framework or thorough and collective effort with key informants and stakeholders. As was highlighted in a recent study published by IUCN, criterion 3 is the most difficult to achieve for seaweed farming and aquaculture.[19] There is a clear need to establish measures to reduce, control and mitigate impacts on biodiversity. Moreover, better documentation of the ecological state of the ecosystem, ecosystem connectivity and assessment of impacts is required. In this regard, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is an important tool to call attention to these issues and helps improve interventions that would otherwise cause harm to coastal and marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable Seaweed farming is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market. The intervention did not carry out a global value chain assessment or detailed 23 assessment of climate change impacts. These could have provided insights into the economic feasibility and sustainability of the intervention, especially with regards to supporting the livelihoods of local women, who predominantly engage in seaweed farming. In addition, alternative scenarios and options need to be explored going forward to identify the most suitable, sustainable and economically viable solution in the specific context. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes Co-management approaches were applied in marine conservation areas. These involved the government and local communities, often with international support. They demonstrated the willingness of the Government of Zanzibar to implement blue growth strategies that are inclusive of local communities and aim to build a sustainable future. The need to further increase and improve the participation of women and aquaculture farmers in decision-making, to enhance transparency and to provide access to information, was highlighted. There are also opportunities to enhance cooperation across jurisdictional boundaries. Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. While there was a reported willingness from the Government of Zanzibar to consider relevant trade-offs, the limits of these trade-offs and associated safeguards were not clarified. Existing cost-benefit analyses have not yet considered environmental aspects that would trigger corrective action.

By completing the self-assessment under the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39, it was possible to make concrete recommendations on how to improve the balancing of trade-offs, while ensuring the sustainability of the intervention. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The Government of Zanzibar put in place a blue growth strategy, which considers the challenges of seaweed farming, including related sustainability concerns. However, there is as yet no evidence of a formal mechanism to monitor and evaluate interventions on a regular basis to determine adaptive management responses. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context Since the 1980s, the Government of Zanzibar encouraged multi-use marine protected zones, which were included in relevant sectoral laws and policies. A blue growth strategy and regulations support seaweed farming practices and the achievement of global targets. The means by which lessons learned are captured and communicated have been highlighted as an area for improvement. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) 24 Lessons learned: Taking corrective action. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 served as an important tool to reflect on Nature-based Solution design, implementation and monitoring challenges. It provided insights into areas that require corrective action, the collection of additional evidence and means of verification and involvement of local stakeholders. In this manner, the self- assessment results will inform future work on aquaculture and seaweed farming in Zanzibar (and elsewhere) and help improve intervention design, implementation and monitoring frameworks. Reviewing the understanding of the NbS criteria and indicators. Several rounds of discussions, guided by IUCN expert reviewers, were held on the rationale and means of verification provided per indicator. These revealed that the criteria were sometimes understood and interpreted differently by different people, impacting the assigned rating. This demonstrated the complexities associated with assessing whether an intervention can be considered a Nature-based Solution and the need for thorough and guided consideration of each indicator. Continued engagement. A new agenda of research and development work has emerged, including dialogues around NbS criteria and indicators with stakeholders in Zanzibar and local communities. This could contribute to a future roadmap for Zanzibar and a framework for regular self- evaluation. 25 4 Summary of results First, case studies offer important opportunities for exchange of experiences, reflection on different approaches applied in different contexts as well as lessons learned with regards to opportunities, challenges and needed corrective actions. The agreed documentation framework and resulting prototype database of case studies based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 and elements from the PANORAMA: solutions for a healthy planet case study database, greatly support the analysis and comparability of experiences by offering common and robust parameters for benchmarking interventions.5 Second, there is tremendous strength in inclusive governance and open, transparent and participatory approaches that draw on local and/or traditional knowledge, engage Indigenous people, local communities and traditionally under-represented groups, such as women and youth. As illustrated in the Guatemala and Zanzibar cases, women in particular can benefit from enhanced opportunities, social status and income generated through NbS, when the design accounts for their role and inherent gender gaps. Third, scale is an important success factor. Small-scale, time-bound, pilot and project-based interventions often fail to address the full complexity of societal challenges and rarely produce the biodiversity and human wellbeing outcomes expected from the NbS. Finally, an enabling institutional, legal and policy environment provides the backbone for the implementation of and investments in NbS by making nature an ally in addressing societal challenges. Supportive, clear and coherent legal and policy frameworks can further enhance and facilitate coordination across relevant sectors and actors as well as protect the rights of affected and vulnerable communities that benefit directly or indirectly from an intervention. 5 More reflections on the benefits of the prototype database see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions, reference [11] 26 References [1] Mace, G.M.

Case studies can be a useful tool to illustrate the value of NbS interventions. They demonstrate the elements that are essential for the successful design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of NbS and thus enable learning from experiences in different contexts. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is particular suited to document the positive contributions of NbS. Based on its science-based and widely consulted criteria and indicators, the Standard helps verify NbS applications and promotes comparability as well as a coherent and consistent framework for benchmarking interventions.

NbS emerged from this deeper understanding as a way to operationalise the Ecosystem Approach, with the primary goal of applying conservation approaches to safeguard society (see Figure 1).[1, 2, 3] Figure 1: Nature-based Solutions to address societal challenges. The seven societal challenges indicators are climate change adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk reduction, economic and social development, human health, food security, water security and environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. (\u00a9 IUCN) More recently, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 1 This IUCN definition was endorsed by IUCN\u2019s 1,400 members at the 2016 World Conservation Congress in Resolution 069; an expanded definition was recently adopted at UNEA-5.2 in the resolution entitled Nature-based Solutions for supporting sustainable development 2 Services (IPBES) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognised NbS and their role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity protection and contributions to people.[4] Moreover, the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), held in Nairobi in the first quarter of 2022, adopted a resolution on Nature-based Solutions for Supporting Sustainable Development.[5] An assessment of NbS requires a consistent and common framework that helps document the positive contributions of NbS to green economic development, ecosystem management, climate change and other societally desirable outcomes. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is a valuable tool to verify a range of NbS applications. [6] The eight criteria (see Figure 2) and 28 indicators of the Standard provide clear, science-based and widely consulted parameters for benchmarking NbS interventions.[6, 7] The interdependent and non-hierarchical nature of its eight criteria implies that to be in adherence an intervention has to at least partially address each criterion. As a result, inadequacy in just one criterion means that the intervention in question is not in adherence with the Standard and therefore cannot be verified as an NbS. Figure 2: The eight criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 (\u00a9 IUCN) Adherence with the Standard means that the NbS action sufficiently addresses critical environmental, social and economic dimensions (aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)), legal and policy considerations, inclusive governance and participation aspects. Due to its compatibility with the ISEAL Alliance Code of Good Practice, the Standard provides the necessary focus on achieving impact at scale, preventing misuse and applying safeguards for the verification and/or subsequent improvement of interventions to be considered NbS. The process-oriented quality of the Standard also provides additional value for analysing and extracting key lessons learned from case studies. It allows reflection on and increases understanding of challenges and opportunities, differentiates between strong and weak NbS interventions, and provides room for corrective and adaptive management and learning throughout the intervention cycle. 3 The international case studies presented here provide insights into particular success factors and challenges for NbS interventions and, thus, promote and enhance uptake, implementation and financing of NbS. Further, they support an effort to build a prototype database of NbS cases using the Standard as a lens through which to understand verification and lessons learned. 4 2 Methodology The prototype database of NbS cases was conceived through an agreed documentation framework, the selection of illustrative international case studies, and the analysis and presentation of five international case studies in accordance with the documentation framework. Inclusivity and gender considerations were given particular attention and wherever possible, disaggregated data is provided. By highlighting the inclusion of different knowledge systems and participation in decision-making of those affected by NbS interventions (including Indigenous peoples and local communities, women and youth), the case studies demonstrate the critical importance of inclusive governance for the success of an NbS intervention. They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff11c055-4318-4d74-9a64-bdfef931cc11": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff11c055-4318-4d74-9a64-bdfef931cc11", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-5-improving-protected-and-conserved", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN WCPA Technical Note Series No. 5 IMPROVING PROTECTED AND CONSERVED AREA MANAGEMENT TO SAFEGUARD ECOLOGICAL INTEGRITY AND MINIMISE ZOONOTIC DISEASE RISK", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-5-improving-protected-and-conserved", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "374c50c49111b92201cadeb82ce79ac8e02d5265df394c774c300528170a41b9"}, "2": {"node_id": "89508ae3-01cb-49fa-bab2-dcba0a6fe870", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-5-improving-protected-and-conserved", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a031b3d4c8dc77aeb339cbde899ba52db5248ce0089c8a616fa45fa2a382564"}}, "hash": "ed7d2742e061569ea07643612fadefea02dd41f61ee397f27c6530cae76d3d85", "text": "They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.

To facilitate this, a combined template \u2013 the documentation framework \u2013 was developed to ensure that the required information would be collected and collated. In order to ensure this framework was complementary with the most relevant databases, a mapping of NbS resources from the EU project NetworkNature was utilised (not yet publicly available).[10] Subsequently, relevant information from the case studies related to the documentation framework was gathered. The case study documentation framework captures key information about each of the case studies. It was designed to combine inputs from the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39 and the information required by the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database to help classify each of the case studies (see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions[11]). 5 2.2 Case study selection and documentation The case study selection process focussed on identifying and agreeing on the five most relevant international case studies. It was agreed that the selected cases should provide a good representation across societal challenges, ecosystems and sectors. The initial longlist of international case studies was drawn from cases that had already undergone a full assessment with the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39. In accordance with the classification discussed in Section 2 of the CCICED Special Policy Study Report on \u201cValue Assessment of Nature- based Solutions\u201d, discussions with the Special Policy Study team and the availability of sufficient qualitative and quantitative information, five case studies were selected, analysed and documented. The results can be found below and on the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database.[12] Identify priority databases \u2022 Use NetworkNature mapping to identify three priority databases (e.g. PANORAMA) Extract documentation framework \u2022 Collect the documentation required for PANORAMA, finding gender disaggregated data where possible \u2022 In addition, gather gender relevant data inspired by the questions supplied by the CCICED Toolkit on Gender Equality and Environmental Sustainability Combine into standardized template \u2022 Combine these frameworks to create an overarching template for the selected case studies.

An increase in the number of coastal flooding events and overwashing occurring several times per year, exacerbated by sea level rise and climate change, established that the existing shingle bank was insufficient to protect against floods. This posed significant actual and potential risks to life and caused damage to property and infrastructure. Additionally, coastal squeeze caused losses of coastal habitat. In response, the Environment Agency of the United Kingdom delivered a GBP 27 million project to realign the defences inland, providing significantly improved flood defences to allow for managed flooding. The intervention created 300 hectares of habitat (183 of which is intertidal, including mudflat, salt marsh and transitional grassland), protection of more than 300 homes, road infrastructure and a wastewater treatment plant and a boom to local tourism and recreation, with 22,000 visitors each year. The main positive impacts of the Figure 5: Aerial view of the intervention area taken in September 2013 (\u00a9 Environment Agency of the United Kingdom) 8 Medmerry managed coastal realignment include improved flood risk management, creation of wildlife habitats, enhanced landscape quality and provision of recreational facilities. Table 2: Characteristics and benefits of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Strong adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status All major NbS restoration activities have been completed and monitored. The focus is now on the continuous sustainable management of the intervention area. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges At the project planning stage, local communities, government representatives and statutory organisations were involved in the development of a vision for Medmerry, highlighting a wide range of impacts, including societal and environmental. The vision exercise highlighted disaster risk reduction, especially flooding, as a major priority. Additionally, environmental assessment data of flood events (the most serious recent event before the start of the project occurred in 2008 and caused over GBP 5 million in economic damage and required evacuation due to risk of life[14]), flood risk mapping and modelling confirmed flooding as the main societal challenge. These assessments were based on global best practices. Impacts of climate change were found to be an exacerbating factor. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale During the planning phase, a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out and a full risk register developed. To achieve flood reduction and environmental improvement, 200 miles of the UK coast were assessed to determine the most promising opportunities for NbS, considering landscape, impacts on people and surrounding habitats. In addition, wider impacts across the region were assessed in accordance with the National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England, including people, businesses, infrastructure and environments. While the coastal realignment provided many new business opportunities, these were not considered in depth during the planning phase. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The expected impacts on the ecosystems in the intervention areas were captured in an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). These included mitigation measures for any risks to biodiversity during construction. For 9 instance, water voles were translocated prior to the start of the works.

Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes The project placed particular emphasis on stakeholder engagement and participation of local communities in all phases of the project. This included proactively providing information about the benefits of the coastal realignment, gaining widespread support for the intervention and seeking community views and inputs. A comprehensive stakeholder analysis allowed a mapping of how best to engage with the different stakeholders. The Medmerry Stakeholder Advisory Group was established, made up of key individuals of the local community, including Parish Councils, local businesses and residents most affected by the coastal realignment. The Advisory Group helped shape the 10 design of the project and met regularly to discuss any issues and concerns. Although a complaints procedure was in place, which enabled affected individuals to raise concerns through an independent ombudsman, more could have been done to ease the associated bureaucratic burden. The active and intentional involvement of the local community and subsequent support generated, contributed significantly to the success of the project. [15] Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits The costs and benefits of the NbS intervention were mapped in line with UK government assessment criteria and included the surrounding areas of the intervention site (landscape level). Annual meetings with stakeholders ensured that the NbS intervention provided the expected benefits. Public access (footpaths, cycle paths and bridleway) to the newly established nature reserve was enhanced and recreational areas provided, while maintaining a balance between recreational activities and undisturbed conservation areas. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The expected benefits were documented in the planning phase and baselines established. These informed the ongoing monitoring of NbS impacts. Immediately after project completion, a five-year monitoring programme was implemented. Annual reports summarised findings and lessons learned, which were shared and discussed with local stakeholders, external consultants, academia and risk management authorities in south England. Approaches to project planning and implementation were adjusted as needed. For instance, the approach applied to engaging the local community was adapted based on early experiences and analysis of challenges and barriers. [15] Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context While lessons learned have been captured in annual reports and through the monitoring framework, these have only been shared with a limited audience. The main benefits that have been communicated relate to reduced flood risk and created habitat. The success of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment along with other NbS interventions informed the organisational national strategy and increased the focus on NbS nationally. The project was characterised by comprehensively considering climate change and biodiversity throughout the design, implementation and monitoring phases. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Participatory and collaborative approaches. Inclusive governance and collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, especially the local community, ensured effective assessment of societal challenges and priorities in the given context, increased understanding and acceptability of the proposed solution and enabled effective planning, implementation and maintenance/management of the NbS intervention, with a possibility for creative problem-solving. 11 Transparency.

The negative impacts caused by increased flood risk also caused transboundary challenges between Vietnam and Cambodia. Based on documented farmer knowledge and experience, IUCN promoted and improved locally-practiced, flood-based (wetland) agriculture and livelihood models in the Vietnamese provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap and Long An. Flood-based livelihoods were encouraged as a financially viable, low risk alternative to triple rice cropping, to enhance economic and social resilience as well as to conserve and restore the biodiversity found in Mekong Delta freshwater wetlands/floodplains. The NbS intervention considered three systems - floating rice systems, lotus farming systems and rice aquaculture systems. Due to increasing weather extremes, hybrid solutions were also explored (combination of dykes and floodplains), to enable controlled flooding and adaptive approaches to overcome risks of drought and to manage the arrival and recession of floods. While the main focus of the NbS intervention was on farmers adding an additional flood-based crop in open flood (no dyke) and flood control zones (low dyke), the utility of replacing low value irrigated crops with higher value flood-based crops in closed control zones (high dyke) was also considered. In order to achieve the full set of biodiversity and human wellbeing benefits derived from moderated floods, interventions need to be scaled up across the entirety of the Mekong Delta floodplain. To do so, a follow-up project is currently being developed under the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

Initial studies of farmer initiatives and proof of concept in IUCN pilot sites were completed between 2015 and 2018. These fed into the design and implementation of similar projects in the region (e.g. those by the World Bank, IUCN and FAO).

The economic component was not sufficiently considered in the design of the initial intervention, though marketable products were identified. While initial IUCN pilot interventions remained limited and small-scale, collaboration across similar projects and recent policy developments currently support the development of a large-scale intervention across the 1.4 million ha of the Upper Mekong Delta floodplain. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The focus of the intervention was on modified wetland ecosystems (formally zoned as agricultural land under private tenure) and thus excluded practices carried out in protected and conserved areas. In light of the extensive scientific evidence on the risks of rice intensification, it was possible to assess the status of ecosystems as well as drivers of change and biodiversity loss. Due to the rather small scale of the IUCN pilot interventions, no concrete data or monitoring frameworks to capture the positive biodiversity outcomes were implemented. Instead, outcomes were captured in general terms, including provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural functions of the floodplain. Detailed 14 monitoring for potential, unintended adverse consequences on nature arising from the intervention was not carried out. Key investments in biodiversity outcomes[16]: \uf0b7 Investments into 450 ha of flood-based livelihoods to enhance ecosystem functions of floodplains, which resulted in the conservation or restoration of approx. 6.7 million m\u00b3 of flood retention capacity supporting aquifer recharge, the reduction in land subsidence and the conservation or restoration of aquatic habitat/biodiversity; \uf0b7 additional benefits were observed from wild fisheries, mitigation of river erosion through the re-establishment of natural hydrology of seasonal flooding and increased land fertility, including through sediment deposition due to the seasonal flooding. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable A feasibility study for a GCF proposal revealed that several hundred thousand farmers and a number of downstream towns would benefit financially from flooding if seasonal flood-based agriculture were applied. In addition, cost- benefit analyses were carried out on the profitability of flood-based crops and the cropping system as a whole in comparison to mono-rice cropping. The NbS intervention did not consider the development of clear value chains and business models, which hampered securing long-term funding sources to maintain the NbS. Instead, the intervention relied on short-term, project-based grant funding. The planned GCF project could help overcome some of these shortcomings. Key expected economic benefits[16]: \uf0b7 flood-based livelihoods have the potential to be 1.5 to five times more profitable than intensive rice cropping; \uf0b7 floating rice systems could generate around USD 6,400 per ha per year, while triple rice cropping systems generate only USD 3,100 per ha per year; \uf0b7 where farmers add a flood-based crop in open flood or flood control zones, additional income between USD 2,293 \u2013 USD 5,744 per ha per year could be generated depending on the flood-based agriculture system applied[17]; \uf0b7 in open flood and flood control zones, no investments need to be made towards flood management, while in closed control zones (high dykes), sluice coordination by the local government is necessary; flood-based agriculture could serve as an incentive to stop conversion of low dykes to high dykes, which in turn helps preserve the floodplains in the Upper Mekong Delta. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and No grievance mechanism was put in place for the IUCN pilot NbS interventions, due to the small-scale and limited number of farmers involved. A grievance 15 empowering governance processes mechanism was put in place for the larger scale World Bank ICRSL project implementation as was required by World Bank safeguard policies. A stakeholder analysis provided insights into which stakeholders were directly and indirectly affected. Stakeholders provided inputs into the regional vision and plans for phasing out intensive triple rice crop farming. In addition, since farmers have private tenure over their land, farmer participation in decision-making and ownership of such decisions was essential. National Resolution 120 entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d and Decision 593 defined the roles and responsibilities of different actors in decision-making processes and recognised the need for policy reform rather than small-scale community- based solutions.

However, it is not yet operational. This constitutes a shortcoming for the NbS intervention. For the World Bank ICRSL project, social and environmental safeguards were put in place. However, the limits of trade-offs were not discussed in detail. In some areas a hybrid model was used, with low dykes controlling the timing of flood arrival/recession to support double-cropping and flood-based cropping (instead of the traditional third rice crop). In the case of lotus farming systems, flood-based agriculture enabled diversification of activities, including fish raising, ecotourism and recreational opportunities. In the future, value chains, especially for rice production, will need to be considered in more detail to support the new flood-based agriculture model and gain support from rice exporters. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence While National Resolution 120 provided an enabling policy environment for flood-based agriculture, examples of interventions that ran counter to the resolution remained. This weakened the impact of the NbS intervention and underlined that monitoring needed to be improved. There is no evidence as to whether there has been a government response to adapt the approach. Limited technical and institutional capacity was identified as a key factor. Lessons learned from the IUCN pilots and experiences from other similar initiatives are shared regularly at the Mekong Delta Development Partners Working Group and Annual Mekong Delta Forums. Further, the emerging interest from academia in flood-based agriculture is already producing relevant data and information. Additionally, the preparation of the planned Green Climate Fund 16 proposal considers the above challenges. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The NbS intervention built on the 2013 Mekong Delta Plan, which recommended high-value double rice cropping in combination with seasonal flood-based agriculture/aquaculture to manage flood risks. This influenced the promulgation of National Resolution 120, entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d; this policy was adopted in November 2017 and stipulates that nature-based adaptation models should be selected that are environmentally sound and achieve sustainable development based on \u2018actively living with the floods\u2019. The Mekong Delta Forum provided a space for knowledge exchange on lessons learned and endorsement of a common vision for the Upper Mekong Delta, including a move to more natural land and water uses. An IUCN-led Green Climate Fund proposal is under preparation to ensure continuity of efforts and to address transboundary challenges. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Legal and regulatory framework. Supportive legal and policy frameworks opened up opportunities for a change in land use and facilitated partnerships across related initiatives for the adoption of flood-based agriculture in open flood and flood control zones. A need for market incentives. The NbS intervention in Vietnam could have profited from a more holistic approach regarding the diversification of marketable products derived from flood-based agriculture to provide additional market incentives. Through consultations and analysis of lessons learned, market access and a lack of value chain development were identified as the greatest challenges for scaling up flood-based agriculture. This is influencing the design of the future Green Climate Fund project. Overcoming small-scale and time-bound interventions. A hybrid system of flood-based agriculture with some flooding control system of low dykes could help manage risks of early/heavy floods and droughts. The highest potential lies in the closed flood zones with high dykes through the opening of sluices during seasonal floods to restore the flood retention area. However, existing projects have not yet addressed this potential. This demonstrates that for NbS interventions to achieve positive impacts at scale, small-scale (often focussed on pilots), project-based and time- bound interventions are not sufficient to address complex societal challenges. Nevertheless, partnerships between related interventions in the region contributed to institutional and policy development as well as supported greater cross-sectoral coordination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "560c9001-e24d-478e-8b8f-d1ab3a9efe42": {"__data__": {"id_": "560c9001-e24d-478e-8b8f-d1ab3a9efe42", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-5-improving-protected-and-conserved", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN WCPA Technical Note Series No. 5 IMPROVING PROTECTED AND CONSERVED AREA MANAGEMENT TO SAFEGUARD ECOLOGICAL INTEGRITY AND MINIMISE ZOONOTIC DISEASE RISK", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-5-improving-protected-and-conserved", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4131068964f47b309e7a6b36d90fad6878dca47694359be53826354ae9efcef5"}, "2": {"node_id": "754e1858-79b6-4d05-9444-4dfde7b26303", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-5-improving-protected-and-conserved", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d1e292e1b3f8934c442c1a80b8f7068c37d2c8536fad8e1bb69df7006d7f375a"}}, "hash": "c22f9c99b82ee33dec1918e7ee156a4aa4824862be333524b099cea9c3ec8d61", "text": "17 3.3 Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management Location: Gulf of Oristano, Sardinia, Italy Main implementing organisation: MEDSEA Mediterranean Sea and Coast Foundation Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 1 (solution that makes better use of existing natural and protected ecosystems) Case overview: The Gulf of Oristano is home to a number of freshwater and coastal wetlands.

The main economic activities in the region include artisanal fishing, agriculture and tourism. The proposed NbS intervention focussed on creating an integrated management model offering a long-term management strategy for the coastal wetlands found in the Gulf of Oristano \u2013 a new regional park. It contributed to balancing social and environmental needs and paved the way to recognise the economic and cultural potential of the wetlands. Since the implementation of activities is still ongoing, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment was used Figure 7: Area archeologica di tharros, San Giovanni di Sinis, Cabras, Italy (\u00a9 L\u00e9onard Cotte, Unsplash) 18 to identify entry points to strengthen the NbS intervention. This analysis was carried out by the UNEP Regional Activity Centre for Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP/RAC) of the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) of the UN Environment Programme and recommendations published in a report.[18] Table 4: Characteristics and benefits of the Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Adequate adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status Implementation of the NbS intervention is ongoing. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped identify the key societal challenges that needed addressing. These management plans also provided insights into human activities in the region, such as aquaculture and fishing. General information on drivers and responses of the identified societal challenges was gathered; however, there was no data specific to the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. An area for improvement identified as part of the self- assessment relates to strengthening the links to human wellbeing outcomes. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The aim of the intervention was to overcome fragmentation between the various wetland ecosystems in the Gulf of Oristano. The collaboration established among 11 municipalities through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract helped advance coordination, including across sectors. Further, interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems fed into the design of the intervention and considered various activities, including fishing, flood risk management, agriculture and tourism among others. Vulnerability and risk maps were developed. However, it was recommended that additional data be gathered to understand risks across the catchment and better define the adaptation and resilience actions to climate change, including related to connectivity between wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped understand the current state of wetland ecosystems and biodiversity in the region. Regular monitoring is 19 ecosystem integrity ensured through an integrated information system, the Oristano Wetland Observatory. In addition, the implementation of a Wetland Index is planned. Options to enhance integrity of the wetland ecosystems were implemented. These included the restoration of ecological connections, creation of buffer zones and preservation of native habitats. Key biodiversity outcomes: \uf0b7 Strengthened conservation of coastal and marine habitats; \uf0b7 Reinforced resilience to climate change impacts; \uf0b7 Reduced water consumption, abstraction, pollution and contamination. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable This criterion turned out to be the weakest for this NbS intervention. No specific cost-effectiveness study was conducted. Cost-benefit analyses and consideration of alternatives were conducted only for a limited number of the wetlands found in the Gulf of Oristano. The long-term resourcing of the NbS was partially secured through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract. Additional resourcing is expected through the new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 as well as through the new funds from the Recovery and Resilience Plan that is currently being developed. Moreover, the institution of a new protected area (regional park) will be an instrument to attract new funds and ensure the ongoing management of wetlands. A full economic analysis was suggested as a priority action going forward to secure the continuity and sustainability of the NbS intervention.

Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits A basic analysis of the rights, usage of and access to land and resources was done. It revealed that the regional government owns the wetlands, while surrounding areas are either under public or private ownership. Concessions are given to fisher cooperatives. The results of the self-assessment revealed a major shortcoming in agreeing limits of trade-offs and related safeguards. This aspect was included as a priority action moving forward. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based The Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract defined guidelines and actions that steered the definition of intended outcomes and actions and informed 20 on evidence monitoring and evaluation of the intervention. The Integrated Information System developed as part of the initiative provided uniform and regular data on the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. The collected information will be used for regular monitoring over time. However, no concrete plan of how the monitoring may trigger an adaptive management response was prepared. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract is an important document supporting the implementation of integrated, coordinated and collaborative approaches at scale. The Contract is an important legal instrument as it reinforces the commitment towards joint policy action to overcome fragmentation of coastal wetlands management, looking towards the establishment of a new regional protected area, which is the first aim of the Action Plan attached to the Contract. It provides the foundation for NbS actions in the Gulf of Oristano. In addition, national and global targets were key reference points for the design of the NbS intervention and Ramsar information sheets were updated for the six Ramsar sites. A new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 is under preparation by the regional government. Steps will be taken to integrate the results of the NbS intervention into the strategy to promote its long-term continuity. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Defining priority and corrective actions to strengthen the intervention. An analysis of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 indicators that have been insufficiently or only partially addressed helped to make recommendations for improvement and to identify concrete corrective actions to strengthen the implementation of the NbS intervention.[18] This demonstrates how the self-assessment can be used to strengthen the design and implementation of NbS interventions. Strong legal basis. The adoption of the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract by the 11 municipalities provided an important legal basis and framework to advance integrated management of six wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. It provided strategies and actions that support ongoing efforts toward the establishment of a new regional park. 3.4 Sustainable aquaculture and innovative seaweed farming in Zanzibar Location: Zanzibar, Tanzania Main implementing organisation: International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Other implementing organisation: Ecosystem-based Aquaculture Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Commission on Ecosystem Management (IUCN CEM) Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 2 (solution for sustainable management of restored and managed ecosystems, including innovative land-use planning protocols) 21 Case overview: Since 1990, Zanzibar has become a primary seaweed producer in Africa. Seaweed farming activities are usually small-scale and carried out in the intertidal zones largely in marine conservation areas, near mangroves and coral reefs. Eighty-eight per cent of seaweed farmers are women, making this an important activity to elevate their economic status and role in the community.[19] Climate change, the absence of producer associations, difficulties in accessing international markets and insufficient protection of coastal ecosystems have contributed to a decline in the production of higher-valued seaweeds. While the co-management approach applied in Zanzibar aims to protect coastal ecosystems and habitats, enhance artisanal fisheries and mariculture, shortcomings in the management remain.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f3df73e-7d25-4c25-ac93-137042196784": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f3df73e-7d25-4c25-ac93-137042196784", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-5-improving-protected-and-conserved", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN WCPA Technical Note Series No. 5 IMPROVING PROTECTED AND CONSERVED AREA MANAGEMENT TO SAFEGUARD ECOLOGICAL INTEGRITY AND MINIMISE ZOONOTIC DISEASE RISK", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-5-improving-protected-and-conserved", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "02dca55b31d13deac84d353774fa07d37b4a1f91eeb60619ae20b26bcd8f9e38"}, "2": {"node_id": "50df1954-a66d-4b3f-9e65-bcee7854d20a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-5-improving-protected-and-conserved", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "091ab5377536598a1c54bff7ea5b34eb22a4b4a51b02d2d36e4d7c1ba96a58e9"}}, "hash": "7cbe98ec97c3fe9665d6a749187606a82e97243a6d2998899ba3fc92d83ff754", "text": "New approaches to aquaculture and marine conservation have emerged only recently (in terms of concrete projects since 2014), with the case in Zanzibar serving as a first attempt to test the level of adherence of seaweed farming with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39.

It should also be noted that the self-assessment was carried out as a desk review. Further, means of verification were not always available, as data relating to certain indicators were not gathered. To conduct a more comprehensive assessment, local stakeholders should be involved as key informants. Nevertheless, the self-assessment provided insights into areas for improvement as to how interventions are designed, implemented and monitored. It also provided insights into knowledge and data gaps, which prompted critical questions and corrective actions that need to be addressed going forward. Intervention status Initial activities are completed. Future actions, research and knowledge needs are being assessed. Figure 8: Women working in seaweed farms in Pemba, Zantibar (\u00a9 R. le Gouvello) 22 Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges The societal challenges were identified, documented and prioritised through a theory of change exercise. This included a stakeholder workshop and engagement with local authorities to verify the information. Several studies provided insights into the positive outcomes of mariculture and seaweed farming, which included gender equality, economic revenues provided to women and the consequences on their life, including increased autonomy, empowerment and role in the communities. Although there was an understanding of the internal and external risks of the intervention, the SWOT analysis carried out for the Zanzibar case showed that a number of weaknesses and threats have not yet been addressed. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The application of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) ensured a recognition of interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems. A more holistic approach should be applied in future interventions to take into account the impact of value chains and access to markets for local livelihoods. Some synergies across sectors were identified. However, since the theory of change exercise was not completed due to time constraints, complementary interventions were not integrated fully into the design of the intervention. It was recommended to work with stakeholders to complete this exercise and achieve synergies for future interventions, especially between aquaculture, marine conservation and other relevant sectors. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. The analysis of the biodiversity benefits achieved through this intervention were largely based on a desk review of existing literature and information rather than a specific assessment, monitoring framework or thorough and collective effort with key informants and stakeholders. As was highlighted in a recent study published by IUCN, criterion 3 is the most difficult to achieve for seaweed farming and aquaculture.[19] There is a clear need to establish measures to reduce, control and mitigate impacts on biodiversity. Moreover, better documentation of the ecological state of the ecosystem, ecosystem connectivity and assessment of impacts is required. In this regard, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is an important tool to call attention to these issues and helps improve interventions that would otherwise cause harm to coastal and marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable Seaweed farming is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market. The intervention did not carry out a global value chain assessment or detailed 23 assessment of climate change impacts. These could have provided insights into the economic feasibility and sustainability of the intervention, especially with regards to supporting the livelihoods of local women, who predominantly engage in seaweed farming. In addition, alternative scenarios and options need to be explored going forward to identify the most suitable, sustainable and economically viable solution in the specific context. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes Co-management approaches were applied in marine conservation areas. These involved the government and local communities, often with international support. They demonstrated the willingness of the Government of Zanzibar to implement blue growth strategies that are inclusive of local communities and aim to build a sustainable future. The need to further increase and improve the participation of women and aquaculture farmers in decision-making, to enhance transparency and to provide access to information, was highlighted. There are also opportunities to enhance cooperation across jurisdictional boundaries. Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. While there was a reported willingness from the Government of Zanzibar to consider relevant trade-offs, the limits of these trade-offs and associated safeguards were not clarified. Existing cost-benefit analyses have not yet considered environmental aspects that would trigger corrective action.

By completing the self-assessment under the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39, it was possible to make concrete recommendations on how to improve the balancing of trade-offs, while ensuring the sustainability of the intervention. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The Government of Zanzibar put in place a blue growth strategy, which considers the challenges of seaweed farming, including related sustainability concerns. However, there is as yet no evidence of a formal mechanism to monitor and evaluate interventions on a regular basis to determine adaptive management responses. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context Since the 1980s, the Government of Zanzibar encouraged multi-use marine protected zones, which were included in relevant sectoral laws and policies. A blue growth strategy and regulations support seaweed farming practices and the achievement of global targets. The means by which lessons learned are captured and communicated have been highlighted as an area for improvement. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) 24 Lessons learned: Taking corrective action. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 served as an important tool to reflect on Nature-based Solution design, implementation and monitoring challenges. It provided insights into areas that require corrective action, the collection of additional evidence and means of verification and involvement of local stakeholders. In this manner, the self- assessment results will inform future work on aquaculture and seaweed farming in Zanzibar (and elsewhere) and help improve intervention design, implementation and monitoring frameworks. Reviewing the understanding of the NbS criteria and indicators. Several rounds of discussions, guided by IUCN expert reviewers, were held on the rationale and means of verification provided per indicator. These revealed that the criteria were sometimes understood and interpreted differently by different people, impacting the assigned rating. This demonstrated the complexities associated with assessing whether an intervention can be considered a Nature-based Solution and the need for thorough and guided consideration of each indicator. Continued engagement. A new agenda of research and development work has emerged, including dialogues around NbS criteria and indicators with stakeholders in Zanzibar and local communities. This could contribute to a future roadmap for Zanzibar and a framework for regular self- evaluation. 25 4 Summary of results First, case studies offer important opportunities for exchange of experiences, reflection on different approaches applied in different contexts as well as lessons learned with regards to opportunities, challenges and needed corrective actions. The agreed documentation framework and resulting prototype database of case studies based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 and elements from the PANORAMA: solutions for a healthy planet case study database, greatly support the analysis and comparability of experiences by offering common and robust parameters for benchmarking interventions.5 Second, there is tremendous strength in inclusive governance and open, transparent and participatory approaches that draw on local and/or traditional knowledge, engage Indigenous people, local communities and traditionally under-represented groups, such as women and youth. As illustrated in the Guatemala and Zanzibar cases, women in particular can benefit from enhanced opportunities, social status and income generated through NbS, when the design accounts for their role and inherent gender gaps. Third, scale is an important success factor. Small-scale, time-bound, pilot and project-based interventions often fail to address the full complexity of societal challenges and rarely produce the biodiversity and human wellbeing outcomes expected from the NbS. Finally, an enabling institutional, legal and policy environment provides the backbone for the implementation of and investments in NbS by making nature an ally in addressing societal challenges. Supportive, clear and coherent legal and policy frameworks can further enhance and facilitate coordination across relevant sectors and actors as well as protect the rights of affected and vulnerable communities that benefit directly or indirectly from an intervention. 5 More reflections on the benefits of the prototype database see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions, reference [11] 26 References [1] Mace, G.M.

Case studies can be a useful tool to illustrate the value of NbS interventions. They demonstrate the elements that are essential for the successful design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of NbS and thus enable learning from experiences in different contexts. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is particular suited to document the positive contributions of NbS. Based on its science-based and widely consulted criteria and indicators, the Standard helps verify NbS applications and promotes comparability as well as a coherent and consistent framework for benchmarking interventions.

NbS emerged from this deeper understanding as a way to operationalise the Ecosystem Approach, with the primary goal of applying conservation approaches to safeguard society (see Figure 1).[1, 2, 3] Figure 1: Nature-based Solutions to address societal challenges. The seven societal challenges indicators are climate change adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk reduction, economic and social development, human health, food security, water security and environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. (\u00a9 IUCN) More recently, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 1 This IUCN definition was endorsed by IUCN\u2019s 1,400 members at the 2016 World Conservation Congress in Resolution 069; an expanded definition was recently adopted at UNEA-5.2 in the resolution entitled Nature-based Solutions for supporting sustainable development 2 Services (IPBES) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognised NbS and their role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity protection and contributions to people.[4] Moreover, the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), held in Nairobi in the first quarter of 2022, adopted a resolution on Nature-based Solutions for Supporting Sustainable Development.[5] An assessment of NbS requires a consistent and common framework that helps document the positive contributions of NbS to green economic development, ecosystem management, climate change and other societally desirable outcomes. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is a valuable tool to verify a range of NbS applications. [6] The eight criteria (see Figure 2) and 28 indicators of the Standard provide clear, science-based and widely consulted parameters for benchmarking NbS interventions.[6, 7] The interdependent and non-hierarchical nature of its eight criteria implies that to be in adherence an intervention has to at least partially address each criterion. As a result, inadequacy in just one criterion means that the intervention in question is not in adherence with the Standard and therefore cannot be verified as an NbS. Figure 2: The eight criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 (\u00a9 IUCN) Adherence with the Standard means that the NbS action sufficiently addresses critical environmental, social and economic dimensions (aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)), legal and policy considerations, inclusive governance and participation aspects. Due to its compatibility with the ISEAL Alliance Code of Good Practice, the Standard provides the necessary focus on achieving impact at scale, preventing misuse and applying safeguards for the verification and/or subsequent improvement of interventions to be considered NbS. The process-oriented quality of the Standard also provides additional value for analysing and extracting key lessons learned from case studies. It allows reflection on and increases understanding of challenges and opportunities, differentiates between strong and weak NbS interventions, and provides room for corrective and adaptive management and learning throughout the intervention cycle. 3 The international case studies presented here provide insights into particular success factors and challenges for NbS interventions and, thus, promote and enhance uptake, implementation and financing of NbS. Further, they support an effort to build a prototype database of NbS cases using the Standard as a lens through which to understand verification and lessons learned. 4 2 Methodology The prototype database of NbS cases was conceived through an agreed documentation framework, the selection of illustrative international case studies, and the analysis and presentation of five international case studies in accordance with the documentation framework. Inclusivity and gender considerations were given particular attention and wherever possible, disaggregated data is provided. By highlighting the inclusion of different knowledge systems and participation in decision-making of those affected by NbS interventions (including Indigenous peoples and local communities, women and youth), the case studies demonstrate the critical importance of inclusive governance for the success of an NbS intervention. They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f63b097d-b937-41f2-a7c0-ebe58295af1e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f63b097d-b937-41f2-a7c0-ebe58295af1e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-4-nature-based-covid-19-recovery", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN WCPA Technical Note Series No. 4 NATURE-BASED COVID-19 RECOVERY: INVESTING IN PROTECTED AND CONSERVED AREAS FOR PLANETARY HEALTH", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-4-nature-based-covid-19-recovery", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1db9cc51e06979faac5dd463a4b36f79134980990a025a075d633965d1948d9a"}, "2": {"node_id": "3af4078b-a2d0-4668-8bbf-90de93b70348", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-4-nature-based-covid-19-recovery", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe773b8c8f47bbac44b6b6bb9c258c1f3b399885dd3aff9c6282921533012c3c"}}, "hash": "9ab5a195122aefa58f05a9df752a77fa04d83799fb5aaedd3d8c4ea982e4cf9f", "text": "They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.

To facilitate this, a combined template \u2013 the documentation framework \u2013 was developed to ensure that the required information would be collected and collated. In order to ensure this framework was complementary with the most relevant databases, a mapping of NbS resources from the EU project NetworkNature was utilised (not yet publicly available).[10] Subsequently, relevant information from the case studies related to the documentation framework was gathered. The case study documentation framework captures key information about each of the case studies. It was designed to combine inputs from the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39 and the information required by the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database to help classify each of the case studies (see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions[11]). 5 2.2 Case study selection and documentation The case study selection process focussed on identifying and agreeing on the five most relevant international case studies. It was agreed that the selected cases should provide a good representation across societal challenges, ecosystems and sectors. The initial longlist of international case studies was drawn from cases that had already undergone a full assessment with the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39. In accordance with the classification discussed in Section 2 of the CCICED Special Policy Study Report on \u201cValue Assessment of Nature- based Solutions\u201d, discussions with the Special Policy Study team and the availability of sufficient qualitative and quantitative information, five case studies were selected, analysed and documented. The results can be found below and on the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database.[12] Identify priority databases \u2022 Use NetworkNature mapping to identify three priority databases (e.g. PANORAMA) Extract documentation framework \u2022 Collect the documentation required for PANORAMA, finding gender disaggregated data where possible \u2022 In addition, gather gender relevant data inspired by the questions supplied by the CCICED Toolkit on Gender Equality and Environmental Sustainability Combine into standardized template \u2022 Combine these frameworks to create an overarching template for the selected case studies.

An increase in the number of coastal flooding events and overwashing occurring several times per year, exacerbated by sea level rise and climate change, established that the existing shingle bank was insufficient to protect against floods. This posed significant actual and potential risks to life and caused damage to property and infrastructure. Additionally, coastal squeeze caused losses of coastal habitat. In response, the Environment Agency of the United Kingdom delivered a GBP 27 million project to realign the defences inland, providing significantly improved flood defences to allow for managed flooding. The intervention created 300 hectares of habitat (183 of which is intertidal, including mudflat, salt marsh and transitional grassland), protection of more than 300 homes, road infrastructure and a wastewater treatment plant and a boom to local tourism and recreation, with 22,000 visitors each year. The main positive impacts of the Figure 5: Aerial view of the intervention area taken in September 2013 (\u00a9 Environment Agency of the United Kingdom) 8 Medmerry managed coastal realignment include improved flood risk management, creation of wildlife habitats, enhanced landscape quality and provision of recreational facilities. Table 2: Characteristics and benefits of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Strong adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status All major NbS restoration activities have been completed and monitored. The focus is now on the continuous sustainable management of the intervention area. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges At the project planning stage, local communities, government representatives and statutory organisations were involved in the development of a vision for Medmerry, highlighting a wide range of impacts, including societal and environmental. The vision exercise highlighted disaster risk reduction, especially flooding, as a major priority. Additionally, environmental assessment data of flood events (the most serious recent event before the start of the project occurred in 2008 and caused over GBP 5 million in economic damage and required evacuation due to risk of life[14]), flood risk mapping and modelling confirmed flooding as the main societal challenge. These assessments were based on global best practices. Impacts of climate change were found to be an exacerbating factor. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale During the planning phase, a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out and a full risk register developed. To achieve flood reduction and environmental improvement, 200 miles of the UK coast were assessed to determine the most promising opportunities for NbS, considering landscape, impacts on people and surrounding habitats. In addition, wider impacts across the region were assessed in accordance with the National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England, including people, businesses, infrastructure and environments. While the coastal realignment provided many new business opportunities, these were not considered in depth during the planning phase. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The expected impacts on the ecosystems in the intervention areas were captured in an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). These included mitigation measures for any risks to biodiversity during construction. For 9 instance, water voles were translocated prior to the start of the works.

Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes The project placed particular emphasis on stakeholder engagement and participation of local communities in all phases of the project. This included proactively providing information about the benefits of the coastal realignment, gaining widespread support for the intervention and seeking community views and inputs. A comprehensive stakeholder analysis allowed a mapping of how best to engage with the different stakeholders. The Medmerry Stakeholder Advisory Group was established, made up of key individuals of the local community, including Parish Councils, local businesses and residents most affected by the coastal realignment. The Advisory Group helped shape the 10 design of the project and met regularly to discuss any issues and concerns. Although a complaints procedure was in place, which enabled affected individuals to raise concerns through an independent ombudsman, more could have been done to ease the associated bureaucratic burden. The active and intentional involvement of the local community and subsequent support generated, contributed significantly to the success of the project. [15] Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits The costs and benefits of the NbS intervention were mapped in line with UK government assessment criteria and included the surrounding areas of the intervention site (landscape level). Annual meetings with stakeholders ensured that the NbS intervention provided the expected benefits. Public access (footpaths, cycle paths and bridleway) to the newly established nature reserve was enhanced and recreational areas provided, while maintaining a balance between recreational activities and undisturbed conservation areas. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The expected benefits were documented in the planning phase and baselines established. These informed the ongoing monitoring of NbS impacts. Immediately after project completion, a five-year monitoring programme was implemented. Annual reports summarised findings and lessons learned, which were shared and discussed with local stakeholders, external consultants, academia and risk management authorities in south England. Approaches to project planning and implementation were adjusted as needed. For instance, the approach applied to engaging the local community was adapted based on early experiences and analysis of challenges and barriers. [15] Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context While lessons learned have been captured in annual reports and through the monitoring framework, these have only been shared with a limited audience. The main benefits that have been communicated relate to reduced flood risk and created habitat. The success of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment along with other NbS interventions informed the organisational national strategy and increased the focus on NbS nationally. The project was characterised by comprehensively considering climate change and biodiversity throughout the design, implementation and monitoring phases. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Participatory and collaborative approaches. Inclusive governance and collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, especially the local community, ensured effective assessment of societal challenges and priorities in the given context, increased understanding and acceptability of the proposed solution and enabled effective planning, implementation and maintenance/management of the NbS intervention, with a possibility for creative problem-solving. 11 Transparency.

The negative impacts caused by increased flood risk also caused transboundary challenges between Vietnam and Cambodia. Based on documented farmer knowledge and experience, IUCN promoted and improved locally-practiced, flood-based (wetland) agriculture and livelihood models in the Vietnamese provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap and Long An. Flood-based livelihoods were encouraged as a financially viable, low risk alternative to triple rice cropping, to enhance economic and social resilience as well as to conserve and restore the biodiversity found in Mekong Delta freshwater wetlands/floodplains. The NbS intervention considered three systems - floating rice systems, lotus farming systems and rice aquaculture systems. Due to increasing weather extremes, hybrid solutions were also explored (combination of dykes and floodplains), to enable controlled flooding and adaptive approaches to overcome risks of drought and to manage the arrival and recession of floods. While the main focus of the NbS intervention was on farmers adding an additional flood-based crop in open flood (no dyke) and flood control zones (low dyke), the utility of replacing low value irrigated crops with higher value flood-based crops in closed control zones (high dyke) was also considered. In order to achieve the full set of biodiversity and human wellbeing benefits derived from moderated floods, interventions need to be scaled up across the entirety of the Mekong Delta floodplain. To do so, a follow-up project is currently being developed under the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Table 3: Characteristics and benefits of flood-based agriculture in the upper Mekong delta floodplain based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Adequate adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status The concept of flood-based agriculture as an NbS emerged as part of a larger Programme of Work starting with the 2013 Mekong Delta Plan, which leveraged a number of projects that explored its feasibility. Initial studies of farmer initiatives and proof of concept in IUCN pilot sites were completed between 2015 and 2018. These fed into the design and implementation of similar projects in the region (e.g. those by the World Bank, IUCN and FAO).

Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges The major flood in 2011 demonstrated the increased damages incurred due to loss of floodplains/retention areas in the Upper Mekong Delta caused by an intensification of rice farming. A debate over the sustainability of intensified rice farming policies that use poldering emerged.

Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The design of the intervention recognised the challenges across the Mekong Delta, which were also captured in the 2013 Mekong Delta Plan.

The economic component was not sufficiently considered in the design of the initial intervention, though marketable products were identified. While initial IUCN pilot interventions remained limited and small-scale, collaboration across similar projects and recent policy developments currently support the development of a large-scale intervention across the 1.4 million ha of the Upper Mekong Delta floodplain. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The focus of the intervention was on modified wetland ecosystems (formally zoned as agricultural land under private tenure) and thus excluded practices carried out in protected and conserved areas. In light of the extensive scientific evidence on the risks of rice intensification, it was possible to assess the status of ecosystems as well as drivers of change and biodiversity loss. Due to the rather small scale of the IUCN pilot interventions, no concrete data or monitoring frameworks to capture the positive biodiversity outcomes were implemented. Instead, outcomes were captured in general terms, including provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural functions of the floodplain. Detailed 14 monitoring for potential, unintended adverse consequences on nature arising from the intervention was not carried out. Key investments in biodiversity outcomes[16]: \uf0b7 Investments into 450 ha of flood-based livelihoods to enhance ecosystem functions of floodplains, which resulted in the conservation or restoration of approx. 6.7 million m\u00b3 of flood retention capacity supporting aquifer recharge, the reduction in land subsidence and the conservation or restoration of aquatic habitat/biodiversity; \uf0b7 additional benefits were observed from wild fisheries, mitigation of river erosion through the re-establishment of natural hydrology of seasonal flooding and increased land fertility, including through sediment deposition due to the seasonal flooding. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable A feasibility study for a GCF proposal revealed that several hundred thousand farmers and a number of downstream towns would benefit financially from flooding if seasonal flood-based agriculture were applied. In addition, cost- benefit analyses were carried out on the profitability of flood-based crops and the cropping system as a whole in comparison to mono-rice cropping. The NbS intervention did not consider the development of clear value chains and business models, which hampered securing long-term funding sources to maintain the NbS. Instead, the intervention relied on short-term, project-based grant funding. The planned GCF project could help overcome some of these shortcomings. Key expected economic benefits[16]: \uf0b7 flood-based livelihoods have the potential to be 1.5 to five times more profitable than intensive rice cropping; \uf0b7 floating rice systems could generate around USD 6,400 per ha per year, while triple rice cropping systems generate only USD 3,100 per ha per year; \uf0b7 where farmers add a flood-based crop in open flood or flood control zones, additional income between USD 2,293 \u2013 USD 5,744 per ha per year could be generated depending on the flood-based agriculture system applied[17]; \uf0b7 in open flood and flood control zones, no investments need to be made towards flood management, while in closed control zones (high dykes), sluice coordination by the local government is necessary; flood-based agriculture could serve as an incentive to stop conversion of low dykes to high dykes, which in turn helps preserve the floodplains in the Upper Mekong Delta. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and No grievance mechanism was put in place for the IUCN pilot NbS interventions, due to the small-scale and limited number of farmers involved. A grievance 15 empowering governance processes mechanism was put in place for the larger scale World Bank ICRSL project implementation as was required by World Bank safeguard policies. A stakeholder analysis provided insights into which stakeholders were directly and indirectly affected. Stakeholders provided inputs into the regional vision and plans for phasing out intensive triple rice crop farming. In addition, since farmers have private tenure over their land, farmer participation in decision-making and ownership of such decisions was essential. National Resolution 120 entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d and Decision 593 defined the roles and responsibilities of different actors in decision-making processes and recognised the need for policy reform rather than small-scale community- based solutions.

However, it is not yet operational. This constitutes a shortcoming for the NbS intervention. For the World Bank ICRSL project, social and environmental safeguards were put in place. However, the limits of trade-offs were not discussed in detail. In some areas a hybrid model was used, with low dykes controlling the timing of flood arrival/recession to support double-cropping and flood-based cropping (instead of the traditional third rice crop). In the case of lotus farming systems, flood-based agriculture enabled diversification of activities, including fish raising, ecotourism and recreational opportunities. In the future, value chains, especially for rice production, will need to be considered in more detail to support the new flood-based agriculture model and gain support from rice exporters. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence While National Resolution 120 provided an enabling policy environment for flood-based agriculture, examples of interventions that ran counter to the resolution remained. This weakened the impact of the NbS intervention and underlined that monitoring needed to be improved. There is no evidence as to whether there has been a government response to adapt the approach. Limited technical and institutional capacity was identified as a key factor. Lessons learned from the IUCN pilots and experiences from other similar initiatives are shared regularly at the Mekong Delta Development Partners Working Group and Annual Mekong Delta Forums. Further, the emerging interest from academia in flood-based agriculture is already producing relevant data and information. Additionally, the preparation of the planned Green Climate Fund 16 proposal considers the above challenges. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The NbS intervention built on the 2013 Mekong Delta Plan, which recommended high-value double rice cropping in combination with seasonal flood-based agriculture/aquaculture to manage flood risks. This influenced the promulgation of National Resolution 120, entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d; this policy was adopted in November 2017 and stipulates that nature-based adaptation models should be selected that are environmentally sound and achieve sustainable development based on \u2018actively living with the floods\u2019. The Mekong Delta Forum provided a space for knowledge exchange on lessons learned and endorsement of a common vision for the Upper Mekong Delta, including a move to more natural land and water uses. An IUCN-led Green Climate Fund proposal is under preparation to ensure continuity of efforts and to address transboundary challenges. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Legal and regulatory framework. Supportive legal and policy frameworks opened up opportunities for a change in land use and facilitated partnerships across related initiatives for the adoption of flood-based agriculture in open flood and flood control zones. A need for market incentives. The NbS intervention in Vietnam could have profited from a more holistic approach regarding the diversification of marketable products derived from flood-based agriculture to provide additional market incentives. Through consultations and analysis of lessons learned, market access and a lack of value chain development were identified as the greatest challenges for scaling up flood-based agriculture. This is influencing the design of the future Green Climate Fund project. Overcoming small-scale and time-bound interventions. A hybrid system of flood-based agriculture with some flooding control system of low dykes could help manage risks of early/heavy floods and droughts. The highest potential lies in the closed flood zones with high dykes through the opening of sluices during seasonal floods to restore the flood retention area. However, existing projects have not yet addressed this potential. This demonstrates that for NbS interventions to achieve positive impacts at scale, small-scale (often focussed on pilots), project-based and time- bound interventions are not sufficient to address complex societal challenges. Nevertheless, partnerships between related interventions in the region contributed to institutional and policy development as well as supported greater cross-sectoral coordination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c6c6ed3-ad9b-470f-a641-ec1272a6f021": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c6c6ed3-ad9b-470f-a641-ec1272a6f021", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-4-nature-based-covid-19-recovery", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN WCPA Technical Note Series No. 4 NATURE-BASED COVID-19 RECOVERY: INVESTING IN PROTECTED AND CONSERVED AREAS FOR PLANETARY HEALTH", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-4-nature-based-covid-19-recovery", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "86b2078c68099ac94b827938ecda824766fb1e7ad3c2ec1a7411e8873a98fc0a"}, "2": {"node_id": "8e73559f-d00c-43e1-a593-1ee3f7bfe097", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-4-nature-based-covid-19-recovery", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37472a2022fef087fed71f3036afb1c7756a04cc5dc37478f77362aa7473a81a"}}, "hash": "1c4c45486a45cea2b9563b09b8da77a30ab0eac7a43ac4c86d3ebb8c6b257f95", "text": "17 3.3 Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management Location: Gulf of Oristano, Sardinia, Italy Main implementing organisation: MEDSEA Mediterranean Sea and Coast Foundation Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 1 (solution that makes better use of existing natural and protected ecosystems) Case overview: The Gulf of Oristano is home to a number of freshwater and coastal wetlands.

The proposed NbS intervention focussed on creating an integrated management model offering a long-term management strategy for the coastal wetlands found in the Gulf of Oristano \u2013 a new regional park. It contributed to balancing social and environmental needs and paved the way to recognise the economic and cultural potential of the wetlands. Since the implementation of activities is still ongoing, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment was used Figure 7: Area archeologica di tharros, San Giovanni di Sinis, Cabras, Italy (\u00a9 L\u00e9onard Cotte, Unsplash) 18 to identify entry points to strengthen the NbS intervention. This analysis was carried out by the UNEP Regional Activity Centre for Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP/RAC) of the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) of the UN Environment Programme and recommendations published in a report.[18] Table 4: Characteristics and benefits of the Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Adequate adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status Implementation of the NbS intervention is ongoing. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped identify the key societal challenges that needed addressing. These management plans also provided insights into human activities in the region, such as aquaculture and fishing. General information on drivers and responses of the identified societal challenges was gathered; however, there was no data specific to the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. An area for improvement identified as part of the self- assessment relates to strengthening the links to human wellbeing outcomes. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The aim of the intervention was to overcome fragmentation between the various wetland ecosystems in the Gulf of Oristano. The collaboration established among 11 municipalities through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract helped advance coordination, including across sectors. Further, interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems fed into the design of the intervention and considered various activities, including fishing, flood risk management, agriculture and tourism among others. Vulnerability and risk maps were developed. However, it was recommended that additional data be gathered to understand risks across the catchment and better define the adaptation and resilience actions to climate change, including related to connectivity between wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped understand the current state of wetland ecosystems and biodiversity in the region. Regular monitoring is 19 ecosystem integrity ensured through an integrated information system, the Oristano Wetland Observatory. In addition, the implementation of a Wetland Index is planned. Options to enhance integrity of the wetland ecosystems were implemented. These included the restoration of ecological connections, creation of buffer zones and preservation of native habitats. Key biodiversity outcomes: \uf0b7 Strengthened conservation of coastal and marine habitats; \uf0b7 Reinforced resilience to climate change impacts; \uf0b7 Reduced water consumption, abstraction, pollution and contamination. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable This criterion turned out to be the weakest for this NbS intervention. No specific cost-effectiveness study was conducted. Cost-benefit analyses and consideration of alternatives were conducted only for a limited number of the wetlands found in the Gulf of Oristano. The long-term resourcing of the NbS was partially secured through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract. Additional resourcing is expected through the new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 as well as through the new funds from the Recovery and Resilience Plan that is currently being developed.

Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits A basic analysis of the rights, usage of and access to land and resources was done. It revealed that the regional government owns the wetlands, while surrounding areas are either under public or private ownership. Concessions are given to fisher cooperatives. The results of the self-assessment revealed a major shortcoming in agreeing limits of trade-offs and related safeguards. This aspect was included as a priority action moving forward. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based The Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract defined guidelines and actions that steered the definition of intended outcomes and actions and informed 20 on evidence monitoring and evaluation of the intervention. The Integrated Information System developed as part of the initiative provided uniform and regular data on the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. The collected information will be used for regular monitoring over time. However, no concrete plan of how the monitoring may trigger an adaptive management response was prepared. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract is an important document supporting the implementation of integrated, coordinated and collaborative approaches at scale. The Contract is an important legal instrument as it reinforces the commitment towards joint policy action to overcome fragmentation of coastal wetlands management, looking towards the establishment of a new regional protected area, which is the first aim of the Action Plan attached to the Contract. It provides the foundation for NbS actions in the Gulf of Oristano. In addition, national and global targets were key reference points for the design of the NbS intervention and Ramsar information sheets were updated for the six Ramsar sites. A new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 is under preparation by the regional government. Steps will be taken to integrate the results of the NbS intervention into the strategy to promote its long-term continuity. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Defining priority and corrective actions to strengthen the intervention. An analysis of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 indicators that have been insufficiently or only partially addressed helped to make recommendations for improvement and to identify concrete corrective actions to strengthen the implementation of the NbS intervention.[18] This demonstrates how the self-assessment can be used to strengthen the design and implementation of NbS interventions. Strong legal basis. The adoption of the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract by the 11 municipalities provided an important legal basis and framework to advance integrated management of six wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. It provided strategies and actions that support ongoing efforts toward the establishment of a new regional park. 3.4 Sustainable aquaculture and innovative seaweed farming in Zanzibar Location: Zanzibar, Tanzania Main implementing organisation: International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Other implementing organisation: Ecosystem-based Aquaculture Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Commission on Ecosystem Management (IUCN CEM) Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 2 (solution for sustainable management of restored and managed ecosystems, including innovative land-use planning protocols) 21 Case overview: Since 1990, Zanzibar has become a primary seaweed producer in Africa. Seaweed farming activities are usually small-scale and carried out in the intertidal zones largely in marine conservation areas, near mangroves and coral reefs. Eighty-eight per cent of seaweed farmers are women, making this an important activity to elevate their economic status and role in the community.[19] Climate change, the absence of producer associations, difficulties in accessing international markets and insufficient protection of coastal ecosystems have contributed to a decline in the production of higher-valued seaweeds. While the co-management approach applied in Zanzibar aims to protect coastal ecosystems and habitats, enhance artisanal fisheries and mariculture, shortcomings in the management remain.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec2c5d7c-7384-4999-8ff4-6e218223248a": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec2c5d7c-7384-4999-8ff4-6e218223248a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-4-nature-based-covid-19-recovery", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN WCPA Technical Note Series No. 4 NATURE-BASED COVID-19 RECOVERY: INVESTING IN PROTECTED AND CONSERVED AREAS FOR PLANETARY HEALTH", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-4-nature-based-covid-19-recovery", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bfb96139d7ec3bd559218137fc77817e7d923314921be1cc2c9709d3322753ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "e8dc8670-f848-4e55-a865-aab602cea2d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-4-nature-based-covid-19-recovery", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de6b5abcd14965e066af0ad4a2747a0eab365e7ed1e2bfdf0473032d529504e5"}}, "hash": "cf82e78492786b667ac0e026180bf12594b54e330608254d8b15a0b1ad981fa9", "text": "New approaches to aquaculture and marine conservation have emerged only recently (in terms of concrete projects since 2014), with the case in Zanzibar serving as a first attempt to test the level of adherence of seaweed farming with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39.

It should also be noted that the self-assessment was carried out as a desk review. Further, means of verification were not always available, as data relating to certain indicators were not gathered. To conduct a more comprehensive assessment, local stakeholders should be involved as key informants. Nevertheless, the self-assessment provided insights into areas for improvement as to how interventions are designed, implemented and monitored. It also provided insights into knowledge and data gaps, which prompted critical questions and corrective actions that need to be addressed going forward. Intervention status Initial activities are completed. Future actions, research and knowledge needs are being assessed. Figure 8: Women working in seaweed farms in Pemba, Zantibar (\u00a9 R. le Gouvello) 22 Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges The societal challenges were identified, documented and prioritised through a theory of change exercise. This included a stakeholder workshop and engagement with local authorities to verify the information. Several studies provided insights into the positive outcomes of mariculture and seaweed farming, which included gender equality, economic revenues provided to women and the consequences on their life, including increased autonomy, empowerment and role in the communities. Although there was an understanding of the internal and external risks of the intervention, the SWOT analysis carried out for the Zanzibar case showed that a number of weaknesses and threats have not yet been addressed. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The application of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) ensured a recognition of interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems. A more holistic approach should be applied in future interventions to take into account the impact of value chains and access to markets for local livelihoods. Some synergies across sectors were identified. However, since the theory of change exercise was not completed due to time constraints, complementary interventions were not integrated fully into the design of the intervention. It was recommended to work with stakeholders to complete this exercise and achieve synergies for future interventions, especially between aquaculture, marine conservation and other relevant sectors. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. The analysis of the biodiversity benefits achieved through this intervention were largely based on a desk review of existing literature and information rather than a specific assessment, monitoring framework or thorough and collective effort with key informants and stakeholders. As was highlighted in a recent study published by IUCN, criterion 3 is the most difficult to achieve for seaweed farming and aquaculture.[19] There is a clear need to establish measures to reduce, control and mitigate impacts on biodiversity. Moreover, better documentation of the ecological state of the ecosystem, ecosystem connectivity and assessment of impacts is required. In this regard, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is an important tool to call attention to these issues and helps improve interventions that would otherwise cause harm to coastal and marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable Seaweed farming is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market. The intervention did not carry out a global value chain assessment or detailed 23 assessment of climate change impacts. These could have provided insights into the economic feasibility and sustainability of the intervention, especially with regards to supporting the livelihoods of local women, who predominantly engage in seaweed farming. In addition, alternative scenarios and options need to be explored going forward to identify the most suitable, sustainable and economically viable solution in the specific context. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes Co-management approaches were applied in marine conservation areas. These involved the government and local communities, often with international support. They demonstrated the willingness of the Government of Zanzibar to implement blue growth strategies that are inclusive of local communities and aim to build a sustainable future. The need to further increase and improve the participation of women and aquaculture farmers in decision-making, to enhance transparency and to provide access to information, was highlighted. There are also opportunities to enhance cooperation across jurisdictional boundaries. Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. While there was a reported willingness from the Government of Zanzibar to consider relevant trade-offs, the limits of these trade-offs and associated safeguards were not clarified. Existing cost-benefit analyses have not yet considered environmental aspects that would trigger corrective action.

By completing the self-assessment under the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39, it was possible to make concrete recommendations on how to improve the balancing of trade-offs, while ensuring the sustainability of the intervention. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The Government of Zanzibar put in place a blue growth strategy, which considers the challenges of seaweed farming, including related sustainability concerns. However, there is as yet no evidence of a formal mechanism to monitor and evaluate interventions on a regular basis to determine adaptive management responses. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context Since the 1980s, the Government of Zanzibar encouraged multi-use marine protected zones, which were included in relevant sectoral laws and policies. A blue growth strategy and regulations support seaweed farming practices and the achievement of global targets. The means by which lessons learned are captured and communicated have been highlighted as an area for improvement. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) 24 Lessons learned: Taking corrective action. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 served as an important tool to reflect on Nature-based Solution design, implementation and monitoring challenges. It provided insights into areas that require corrective action, the collection of additional evidence and means of verification and involvement of local stakeholders. In this manner, the self- assessment results will inform future work on aquaculture and seaweed farming in Zanzibar (and elsewhere) and help improve intervention design, implementation and monitoring frameworks. Reviewing the understanding of the NbS criteria and indicators. Several rounds of discussions, guided by IUCN expert reviewers, were held on the rationale and means of verification provided per indicator. These revealed that the criteria were sometimes understood and interpreted differently by different people, impacting the assigned rating. This demonstrated the complexities associated with assessing whether an intervention can be considered a Nature-based Solution and the need for thorough and guided consideration of each indicator. Continued engagement. A new agenda of research and development work has emerged, including dialogues around NbS criteria and indicators with stakeholders in Zanzibar and local communities. This could contribute to a future roadmap for Zanzibar and a framework for regular self- evaluation. 25 4 Summary of results First, case studies offer important opportunities for exchange of experiences, reflection on different approaches applied in different contexts as well as lessons learned with regards to opportunities, challenges and needed corrective actions. The agreed documentation framework and resulting prototype database of case studies based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 and elements from the PANORAMA: solutions for a healthy planet case study database, greatly support the analysis and comparability of experiences by offering common and robust parameters for benchmarking interventions.5 Second, there is tremendous strength in inclusive governance and open, transparent and participatory approaches that draw on local and/or traditional knowledge, engage Indigenous people, local communities and traditionally under-represented groups, such as women and youth. As illustrated in the Guatemala and Zanzibar cases, women in particular can benefit from enhanced opportunities, social status and income generated through NbS, when the design accounts for their role and inherent gender gaps. Third, scale is an important success factor. Small-scale, time-bound, pilot and project-based interventions often fail to address the full complexity of societal challenges and rarely produce the biodiversity and human wellbeing outcomes expected from the NbS. Finally, an enabling institutional, legal and policy environment provides the backbone for the implementation of and investments in NbS by making nature an ally in addressing societal challenges. Supportive, clear and coherent legal and policy frameworks can further enhance and facilitate coordination across relevant sectors and actors as well as protect the rights of affected and vulnerable communities that benefit directly or indirectly from an intervention. 5 More reflections on the benefits of the prototype database see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions, reference [11] 26 References [1] Mace, G.M.

Case studies can be a useful tool to illustrate the value of NbS interventions. They demonstrate the elements that are essential for the successful design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of NbS and thus enable learning from experiences in different contexts. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is particular suited to document the positive contributions of NbS. Based on its science-based and widely consulted criteria and indicators, the Standard helps verify NbS applications and promotes comparability as well as a coherent and consistent framework for benchmarking interventions.

NbS emerged from this deeper understanding as a way to operationalise the Ecosystem Approach, with the primary goal of applying conservation approaches to safeguard society (see Figure 1).[1, 2, 3] Figure 1: Nature-based Solutions to address societal challenges. The seven societal challenges indicators are climate change adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk reduction, economic and social development, human health, food security, water security and environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. (\u00a9 IUCN) More recently, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 1 This IUCN definition was endorsed by IUCN\u2019s 1,400 members at the 2016 World Conservation Congress in Resolution 069; an expanded definition was recently adopted at UNEA-5.2 in the resolution entitled Nature-based Solutions for supporting sustainable development 2 Services (IPBES) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognised NbS and their role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity protection and contributions to people.[4] Moreover, the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), held in Nairobi in the first quarter of 2022, adopted a resolution on Nature-based Solutions for Supporting Sustainable Development.[5] An assessment of NbS requires a consistent and common framework that helps document the positive contributions of NbS to green economic development, ecosystem management, climate change and other societally desirable outcomes. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is a valuable tool to verify a range of NbS applications. [6] The eight criteria (see Figure 2) and 28 indicators of the Standard provide clear, science-based and widely consulted parameters for benchmarking NbS interventions.[6, 7] The interdependent and non-hierarchical nature of its eight criteria implies that to be in adherence an intervention has to at least partially address each criterion. As a result, inadequacy in just one criterion means that the intervention in question is not in adherence with the Standard and therefore cannot be verified as an NbS. Figure 2: The eight criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 (\u00a9 IUCN) Adherence with the Standard means that the NbS action sufficiently addresses critical environmental, social and economic dimensions (aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)), legal and policy considerations, inclusive governance and participation aspects. Due to its compatibility with the ISEAL Alliance Code of Good Practice, the Standard provides the necessary focus on achieving impact at scale, preventing misuse and applying safeguards for the verification and/or subsequent improvement of interventions to be considered NbS. The process-oriented quality of the Standard also provides additional value for analysing and extracting key lessons learned from case studies. It allows reflection on and increases understanding of challenges and opportunities, differentiates between strong and weak NbS interventions, and provides room for corrective and adaptive management and learning throughout the intervention cycle. 3 The international case studies presented here provide insights into particular success factors and challenges for NbS interventions and, thus, promote and enhance uptake, implementation and financing of NbS. Further, they support an effort to build a prototype database of NbS cases using the Standard as a lens through which to understand verification and lessons learned. 4 2 Methodology The prototype database of NbS cases was conceived through an agreed documentation framework, the selection of illustrative international case studies, and the analysis and presentation of five international case studies in accordance with the documentation framework. Inclusivity and gender considerations were given particular attention and wherever possible, disaggregated data is provided. By highlighting the inclusion of different knowledge systems and participation in decision-making of those affected by NbS interventions (including Indigenous peoples and local communities, women and youth), the case studies demonstrate the critical importance of inclusive governance for the success of an NbS intervention. They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "adeeafc9-662d-48fb-a9d3-f9cd5334362b": {"__data__": {"id_": "adeeafc9-662d-48fb-a9d3-f9cd5334362b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-3-guidelines-conserving-connectivity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN WCPA Technical Note Series No. 3 GUIDELINES FOR CONSERVING CONNECTIVITY THROUGH ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS AND CORRIDORS", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-3-guidelines-conserving-connectivity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33f292f2c6e3e7c5b3df601e6b46839486d5a6cd4a20168406beddaf6473301e"}, "2": {"node_id": "8448121a-003e-48b3-9fe4-45e7088b829d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-3-guidelines-conserving-connectivity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1468289f3a579566465ee1a8942c0a659f63bdef09883fc286d39b30943499d"}}, "hash": "979b042a9377f1ccfa1447c86240e63b1301ab72e310858b4aebc09aa767150b", "text": "They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.

To facilitate this, a combined template \u2013 the documentation framework \u2013 was developed to ensure that the required information would be collected and collated. In order to ensure this framework was complementary with the most relevant databases, a mapping of NbS resources from the EU project NetworkNature was utilised (not yet publicly available).[10] Subsequently, relevant information from the case studies related to the documentation framework was gathered. The case study documentation framework captures key information about each of the case studies. It was designed to combine inputs from the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39 and the information required by the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database to help classify each of the case studies (see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions[11]). 5 2.2 Case study selection and documentation The case study selection process focussed on identifying and agreeing on the five most relevant international case studies. It was agreed that the selected cases should provide a good representation across societal challenges, ecosystems and sectors. The initial longlist of international case studies was drawn from cases that had already undergone a full assessment with the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39. In accordance with the classification discussed in Section 2 of the CCICED Special Policy Study Report on \u201cValue Assessment of Nature- based Solutions\u201d, discussions with the Special Policy Study team and the availability of sufficient qualitative and quantitative information, five case studies were selected, analysed and documented. The results can be found below and on the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database.[12] Identify priority databases \u2022 Use NetworkNature mapping to identify three priority databases (e.g. PANORAMA) Extract documentation framework \u2022 Collect the documentation required for PANORAMA, finding gender disaggregated data where possible \u2022 In addition, gather gender relevant data inspired by the questions supplied by the CCICED Toolkit on Gender Equality and Environmental Sustainability Combine into standardized template \u2022 Combine these frameworks to create an overarching template for the selected case studies.

An increase in the number of coastal flooding events and overwashing occurring several times per year, exacerbated by sea level rise and climate change, established that the existing shingle bank was insufficient to protect against floods. This posed significant actual and potential risks to life and caused damage to property and infrastructure. Additionally, coastal squeeze caused losses of coastal habitat. In response, the Environment Agency of the United Kingdom delivered a GBP 27 million project to realign the defences inland, providing significantly improved flood defences to allow for managed flooding. The intervention created 300 hectares of habitat (183 of which is intertidal, including mudflat, salt marsh and transitional grassland), protection of more than 300 homes, road infrastructure and a wastewater treatment plant and a boom to local tourism and recreation, with 22,000 visitors each year. The main positive impacts of the Figure 5: Aerial view of the intervention area taken in September 2013 (\u00a9 Environment Agency of the United Kingdom) 8 Medmerry managed coastal realignment include improved flood risk management, creation of wildlife habitats, enhanced landscape quality and provision of recreational facilities. Table 2: Characteristics and benefits of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Strong adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status All major NbS restoration activities have been completed and monitored. The focus is now on the continuous sustainable management of the intervention area. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges At the project planning stage, local communities, government representatives and statutory organisations were involved in the development of a vision for Medmerry, highlighting a wide range of impacts, including societal and environmental. The vision exercise highlighted disaster risk reduction, especially flooding, as a major priority. Additionally, environmental assessment data of flood events (the most serious recent event before the start of the project occurred in 2008 and caused over GBP 5 million in economic damage and required evacuation due to risk of life[14]), flood risk mapping and modelling confirmed flooding as the main societal challenge. These assessments were based on global best practices. Impacts of climate change were found to be an exacerbating factor. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale During the planning phase, a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out and a full risk register developed. To achieve flood reduction and environmental improvement, 200 miles of the UK coast were assessed to determine the most promising opportunities for NbS, considering landscape, impacts on people and surrounding habitats. In addition, wider impacts across the region were assessed in accordance with the National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England, including people, businesses, infrastructure and environments. While the coastal realignment provided many new business opportunities, these were not considered in depth during the planning phase. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The expected impacts on the ecosystems in the intervention areas were captured in an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).

Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes The project placed particular emphasis on stakeholder engagement and participation of local communities in all phases of the project. This included proactively providing information about the benefits of the coastal realignment, gaining widespread support for the intervention and seeking community views and inputs. A comprehensive stakeholder analysis allowed a mapping of how best to engage with the different stakeholders. The Medmerry Stakeholder Advisory Group was established, made up of key individuals of the local community, including Parish Councils, local businesses and residents most affected by the coastal realignment. The Advisory Group helped shape the 10 design of the project and met regularly to discuss any issues and concerns. Although a complaints procedure was in place, which enabled affected individuals to raise concerns through an independent ombudsman, more could have been done to ease the associated bureaucratic burden. The active and intentional involvement of the local community and subsequent support generated, contributed significantly to the success of the project. [15] Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits The costs and benefits of the NbS intervention were mapped in line with UK government assessment criteria and included the surrounding areas of the intervention site (landscape level). Annual meetings with stakeholders ensured that the NbS intervention provided the expected benefits. Public access (footpaths, cycle paths and bridleway) to the newly established nature reserve was enhanced and recreational areas provided, while maintaining a balance between recreational activities and undisturbed conservation areas. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The expected benefits were documented in the planning phase and baselines established. These informed the ongoing monitoring of NbS impacts. Immediately after project completion, a five-year monitoring programme was implemented. Annual reports summarised findings and lessons learned, which were shared and discussed with local stakeholders, external consultants, academia and risk management authorities in south England. Approaches to project planning and implementation were adjusted as needed. For instance, the approach applied to engaging the local community was adapted based on early experiences and analysis of challenges and barriers. [15] Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context While lessons learned have been captured in annual reports and through the monitoring framework, these have only been shared with a limited audience. The main benefits that have been communicated relate to reduced flood risk and created habitat. The success of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment along with other NbS interventions informed the organisational national strategy and increased the focus on NbS nationally. The project was characterised by comprehensively considering climate change and biodiversity throughout the design, implementation and monitoring phases.

The negative impacts caused by increased flood risk also caused transboundary challenges between Vietnam and Cambodia. Based on documented farmer knowledge and experience, IUCN promoted and improved locally-practiced, flood-based (wetland) agriculture and livelihood models in the Vietnamese provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap and Long An. Flood-based livelihoods were encouraged as a financially viable, low risk alternative to triple rice cropping, to enhance economic and social resilience as well as to conserve and restore the biodiversity found in Mekong Delta freshwater wetlands/floodplains. The NbS intervention considered three systems - floating rice systems, lotus farming systems and rice aquaculture systems. Due to increasing weather extremes, hybrid solutions were also explored (combination of dykes and floodplains), to enable controlled flooding and adaptive approaches to overcome risks of drought and to manage the arrival and recession of floods. While the main focus of the NbS intervention was on farmers adding an additional flood-based crop in open flood (no dyke) and flood control zones (low dyke), the utility of replacing low value irrigated crops with higher value flood-based crops in closed control zones (high dyke) was also considered. In order to achieve the full set of biodiversity and human wellbeing benefits derived from moderated floods, interventions need to be scaled up across the entirety of the Mekong Delta floodplain. To do so, a follow-up project is currently being developed under the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

Initial studies of farmer initiatives and proof of concept in IUCN pilot sites were completed between 2015 and 2018. These fed into the design and implementation of similar projects in the region (e.g. those by the World Bank, IUCN and FAO).

The economic component was not sufficiently considered in the design of the initial intervention, though marketable products were identified. While initial IUCN pilot interventions remained limited and small-scale, collaboration across similar projects and recent policy developments currently support the development of a large-scale intervention across the 1.4 million ha of the Upper Mekong Delta floodplain. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The focus of the intervention was on modified wetland ecosystems (formally zoned as agricultural land under private tenure) and thus excluded practices carried out in protected and conserved areas. In light of the extensive scientific evidence on the risks of rice intensification, it was possible to assess the status of ecosystems as well as drivers of change and biodiversity loss. Due to the rather small scale of the IUCN pilot interventions, no concrete data or monitoring frameworks to capture the positive biodiversity outcomes were implemented. Instead, outcomes were captured in general terms, including provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural functions of the floodplain. Detailed 14 monitoring for potential, unintended adverse consequences on nature arising from the intervention was not carried out. Key investments in biodiversity outcomes[16]: \uf0b7 Investments into 450 ha of flood-based livelihoods to enhance ecosystem functions of floodplains, which resulted in the conservation or restoration of approx. 6.7 million m\u00b3 of flood retention capacity supporting aquifer recharge, the reduction in land subsidence and the conservation or restoration of aquatic habitat/biodiversity; \uf0b7 additional benefits were observed from wild fisheries, mitigation of river erosion through the re-establishment of natural hydrology of seasonal flooding and increased land fertility, including through sediment deposition due to the seasonal flooding. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable A feasibility study for a GCF proposal revealed that several hundred thousand farmers and a number of downstream towns would benefit financially from flooding if seasonal flood-based agriculture were applied. In addition, cost- benefit analyses were carried out on the profitability of flood-based crops and the cropping system as a whole in comparison to mono-rice cropping. The NbS intervention did not consider the development of clear value chains and business models, which hampered securing long-term funding sources to maintain the NbS. Instead, the intervention relied on short-term, project-based grant funding. The planned GCF project could help overcome some of these shortcomings. Key expected economic benefits[16]: \uf0b7 flood-based livelihoods have the potential to be 1.5 to five times more profitable than intensive rice cropping; \uf0b7 floating rice systems could generate around USD 6,400 per ha per year, while triple rice cropping systems generate only USD 3,100 per ha per year; \uf0b7 where farmers add a flood-based crop in open flood or flood control zones, additional income between USD 2,293 \u2013 USD 5,744 per ha per year could be generated depending on the flood-based agriculture system applied[17]; \uf0b7 in open flood and flood control zones, no investments need to be made towards flood management, while in closed control zones (high dykes), sluice coordination by the local government is necessary; flood-based agriculture could serve as an incentive to stop conversion of low dykes to high dykes, which in turn helps preserve the floodplains in the Upper Mekong Delta. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and No grievance mechanism was put in place for the IUCN pilot NbS interventions, due to the small-scale and limited number of farmers involved. A grievance 15 empowering governance processes mechanism was put in place for the larger scale World Bank ICRSL project implementation as was required by World Bank safeguard policies. A stakeholder analysis provided insights into which stakeholders were directly and indirectly affected. Stakeholders provided inputs into the regional vision and plans for phasing out intensive triple rice crop farming. In addition, since farmers have private tenure over their land, farmer participation in decision-making and ownership of such decisions was essential.

However, it is not yet operational. This constitutes a shortcoming for the NbS intervention. For the World Bank ICRSL project, social and environmental safeguards were put in place. However, the limits of trade-offs were not discussed in detail. In some areas a hybrid model was used, with low dykes controlling the timing of flood arrival/recession to support double-cropping and flood-based cropping (instead of the traditional third rice crop). In the case of lotus farming systems, flood-based agriculture enabled diversification of activities, including fish raising, ecotourism and recreational opportunities. In the future, value chains, especially for rice production, will need to be considered in more detail to support the new flood-based agriculture model and gain support from rice exporters. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence While National Resolution 120 provided an enabling policy environment for flood-based agriculture, examples of interventions that ran counter to the resolution remained. This weakened the impact of the NbS intervention and underlined that monitoring needed to be improved. There is no evidence as to whether there has been a government response to adapt the approach. Limited technical and institutional capacity was identified as a key factor. Lessons learned from the IUCN pilots and experiences from other similar initiatives are shared regularly at the Mekong Delta Development Partners Working Group and Annual Mekong Delta Forums. Further, the emerging interest from academia in flood-based agriculture is already producing relevant data and information. Additionally, the preparation of the planned Green Climate Fund 16 proposal considers the above challenges. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The NbS intervention built on the 2013 Mekong Delta Plan, which recommended high-value double rice cropping in combination with seasonal flood-based agriculture/aquaculture to manage flood risks. This influenced the promulgation of National Resolution 120, entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d; this policy was adopted in November 2017 and stipulates that nature-based adaptation models should be selected that are environmentally sound and achieve sustainable development based on \u2018actively living with the floods\u2019. The Mekong Delta Forum provided a space for knowledge exchange on lessons learned and endorsement of a common vision for the Upper Mekong Delta, including a move to more natural land and water uses. An IUCN-led Green Climate Fund proposal is under preparation to ensure continuity of efforts and to address transboundary challenges. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Legal and regulatory framework. Supportive legal and policy frameworks opened up opportunities for a change in land use and facilitated partnerships across related initiatives for the adoption of flood-based agriculture in open flood and flood control zones. A need for market incentives. The NbS intervention in Vietnam could have profited from a more holistic approach regarding the diversification of marketable products derived from flood-based agriculture to provide additional market incentives. Through consultations and analysis of lessons learned, market access and a lack of value chain development were identified as the greatest challenges for scaling up flood-based agriculture. This is influencing the design of the future Green Climate Fund project. Overcoming small-scale and time-bound interventions. A hybrid system of flood-based agriculture with some flooding control system of low dykes could help manage risks of early/heavy floods and droughts. The highest potential lies in the closed flood zones with high dykes through the opening of sluices during seasonal floods to restore the flood retention area. However, existing projects have not yet addressed this potential. This demonstrates that for NbS interventions to achieve positive impacts at scale, small-scale (often focussed on pilots), project-based and time- bound interventions are not sufficient to address complex societal challenges. Nevertheless, partnerships between related interventions in the region contributed to institutional and policy development as well as supported greater cross-sectoral coordination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "509aaa23-22b8-4656-aac3-df7d9b2519a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "509aaa23-22b8-4656-aac3-df7d9b2519a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-3-guidelines-conserving-connectivity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN WCPA Technical Note Series No. 3 GUIDELINES FOR CONSERVING CONNECTIVITY THROUGH ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS AND CORRIDORS", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-3-guidelines-conserving-connectivity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b4febd5c30e705fea24dccbf3e848ee95363fb11f7bfbc21168dbfe94542733e"}, "2": {"node_id": "6aa2f940-8519-4cdb-9085-7de0bd23c08b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-3-guidelines-conserving-connectivity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f2d7db7b2b7f4fe67021d0ae67ee04aee046d14d65b0ac2c8c41eb1724eb4a5"}}, "hash": "3d14f40611b541f77df7145ecaac9878bb1ac848f00a097336442c9b9dd1a92e", "text": "17 3.3 Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management Location: Gulf of Oristano, Sardinia, Italy Main implementing organisation: MEDSEA Mediterranean Sea and Coast Foundation Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 1 (solution that makes better use of existing natural and protected ecosystems) Case overview: The Gulf of Oristano is home to a number of freshwater and coastal wetlands.

It contributed to balancing social and environmental needs and paved the way to recognise the economic and cultural potential of the wetlands. Since the implementation of activities is still ongoing, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment was used Figure 7: Area archeologica di tharros, San Giovanni di Sinis, Cabras, Italy (\u00a9 L\u00e9onard Cotte, Unsplash) 18 to identify entry points to strengthen the NbS intervention. This analysis was carried out by the UNEP Regional Activity Centre for Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP/RAC) of the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) of the UN Environment Programme and recommendations published in a report.[18] Table 4: Characteristics and benefits of the Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Adequate adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status Implementation of the NbS intervention is ongoing. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped identify the key societal challenges that needed addressing. These management plans also provided insights into human activities in the region, such as aquaculture and fishing. General information on drivers and responses of the identified societal challenges was gathered; however, there was no data specific to the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. An area for improvement identified as part of the self- assessment relates to strengthening the links to human wellbeing outcomes. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The aim of the intervention was to overcome fragmentation between the various wetland ecosystems in the Gulf of Oristano. The collaboration established among 11 municipalities through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract helped advance coordination, including across sectors. Further, interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems fed into the design of the intervention and considered various activities, including fishing, flood risk management, agriculture and tourism among others. Vulnerability and risk maps were developed. However, it was recommended that additional data be gathered to understand risks across the catchment and better define the adaptation and resilience actions to climate change, including related to connectivity between wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped understand the current state of wetland ecosystems and biodiversity in the region. Regular monitoring is 19 ecosystem integrity ensured through an integrated information system, the Oristano Wetland Observatory. In addition, the implementation of a Wetland Index is planned. Options to enhance integrity of the wetland ecosystems were implemented. These included the restoration of ecological connections, creation of buffer zones and preservation of native habitats. Key biodiversity outcomes: \uf0b7 Strengthened conservation of coastal and marine habitats; \uf0b7 Reinforced resilience to climate change impacts; \uf0b7 Reduced water consumption, abstraction, pollution and contamination. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable This criterion turned out to be the weakest for this NbS intervention. No specific cost-effectiveness study was conducted. Cost-benefit analyses and consideration of alternatives were conducted only for a limited number of the wetlands found in the Gulf of Oristano. The long-term resourcing of the NbS was partially secured through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract. Additional resourcing is expected through the new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 as well as through the new funds from the Recovery and Resilience Plan that is currently being developed. Moreover, the institution of a new protected area (regional park) will be an instrument to attract new funds and ensure the ongoing management of wetlands. A full economic analysis was suggested as a priority action going forward to secure the continuity and sustainability of the NbS intervention.

In addition, national and global targets were key reference points for the design of the NbS intervention and Ramsar information sheets were updated for the six Ramsar sites. A new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 is under preparation by the regional government. Steps will be taken to integrate the results of the NbS intervention into the strategy to promote its long-term continuity. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Defining priority and corrective actions to strengthen the intervention. An analysis of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 indicators that have been insufficiently or only partially addressed helped to make recommendations for improvement and to identify concrete corrective actions to strengthen the implementation of the NbS intervention.[18] This demonstrates how the self-assessment can be used to strengthen the design and implementation of NbS interventions. Strong legal basis. The adoption of the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract by the 11 municipalities provided an important legal basis and framework to advance integrated management of six wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano.

Seaweed farming activities are usually small-scale and carried out in the intertidal zones largely in marine conservation areas, near mangroves and coral reefs. Eighty-eight per cent of seaweed farmers are women, making this an important activity to elevate their economic status and role in the community.[19] Climate change, the absence of producer associations, difficulties in accessing international markets and insufficient protection of coastal ecosystems have contributed to a decline in the production of higher-valued seaweeds.

It should also be noted that the self-assessment was carried out as a desk review. Further, means of verification were not always available, as data relating to certain indicators were not gathered. To conduct a more comprehensive assessment, local stakeholders should be involved as key informants. Nevertheless, the self-assessment provided insights into areas for improvement as to how interventions are designed, implemented and monitored. It also provided insights into knowledge and data gaps, which prompted critical questions and corrective actions that need to be addressed going forward. Intervention status Initial activities are completed. Future actions, research and knowledge needs are being assessed. Figure 8: Women working in seaweed farms in Pemba, Zantibar (\u00a9 R. le Gouvello) 22 Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges The societal challenges were identified, documented and prioritised through a theory of change exercise. This included a stakeholder workshop and engagement with local authorities to verify the information. Several studies provided insights into the positive outcomes of mariculture and seaweed farming, which included gender equality, economic revenues provided to women and the consequences on their life, including increased autonomy, empowerment and role in the communities. Although there was an understanding of the internal and external risks of the intervention, the SWOT analysis carried out for the Zanzibar case showed that a number of weaknesses and threats have not yet been addressed. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The application of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) ensured a recognition of interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems. A more holistic approach should be applied in future interventions to take into account the impact of value chains and access to markets for local livelihoods. Some synergies across sectors were identified. However, since the theory of change exercise was not completed due to time constraints, complementary interventions were not integrated fully into the design of the intervention. It was recommended to work with stakeholders to complete this exercise and achieve synergies for future interventions, especially between aquaculture, marine conservation and other relevant sectors. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. The analysis of the biodiversity benefits achieved through this intervention were largely based on a desk review of existing literature and information rather than a specific assessment, monitoring framework or thorough and collective effort with key informants and stakeholders. As was highlighted in a recent study published by IUCN, criterion 3 is the most difficult to achieve for seaweed farming and aquaculture.[19] There is a clear need to establish measures to reduce, control and mitigate impacts on biodiversity. Moreover, better documentation of the ecological state of the ecosystem, ecosystem connectivity and assessment of impacts is required. In this regard, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is an important tool to call attention to these issues and helps improve interventions that would otherwise cause harm to coastal and marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable Seaweed farming is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market. The intervention did not carry out a global value chain assessment or detailed 23 assessment of climate change impacts. These could have provided insights into the economic feasibility and sustainability of the intervention, especially with regards to supporting the livelihoods of local women, who predominantly engage in seaweed farming. In addition, alternative scenarios and options need to be explored going forward to identify the most suitable, sustainable and economically viable solution in the specific context. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes Co-management approaches were applied in marine conservation areas. These involved the government and local communities, often with international support. They demonstrated the willingness of the Government of Zanzibar to implement blue growth strategies that are inclusive of local communities and aim to build a sustainable future. The need to further increase and improve the participation of women and aquaculture farmers in decision-making, to enhance transparency and to provide access to information, was highlighted. There are also opportunities to enhance cooperation across jurisdictional boundaries. Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. While there was a reported willingness from the Government of Zanzibar to consider relevant trade-offs, the limits of these trade-offs and associated safeguards were not clarified. Existing cost-benefit analyses have not yet considered environmental aspects that would trigger corrective action.

By completing the self-assessment under the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39, it was possible to make concrete recommendations on how to improve the balancing of trade-offs, while ensuring the sustainability of the intervention. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The Government of Zanzibar put in place a blue growth strategy, which considers the challenges of seaweed farming, including related sustainability concerns. However, there is as yet no evidence of a formal mechanism to monitor and evaluate interventions on a regular basis to determine adaptive management responses. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context Since the 1980s, the Government of Zanzibar encouraged multi-use marine protected zones, which were included in relevant sectoral laws and policies. A blue growth strategy and regulations support seaweed farming practices and the achievement of global targets. The means by which lessons learned are captured and communicated have been highlighted as an area for improvement. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) 24 Lessons learned: Taking corrective action. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 served as an important tool to reflect on Nature-based Solution design, implementation and monitoring challenges. It provided insights into areas that require corrective action, the collection of additional evidence and means of verification and involvement of local stakeholders. In this manner, the self- assessment results will inform future work on aquaculture and seaweed farming in Zanzibar (and elsewhere) and help improve intervention design, implementation and monitoring frameworks. Reviewing the understanding of the NbS criteria and indicators. Several rounds of discussions, guided by IUCN expert reviewers, were held on the rationale and means of verification provided per indicator. These revealed that the criteria were sometimes understood and interpreted differently by different people, impacting the assigned rating. This demonstrated the complexities associated with assessing whether an intervention can be considered a Nature-based Solution and the need for thorough and guided consideration of each indicator. Continued engagement. A new agenda of research and development work has emerged, including dialogues around NbS criteria and indicators with stakeholders in Zanzibar and local communities. This could contribute to a future roadmap for Zanzibar and a framework for regular self- evaluation. 25 4 Summary of results First, case studies offer important opportunities for exchange of experiences, reflection on different approaches applied in different contexts as well as lessons learned with regards to opportunities, challenges and needed corrective actions. The agreed documentation framework and resulting prototype database of case studies based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 and elements from the PANORAMA: solutions for a healthy planet case study database, greatly support the analysis and comparability of experiences by offering common and robust parameters for benchmarking interventions.5 Second, there is tremendous strength in inclusive governance and open, transparent and participatory approaches that draw on local and/or traditional knowledge, engage Indigenous people, local communities and traditionally under-represented groups, such as women and youth. As illustrated in the Guatemala and Zanzibar cases, women in particular can benefit from enhanced opportunities, social status and income generated through NbS, when the design accounts for their role and inherent gender gaps. Third, scale is an important success factor. Small-scale, time-bound, pilot and project-based interventions often fail to address the full complexity of societal challenges and rarely produce the biodiversity and human wellbeing outcomes expected from the NbS. Finally, an enabling institutional, legal and policy environment provides the backbone for the implementation of and investments in NbS by making nature an ally in addressing societal challenges. Supportive, clear and coherent legal and policy frameworks can further enhance and facilitate coordination across relevant sectors and actors as well as protect the rights of affected and vulnerable communities that benefit directly or indirectly from an intervention. 5 More reflections on the benefits of the prototype database see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions, reference [11] 26 References [1] Mace, G.M.

Case studies can be a useful tool to illustrate the value of NbS interventions. They demonstrate the elements that are essential for the successful design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of NbS and thus enable learning from experiences in different contexts. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is particular suited to document the positive contributions of NbS. Based on its science-based and widely consulted criteria and indicators, the Standard helps verify NbS applications and promotes comparability as well as a coherent and consistent framework for benchmarking interventions.

NbS emerged from this deeper understanding as a way to operationalise the Ecosystem Approach, with the primary goal of applying conservation approaches to safeguard society (see Figure 1).[1, 2, 3] Figure 1: Nature-based Solutions to address societal challenges. The seven societal challenges indicators are climate change adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk reduction, economic and social development, human health, food security, water security and environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. (\u00a9 IUCN) More recently, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 1 This IUCN definition was endorsed by IUCN\u2019s 1,400 members at the 2016 World Conservation Congress in Resolution 069; an expanded definition was recently adopted at UNEA-5.2 in the resolution entitled Nature-based Solutions for supporting sustainable development 2 Services (IPBES) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognised NbS and their role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity protection and contributions to people.[4] Moreover, the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), held in Nairobi in the first quarter of 2022, adopted a resolution on Nature-based Solutions for Supporting Sustainable Development.[5] An assessment of NbS requires a consistent and common framework that helps document the positive contributions of NbS to green economic development, ecosystem management, climate change and other societally desirable outcomes. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is a valuable tool to verify a range of NbS applications. [6] The eight criteria (see Figure 2) and 28 indicators of the Standard provide clear, science-based and widely consulted parameters for benchmarking NbS interventions.[6, 7] The interdependent and non-hierarchical nature of its eight criteria implies that to be in adherence an intervention has to at least partially address each criterion. As a result, inadequacy in just one criterion means that the intervention in question is not in adherence with the Standard and therefore cannot be verified as an NbS. Figure 2: The eight criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 (\u00a9 IUCN) Adherence with the Standard means that the NbS action sufficiently addresses critical environmental, social and economic dimensions (aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)), legal and policy considerations, inclusive governance and participation aspects. Due to its compatibility with the ISEAL Alliance Code of Good Practice, the Standard provides the necessary focus on achieving impact at scale, preventing misuse and applying safeguards for the verification and/or subsequent improvement of interventions to be considered NbS. The process-oriented quality of the Standard also provides additional value for analysing and extracting key lessons learned from case studies. It allows reflection on and increases understanding of challenges and opportunities, differentiates between strong and weak NbS interventions, and provides room for corrective and adaptive management and learning throughout the intervention cycle. 3 The international case studies presented here provide insights into particular success factors and challenges for NbS interventions and, thus, promote and enhance uptake, implementation and financing of NbS. Further, they support an effort to build a prototype database of NbS cases using the Standard as a lens through which to understand verification and lessons learned. 4 2 Methodology The prototype database of NbS cases was conceived through an agreed documentation framework, the selection of illustrative international case studies, and the analysis and presentation of five international case studies in accordance with the documentation framework. Inclusivity and gender considerations were given particular attention and wherever possible, disaggregated data is provided. By highlighting the inclusion of different knowledge systems and participation in decision-making of those affected by NbS interventions (including Indigenous peoples and local communities, women and youth), the case studies demonstrate the critical importance of inclusive governance for the success of an NbS intervention. They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e5ae1aa-b49b-4744-9a98-339271e1f49e": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e5ae1aa-b49b-4744-9a98-339271e1f49e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-2-protected-areas-benefits-assessment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN WCPA Technical Note Series No. 2 PROTECTED AREAS BENEFITS ASSESSMENT TOOL +", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-2-protected-areas-benefits-assessment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9fb149420a73b213996553d7fd827cc7653c36ae399b7950c5ca20aa031582c0"}, "2": {"node_id": "c99a6ca3-6962-4ce6-b9e6-01ae6031387f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-2-protected-areas-benefits-assessment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4e24f8eabbc8cbacec24d7ce2e8ddd4400c2f4d75710e2d397d8b29a355ee3d2"}}, "hash": "8554aee8434bd7db68ac201007580783495acc96234b7f5238ed231f0ff32994", "text": "They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.

To facilitate this, a combined template \u2013 the documentation framework \u2013 was developed to ensure that the required information would be collected and collated. In order to ensure this framework was complementary with the most relevant databases, a mapping of NbS resources from the EU project NetworkNature was utilised (not yet publicly available).[10] Subsequently, relevant information from the case studies related to the documentation framework was gathered. The case study documentation framework captures key information about each of the case studies. It was designed to combine inputs from the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39 and the information required by the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database to help classify each of the case studies (see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions[11]). 5 2.2 Case study selection and documentation The case study selection process focussed on identifying and agreeing on the five most relevant international case studies. It was agreed that the selected cases should provide a good representation across societal challenges, ecosystems and sectors. The initial longlist of international case studies was drawn from cases that had already undergone a full assessment with the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39. In accordance with the classification discussed in Section 2 of the CCICED Special Policy Study Report on \u201cValue Assessment of Nature- based Solutions\u201d, discussions with the Special Policy Study team and the availability of sufficient qualitative and quantitative information, five case studies were selected, analysed and documented. The results can be found below and on the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database.[12] Identify priority databases \u2022 Use NetworkNature mapping to identify three priority databases (e.g. PANORAMA) Extract documentation framework \u2022 Collect the documentation required for PANORAMA, finding gender disaggregated data where possible \u2022 In addition, gather gender relevant data inspired by the questions supplied by the CCICED Toolkit on Gender Equality and Environmental Sustainability Combine into standardized template \u2022 Combine these frameworks to create an overarching template for the selected case studies.

An increase in the number of coastal flooding events and overwashing occurring several times per year, exacerbated by sea level rise and climate change, established that the existing shingle bank was insufficient to protect against floods. This posed significant actual and potential risks to life and caused damage to property and infrastructure. Additionally, coastal squeeze caused losses of coastal habitat. In response, the Environment Agency of the United Kingdom delivered a GBP 27 million project to realign the defences inland, providing significantly improved flood defences to allow for managed flooding. The intervention created 300 hectares of habitat (183 of which is intertidal, including mudflat, salt marsh and transitional grassland), protection of more than 300 homes, road infrastructure and a wastewater treatment plant and a boom to local tourism and recreation, with 22,000 visitors each year. The main positive impacts of the Figure 5: Aerial view of the intervention area taken in September 2013 (\u00a9 Environment Agency of the United Kingdom) 8 Medmerry managed coastal realignment include improved flood risk management, creation of wildlife habitats, enhanced landscape quality and provision of recreational facilities. Table 2: Characteristics and benefits of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Strong adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status All major NbS restoration activities have been completed and monitored. The focus is now on the continuous sustainable management of the intervention area. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges At the project planning stage, local communities, government representatives and statutory organisations were involved in the development of a vision for Medmerry, highlighting a wide range of impacts, including societal and environmental. The vision exercise highlighted disaster risk reduction, especially flooding, as a major priority. Additionally, environmental assessment data of flood events (the most serious recent event before the start of the project occurred in 2008 and caused over GBP 5 million in economic damage and required evacuation due to risk of life[14]), flood risk mapping and modelling confirmed flooding as the main societal challenge. These assessments were based on global best practices. Impacts of climate change were found to be an exacerbating factor. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale During the planning phase, a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out and a full risk register developed. To achieve flood reduction and environmental improvement, 200 miles of the UK coast were assessed to determine the most promising opportunities for NbS, considering landscape, impacts on people and surrounding habitats. In addition, wider impacts across the region were assessed in accordance with the National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England, including people, businesses, infrastructure and environments. While the coastal realignment provided many new business opportunities, these were not considered in depth during the planning phase. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The expected impacts on the ecosystems in the intervention areas were captured in an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). These included mitigation measures for any risks to biodiversity during construction. For 9 instance, water voles were translocated prior to the start of the works.

Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes The project placed particular emphasis on stakeholder engagement and participation of local communities in all phases of the project. This included proactively providing information about the benefits of the coastal realignment, gaining widespread support for the intervention and seeking community views and inputs. A comprehensive stakeholder analysis allowed a mapping of how best to engage with the different stakeholders. The Medmerry Stakeholder Advisory Group was established, made up of key individuals of the local community, including Parish Councils, local businesses and residents most affected by the coastal realignment. The Advisory Group helped shape the 10 design of the project and met regularly to discuss any issues and concerns. Although a complaints procedure was in place, which enabled affected individuals to raise concerns through an independent ombudsman, more could have been done to ease the associated bureaucratic burden. The active and intentional involvement of the local community and subsequent support generated, contributed significantly to the success of the project. [15] Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits The costs and benefits of the NbS intervention were mapped in line with UK government assessment criteria and included the surrounding areas of the intervention site (landscape level). Annual meetings with stakeholders ensured that the NbS intervention provided the expected benefits. Public access (footpaths, cycle paths and bridleway) to the newly established nature reserve was enhanced and recreational areas provided, while maintaining a balance between recreational activities and undisturbed conservation areas. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The expected benefits were documented in the planning phase and baselines established. These informed the ongoing monitoring of NbS impacts. Immediately after project completion, a five-year monitoring programme was implemented. Annual reports summarised findings and lessons learned, which were shared and discussed with local stakeholders, external consultants, academia and risk management authorities in south England. Approaches to project planning and implementation were adjusted as needed. For instance, the approach applied to engaging the local community was adapted based on early experiences and analysis of challenges and barriers. [15] Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context While lessons learned have been captured in annual reports and through the monitoring framework, these have only been shared with a limited audience. The main benefits that have been communicated relate to reduced flood risk and created habitat. The success of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment along with other NbS interventions informed the organisational national strategy and increased the focus on NbS nationally. The project was characterised by comprehensively considering climate change and biodiversity throughout the design, implementation and monitoring phases. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Participatory and collaborative approaches. Inclusive governance and collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, especially the local community, ensured effective assessment of societal challenges and priorities in the given context, increased understanding and acceptability of the proposed solution and enabled effective planning, implementation and maintenance/management of the NbS intervention, with a possibility for creative problem-solving. 11 Transparency.

The negative impacts caused by increased flood risk also caused transboundary challenges between Vietnam and Cambodia. Based on documented farmer knowledge and experience, IUCN promoted and improved locally-practiced, flood-based (wetland) agriculture and livelihood models in the Vietnamese provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap and Long An. Flood-based livelihoods were encouraged as a financially viable, low risk alternative to triple rice cropping, to enhance economic and social resilience as well as to conserve and restore the biodiversity found in Mekong Delta freshwater wetlands/floodplains. The NbS intervention considered three systems - floating rice systems, lotus farming systems and rice aquaculture systems. Due to increasing weather extremes, hybrid solutions were also explored (combination of dykes and floodplains), to enable controlled flooding and adaptive approaches to overcome risks of drought and to manage the arrival and recession of floods. While the main focus of the NbS intervention was on farmers adding an additional flood-based crop in open flood (no dyke) and flood control zones (low dyke), the utility of replacing low value irrigated crops with higher value flood-based crops in closed control zones (high dyke) was also considered. In order to achieve the full set of biodiversity and human wellbeing benefits derived from moderated floods, interventions need to be scaled up across the entirety of the Mekong Delta floodplain. To do so, a follow-up project is currently being developed under the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

Initial studies of farmer initiatives and proof of concept in IUCN pilot sites were completed between 2015 and 2018. These fed into the design and implementation of similar projects in the region (e.g. those by the World Bank, IUCN and FAO).

The economic component was not sufficiently considered in the design of the initial intervention, though marketable products were identified. While initial IUCN pilot interventions remained limited and small-scale, collaboration across similar projects and recent policy developments currently support the development of a large-scale intervention across the 1.4 million ha of the Upper Mekong Delta floodplain. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The focus of the intervention was on modified wetland ecosystems (formally zoned as agricultural land under private tenure) and thus excluded practices carried out in protected and conserved areas. In light of the extensive scientific evidence on the risks of rice intensification, it was possible to assess the status of ecosystems as well as drivers of change and biodiversity loss. Due to the rather small scale of the IUCN pilot interventions, no concrete data or monitoring frameworks to capture the positive biodiversity outcomes were implemented. Instead, outcomes were captured in general terms, including provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural functions of the floodplain. Detailed 14 monitoring for potential, unintended adverse consequences on nature arising from the intervention was not carried out. Key investments in biodiversity outcomes[16]: \uf0b7 Investments into 450 ha of flood-based livelihoods to enhance ecosystem functions of floodplains, which resulted in the conservation or restoration of approx. 6.7 million m\u00b3 of flood retention capacity supporting aquifer recharge, the reduction in land subsidence and the conservation or restoration of aquatic habitat/biodiversity; \uf0b7 additional benefits were observed from wild fisheries, mitigation of river erosion through the re-establishment of natural hydrology of seasonal flooding and increased land fertility, including through sediment deposition due to the seasonal flooding. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable A feasibility study for a GCF proposal revealed that several hundred thousand farmers and a number of downstream towns would benefit financially from flooding if seasonal flood-based agriculture were applied. In addition, cost- benefit analyses were carried out on the profitability of flood-based crops and the cropping system as a whole in comparison to mono-rice cropping. The NbS intervention did not consider the development of clear value chains and business models, which hampered securing long-term funding sources to maintain the NbS. Instead, the intervention relied on short-term, project-based grant funding. The planned GCF project could help overcome some of these shortcomings. Key expected economic benefits[16]: \uf0b7 flood-based livelihoods have the potential to be 1.5 to five times more profitable than intensive rice cropping; \uf0b7 floating rice systems could generate around USD 6,400 per ha per year, while triple rice cropping systems generate only USD 3,100 per ha per year; \uf0b7 where farmers add a flood-based crop in open flood or flood control zones, additional income between USD 2,293 \u2013 USD 5,744 per ha per year could be generated depending on the flood-based agriculture system applied[17]; \uf0b7 in open flood and flood control zones, no investments need to be made towards flood management, while in closed control zones (high dykes), sluice coordination by the local government is necessary; flood-based agriculture could serve as an incentive to stop conversion of low dykes to high dykes, which in turn helps preserve the floodplains in the Upper Mekong Delta. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and No grievance mechanism was put in place for the IUCN pilot NbS interventions, due to the small-scale and limited number of farmers involved. A grievance 15 empowering governance processes mechanism was put in place for the larger scale World Bank ICRSL project implementation as was required by World Bank safeguard policies. A stakeholder analysis provided insights into which stakeholders were directly and indirectly affected. Stakeholders provided inputs into the regional vision and plans for phasing out intensive triple rice crop farming. In addition, since farmers have private tenure over their land, farmer participation in decision-making and ownership of such decisions was essential. National Resolution 120 entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d and Decision 593 defined the roles and responsibilities of different actors in decision-making processes and recognised the need for policy reform rather than small-scale community- based solutions.

However, it is not yet operational. This constitutes a shortcoming for the NbS intervention. For the World Bank ICRSL project, social and environmental safeguards were put in place. However, the limits of trade-offs were not discussed in detail. In some areas a hybrid model was used, with low dykes controlling the timing of flood arrival/recession to support double-cropping and flood-based cropping (instead of the traditional third rice crop). In the case of lotus farming systems, flood-based agriculture enabled diversification of activities, including fish raising, ecotourism and recreational opportunities. In the future, value chains, especially for rice production, will need to be considered in more detail to support the new flood-based agriculture model and gain support from rice exporters. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence While National Resolution 120 provided an enabling policy environment for flood-based agriculture, examples of interventions that ran counter to the resolution remained. This weakened the impact of the NbS intervention and underlined that monitoring needed to be improved. There is no evidence as to whether there has been a government response to adapt the approach. Limited technical and institutional capacity was identified as a key factor. Lessons learned from the IUCN pilots and experiences from other similar initiatives are shared regularly at the Mekong Delta Development Partners Working Group and Annual Mekong Delta Forums. Further, the emerging interest from academia in flood-based agriculture is already producing relevant data and information. Additionally, the preparation of the planned Green Climate Fund 16 proposal considers the above challenges. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The NbS intervention built on the 2013 Mekong Delta Plan, which recommended high-value double rice cropping in combination with seasonal flood-based agriculture/aquaculture to manage flood risks. This influenced the promulgation of National Resolution 120, entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d; this policy was adopted in November 2017 and stipulates that nature-based adaptation models should be selected that are environmentally sound and achieve sustainable development based on \u2018actively living with the floods\u2019. The Mekong Delta Forum provided a space for knowledge exchange on lessons learned and endorsement of a common vision for the Upper Mekong Delta, including a move to more natural land and water uses. An IUCN-led Green Climate Fund proposal is under preparation to ensure continuity of efforts and to address transboundary challenges. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Legal and regulatory framework. Supportive legal and policy frameworks opened up opportunities for a change in land use and facilitated partnerships across related initiatives for the adoption of flood-based agriculture in open flood and flood control zones. A need for market incentives. The NbS intervention in Vietnam could have profited from a more holistic approach regarding the diversification of marketable products derived from flood-based agriculture to provide additional market incentives. Through consultations and analysis of lessons learned, market access and a lack of value chain development were identified as the greatest challenges for scaling up flood-based agriculture. This is influencing the design of the future Green Climate Fund project. Overcoming small-scale and time-bound interventions. A hybrid system of flood-based agriculture with some flooding control system of low dykes could help manage risks of early/heavy floods and droughts. The highest potential lies in the closed flood zones with high dykes through the opening of sluices during seasonal floods to restore the flood retention area. However, existing projects have not yet addressed this potential. This demonstrates that for NbS interventions to achieve positive impacts at scale, small-scale (often focussed on pilots), project-based and time- bound interventions are not sufficient to address complex societal challenges. Nevertheless, partnerships between related interventions in the region contributed to institutional and policy development as well as supported greater cross-sectoral coordination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d05eec4-1be1-4f3b-805a-ffee422f9de1": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d05eec4-1be1-4f3b-805a-ffee422f9de1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-2-protected-areas-benefits-assessment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN WCPA Technical Note Series No. 2 PROTECTED AREAS BENEFITS ASSESSMENT TOOL +", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-2-protected-areas-benefits-assessment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a012fac696f616e9fa9cd4d4b9cae98f20cbeabd3f9ac6ef93a721958a5b959"}, "2": {"node_id": "841faef3-7957-4bd4-897c-3b38bb440413", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-2-protected-areas-benefits-assessment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42487d6562405c93328f4369df7c00b0a429ef1077d067a9a019a74f421e1668"}}, "hash": "53cf470de7a9344db2ccb8f3d54e659f3fd387d7ec25f2b7391183841cbb66a4", "text": "17 3.3 Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management Location: Gulf of Oristano, Sardinia, Italy Main implementing organisation: MEDSEA Mediterranean Sea and Coast Foundation Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 1 (solution that makes better use of existing natural and protected ecosystems) Case overview: The Gulf of Oristano is home to a number of freshwater and coastal wetlands.

This analysis was carried out by the UNEP Regional Activity Centre for Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP/RAC) of the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) of the UN Environment Programme and recommendations published in a report.[18] Table 4: Characteristics and benefits of the Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Adequate adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status Implementation of the NbS intervention is ongoing. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped identify the key societal challenges that needed addressing. These management plans also provided insights into human activities in the region, such as aquaculture and fishing. General information on drivers and responses of the identified societal challenges was gathered; however, there was no data specific to the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. An area for improvement identified as part of the self- assessment relates to strengthening the links to human wellbeing outcomes. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The aim of the intervention was to overcome fragmentation between the various wetland ecosystems in the Gulf of Oristano. The collaboration established among 11 municipalities through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract helped advance coordination, including across sectors. Further, interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems fed into the design of the intervention and considered various activities, including fishing, flood risk management, agriculture and tourism among others. Vulnerability and risk maps were developed. However, it was recommended that additional data be gathered to understand risks across the catchment and better define the adaptation and resilience actions to climate change, including related to connectivity between wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped understand the current state of wetland ecosystems and biodiversity in the region. Regular monitoring is 19 ecosystem integrity ensured through an integrated information system, the Oristano Wetland Observatory. In addition, the implementation of a Wetland Index is planned. Options to enhance integrity of the wetland ecosystems were implemented. These included the restoration of ecological connections, creation of buffer zones and preservation of native habitats. Key biodiversity outcomes: \uf0b7 Strengthened conservation of coastal and marine habitats; \uf0b7 Reinforced resilience to climate change impacts; \uf0b7 Reduced water consumption, abstraction, pollution and contamination. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable This criterion turned out to be the weakest for this NbS intervention. No specific cost-effectiveness study was conducted. Cost-benefit analyses and consideration of alternatives were conducted only for a limited number of the wetlands found in the Gulf of Oristano. The long-term resourcing of the NbS was partially secured through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract. Additional resourcing is expected through the new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 as well as through the new funds from the Recovery and Resilience Plan that is currently being developed. Moreover, the institution of a new protected area (regional park) will be an instrument to attract new funds and ensure the ongoing management of wetlands. A full economic analysis was suggested as a priority action going forward to secure the continuity and sustainability of the NbS intervention.

Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits A basic analysis of the rights, usage of and access to land and resources was done. It revealed that the regional government owns the wetlands, while surrounding areas are either under public or private ownership. Concessions are given to fisher cooperatives. The results of the self-assessment revealed a major shortcoming in agreeing limits of trade-offs and related safeguards. This aspect was included as a priority action moving forward. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based The Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract defined guidelines and actions that steered the definition of intended outcomes and actions and informed 20 on evidence monitoring and evaluation of the intervention. The Integrated Information System developed as part of the initiative provided uniform and regular data on the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. The collected information will be used for regular monitoring over time. However, no concrete plan of how the monitoring may trigger an adaptive management response was prepared. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract is an important document supporting the implementation of integrated, coordinated and collaborative approaches at scale. The Contract is an important legal instrument as it reinforces the commitment towards joint policy action to overcome fragmentation of coastal wetlands management, looking towards the establishment of a new regional protected area, which is the first aim of the Action Plan attached to the Contract. It provides the foundation for NbS actions in the Gulf of Oristano. In addition, national and global targets were key reference points for the design of the NbS intervention and Ramsar information sheets were updated for the six Ramsar sites. A new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 is under preparation by the regional government. Steps will be taken to integrate the results of the NbS intervention into the strategy to promote its long-term continuity. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Defining priority and corrective actions to strengthen the intervention. An analysis of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 indicators that have been insufficiently or only partially addressed helped to make recommendations for improvement and to identify concrete corrective actions to strengthen the implementation of the NbS intervention.[18] This demonstrates how the self-assessment can be used to strengthen the design and implementation of NbS interventions. Strong legal basis. The adoption of the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract by the 11 municipalities provided an important legal basis and framework to advance integrated management of six wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. It provided strategies and actions that support ongoing efforts toward the establishment of a new regional park. 3.4 Sustainable aquaculture and innovative seaweed farming in Zanzibar Location: Zanzibar, Tanzania Main implementing organisation: International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Other implementing organisation: Ecosystem-based Aquaculture Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Commission on Ecosystem Management (IUCN CEM) Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 2 (solution for sustainable management of restored and managed ecosystems, including innovative land-use planning protocols) 21 Case overview: Since 1990, Zanzibar has become a primary seaweed producer in Africa. Seaweed farming activities are usually small-scale and carried out in the intertidal zones largely in marine conservation areas, near mangroves and coral reefs. Eighty-eight per cent of seaweed farmers are women, making this an important activity to elevate their economic status and role in the community.[19] Climate change, the absence of producer associations, difficulties in accessing international markets and insufficient protection of coastal ecosystems have contributed to a decline in the production of higher-valued seaweeds. While the co-management approach applied in Zanzibar aims to protect coastal ecosystems and habitats, enhance artisanal fisheries and mariculture, shortcomings in the management remain.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53e40798-aa68-4701-b5b0-9d0cffa2ee80": {"__data__": {"id_": "53e40798-aa68-4701-b5b0-9d0cffa2ee80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-2-protected-areas-benefits-assessment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN WCPA Technical Note Series No. 2 PROTECTED AREAS BENEFITS ASSESSMENT TOOL +", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-2-protected-areas-benefits-assessment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53e1f9aaf9dfc7f178504f12947616abfded919b163f20d60141e8836f6a7339"}, "2": {"node_id": "68a693bb-81ec-40a9-aebd-d6401f364c5f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-2-protected-areas-benefits-assessment", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fba9bd116c65a6bbcbc7cb3604baa227e294d80719e48ec704932e1f9cc5d4ce"}}, "hash": "2e1ec0c1ccd68c0544ae347d8df7cf3686e897c31049430a17a55ad1c9ef2fdb", "text": "New approaches to aquaculture and marine conservation have emerged only recently (in terms of concrete projects since 2014), with the case in Zanzibar serving as a first attempt to test the level of adherence of seaweed farming with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39.

It should also be noted that the self-assessment was carried out as a desk review. Further, means of verification were not always available, as data relating to certain indicators were not gathered. To conduct a more comprehensive assessment, local stakeholders should be involved as key informants. Nevertheless, the self-assessment provided insights into areas for improvement as to how interventions are designed, implemented and monitored. It also provided insights into knowledge and data gaps, which prompted critical questions and corrective actions that need to be addressed going forward. Intervention status Initial activities are completed. Future actions, research and knowledge needs are being assessed. Figure 8: Women working in seaweed farms in Pemba, Zantibar (\u00a9 R. le Gouvello) 22 Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges The societal challenges were identified, documented and prioritised through a theory of change exercise. This included a stakeholder workshop and engagement with local authorities to verify the information. Several studies provided insights into the positive outcomes of mariculture and seaweed farming, which included gender equality, economic revenues provided to women and the consequences on their life, including increased autonomy, empowerment and role in the communities. Although there was an understanding of the internal and external risks of the intervention, the SWOT analysis carried out for the Zanzibar case showed that a number of weaknesses and threats have not yet been addressed. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The application of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) ensured a recognition of interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems. A more holistic approach should be applied in future interventions to take into account the impact of value chains and access to markets for local livelihoods. Some synergies across sectors were identified. However, since the theory of change exercise was not completed due to time constraints, complementary interventions were not integrated fully into the design of the intervention. It was recommended to work with stakeholders to complete this exercise and achieve synergies for future interventions, especially between aquaculture, marine conservation and other relevant sectors. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. The analysis of the biodiversity benefits achieved through this intervention were largely based on a desk review of existing literature and information rather than a specific assessment, monitoring framework or thorough and collective effort with key informants and stakeholders. As was highlighted in a recent study published by IUCN, criterion 3 is the most difficult to achieve for seaweed farming and aquaculture.[19] There is a clear need to establish measures to reduce, control and mitigate impacts on biodiversity. Moreover, better documentation of the ecological state of the ecosystem, ecosystem connectivity and assessment of impacts is required. In this regard, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is an important tool to call attention to these issues and helps improve interventions that would otherwise cause harm to coastal and marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable Seaweed farming is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market. The intervention did not carry out a global value chain assessment or detailed 23 assessment of climate change impacts. These could have provided insights into the economic feasibility and sustainability of the intervention, especially with regards to supporting the livelihoods of local women, who predominantly engage in seaweed farming. In addition, alternative scenarios and options need to be explored going forward to identify the most suitable, sustainable and economically viable solution in the specific context. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes Co-management approaches were applied in marine conservation areas. These involved the government and local communities, often with international support. They demonstrated the willingness of the Government of Zanzibar to implement blue growth strategies that are inclusive of local communities and aim to build a sustainable future. The need to further increase and improve the participation of women and aquaculture farmers in decision-making, to enhance transparency and to provide access to information, was highlighted. There are also opportunities to enhance cooperation across jurisdictional boundaries. Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. While there was a reported willingness from the Government of Zanzibar to consider relevant trade-offs, the limits of these trade-offs and associated safeguards were not clarified. Existing cost-benefit analyses have not yet considered environmental aspects that would trigger corrective action.

By completing the self-assessment under the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39, it was possible to make concrete recommendations on how to improve the balancing of trade-offs, while ensuring the sustainability of the intervention. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The Government of Zanzibar put in place a blue growth strategy, which considers the challenges of seaweed farming, including related sustainability concerns. However, there is as yet no evidence of a formal mechanism to monitor and evaluate interventions on a regular basis to determine adaptive management responses. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context Since the 1980s, the Government of Zanzibar encouraged multi-use marine protected zones, which were included in relevant sectoral laws and policies. A blue growth strategy and regulations support seaweed farming practices and the achievement of global targets. The means by which lessons learned are captured and communicated have been highlighted as an area for improvement. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) 24 Lessons learned: Taking corrective action. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 served as an important tool to reflect on Nature-based Solution design, implementation and monitoring challenges. It provided insights into areas that require corrective action, the collection of additional evidence and means of verification and involvement of local stakeholders. In this manner, the self- assessment results will inform future work on aquaculture and seaweed farming in Zanzibar (and elsewhere) and help improve intervention design, implementation and monitoring frameworks. Reviewing the understanding of the NbS criteria and indicators. Several rounds of discussions, guided by IUCN expert reviewers, were held on the rationale and means of verification provided per indicator. These revealed that the criteria were sometimes understood and interpreted differently by different people, impacting the assigned rating. This demonstrated the complexities associated with assessing whether an intervention can be considered a Nature-based Solution and the need for thorough and guided consideration of each indicator. Continued engagement. A new agenda of research and development work has emerged, including dialogues around NbS criteria and indicators with stakeholders in Zanzibar and local communities. This could contribute to a future roadmap for Zanzibar and a framework for regular self- evaluation. 25 4 Summary of results First, case studies offer important opportunities for exchange of experiences, reflection on different approaches applied in different contexts as well as lessons learned with regards to opportunities, challenges and needed corrective actions. The agreed documentation framework and resulting prototype database of case studies based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 and elements from the PANORAMA: solutions for a healthy planet case study database, greatly support the analysis and comparability of experiences by offering common and robust parameters for benchmarking interventions.5 Second, there is tremendous strength in inclusive governance and open, transparent and participatory approaches that draw on local and/or traditional knowledge, engage Indigenous people, local communities and traditionally under-represented groups, such as women and youth. As illustrated in the Guatemala and Zanzibar cases, women in particular can benefit from enhanced opportunities, social status and income generated through NbS, when the design accounts for their role and inherent gender gaps. Third, scale is an important success factor. Small-scale, time-bound, pilot and project-based interventions often fail to address the full complexity of societal challenges and rarely produce the biodiversity and human wellbeing outcomes expected from the NbS. Finally, an enabling institutional, legal and policy environment provides the backbone for the implementation of and investments in NbS by making nature an ally in addressing societal challenges. Supportive, clear and coherent legal and policy frameworks can further enhance and facilitate coordination across relevant sectors and actors as well as protect the rights of affected and vulnerable communities that benefit directly or indirectly from an intervention. 5 More reflections on the benefits of the prototype database see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions, reference [11] 26 References [1] Mace, G.M.

Case studies can be a useful tool to illustrate the value of NbS interventions. They demonstrate the elements that are essential for the successful design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of NbS and thus enable learning from experiences in different contexts. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is particular suited to document the positive contributions of NbS. Based on its science-based and widely consulted criteria and indicators, the Standard helps verify NbS applications and promotes comparability as well as a coherent and consistent framework for benchmarking interventions.

NbS emerged from this deeper understanding as a way to operationalise the Ecosystem Approach, with the primary goal of applying conservation approaches to safeguard society (see Figure 1).[1, 2, 3] Figure 1: Nature-based Solutions to address societal challenges. The seven societal challenges indicators are climate change adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk reduction, economic and social development, human health, food security, water security and environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. (\u00a9 IUCN) More recently, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 1 This IUCN definition was endorsed by IUCN\u2019s 1,400 members at the 2016 World Conservation Congress in Resolution 069; an expanded definition was recently adopted at UNEA-5.2 in the resolution entitled Nature-based Solutions for supporting sustainable development 2 Services (IPBES) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognised NbS and their role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity protection and contributions to people.[4] Moreover, the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), held in Nairobi in the first quarter of 2022, adopted a resolution on Nature-based Solutions for Supporting Sustainable Development.[5] An assessment of NbS requires a consistent and common framework that helps document the positive contributions of NbS to green economic development, ecosystem management, climate change and other societally desirable outcomes. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is a valuable tool to verify a range of NbS applications. [6] The eight criteria (see Figure 2) and 28 indicators of the Standard provide clear, science-based and widely consulted parameters for benchmarking NbS interventions.[6, 7] The interdependent and non-hierarchical nature of its eight criteria implies that to be in adherence an intervention has to at least partially address each criterion. As a result, inadequacy in just one criterion means that the intervention in question is not in adherence with the Standard and therefore cannot be verified as an NbS. Figure 2: The eight criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 (\u00a9 IUCN) Adherence with the Standard means that the NbS action sufficiently addresses critical environmental, social and economic dimensions (aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)), legal and policy considerations, inclusive governance and participation aspects. Due to its compatibility with the ISEAL Alliance Code of Good Practice, the Standard provides the necessary focus on achieving impact at scale, preventing misuse and applying safeguards for the verification and/or subsequent improvement of interventions to be considered NbS. The process-oriented quality of the Standard also provides additional value for analysing and extracting key lessons learned from case studies. It allows reflection on and increases understanding of challenges and opportunities, differentiates between strong and weak NbS interventions, and provides room for corrective and adaptive management and learning throughout the intervention cycle. 3 The international case studies presented here provide insights into particular success factors and challenges for NbS interventions and, thus, promote and enhance uptake, implementation and financing of NbS. Further, they support an effort to build a prototype database of NbS cases using the Standard as a lens through which to understand verification and lessons learned. 4 2 Methodology The prototype database of NbS cases was conceived through an agreed documentation framework, the selection of illustrative international case studies, and the analysis and presentation of five international case studies in accordance with the documentation framework. Inclusivity and gender considerations were given particular attention and wherever possible, disaggregated data is provided. By highlighting the inclusion of different knowledge systems and participation in decision-making of those affected by NbS interventions (including Indigenous peoples and local communities, women and youth), the case studies demonstrate the critical importance of inclusive governance for the success of an NbS intervention. They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3fd46cf-ee2a-4c54-b5de-c017fa1f9432": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3fd46cf-ee2a-4c54-b5de-c017fa1f9432", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/1-iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-1-privately-protected-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1 IUCN WCPA Technical Note Series No. 1: Privately protected areas: international reporting and their relationship with OECMs", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/1-iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-1-privately-protected-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88d920fa2a47e55eae0e630bb3700da21f260d74bd25d864c6f5dfae4f6e9cac"}, "2": {"node_id": "f8699d1b-c4fe-4a07-b865-632153f7ee42", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/1-iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-1-privately-protected-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3c0251223710e825bc8f2138914d9d28bb90a3aaf8983b97dada7db98ecc8887"}}, "hash": "d4a59dc7e717384d89895493973899f74585c7be96c4e46291fbae67f33c0635", "text": "They also underscore the need for transparency and equity in order to safeguard people and culture.

To facilitate this, a combined template \u2013 the documentation framework \u2013 was developed to ensure that the required information would be collected and collated. In order to ensure this framework was complementary with the most relevant databases, a mapping of NbS resources from the EU project NetworkNature was utilised (not yet publicly available).[10] Subsequently, relevant information from the case studies related to the documentation framework was gathered. The case study documentation framework captures key information about each of the case studies. It was designed to combine inputs from the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39 and the information required by the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database to help classify each of the case studies (see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions[11]). 5 2.2 Case study selection and documentation The case study selection process focussed on identifying and agreeing on the five most relevant international case studies. It was agreed that the selected cases should provide a good representation across societal challenges, ecosystems and sectors. The initial longlist of international case studies was drawn from cases that had already undergone a full assessment with the IUCN Global Standard for NbS\u1d40\u1d39. In accordance with the classification discussed in Section 2 of the CCICED Special Policy Study Report on \u201cValue Assessment of Nature- based Solutions\u201d, discussions with the Special Policy Study team and the availability of sufficient qualitative and quantitative information, five case studies were selected, analysed and documented. The results can be found below and on the PANORAMA: Solutions for a healthy planet case study database.[12] Identify priority databases \u2022 Use NetworkNature mapping to identify three priority databases (e.g. PANORAMA) Extract documentation framework \u2022 Collect the documentation required for PANORAMA, finding gender disaggregated data where possible \u2022 In addition, gather gender relevant data inspired by the questions supplied by the CCICED Toolkit on Gender Equality and Environmental Sustainability Combine into standardized template \u2022 Combine these frameworks to create an overarching template for the selected case studies.

An increase in the number of coastal flooding events and overwashing occurring several times per year, exacerbated by sea level rise and climate change, established that the existing shingle bank was insufficient to protect against floods. This posed significant actual and potential risks to life and caused damage to property and infrastructure. Additionally, coastal squeeze caused losses of coastal habitat. In response, the Environment Agency of the United Kingdom delivered a GBP 27 million project to realign the defences inland, providing significantly improved flood defences to allow for managed flooding. The intervention created 300 hectares of habitat (183 of which is intertidal, including mudflat, salt marsh and transitional grassland), protection of more than 300 homes, road infrastructure and a wastewater treatment plant and a boom to local tourism and recreation, with 22,000 visitors each year. The main positive impacts of the Figure 5: Aerial view of the intervention area taken in September 2013 (\u00a9 Environment Agency of the United Kingdom) 8 Medmerry managed coastal realignment include improved flood risk management, creation of wildlife habitats, enhanced landscape quality and provision of recreational facilities. Table 2: Characteristics and benefits of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Strong adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status All major NbS restoration activities have been completed and monitored. The focus is now on the continuous sustainable management of the intervention area. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges At the project planning stage, local communities, government representatives and statutory organisations were involved in the development of a vision for Medmerry, highlighting a wide range of impacts, including societal and environmental. The vision exercise highlighted disaster risk reduction, especially flooding, as a major priority. Additionally, environmental assessment data of flood events (the most serious recent event before the start of the project occurred in 2008 and caused over GBP 5 million in economic damage and required evacuation due to risk of life[14]), flood risk mapping and modelling confirmed flooding as the main societal challenge. These assessments were based on global best practices. Impacts of climate change were found to be an exacerbating factor. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale During the planning phase, a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out and a full risk register developed. To achieve flood reduction and environmental improvement, 200 miles of the UK coast were assessed to determine the most promising opportunities for NbS, considering landscape, impacts on people and surrounding habitats. In addition, wider impacts across the region were assessed in accordance with the National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England, including people, businesses, infrastructure and environments. While the coastal realignment provided many new business opportunities, these were not considered in depth during the planning phase.

Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes The project placed particular emphasis on stakeholder engagement and participation of local communities in all phases of the project. This included proactively providing information about the benefits of the coastal realignment, gaining widespread support for the intervention and seeking community views and inputs. A comprehensive stakeholder analysis allowed a mapping of how best to engage with the different stakeholders. The Medmerry Stakeholder Advisory Group was established, made up of key individuals of the local community, including Parish Councils, local businesses and residents most affected by the coastal realignment. The Advisory Group helped shape the 10 design of the project and met regularly to discuss any issues and concerns. Although a complaints procedure was in place, which enabled affected individuals to raise concerns through an independent ombudsman, more could have been done to ease the associated bureaucratic burden. The active and intentional involvement of the local community and subsequent support generated, contributed significantly to the success of the project. [15] Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits The costs and benefits of the NbS intervention were mapped in line with UK government assessment criteria and included the surrounding areas of the intervention site (landscape level). Annual meetings with stakeholders ensured that the NbS intervention provided the expected benefits. Public access (footpaths, cycle paths and bridleway) to the newly established nature reserve was enhanced and recreational areas provided, while maintaining a balance between recreational activities and undisturbed conservation areas. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The expected benefits were documented in the planning phase and baselines established. These informed the ongoing monitoring of NbS impacts. Immediately after project completion, a five-year monitoring programme was implemented. Annual reports summarised findings and lessons learned, which were shared and discussed with local stakeholders, external consultants, academia and risk management authorities in south England. Approaches to project planning and implementation were adjusted as needed. For instance, the approach applied to engaging the local community was adapted based on early experiences and analysis of challenges and barriers. [15] Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context While lessons learned have been captured in annual reports and through the monitoring framework, these have only been shared with a limited audience. The main benefits that have been communicated relate to reduced flood risk and created habitat. The success of the Medmerry managed coastal realignment along with other NbS interventions informed the organisational national strategy and increased the focus on NbS nationally. The project was characterised by comprehensively considering climate change and biodiversity throughout the design, implementation and monitoring phases. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Participatory and collaborative approaches. Inclusive governance and collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, especially the local community, ensured effective assessment of societal challenges and priorities in the given context, increased understanding and acceptability of the proposed solution and enabled effective planning, implementation and maintenance/management of the NbS intervention, with a possibility for creative problem-solving. 11 Transparency.

The negative impacts caused by increased flood risk also caused transboundary challenges between Vietnam and Cambodia. Based on documented farmer knowledge and experience, IUCN promoted and improved locally-practiced, flood-based (wetland) agriculture and livelihood models in the Vietnamese provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap and Long An. Flood-based livelihoods were encouraged as a financially viable, low risk alternative to triple rice cropping, to enhance economic and social resilience as well as to conserve and restore the biodiversity found in Mekong Delta freshwater wetlands/floodplains. The NbS intervention considered three systems - floating rice systems, lotus farming systems and rice aquaculture systems. Due to increasing weather extremes, hybrid solutions were also explored (combination of dykes and floodplains), to enable controlled flooding and adaptive approaches to overcome risks of drought and to manage the arrival and recession of floods. While the main focus of the NbS intervention was on farmers adding an additional flood-based crop in open flood (no dyke) and flood control zones (low dyke), the utility of replacing low value irrigated crops with higher value flood-based crops in closed control zones (high dyke) was also considered. In order to achieve the full set of biodiversity and human wellbeing benefits derived from moderated floods, interventions need to be scaled up across the entirety of the Mekong Delta floodplain. To do so, a follow-up project is currently being developed under the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Table 3: Characteristics and benefits of flood-based agriculture in the upper Mekong delta floodplain based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Adequate adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status The concept of flood-based agriculture as an NbS emerged as part of a larger Programme of Work starting with the 2013 Mekong Delta Plan, which leveraged a number of projects that explored its feasibility. Initial studies of farmer initiatives and proof of concept in IUCN pilot sites were completed between 2015 and 2018. These fed into the design and implementation of similar projects in the region (e.g. those by the World Bank, IUCN and FAO).

The economic component was not sufficiently considered in the design of the initial intervention, though marketable products were identified. While initial IUCN pilot interventions remained limited and small-scale, collaboration across similar projects and recent policy developments currently support the development of a large-scale intervention across the 1.4 million ha of the Upper Mekong Delta floodplain. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity The focus of the intervention was on modified wetland ecosystems (formally zoned as agricultural land under private tenure) and thus excluded practices carried out in protected and conserved areas. In light of the extensive scientific evidence on the risks of rice intensification, it was possible to assess the status of ecosystems as well as drivers of change and biodiversity loss. Due to the rather small scale of the IUCN pilot interventions, no concrete data or monitoring frameworks to capture the positive biodiversity outcomes were implemented. Instead, outcomes were captured in general terms, including provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural functions of the floodplain. Detailed 14 monitoring for potential, unintended adverse consequences on nature arising from the intervention was not carried out. Key investments in biodiversity outcomes[16]: \uf0b7 Investments into 450 ha of flood-based livelihoods to enhance ecosystem functions of floodplains, which resulted in the conservation or restoration of approx. 6.7 million m\u00b3 of flood retention capacity supporting aquifer recharge, the reduction in land subsidence and the conservation or restoration of aquatic habitat/biodiversity; \uf0b7 additional benefits were observed from wild fisheries, mitigation of river erosion through the re-establishment of natural hydrology of seasonal flooding and increased land fertility, including through sediment deposition due to the seasonal flooding. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable A feasibility study for a GCF proposal revealed that several hundred thousand farmers and a number of downstream towns would benefit financially from flooding if seasonal flood-based agriculture were applied. In addition, cost- benefit analyses were carried out on the profitability of flood-based crops and the cropping system as a whole in comparison to mono-rice cropping. The NbS intervention did not consider the development of clear value chains and business models, which hampered securing long-term funding sources to maintain the NbS. Instead, the intervention relied on short-term, project-based grant funding. The planned GCF project could help overcome some of these shortcomings. Key expected economic benefits[16]: \uf0b7 flood-based livelihoods have the potential to be 1.5 to five times more profitable than intensive rice cropping; \uf0b7 floating rice systems could generate around USD 6,400 per ha per year, while triple rice cropping systems generate only USD 3,100 per ha per year; \uf0b7 where farmers add a flood-based crop in open flood or flood control zones, additional income between USD 2,293 \u2013 USD 5,744 per ha per year could be generated depending on the flood-based agriculture system applied[17]; \uf0b7 in open flood and flood control zones, no investments need to be made towards flood management, while in closed control zones (high dykes), sluice coordination by the local government is necessary; flood-based agriculture could serve as an incentive to stop conversion of low dykes to high dykes, which in turn helps preserve the floodplains in the Upper Mekong Delta. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and No grievance mechanism was put in place for the IUCN pilot NbS interventions, due to the small-scale and limited number of farmers involved. A grievance 15 empowering governance processes mechanism was put in place for the larger scale World Bank ICRSL project implementation as was required by World Bank safeguard policies. A stakeholder analysis provided insights into which stakeholders were directly and indirectly affected. Stakeholders provided inputs into the regional vision and plans for phasing out intensive triple rice crop farming.

However, it is not yet operational. This constitutes a shortcoming for the NbS intervention. For the World Bank ICRSL project, social and environmental safeguards were put in place. However, the limits of trade-offs were not discussed in detail. In some areas a hybrid model was used, with low dykes controlling the timing of flood arrival/recession to support double-cropping and flood-based cropping (instead of the traditional third rice crop). In the case of lotus farming systems, flood-based agriculture enabled diversification of activities, including fish raising, ecotourism and recreational opportunities. In the future, value chains, especially for rice production, will need to be considered in more detail to support the new flood-based agriculture model and gain support from rice exporters. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence While National Resolution 120 provided an enabling policy environment for flood-based agriculture, examples of interventions that ran counter to the resolution remained. This weakened the impact of the NbS intervention and underlined that monitoring needed to be improved. There is no evidence as to whether there has been a government response to adapt the approach. Limited technical and institutional capacity was identified as a key factor. Lessons learned from the IUCN pilots and experiences from other similar initiatives are shared regularly at the Mekong Delta Development Partners Working Group and Annual Mekong Delta Forums. Further, the emerging interest from academia in flood-based agriculture is already producing relevant data and information. Additionally, the preparation of the planned Green Climate Fund 16 proposal considers the above challenges. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context The NbS intervention built on the 2013 Mekong Delta Plan, which recommended high-value double rice cropping in combination with seasonal flood-based agriculture/aquaculture to manage flood risks. This influenced the promulgation of National Resolution 120, entitled \u201cFor a sustainable and climate resilient Mekong Delta\u201d; this policy was adopted in November 2017 and stipulates that nature-based adaptation models should be selected that are environmentally sound and achieve sustainable development based on \u2018actively living with the floods\u2019. The Mekong Delta Forum provided a space for knowledge exchange on lessons learned and endorsement of a common vision for the Upper Mekong Delta, including a move to more natural land and water uses. An IUCN-led Green Climate Fund proposal is under preparation to ensure continuity of efforts and to address transboundary challenges. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Legal and regulatory framework. Supportive legal and policy frameworks opened up opportunities for a change in land use and facilitated partnerships across related initiatives for the adoption of flood-based agriculture in open flood and flood control zones. A need for market incentives. The NbS intervention in Vietnam could have profited from a more holistic approach regarding the diversification of marketable products derived from flood-based agriculture to provide additional market incentives. Through consultations and analysis of lessons learned, market access and a lack of value chain development were identified as the greatest challenges for scaling up flood-based agriculture. This is influencing the design of the future Green Climate Fund project. Overcoming small-scale and time-bound interventions. A hybrid system of flood-based agriculture with some flooding control system of low dykes could help manage risks of early/heavy floods and droughts. The highest potential lies in the closed flood zones with high dykes through the opening of sluices during seasonal floods to restore the flood retention area. However, existing projects have not yet addressed this potential. This demonstrates that for NbS interventions to achieve positive impacts at scale, small-scale (often focussed on pilots), project-based and time- bound interventions are not sufficient to address complex societal challenges. Nevertheless, partnerships between related interventions in the region contributed to institutional and policy development as well as supported greater cross-sectoral coordination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5f8eeeb-ca21-4577-abeb-1996a769f541": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5f8eeeb-ca21-4577-abeb-1996a769f541", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/1-iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-1-privately-protected-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1 IUCN WCPA Technical Note Series No. 1: Privately protected areas: international reporting and their relationship with OECMs", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/1-iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-1-privately-protected-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "058be454de0715774e0f5f020ecaa27f2e5d1d072e5c6245d8ef76efe0ae42fe"}, "2": {"node_id": "6ebc84c6-01a4-421f-a502-e6f10e3769a0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/1-iucn-wcpa-technical-note-series-no-1-privately-protected-areas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7277963cc71a5f40309f485b5aff8f1e8474ebe2ee4c56136496d6b831ca96ff"}}, "hash": "b36f7cb97fbe0948b5528acdef766f87ffb6be2433d89c12b5a926aaba296d17", "text": "17 3.3 Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management Location: Gulf of Oristano, Sardinia, Italy Main implementing organisation: MEDSEA Mediterranean Sea and Coast Foundation Type of NbS intervention[2, 13]: Type 1 (solution that makes better use of existing natural and protected ecosystems) Case overview: The Gulf of Oristano is home to a number of freshwater and coastal wetlands.

It contributed to balancing social and environmental needs and paved the way to recognise the economic and cultural potential of the wetlands. Since the implementation of activities is still ongoing, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment was used Figure 7: Area archeologica di tharros, San Giovanni di Sinis, Cabras, Italy (\u00a9 L\u00e9onard Cotte, Unsplash) 18 to identify entry points to strengthen the NbS intervention. This analysis was carried out by the UNEP Regional Activity Centre for Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP/RAC) of the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) of the UN Environment Programme and recommendations published in a report.[18] Table 4: Characteristics and benefits of the Maristanis integrated coastal and wetlands management based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Overall assessment Adequate adherence with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 Intervention status Implementation of the NbS intervention is ongoing. Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped identify the key societal challenges that needed addressing. These management plans also provided insights into human activities in the region, such as aquaculture and fishing. General information on drivers and responses of the identified societal challenges was gathered; however, there was no data specific to the wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. An area for improvement identified as part of the self- assessment relates to strengthening the links to human wellbeing outcomes. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The aim of the intervention was to overcome fragmentation between the various wetland ecosystems in the Gulf of Oristano. The collaboration established among 11 municipalities through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract helped advance coordination, including across sectors. Further, interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems fed into the design of the intervention and considered various activities, including fishing, flood risk management, agriculture and tourism among others. Vulnerability and risk maps were developed. However, it was recommended that additional data be gathered to understand risks across the catchment and better define the adaptation and resilience actions to climate change, including related to connectivity between wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and A review of management plans for sites of community importance and special protected areas in the Gulf of Oristano helped understand the current state of wetland ecosystems and biodiversity in the region. Regular monitoring is 19 ecosystem integrity ensured through an integrated information system, the Oristano Wetland Observatory. In addition, the implementation of a Wetland Index is planned. Options to enhance integrity of the wetland ecosystems were implemented. These included the restoration of ecological connections, creation of buffer zones and preservation of native habitats. Key biodiversity outcomes: \uf0b7 Strengthened conservation of coastal and marine habitats; \uf0b7 Reinforced resilience to climate change impacts; \uf0b7 Reduced water consumption, abstraction, pollution and contamination. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable This criterion turned out to be the weakest for this NbS intervention. No specific cost-effectiveness study was conducted. Cost-benefit analyses and consideration of alternatives were conducted only for a limited number of the wetlands found in the Gulf of Oristano. The long-term resourcing of the NbS was partially secured through the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract. Additional resourcing is expected through the new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 as well as through the new funds from the Recovery and Resilience Plan that is currently being developed. Moreover, the institution of a new protected area (regional park) will be an instrument to attract new funds and ensure the ongoing management of wetlands. A full economic analysis was suggested as a priority action going forward to secure the continuity and sustainability of the NbS intervention.

It revealed that the regional government owns the wetlands, while surrounding areas are either under public or private ownership. Concessions are given to fisher cooperatives. The results of the self-assessment revealed a major shortcoming in agreeing limits of trade-offs and related safeguards. This aspect was included as a priority action moving forward.

It provides the foundation for NbS actions in the Gulf of Oristano. In addition, national and global targets were key reference points for the design of the NbS intervention and Ramsar information sheets were updated for the six Ramsar sites. A new Sardinia Strategy for 2030 is under preparation by the regional government. Steps will be taken to integrate the results of the NbS intervention into the strategy to promote its long-term continuity. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) Lessons learned: Defining priority and corrective actions to strengthen the intervention. An analysis of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 indicators that have been insufficiently or only partially addressed helped to make recommendations for improvement and to identify concrete corrective actions to strengthen the implementation of the NbS intervention.[18] This demonstrates how the self-assessment can be used to strengthen the design and implementation of NbS interventions. Strong legal basis. The adoption of the Oristano Coastal Wetlands Contract by the 11 municipalities provided an important legal basis and framework to advance integrated management of six wetlands in the Gulf of Oristano.

Eighty-eight per cent of seaweed farmers are women, making this an important activity to elevate their economic status and role in the community.[19] Climate change, the absence of producer associations, difficulties in accessing international markets and insufficient protection of coastal ecosystems have contributed to a decline in the production of higher-valued seaweeds.

It should also be noted that the self-assessment was carried out as a desk review. Further, means of verification were not always available, as data relating to certain indicators were not gathered. To conduct a more comprehensive assessment, local stakeholders should be involved as key informants. Nevertheless, the self-assessment provided insights into areas for improvement as to how interventions are designed, implemented and monitored. It also provided insights into knowledge and data gaps, which prompted critical questions and corrective actions that need to be addressed going forward. Intervention status Initial activities are completed. Future actions, research and knowledge needs are being assessed. Figure 8: Women working in seaweed farms in Pemba, Zantibar (\u00a9 R. le Gouvello) 22 Criterion 1: NbS effectively address societal challenges The societal challenges were identified, documented and prioritised through a theory of change exercise. This included a stakeholder workshop and engagement with local authorities to verify the information. Several studies provided insights into the positive outcomes of mariculture and seaweed farming, which included gender equality, economic revenues provided to women and the consequences on their life, including increased autonomy, empowerment and role in the communities. Although there was an understanding of the internal and external risks of the intervention, the SWOT analysis carried out for the Zanzibar case showed that a number of weaknesses and threats have not yet been addressed. Criterion 2: Design of NbS is informed by scale The application of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) ensured a recognition of interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems. A more holistic approach should be applied in future interventions to take into account the impact of value chains and access to markets for local livelihoods. Some synergies across sectors were identified. However, since the theory of change exercise was not completed due to time constraints, complementary interventions were not integrated fully into the design of the intervention. It was recommended to work with stakeholders to complete this exercise and achieve synergies for future interventions, especially between aquaculture, marine conservation and other relevant sectors. Criterion 3: NbS result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. The analysis of the biodiversity benefits achieved through this intervention were largely based on a desk review of existing literature and information rather than a specific assessment, monitoring framework or thorough and collective effort with key informants and stakeholders. As was highlighted in a recent study published by IUCN, criterion 3 is the most difficult to achieve for seaweed farming and aquaculture.[19] There is a clear need to establish measures to reduce, control and mitigate impacts on biodiversity. Moreover, better documentation of the ecological state of the ecosystem, ecosystem connectivity and assessment of impacts is required. In this regard, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 is an important tool to call attention to these issues and helps improve interventions that would otherwise cause harm to coastal and marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Criterion 4: NbS are economically viable Seaweed farming is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market. The intervention did not carry out a global value chain assessment or detailed 23 assessment of climate change impacts. These could have provided insights into the economic feasibility and sustainability of the intervention, especially with regards to supporting the livelihoods of local women, who predominantly engage in seaweed farming. In addition, alternative scenarios and options need to be explored going forward to identify the most suitable, sustainable and economically viable solution in the specific context. Criterion 5: NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes Co-management approaches were applied in marine conservation areas. These involved the government and local communities, often with international support. They demonstrated the willingness of the Government of Zanzibar to implement blue growth strategies that are inclusive of local communities and aim to build a sustainable future. The need to further increase and improve the participation of women and aquaculture farmers in decision-making, to enhance transparency and to provide access to information, was highlighted. There are also opportunities to enhance cooperation across jurisdictional boundaries. Criterion 6: NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits This criterion was deemed to be insufficiently addressed by the intervention. While there was a reported willingness from the Government of Zanzibar to consider relevant trade-offs, the limits of these trade-offs and associated safeguards were not clarified. Existing cost-benefit analyses have not yet considered environmental aspects that would trigger corrective action.

By completing the self-assessment under the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39, it was possible to make concrete recommendations on how to improve the balancing of trade-offs, while ensuring the sustainability of the intervention. Criterion 7: NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence The Government of Zanzibar put in place a blue growth strategy, which considers the challenges of seaweed farming, including related sustainability concerns. However, there is as yet no evidence of a formal mechanism to monitor and evaluate interventions on a regular basis to determine adaptive management responses. Criterion 8: NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context Since the 1980s, the Government of Zanzibar encouraged multi-use marine protected zones, which were included in relevant sectoral laws and policies. A blue growth strategy and regulations support seaweed farming practices and the achievement of global targets. The means by which lessons learned are captured and communicated have been highlighted as an area for improvement. (Source: Table developed by the authors of this report based on the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 self-assessment results for this case study) 24 Lessons learned: Taking corrective action. The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 served as an important tool to reflect on Nature-based Solution design, implementation and monitoring challenges. It provided insights into areas that require corrective action, the collection of additional evidence and means of verification and involvement of local stakeholders. In this manner, the self- assessment results will inform future work on aquaculture and seaweed farming in Zanzibar (and elsewhere) and help improve intervention design, implementation and monitoring frameworks. Reviewing the understanding of the NbS criteria and indicators. Several rounds of discussions, guided by IUCN expert reviewers, were held on the rationale and means of verification provided per indicator. These revealed that the criteria were sometimes understood and interpreted differently by different people, impacting the assigned rating. This demonstrated the complexities associated with assessing whether an intervention can be considered a Nature-based Solution and the need for thorough and guided consideration of each indicator. Continued engagement. A new agenda of research and development work has emerged, including dialogues around NbS criteria and indicators with stakeholders in Zanzibar and local communities. This could contribute to a future roadmap for Zanzibar and a framework for regular self- evaluation. 25 4 Summary of results First, case studies offer important opportunities for exchange of experiences, reflection on different approaches applied in different contexts as well as lessons learned with regards to opportunities, challenges and needed corrective actions. The agreed documentation framework and resulting prototype database of case studies based on the criteria of the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions\u1d40\u1d39 and elements from the PANORAMA: solutions for a healthy planet case study database, greatly support the analysis and comparability of experiences by offering common and robust parameters for benchmarking interventions.5 Second, there is tremendous strength in inclusive governance and open, transparent and participatory approaches that draw on local and/or traditional knowledge, engage Indigenous people, local communities and traditionally under-represented groups, such as women and youth. As illustrated in the Guatemala and Zanzibar cases, women in particular can benefit from enhanced opportunities, social status and income generated through NbS, when the design accounts for their role and inherent gender gaps. Third, scale is an important success factor. Small-scale, time-bound, pilot and project-based interventions often fail to address the full complexity of societal challenges and rarely produce the biodiversity and human wellbeing outcomes expected from the NbS. Finally, an enabling institutional, legal and policy environment provides the backbone for the implementation of and investments in NbS by making nature an ally in addressing societal challenges. Supportive, clear and coherent legal and policy frameworks can further enhance and facilitate coordination across relevant sectors and actors as well as protect the rights of affected and vulnerable communities that benefit directly or indirectly from an intervention. 5 More reflections on the benefits of the prototype database see CCICED Special Policy Study: Value Assessment of Nature- based Solutions, reference [11] 26 References [1] Mace, G.M.

Further, recognising the wider loss and degradation of ecosystems, the United Nations has declared 2021\u20132030 the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. Landscapes are shaped by decision-making and power relationships across multiple sectors and scales. FLR involves and impacts many actors over long periods, including Indigenous peoples and local communities who own, govern, manage and/or rely on areas, territories and resources within those landscapes. FLR governance concerns, among other issues, how and by whom restoration decisions are made (including on whose land and incorporating whose knowledge, vision and practice) and how FLR can impact rights and well-being in the short- and long-term. Governance is therefore a crucial factor in the effectiveness, equity and sustainability of FLR. The Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) provides a framework for governments and other rights-holders and stakeholders to define and prioritise actions for FLR in national or sub-national contexts, using participatory analysis of multiple factors. This publication analyses strengths, opportunities and challenges in how ROAM guidance and practice address governance issues. It considers both how ROAM processes are designed and carried out, and how they take into account governance of the target landscapes. It then presents lessons learned and offers recommendations on governance aspects of the ROAM framework and process with the aim of strengthening the ability of ROAM to inform effective, equitable and sustainable FLR. This analysis focuses on ROAM as a widely used framework that informs longer-term FLR, rather than comprehensively considering FLR itself. It offers inputs for developing additional governance guidance for ROAM processes going forward. The primary analysis methods were: (1) review of the most relevant sources of ROAM guidance; (2) analysis of the ROAM process in four countries \u2013 Colombia, Indonesia, Malawi and Rwanda \u2013 based on interviews and document review; and (3) additional research, including a review of targeted literature. The analysis was undertaken using the Natural Resource Governance Framework (NRGF), an IUCN knowledge resource that aims to provide a robust, inclusive and credible approach to assessing and improving natural resource governance. The NRGF framework includes values, principles and criteria for equitable and effective governance. The analysis also takes into consideration the FLR principles agreed upon by the Global Partnership on FLR (GPFLR), which ROAM seeks to operationalise. These two sets of principles address different subjects and have distinct objectives. Nonetheless, mapping the alignment between them shows that governance is intrinsic to many FLR principles and, thus, the NRGF can reinforce those principles. At the same time, because it goes further in identifying specific elements of effective and equitable governance, the NRGF can deepen consideration of governance in ROAM and, subsequently, the FLR initiatives identified through the ROAM process. Overall, this publication highlights that ROAM, like FLR, is a social and political process that is impacted by, and in turn impacts, different dimensions of governance, including equity and rights. The assessment process will determine whose knowledge, practice, rights and restoration visions are (and are not) reflected in outcomes. Therefore, while ROAM is not a governance assessment framework per se, taking governance issues into account is critical. This means, in part, ensuring that ROAM processes and outcomes do not inadvertently exacerbate governance concerns, e.g. by prioritising FLR initiatives that may marginalise or Principles of forest and landscape restoration \u2212 Focus on landscapes \u2212 Engage stakeholders and support participatory governance \u2212 Restore multiple functions for multiple benefits \u2212 Maintain and enhance natural ecosystems within landscapes \u2212 Tailor to the local context using a variety of approaches \u2212 Manage adaptively for long-term resilience Source: Besseau et al.

There is an opportunity to build on ROAM guidance to reinforce how governance considerations are integrated. Key findings Key findings from the analysis of how governance considerations are addressed in ROAM guidance and processes include the following (listed in relation to the NRGF principles):1 Principle 1 - Inclusive decision-making: Decision-making regarding natural resource policies and practices is based on the full and effective participation of all relevant actors, with particular attention to the voice and inclusion of rights-holders and groups at risk of marginalisation. ROAM guidance and processes emphasise stakeholder participation, including through stakeholder analysis aimed at better understanding which rights-holders and stakeholders can most benefit from FLR and influence the decision-making process . Yet, enabling full and effective participation remains challenging in practice, including with respect to ensuring inclusiveness, equitable power relationships (e.g. in designing and implementing multi-level, multi- stakeholder processes), sufficient resources (including time) and capacity (e.g. in facilitation). Principle 2 - Recognition of and respect for tenure rights: Rights to lands, resources and waters are recognised and respected, with particular attention to the customary, collective rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities, and to women\u2019s tenure rights. Understanding and respecting tenure rights, including customary and collective rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities, is key to equitable and effective FLR. Consideration of tenure rights is not central to ROAM guidance. Yet, in practice, ROAM processes frequently confront tenure issues, and address them in variable ways. Tenure rights, such as those related to ownership, governance, access, use and/or management of land, territories, water, trees and other resources, could be undermined if not well understood and fairly addressed in FLR, including where rights are unclear or unrecognised. More guidance and sharing of experiences about how ROAM processes and FLR can recognise, respect and uphold tenure rights are needed. Principle 3 - Recognition of and respect for diverse cultures, knowledge and institutions: Natural resource governance is grounded in sound and diverse forms of knowledge and respect for diverse cultures, values and practices. Recognition of diverse knowledge, knowledge-holders and culture has been increasing in ROAM processes, including through a new survey tool on culture. ROAM practice has also improved in recent years in terms of enabling knowledge co-generation and sharing, such as through collaborative learning between rights-holders and stakeholders. There are also aspects that could be strengthened, for example, through further guidance and more systematic practice on equitable knowledge co-generation and collaborative research, as well as the appropriate recognition and inclusion of diverse restoration knowledge, including cultural, Indigenous and local knowledge. 1 NRGF principles and associated graphics from Springer et al. (2021). vii Principle 4 - Devolution: Decisions are taken at the lowest possible level appropriate to the social and ecological systems being governed, with particular attention to empowering the roles and authority of Indigenous peoples and local communities in natural resource governance. Devolution is important to the ROAM process, for example, when ensuring that assessment scales enable decision-making about restoration at the most local level appropriate, with recognition of local (statutory and customary) governance systems, and the full and effective participation of rights-holders and stakeholders. It is also important to consider the opportunities and barriers for decentralised restoration in the landscape. For example, ROAM outputs can recognise and support Indigenous- and community-led restoration, in ways that respect self-determination and FPIC. Devolution is often considered in practice, particularly where national policy encourages or requires a decentralised restoration approach. However, addressing devolution more directly in guidance could ensure more consistent and comprehensive inclusion in ROAM processes. Principle 5 - Strategic vision, direction and learning: Natural resource governance is guided by an overall vision of desired environmental and social outcomes, and allows for adaptation in response to learning and changing conditions. Achieving FLR objectives requires clear vision, direction and learning. Developing a broadly shared, but often locally differentiated, vision for a future restored landscape is fundamental in ROAM and often one of its key outcomes. In practice, this is challenging to achieve. Rights-holders and stakeholders have different restoration visions and strategies across the landscape, which should be recognised and respected. Equity regarding whose vision is prioritised (and how) in ROAM processes is crucial. Additionally, while ROAM guidance considers the need for long-term learning and adaptation, more could be provided in terms of, for example, supporting learning and adaptation of FLR visions in a dynamic landscape over time.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86c094fb-1da9-46fe-9d96-1d4e533075cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "86c094fb-1da9-46fe-9d96-1d4e533075cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the integration of governance in forest landscape restoration opportunities assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d038230b169b0b2b426c3814e89a46b8359df96b541ed8891bad2fc55c84a3af"}, "2": {"node_id": "da5e1b8e-13d2-45b7-a995-69685f3d6025", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2463b57525590411a3268060751717e64c370d0ff031edb92da61e8b2ff5b98"}}, "hash": "90e3e25cd3ceb8674e3a4e402adc4e7ca7dd5290e387f3a601d5e3f3183ee4c7", "text": "Such learning should be multi- directional and grounded in the context and its history.

In terms of content, ROAM processes often (although to varying degrees) consider coordination and coherency in the institutional landscape for restoration. ROAM can provide a platform for improved coordination for FLR, with impacts within and beyond the assessment. For example, the creation of multi-stakeholder and cross- sectoral platforms have enhanced FLR coordination and coherence in some countries. Further guidance on the formation and governance of such platforms could help ensure that they are inclusive, including of Indigenous peoples and local communities, and enable equitable and effective FLR over time. Principle 7 - Sustainable and equitably shared resources: Actors responsible for natural resources have the means necessary to carry out sustainable management and governance activities, including from the equitable sharing of benefits generated from natural resources Restoration has economic, social/cultural and environmental costs and benefits. Benefit sharing and sustainability are often considered in-depth during ROAM processes, and the guidance suggests taking into account economic, environmental and social factors. However, while various material and non-material benefits are considered in ROAM processes, the costs of restoration are generally viewed more narrowly from an economic perspective. Analysing costs and benefits across geographical and temporal scales and considering distributional equity were also noted as challenges. ROAM guidance and processes could also integrate broader concepts of well-being, e.g. when considering impacts of proposed restoration actions. viii Principle 8 - Accountability: Actors responsible for or affecting natural resource governance are accountable for their actions and the environmental and social impacts they produce Transparency is important for accountability. ROAM guidance calls for transparency, and case analysis suggests that the process is often transparent to participants. There are also challenges. Process convenors\u2019 ability or willingness to coordinate and fulfil their roles varies. Further, when choosing restoration priorities, ROAM guidance does not provide a set of safeguards or a specific way to ensure that potential adverse social impacts are considered and addressed. There are several ways this could be, and sometimes is, done in practice (see Recommendations 11 and 18). Another challenge concerns answerability, or accountability, for longer-term restoration implementation and monitoring. Although long-term accountability is largely outside ROAM\u2019s scope, ROAM outputs can point the way to accountability, e.g. by providing information about who should be accountable to whom in FLR initiatives, including accountability to Indigenous peoples and local communities. Principle 9 - Fair and effective rule of law: Natural resource-related laws and their application are fair and effective and protect fundamental rights ROAM considers laws, policies and rules related to restoration as part of broader legal and policy analysis, e.g. as enabling factors. At the same time, there is little focus in ROAM guidance on considering the fairness of laws and their enforcement, including their consistency with fundamental rights. While resolving concerns related to the content or enforcement of law is likely to be outside the scope of a ROAM process, identifying such concerns can help ensure that they are taken into account, including in the prioritised FLR initiatives. Principle 10 - Access to justice and conflict resolution: People are able to seek and obtain remedies for grievances and resolve conflicts regarding land and natural resources While conflict resolution is not a focus of the guidance, ROAM processes often address related issues in practice. Some ROAM processes are intended, in part, to acknowledge and resolve conflicts so that rights-holder and stakeholder-defined FLR can move forward. ROAM assessments may also be carried out in landscapes where there are, or recently have been, conflicts that need to be taken into account in process design and facilitation. Conflict may also arise (or become more visible) during ROAM processes, such as around questions of who makes decisions, has rights and responsibilities, and benefits and bears costs related to restoration. Finally, access to justice and conflict resolution are key considerations for ROAM processes because they are important for effective and equitable FLR. More ROAM guidance and experience sharing in this area would be helpful.

Fully integrate governance and rights in situational and legal and policy analysis and/or do a governance assessment. Consider, inter alia: the full range of statutory and customary laws and policies, governance institutions and knowledge systems that guide (and can be impacted by) FLR; tenure and other substantive and procedural rights; land and resource- related injustices and conflicts; accountability arrangements and concerns; and the narratives and assumptions about who is responsible for deforestation and why. Take into account both the current and historical situation. All 4. Carry out a robust rights-holder and stakeholder analysis, including any Indigenous peoples, local communities and other local people who have connection to, own, govern, care for and/or rely on land, territories and natural resources in areas that may be impacted by FLR. Take account of differences in power, including across genders. 1, 4 5. Ensure an inclusive process with full and effective participation in all phases. This can be enabled by, among others: working with and through appropriate institutions at all levels; engaging rights-holders and key stakeholders as empowered partners; being transparent and responsive; fully budgeting for participation; and enabling full inclusion of Indigenous peoples, local communities, people of different genders and ages and potentially marginalised groups, through self-determined representation. 1, 3, 5 6. Align the process to the geographical and institutional scale(s), with inclusion at each level. Enabling meaningful participation across scales and sectors may require phased or tiered approaches, e.g. sub-national followed by national processes. Local actors who will lead, implement and be impacted by FLR should be partners in processes at all scales. 1, 3, 4, 5 7. Facilitate multi-stakeholder processes in ways that take account of, and positively impact, power dynamics, including to enable full and effective participation. All 8. Co-generate and respect diverse knowledge, including through multi-directional learning and contextually appropriate collaborative methods in all ROAM phases. Recognise, respect and include diverse ways of knowing, knowledge-holders and systems, including Indigenous and local knowledge, with FPIC. 3 9. Support fair, effective conflict recognition and resolution at the appropriate level. Work through statutory or customary mechanisms at the appropriate level and ensure rights-holders and stakeholders have information about and access to grievance mechanisms, including IUCN\u2019s. 10 10. Develop ROAM objectives and FLR visions with rights-holders and key stakeholders at each level, and with respect for a diversity of visions and strategies. Conveners should be transparent about their objectives and facilitate a process that is open and responsive to the visions and priorities of participants. Given ROAM\u2019s scale and FLR\u2019s timeframe, there may be a broad vision (e.g. a Bonn Challenge commitment) with diverse visions and strategies at more local levels (e.g. sacred forest restoration or expanded agroforestry). Visions and priorities may change over time. 1,5 x Recommendations for enhancing governance considerations in ROAM Related NRGF Principles ROAM Phase 1: Preparation, consultation and planning (continued) 11.

FCP has been integrated into the IUCN Forest and Grassland Team. 1 1 Introduction Governance is a crucial factor in the equity, effectiveness and sustainability of forest landscape restoration (FLR). Governance concerns questions of, inter alia, how and by whom restoration decisions are made (including on whose land and incorporating whose knowledge and visions) and how FLR can impact rights and well-being in the short- and long-term. In 2014, to assist governments and other rights-holders and stakeholders with making FLR actionable, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), in collaboration with the World Resources Institute (WRI), produced the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) (IUCN & WRI, 2014). ROAM provides a framework for governments, rights-holders and stakeholders to define and prioritise FLR actions in a national or sub-national context, using participatory analysis of multiple factors. The ROAM framework, and the processes through which it is applied, address governance issues to varying degrees. The objective of this publication is to present lessons learned and offer recommendations on governance aspects of the ROAM framework and process and, by doing so, reinforce the ability of ROAM to inform effective, equitable and sustainable FLR. The analysis uses the IUCN Natural Resource Governance Framework (NRGF) (Springer et al., 2021) as its primary lens and also takes into account FLR principles agreed to by the Global Partnership on FLR (GPFLR) (see Besseau et al., 2018). It analyses strengths, opportunities and challenges in how ROAM addresses governance in its guidance and practice. It then offers recommendations for further integrating governance issues in ROAM, as inputs for developing more comprehensive guidance and practice going forward. 1.1 Importance of governance for FLR and ROAM With vast areas of the globe facing deforestation and forest degradation, FLR has become a priority involving numerous actors. To date, 61 countries, through 74 pledges, have collectively committed to restoring 210 million hectares of degraded and deforested land in response to the Bonn Challenge2 and associated regional platforms.3 Further, recognising the wider loss and degradation of ecosystems, the United Nations has declared 2021\u20132030 a Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. There is increasing evidence and awareness that governance is fundamental to effective and equitable conservation (e.g. Bennett et al., 2019; Borrini-Feyerabend et al., 2013; Springer et al., 2021), including restoration (Mansourian, 2016). This includes growing recognition of the extensive coverage and conservation contributions of territories and areas governed by Indigenous peoples and local communities (e.g. Dawson et al., 2021; ICCA Consortium, 2021; IPBES, 2019). An expanding body of research addresses forest governance (e.g. Agrawal et al., 2008; Barrow et al., 2016; McDermott et al., 2010; Nuesiri, 2018; Ribot, 2016) and landscape governance (e.g. Blomley & Walters, 2019; G\u00f6rg, 2007; van Oosten, 2013; van Oosten et al., 2014; Ros-Tonen et al., 2014). While there is far less research on FLR and governance, this work is also growing (e.g. Erbaugh et al., 2020; Guariguata & Brancalion, 2014; Mansourian, 2016; Mansourian, 2017; McLain et al., 2021). This is crucial because, while insights from forest and landscape governance are useful, FLR presents distinct governance issues. Landscapes are social and ecological systems, shaped by decision-making and power relationships across multiple sectors and spatial and temporal scales. FLR involves and impacts many actors, including local rights-holders and stakeholders across landscapes. As Erbaugh et al. (2020, p. 1) note: 2 The Bonn Challenge is a global goal to bring 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested landscapes into restoration by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030. 3 See, for example, the AFR100 (the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative) and the 20x20 Initiative for Latin America.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30a95450-4d26-4e84-b0ae-3361566e7028": {"__data__": {"id_": "30a95450-4d26-4e84-b0ae-3361566e7028", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the integration of governance in forest landscape restoration opportunities assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03b128eb059cbaf83c7478e023158fddca1c0b9098b1d3f65cf3618ac5bcf4be"}, "2": {"node_id": "1c5ab9e8-a033-4333-9b97-c25bf925c741", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af063226a8c606dee2142595c2313743d21dbc4ed709d369ff190256a572affb"}}, "hash": "8a919f128d33ead3e7ee43fb3d1890504b78654256b5a821bfdf3976c9abb2f8", "text": "2 While \u201c[f]orest restoration occupies centre stage in global conversations about carbon removal and biodiversity conservation\u2026 recent research rarely acknowledges social dimensions or environmental justice implications related to its implementation\u2026 Forest landscape restoration that prioritizes local communities by affording them rights to manage and restore forests provides a promising option to align global agendas for climate mitigation, conservation, environmental justice and sustainable development.\u201d The governance aspects of FLR intervention design and implementation are critical, including how and by whom decisions are made, and how costs and benefits are distributed (e.g. Adams et al., 2016; Reed et al., 2016; Walters et al., 2019).

The large areas over which FLR is planned (through processes such as ROAM) concern many rights-holders and stakeholders with different rights, interests and power relationships. For example, in Madagascar\u2019s Fandriana-Marolambo landscape, WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature) International, with the endorsement of the Government of Madagascar, raised funding from the French government in 2004 to implement a FLR programme in a landscape with 150,000 people from three different ethnic groups. These communities were initially wary of engaging in the project. As a result, significant adjustments had to be made to the project once it had started (Mansourian et al., 2016). While concerns were ultimately addressed, this example demonstrates, inter alia, the importance of ensuring that the vision and priorities of local peoples and communities are reflected in and drive initial FLR conceptualisation and planning. This publication focuses on ROAM rather than comprehensively considering FLR governance. ROAM aims to operationalise FLR principles and is a widely used methodology for identifying and prioritising FLR strategies and initiatives. Accordingly, a ROAM process contributes to the entire FLR process (including design, implementation and monitoring) and is a means to an end \u2013 not the end in itself. In different FLR phases, distinct aspects of governance may take on more importance (Mansourian, 2016). For ROAM, governance issues related to FLR planning and initiation tend to be most important/prominent. Furthermore, governance opportunities and challenges in the landscape will largely define how the ROAM process is carried out and what outcomes it generates. Key issues may relate, for instance, to tenure conflict (Lovelock & Brown, 2020; McLain et al., 2021) or lack of cross-sectoral coordination (Mansourian, 2017). Therefore, the rights-holders and stakeholders convening and participating in the ROAM process need to consider not only the state of governance in the landscapes in which restoration opportunities are being assessed, but also prioritise effective and equitable FLR strategies and approaches that can adapt to a changing governance context over time. ROAM guidance and processes address governance issues to varying extents and in evolving ways. A more systematic integration of natural resource governance principles can add value to ROAM.

With respect to both guidance and practice, the analysis considers, as much as possible, the process (e.g. how ROAM assessments are, or are meant to be, governed) and content (e.g. how governance issues in the target landscapes are, or are meant to be, considered during those processes). Audience: This publication aims to support ROAM practitioners, including conveners, coordinators, facilitators and other participants in the process. Some recommendations also pertain to ROAM guidance and training. It assumes that the reader is familiar with ROAM, including its phases and main steps. Methodology: Primary analysis methods used are: (1) review of the most relevant ROAM guidance; (2) analysis of four ROAM processes (from assessments in Colombia, Indonesia, Malawi and Rwanda) based on interviews and document review; and (3) additional research, including review of selected literature.

Therefore, while most practice-related findings and lessons are drawn from the four focal cases, the analysis also considers recent innovations in ROAM approaches, based on co- authors\u2019 experience and interviewee and reviewer inputs. Comprehensiveness: While this analysis aims to be fairly comprehensive, there is always more to learn. Interviews were largely limited to individuals from convening organisations. They do not include direct accounts from participating community members. This should be a priority for future analysis. Although interviewees were generally open, it was difficult to obtain information about certain issues, including aspects of accountability. This may be due in part to budget constraints that limited the time available for research and necessitated remote interviews. 4 Where data was available, the analysis also considers impacts, including how and to what extent ROAM has resulted in FLR coordination or implementation. 5 This refers to the name of the programme at the time that this publication was developed. FCP is now integrated into the IUCN Forest and Grassland Team. 4 2 Alignment between NRGF and FLR principles The analysis in this publication was undertaken using the NRGF, an IUCN knowledge resource created to provide a robust, inclusive and credible approach to assessing and improving natural resource governance. At its core is a normative framework of values, principles and criteria for equitable and effective natural resource governance (Springer et al., 2021; see also Annex 1). The NRGF aims to be applicable to diverse levels and natural resource governance contexts, including restoration. This analysis also takes account of the FLR principles agreed to by the Global Partnership on FLR (GPFLR) in 2018, which ROAM seeks to operationalise and advance.6 These principles unpack and describe the FLR process. Table 1 shows the alignment between these two sets of principles. Several points of caution are necessary in understanding this alignment mapping. Firstly, the two sets of principles reflect different objects: a normative framework for governance (NRGF) versus largely descriptive elements of a long-term forest landscape restoration process (FLR). Secondly, they address different subjects. NRGF principles focus on governance, while FLR principles focus on many dimensions of FLR (including governance). In particular, and in keeping with some of the most widely used definitions of FLR, the FLR principles reflect, among others, FLR\u2019s: (1) dual social-ecological dimensions; (2) scale (the landscape); and (3) long-term nature. Finally, the mapping only considers principles. The fuller meaning of NRGF principles is elaborated in criteria that consider, inter alia, the laws and policies, processes and practices that enable their realisation (see Annex 1). Despite these differences, governance is intrinsic to many FLR principles and thus, many of the NRGF principles can apply to and reinforce those of FLR. At the same time, the NRGF generally goes further in describing key elements of effective and equitable governance. Therefore, the NRGF can add value and deepen the approach to governance within ROAM, as part of longer-term FLR. Specifically, the mapping exercise (Table 1) highlights that: \u2212 Two principles, concerning participation and the recognition and inclusion of diverse knowledge and cultures, apply relatively strongly to both NRGF and FLR. \u2212 Three NRGF principles are moderately aligned with/reflected in FLR principles. \u2212 Three NRGF principles are weakly aligned with/reflected in FLR principles. \u2212 Two NRGF principles do not appear to be considered in the FLR principles, namely: accountability and fair and effective rule of law. \u2212 One FLR principle (maintain and enhance natural ecosystems within landscapes) does not map explicitly with any NRGF principle but reflects instead an underlying NRGF value. 6 The FLR principles have seen many iterations. The most widely agreed upon are those articulated by the GPFLR (see Besseau et al., 2018, Fig. 4, p. 18). ROAM initially worked with eight principles, which were broadly similar to those from GPFLR (see IUCN & WRI, 2014). However, more recently, the ROAM process has adopted the GPFLR set of six principles.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8602d5a2-5430-4f91-a571-969f88071066": {"__data__": {"id_": "8602d5a2-5430-4f91-a571-969f88071066", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing the integration of governance in forest landscape restoration opportunities assessments", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e27ec8f2e77a8608599b8570a4ed2ffd719fcebcfd7479b6a528292085038142"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f2d0f3a-a294-47f2-a9ce-1e26cf07c3bd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-integration-governance-forest-landscape-restoration", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7fedb5865d98a192b20c8e9d92d7fef544a89a389359bffaad13307c96e08123"}}, "hash": "60004f2afe55c5cac84eb3c198e5abcb99a304537e0ed0e30515dac78f6cfe1c", "text": "5 Table 1: Alignment between NRGF and FLR principles NRGF principles FLR principles Inclusive decision-making: Decision-making regarding natural resource policies and practices is based on the full and effective participation of all relevant actors, with particular attention to the voice and inclusion of rights-holders and groups at risk of marginalisation.

The governance related lessons from each case are then analysed in Section 5, in relation to NRGF principles. As described in Section 1.2 (Scope and methods), these cases were selected in collaboration with IUCN, based on the criteria that they each had sufficient information available, included IUCN as a partner, and had completed all ROAM phases, as well as collectively covering diverse regions and lessons. 4.1 Colombia11 Restoration has become a key activity for Colombia to achieve its national conservation priorities and international commitments. The ROAM process in eastern Antioquia identified options for increased connectivity between landscapes, ecosystems and habitats, and provided insight into the potential for FLR in post-conflict Colombia (see Table 3). The process positioned FLR as a key activity to address the 2016 peace agreement, including through enabling alternative livelihood options for the 600,000 displaced people returning to previously occupied conflict zones.

Eastern Antioquia has been strongly impacted by the country\u2019s 50-year conflict, where many people were kidnapped or killed or have fled to escape the conflict. The Antioquia region as a whole includes 20% of those who were displaced (over one million people) (Buitrago & Valencia, 2013). The high p\u00e1ramo (high-elevation ecosystem) still contains anti-personnel mines and many \u2018no-go zones\u2019. The 2016 peace accord impacts land use because it includes the creation of a fund to provide three million 11 Case background draws on ROAM report (Isaacs-Cubides et al., 2017) and key informant interviews. 12 For more information, please see: https://banco2.com/. 12 hectares of land to the most impacted rural communities. These lands are expected to come from the update, demarcation and strengthening of forest reserves, and communities are expected to develop plans to protect the environment and manage it sustainably (Bustos & Jaramillo, 2016). At the national level, Colombia\u2019s 2013\u20132023 National Restoration Plan (MADS, 2013) promotes restoration of degraded ecosystems while recognising traditional uses that do not degrade ecosystems. The plan has three priorities: (1) ecological restoration; (2) rehabilitation; and (3) reclamation. Each priority includes corresponding actions, objectives and
