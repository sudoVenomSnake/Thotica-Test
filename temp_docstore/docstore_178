The study has been funded through the Mekong Water Dialogues project with funds from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland. 6 2 Methods The methods used for assessing the vulnerability of the wetlands and wetland livelihoods to climate change received guidance from the MRC\u2018s case studies on climate change vulnerability of Mekong wetlands, the VCA analysis for community vulnerability, and the ICEM Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment and Adaptation (CAM). Climate change threat profiles for Kampong Thom province were taken from the USAID Mekong ARCC study. 2.1 Wetland and climate change case studies guidance One of the products of the MRC\u2018s basin-wide study of the impacts of climate change on wetlands was a manual providing guidance for wetland case studies (ICEM, 2012). This manual suggested nine steps for conducting such wetland climate change assessments: 1. Review institutional and policy frameworks at the local and national level for those elements which influence management and use of the site; 2. Describe the main biodiversity and ecosystem service characteristics of the site, their status and the ways they contribute to livelihoods; 3. Define the main features which determine the wetland type/category; 4. Document the nature and impact of past climate extremes on the wetland and the \u2015adaptation\u2016 responses by communities, government and others; 5. Assess the impact of projected climate change threats on the key \u2015assets\u2016 of the wetland; 6. Document the other development threats to the wetlands and the main drivers of change; 7. Define the adaptation options and their phasing to maintain and enhance the wetland\u2018s natural systems and services; 8. If resources permit, assess the cost of the impact of climate change on wetlands if no action is taken and the cost of adaptation; and 9. Define a road map for implementing an adaptation plan for the wetland. These steps together with component aspects to be studied are shown in Figure 2.1. This study focused on steps 2\u20136.The adaptation and management steps, and wetland valuation are for further follow-up and development. Of particular use for this study was the guidance provided in the manual for carrying out the assessments for: o Wetland hydrology field survey checklist; o Wetland habitat and biodiversity vulnerability; o Wetland ecosystem services trend analysis; and o Wetland livelihood vulnerability. 7 Figure 2.1: Nine-step approach for wetland and climate change case studies 8 2.2 Village consultations Village consultations were held in eight villages around the Beung Kiat Ngong wetlands in early January 2014. Half-day meetings were held in each village with about 30\u201340 participants, both men and women, from the communities. The meetings consisted of the following agenda items: o Introduction and explanation of the purpose and agenda; o Outline of potential climate changes and their implications; o Discussion on the village boundaries; o Discussion on the most important wetland products that the village obtains from the wetlands, mapping where these products are found and the seasonal calendar for collection and lifecycle of the wetland species; o Discussion on extreme events that have occurred over the last 40 years, and coping strategies; and o Discussions with the village head about village statistics (population, agriculture, livestock etc.). Where possible the results of the discussions were captured on sketch maps, calendars, and priority lists. 2.2.1 Key questions \u2013 wetland resources 1. What are the most important wetland resources that you collect and use? Rank their importance for your household. 2. At what time of year do you collect or process these resources?

Draw a wetland resource map identifying the main zones for collection of these resources. 4. Do you know if these wetland fauna use other areas for breeding, or as refuges during the dry season? This is a question about what they know of the life history of these animals. 5. How much of these resources does each household collect (each day, how many days a month, which months)? 6.

The methodology has been and continues to be developed and adapted to project 10 and case-specific needs. CAM is an overall conceptual approach that has been designed to integrate a wide range of tools and processes that can be applied at different levels and stages of climate change mitigation and adaptation planning. This description of the CAM process is taken from the USAID Mekong ARCC Main report. (ICEM, 2013) Figure 2.2: Vulnerability assessment and adaptation process Source: ICEM Figure 2.2 to Figure 2.4 summarize the CAM process steps and concepts. It has three main phases: vulnerability assessment, adaptation planning, and then adaptation implementation (Figure 2.2). This study has gone only part way along the adaptation process, focusing on the first phase of identifying impacts and assessing vulnerability for Beung Kiat Ngong habitats and species of relevance for livelihoods (Figure 2.3). 11 Figure 2.3: Climate change impact and vulnerability assessment process Source: ICEM The vulnerability assessment follows a recognized pattern of assessing the exposure and sensitivities to climate change threats, and the likely impacts that may result. When combined with the adaptive capacity of the species or system, a ranking and analysis of their vulnerability can be made. Figure 2.2, Figure 2.3 and Figure 2.4 are conceptual in nature. For their practical application, a precise step-wise process is defined and supported by a tool box which facilitates appropriate information inputs at each step. The operational vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning process involves six main components: 1. Determining the scope, by identifying the geographic and sector focus of the assessment and the species and systems (natural, social, economic, institutional, and built) which will be impacted. 2. Determining the climate change threats through an analysis of past extreme events and trends and through climate modelling and downscaling of future climate and hydrology against various scenarios.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb9e7989-4a09-4a2a-a8b2-66159bd222a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb9e7989-4a09-4a2a-a8b2-66159bd222a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate change vulnerability assessment for Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar Site, Lao PDR", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd530d6322f1e29449aea5af4180d1f2d8585703ee257a42a4106a113242387e"}, "2": {"node_id": "27cb64d4-1fe6-4ac1-aeeb-b6e1a317d0af", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a9ebd31773c62c4a05d5151d3dc1823fee27d21d6db47f63cbd0ffe8aea0533"}}, "hash": "5038a72177d1a4275eb289458cee985fdb506e65b536fbfeb1185c51e6e91740", "text": "The definition of projected climate change threats is part of the baseline\u2014it needs to be fine-tuned to the specific sensitivities of the species and areas under focus in the form of threat profiles. 3.

Conducting the impact assessment: for each of the target species and systems, the exposure, sensitivity, impact, and adaptive capacity were defined using the baseline and climate threat modelling results and matrix support tools developed by ICEM. The theme vulnerability assessments are summarized in the separate theme volumes to this report. The CAM method outlines four important factors in assessing vulnerability of the target species and systems to the defined climate change threats: exposure, sensitivity, impact, and adaptive capacity, and provides a set of tools to facilitate assessments at each stage (Figure 2.4). \uf0b7 Exposure is the degree of climate stress on a particular system or species; it is influenced by long-term changes in climate conditions, and by changes in climate variability, including the magnitude and frequency of extreme events. \uf0b7 Sensitivity is the degree to which a species or system will be affected by, or responsive to climate change exposure. \uf0b7 The potential impact (or level of risk) is a function of the level of exposure to climate change-induced threats, and the sensitivity of the target assets or system to that exposure. \uf0b7 Adaptive capacity is understood in terms of the ability to prepare for a future threat and in the process increase resilience and the ability to recover from the impact. Determinants of adaptive capacity include: \uf0b7 Natural systems o Species diversity and integrity o Species and habitat tolerance levels o Availability of alternative habitat o Ability to regenerate or spatially shift o For individual species: dispersal range and life strategy o Infrastructure o Availability of physical resources (e.g., materials and equipment) o Backup systems (e.g., a plan B) o Social factors o Social networks o Insurance and financial resources o Access to external services (medical, finance, markets, disaster response, etc.) o Access to alternative products and services o Crosscutting factors o The range of available adaptation technologies, planning, and management tools o Availability and distribution of financial resources o Availability of relevant skills and knowledge o Management, maintenance, and response systems including policies, structures, technical staff, and budgets o Political will and policy commitment. 13 Figure 2.4: Parameters and issues considered in the baseline and vulnerability assessment process Source: ICEM When impact and adaptation capacity are considered, a measure of relative vulnerability can be defined. The CAM method can use numerical scoring for exposure, sensitivity, impact, and adaptive capacity leading to a comparative score for vulnerability, or it can use qualitative terms from very low to very high with the aid of assessment tools which come with the method. Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 show the scoring matrices used in this study to assess impact and vulnerability. 14 Table 2.1: Determining impact: exposure X sensitivity Source: ICEM 15 Table 2.2: Determining vulnerability: impact / adaptive capacity Source: ICEM 2.4 Determining ecological response to climate change In 2008, IUCN Species Programme (Foden, 2008) produced a paper on species susceptibility to climate change in which the effects on different species could be associated with different predicted changes. A linkage diagram from that report is presented in Figure 2.5 and demonstrates the complex relationship between climatic factors and biotic response. This was used in the manual for rapid climate change assessments for wetland biodiversity in the Lower Mekong Basin (ICEM, 2012). It identifies some of the impacts that can be expected on wetland biodiversity in the Lower Mekong Basin. 16 Figure 2.5. Summary of some of the predicted aspects of climate change and examples of the effects that these are likely to have on species Source: Foden, 2008 The methods for determining the ecological response of habitats and species to climate change depend upon knowledge of the biological requirements for temperature and water availability/water level at different stages of the lifecycle of species, or in the year for habitats. Whilst complex ecological models may be available, at this level of analysis it is necessary to base the vulnerability assessment upon scientific judgment, based upon information from published papers on the biology and behavior of the habitats or species, their tolerances to temperature and drought etc. and local knowledge about these issues. It is important to identify key life stages where the organism is likely to be less tolerant, e.g. during breeding and juvenile development; flowering, fruiting and seed dispersal.

Other factors may include availability of food sources, or the resistance to parasites and diseases that may be reduced by climate change. 2.4.1 Comfort zones Comfort zones are where species and ecosystems experience the most suitable growing conditions in terms of the range and timing of temperature and rainfall. They are defined to include 50% of the baseline variability around the mean in temperature and rainfall for typical months, seasons and years. 17 All species have a range of climate in which they grow most comfortably. For agricultural crops usually that range is well understood\u2014climate parameters have been studied in detail and published widely. For example, it has been shown that maize grows well in areas that have a total annual precipitation of between 500 and 5,000 mm and mean maximum temperature in the range of 26\u00b0C to 29\u00b0C. Outside this range the growth of the plant is constrained or inhibited entirely. For wild species and habitats, the comfort range is poorly researched and documented, even if known anecdotally by local communities and managers. Comfort zone analysis requires information on the range of rainfall and temperature that was experienced during 50% of the historical baseline around the mean. For example, Figure 2-6 shows the wet season and dry season daily maximum temperature comfort zone for the Champasak. In this area the ecosystem is adapted to and comfortable within a daily maximum temperature of between 29\u00b0C and 32\u00b0C during the wet season and 30\u00b0C and 34.5\u00b0C during the dry season. By 2050 the daily maximum temperature during the wet season will shift completely outside the baseline comfort zone: in the dry season the maximum daily temperature will shift so that 50% of the maximum temperatures will occur in the range between 32 to 37\u00b0C. The comfort zone analysis enables the researchers to make rapid assessments on the relative impact of climate change on species and habitats.

It lies between 120\u2013200 m above sea level, partly within the Xe Pian National Protected Area (NPA) and to the south of Dong Hua Sao NPA which covers the southern slopes of the Bolaven Plateau. Both of these NPAs provide the streams which feed the wetland. Figure 3.1: Location of Beung Kiat Nong wetlands Source: IUCN 2011 19 The Ramsar site boundary in Figure 3.1 shows that the site has two almost separate wetland areas: the northern part, Beung Gnai Kiatngong on the map, and the southern wetland area between the villages of Phakha, Phapho and Phaly-Thong. The two areas are linked by a narrow corridor. The water in the northern area of wetlands is fed by streams from the north and from hills to the west, while the water flowing into the southern wetland area comes from a larger catchment to the south. The general direction of the water flow in the wetland is from north to south, flowing out into the Houay Tauang, and from there into the Xe Khampho which then joins the Xe Pian river and Sekong. The wetlands lie in a series of shallow basins, which have filled with peat and form a wetland complex of marsh, swamps, perennial and seasonal ponds, and seasonally flooded grasslands. Around the perimeter of the wetlands, the land has been converted to rain-fed rice paddy, especially in the southeastern portion where the wetlands have naturally filled in with accumulated sediment and decayed vegetation. Interspersed within these marshes and open waters, there are islands with shrubs and trees, and there are areas of rich semi- evergreen and seasonally flooded forest. Much of the wetland is not open water, but consists of relatively shallow water covered by a thick layer of decaying grasses with new shoots and emergent weeds as well as bushes growing on top of this layer. The deepest parts of the wetland may be as deep as two to three metres in the dry season. Within the main part of the wetland water permanence during the dry season is 300\u2013400 ha with other scattered small marshes and pools that retain water throughout the year.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3100ef6-8ed7-49ed-bf4e-eb472582d9b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3100ef6-8ed7-49ed-bf4e-eb472582d9b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate change vulnerability assessment for Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar Site, Lao PDR", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b1b6f81524b8df734b6b426fc4fed23c588ff2c62a62cd96ab31a11248e06ef"}, "2": {"node_id": "52060ad0-4d33-4e7f-aedc-8583877de656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "06cc4fa6e5c830696330b358ec487b8cd6e6a8383dc74a3c7b2b7b3c1c0cae0c"}}, "hash": "182ed95e8955be27ba5de26e63bb4a6c6f059f49111c619ca7157dd2e1ce66d0", "text": "During the wet season the whole area becomes inundated with water levels rising to two metres above the dry season levels.

Temperatures range from a minimum low of 14.5\u00b0C in January, when the humidity ranges between 32\u201395 % to a maximum high of 38.3\u00b0C in April with humidity ranging between 39\u201396%. During most of the wet season the humidity approaches 99%. The average rainfall at the site is around 2,000 mm annually with one third of the rainfall usually occurring in August (IUCN, 2011). Further 20 details of the community perceptions of the climate are provided in Chapter 5, and of climate projections and extreme events in Chapter 6. 3.3 Hydrological characteristics The Beung Kiat Ngong catchment is split into a smaller northern section, just draining the immediate slopes around the wetland and a larger southern portion as shown on the Google earth maps. The northern section of Beung Kiat Ngong appears to be extremely complicated hydrologically. The estimated area is about 46 km2, with most of the run-off coming from short seasonal streams running from the eastern slopes of the Xe Pian hills (Phou Asa etc.) and some run-off coming from the flat lands to the north. It is difficult to distinguish where are the main flows amongst the complex streams in this flat area; do they flow from north to south into the wetland, or west into Houay Tomo? The southern catchment feeds into the Houay Tauang which is a tributary of the Xe Khampho. This catchment is part of the Xe Khampho catchment and has a total area of 442.57 km2. Some characteristics of this catchment area are shown in Table 3.1(Meynell, 2013).

There is an indication of this in the reports of local people of two distinct major floods in 1978 (in the southern part) and 1979 (in the northern part). 22 Figure 3.2: A Google Earth interpretation of the catchment area of Houay Tauang into southern part of Beung Kiat Ngong (note the map is oriented in a west-east direction) by the authors. Figure 3.3: Catchment area for the northern part of Beung Kiat Ngong 23 3.4 Wetland habitats The wetland habitats in and around the Ramsar site have developed in a series of basins in the low lying plain, sandwiched between the Bolaven Plateau and the hills of Xe Pian NPA1. Lava flows from the ancient volcanic activity on the Bolaven have created a system of basins formed by natural dykes and dams. These basins have filled up with alluvial sediments and peat formation, and small areas of permanent wetland remain with open water at the centres of these basins. The Bung Gnai-Kiat Ngong (BGKN) in the northern part of the Ramsar site is the largest area of permanent marsh. The Ban Phapho basin is not much smaller but has now almost totally filled, and has therefore been converted largely to paddy. In contrast to the larger basins, many small but often steep-sided basins have larger proportions of permanent wetland. These small basins are often tree-covered and have open water rather than marsh vegetation. A complex network of streams may connect all the larger basins. Precise drainage patterns are not at all obvious and often convoluted, although drainage is roughly north to south. Some of the small basins are either isolated or are connected to the rest of the system only at very high water levels. Some larger basins may also be relatively isolated. Wetland types vary considerably in the Pathoumphone wetlands. Seasonal wetlands predominate in total area, but their ratio to permanent wetlands, hard to estimate, may vary year to year. The full wetland extent is hard to visualize because of forest cover, as are patterns of connectivity between wetlands. No accurate map yet exists. Most basins appear to interconnect, rather than to be connected by drainage channels per se. The different wetland habitat types that can be distinguished are: o Perennial ponds- Areas of relatively permanent open water with aquatic plants seem rather limited in the large basins, especially within the main BGKN marsh. There are three main types of permanent ponds: open water with various aquatic herbs (both floating and submerged), open water below shrubs and bushes (and, in smaller basins, trees), and floating vegetation mats. o Seasonal ponds-During the wet season, open-water habitats become relatively common throughout the edges, although patches are often small. These have abundant ephemeral floating and aquatic herbs, as well as species with above- ground structures presumably dying back during the dry season. More deeply, but not permanently, inundated regions hold Lotus Nelumbo nucifera, such as around the southern edge of the permanent main BGKN marsh. o Small seasonal and perennial streams-There are a number of small seasonal and perennial streams which flow into the wetland from the surrounding hills, and interconnecting streams between the basins flowing in a generally north to south direction. o Peatmarshes \u2013 Peat marshes have formed from decaying vegetation under acidic and anaerobic conditions in some areas, particularly in the northern part of the 1This section of the report has been drawn from the recent biodiversity survey of Beung Kiat Ngong for IUCN by Timmins and Duckworth (Timmins, 2014). 24 wetland. There are about 400 ha of high quality peat land in the northern part and about 1,000 ha of lower quality seasonal semi-peatlands in the southern part.

Where inundation and soil water logging are not prolonged, the predominant cover appears to be various grass species. In places such as the north-east of the main BGKN marsh, one species of grass forms almost a monoculture over about a tenth of the total marsh. o Floating vegetation mats -The extent of floating mats is hard to estimate: in most areas they are not readily distinguishable from areas of graminoids rooted into the wetland bed. They probably occupy 20\u201330% of the main BGKN marsh. Mats are typically difficult to reach, so their composition is uncertain. Mat vegetation in the main BGKN marsh seems predominantly graminoid-based, with Imperata cylindrica prevailing. Very few, if any, shrubs grow in the mat itself, although, apparently rooted in the wetland bed, they are common but sparse in a zone around the mats. Some mats in the Pathoumphone wetlands do have shrubs: dense shrub and small tree growth (probably involving willows Salix) e.g. Nong Pakham andmuch of central Nong Boua had what appeared to be most likely a floating mat composed of a dense mix of shrubs, aroids, sedges (but not \u2017purr\u2018) and ferns. o Shrubland - In other parts of the main BGKN marsh the community is richer with a mix of grasses, sedges and herbs. A shrub probably Sesbania often occurs in quite extensive clumps, possibly in association with ground depressions with longer inundation. o Swamp forests- Larger basins typically have small clumps of taller vegetation, varying in composition, but include various tree and shrub species. Commonly the shrubs were overgrown with vine, ferns and a large aroid. These areas probably indicate deeper ground depressions, corresponding to elements of swamp forest, especially around the basin edges. In the main BGKN marsh, they tend to occur on edges furthest from frequent human use (e.g. paddies, grazing land and villages). The swamp forest areas on the edge are in general larger and taller, with trees rather than the smaller bush-like trees and shrubs within the marsh. Bruselaceous trees, such as Barringtonia, are conspicuous in such swamp forest edges. These swamp forest areas are generally small patches less than a hectare in size, typically 25 bounding the wetland edge in direct contact with remnant \u2017dry-land\u2018 forest. All swamp forest is probably disturbed, primarily through timber removal and clearance of adjacent areas for agriculture. As usual under a swamp forest canopy, plant growth is relatively sparse. o Rice paddies- Images on Google Earth suggest paddies already comprise perhaps 30\u201340% of total cover in these large basins. However, the main Beung Kiat Ngong basin retains a larger extent of more natural cover. Paddies cover only about a tenth of it, mainly along the western and northern edge, and probably receive shorter inundation than is typical in areas of more natural cover(Timmins, 2014). Established paddies are almost confined to basins, with mostly alluvial soils (rather than organic \u2017peat\u2018 soils). \u2017Dryland\u2018 agriculture including plantations is increasing at the expense of forest. The shallow soils, perhaps minerally rich, seem not to hinder seasonal agriculture significantly. o Surrounding dry-land habitats, generally degraded, would originally have consisted of two broad forest categories. The lava flows themselves support predominantly deciduous communities, variously named by different classification systems (e.g. mixed deciduous forest; nearly-deciduous forest; nearly fully deciduous semi-evergreen forest).

The very valuable NTFP tree, Scaphium macropodum from which Malva nuts (Mak chong) are gathered occur in these forest areas. 3.5 Changes in vegetation Marsh vegetation is likely to be very dynamic, through various factors, notably fire, livestock grazing and timber removal.

This suggests that floating mat vegetation was also then scarce. \uf0b7 Salvinia (\u2017chok\u2018) was then reportedly much more common. In 2013\u20132014 only sporadic small dense patches were found, amongst other vegetation in the seasonally inundated edge. \uf0b7 Bush and tree cover had also reportedly decreased, especially in the main BGKN marsh. 26 However, this timeline may be inaccurate, because Salter (1989) described, 25 years ago, essentially the same habitat mix for the main BGKN marsh as now: \u2015Margin adjacent to forest now dry (but seasonally flooded) grassland up to 500+ m wide. Very heavily grazed by cattle and water buffalo and also by domestic elephants. Central area appears permanently saturated and supports dense growth of tall (1 m) sedges and patches of low (<2 m) shrubs. Open water limited to small patches <0.1 ha in size with water lettuce [Pistia] and other floating aquatics\u2016. The loss of tree and bush cover is almost certainly attributable to human activities. Several local people considered that trees and shrubs surrounding deeper depressions might be cut to reach the wetland products in these more permanent wetlands. When cut, the trees and shrubs are placed in the water to create \u2017substrate and structure\u2018 in order to attract fish and other aquatic animals. Other damage is likely to arise from activities including fodder collection, timber and other wood removal, livestock trampling, especially by elephants, and fire. Similarly, the fringing forest that until recently dominated the edges of even the open wetlands, is being rapidly degraded and lost by a combination of timber removal and agricultural clearance, primarily for non-rice crops. Livestock use of the wetlands can change the vegetation structure. Livestock using the marsh, especially buffalo, have reportedly decreased substantially as local economies move from subsistence- to market-based systems. Buffalo can modify and maintain various marsh characteristics, including species composition via selective grazing and browsing, and if there are fewer animals remaining, then the species composition is also likely to change. The larger basins\u2018 open nature reflects three interacting factors: fire, large ungulates and people. Without these, swamp forest would predominate in all seasonally inundated areas (including those that might dry only in very rare dry years). Even without people, herbivores and fire would maintain many large basins as open seasonal wetlands. But the three factors also tend to remove seasonal tall cover of grasses, sedges and Sesbania. This latter factor is particularly significant because in the late dry season when the wet area is at its lowest the cover available for wetland animals is also most limited. 3.6 Biodiversity - key species This section focuses on the main species found in the wetlands that are important to the livelihoods of the communities surrounding the wetlands. 3.6.1 Flora There is not a great deal of information about the floral species in the Beung Kiat Ngong wetlands. In 2009, a survey of medicinal plants found in the wetlands and surrounding forests identified more than 240 species (180 genera and 80 families of vascular plants) used by traditional healers in the area including Tinospora crispa, a climbing woody liana in mixed deciduous forests, used in the treatment of diabetes; Desmodium lanceolatum, a perennial non-climbing woody shrub in the forest understory used for a variety of ailments including hypertension, dysentery, worms, fevers and stomach upsets; Orthsiphon stamineus, a herb distinguished by its white or purple-coloured flowers used as herbal tea; Vitex trifolia, a large shrub or tree used for fever and as a mosquito deterrent. One of the most important economically important trees in the forests around Beung Kiat Ngong is the 27 Malva nut tree, Scaphium macropodum. This is a masting species, flowering and fruiting in large quantities on a three to four year cycle. The nuts contain a bassorine gum, which though not soluble in water, swells up to form a gel, which is then used for a variety of medicines against diarrhea, sore throats, coughs, inflammation and urinary complaints.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7bff1672-5b0d-4561-aafd-12d9e1f0e344": {"__data__": {"id_": "7bff1672-5b0d-4561-aafd-12d9e1f0e344", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate change vulnerability assessment for Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar Site, Lao PDR", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7219a450ab73258f5b7455e5a93a2b45fef71f74c9060bd23417fa1bc6139f9e"}, "2": {"node_id": "b4a9077b-7c66-4162-bc4c-1f32105e9870", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c70dee8a48f4780267c52a928fa6ca3b27345acbc0d593d6ebece20f7a68620c"}}, "hash": "43a0e88eff17b3ef259e7e5ed9a28e602bfd4718e5fa772b1defc2258a1994e9", "text": "Of the wetland plants that have been mentioned in the habitat discussion: \uf0b7 Grasses that form the floating mats and seasonally inundated grassland.

It serves as good herbage when ploughed in as green manure. In India and Malaysia, the tubers are a good source of starch, where it is also used in traditional medicine. In the Philippines and Malaysia it is harvested for mat-making and string(Plantwise, 2014). \uf0b7 Wetland trees include Xanthophyllum flavescens (Khok seng), which grows on the edges of the wetlands and swamp forest.

Most species are specifically adapted to such conditions, and can breathe air, are able to move overland in search of freshwater bodies, and some can survive out of water for long periods e.g. Climbing perch.

Although breathing is slowed down, the fish remains active and flees if it is disturbed. They emerge from their burrows at the beginning of the wet season as the water level starts to rise. 3.6.3 Molluscs Shells or snails are ranked the third most important wetland product by the communities of Beung Kiat Ngong. There are believed to be two native species of large operculate snails collected: the large apple snail, Pila polita, and another large apple snail, probably P. pesmei or P. ampullacea, recorded in Nong Kasay, which appears to be less common(Timmins, 2014). The third large snail species which is now widespread in many areas of the Beung Kiat Ngong wetlands is the South American invasive Golden apple snail, Pomacea canaliculata, which was first reported in about 2008. In contrast to Pomacea, P. polita appears to require permanent wetland, and has been found in the main Beung Kiat Ngong marsh, the Nong Pakau complex and Nong Kasay. According to Timmins (2014), local sources have reported declines in the native snails following the arrival of the Golden Apple snail, which now appears to be more common than the native apple snail. The invasion has also been reported to be linked to significant damage to rice crops. Although the invasive species is eaten, it was commonly reported to taste inferior to the two native apple snails. Pila polita, is a widespread species throughout south and South East Asia, found in calm freshwater habitats, such as paddy fields, ponds, klongs, pools and slow moving streams. They are unisexual, with females laying eggs near the banks. The species harbours metacercariae of Echinostoma ilocanum which can cause Garrison's fluke infection (Echinostomiasis) and Angiostrongyliasis. It is listed as of Least Concern in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species(IUCN, 2014). Pomacea canaliculata feeds on floating or submersed higher plants, detritus and animal matter. Diet may vary with age, with younger smaller individuals feeding on algae and detritus, and older, bigger (15mm and above) individuals later shifting to higher plants. In tropical areas, reproduction is continuous. The egg masses laid on the stalks of plants just above the water surface are a very obvious pink or orange colour. Listed under the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as of Least Concern, it is recognized as being one of the top 100 globally invasive species. 3.6.4 Amphibians and Reptiles Frogs There is no information on the species of amphibians found in Beung Kiat Ngong. However, community consultations indicate that all villages collect frogs, and they are ranked overall as the fourth most important wetland product while in two villages, Nong Mak Ek and Kele frogs are ranked second to fish in importance. 30 Turtles The turtles found in Beung Kiat Ngong wetlands include: o Malayan snail-eating turtle, Malaemys subtrijuga \u2013 Listed as Vulnerable in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and also known as the \u2015rice field turtle\u2016. It is favoured for its meat and is also used in traditional medicine; o Yellow headed temple turtle, Hieremys annandalii \u2013 Listed as Endangered in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species; and o Elongated tortoise, Indotestudo elongata \u2013 Listed as Endangered IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Timmins (2014) considers that because of the extent and complexity of the Beung Kiat Ngong wetlands several species of turtle are still likely to persist, of which Yellow-headed Temple Turtle Hieremys annandalii would be the most significant. Populations of all species are very likely to be highly depleted. Nevertheless, the Beung Kiat Ngong wetlands still have considerable national and regional significance for aquatic turtles, particularly H. annandalii which is large and easily exploited and depleted, and has a relatively small global range.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "939b15e5-a6c8-465d-b8cb-7764e24746c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "939b15e5-a6c8-465d-b8cb-7764e24746c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate change vulnerability assessment for Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar Site, Lao PDR", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0228cef431a8c1b7f7a118099fc7703a1dfe7cc196ac19fd9c640a477f52c36e"}, "2": {"node_id": "14cc6dda-e9d0-4234-80a5-ba9f04719b4f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c757e3769996454f07592abf6bf1e894d19c29c842eb331b3f30dd7d0c3759f5"}}, "hash": "b10a154a65d9b23acfd230b7e332c5fc444874c391a15b1495319cf07ba822a8", "text": "The Elongated Tortoise, Indotestudo elongata, a terrestrial species characteristic of deciduous dipterocarp forest and highly deciduous semi-evergreen forest, is unlikely to survive in significant numbers and might already have been extirpated.

The communities also indicated that collection of turtles was still continuing despite their declining numbers. 3.6.5 Birds Beung Kiat Ngong is considered to be an important site for bird feeding and nesting, as part of the Xe Pian NPA. It is particularly important for small and medium-sized water birds, and for seed eating birds that depend upon the grasses in the wetland.

The recent surveys by Timmins and Duckworth confirm the steady decline in bird numbers in Beung Kiat Ngong since the previous surveys in 2008(Timmins, 2014). The birds that were recorded recently include: Cotton Pygmy-goose, Buttonquail, Stork-billed Kingfisher, Green Bee-eater, White-breasted Waterhen, Eurasian Marsh Harrier, Pied Harrier, Black-crowned Night Heron and weavers. The Asian Open-bill stork appears to be increasing in numbers, and this is of interest because it is the main predator of the invasive Golden Apple snails (Timmins, 2014). Birds ranked eleventh in the list of important wetland products and were only listed for Nong Mak Ek, Kiat Ngong and Kele. They are also important as one of the ecotourism attractions. 3.6.6 Mammals The large mammals of conservation significance that may have existed in these wetlands are already known to be extirpated. Four species of otter should occur in these wetlands, but the lack of signs of otters would indicate that these are rare. Two species of cat, Jungle Cat (Felis chaus) and the Endangered Fishing Cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) are thought to occur 31 in the corridor between Xe Pian NPA and Dong Hua Sao NPA. The most common signs of mammals are from wild pigs, muntjacs, squirrels (Callosciurus finalysonii williamsoni and Tamiops spp), Northern tree shrew, Small Asian mongoose and Siamese Hare (IUCN, 2011). Hunting pressure and the illegal wildlife trade results in major pressure on both mammals and birds. 3.7 Land use As indicated above, the coverage of rice fields in the Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar site is between 30\u201340% with only about 10% in the northern section of Beung Gnai Kiat Ngong(Timmins, 2014). The rest of the Ramsar site is the natural wetland area. Rice fields are generally used for a single rain-fed crop, apart from 30 ha of irrigated rice in Phalai and 10 ha each in Phapho and Phakha. After harvesting the fields are left for grazing animals, and dung collection from the fields was mentioned (and observed) in Phapho village, where they can get LAK 5,000 for one sack of dung. Table 3.3 shows the village land-use statistics obtained from village records during consultation meetings. There are some anomalies here, but rain-fed rice shows a total 1,387 ha and 50 ha of irrigated rice amongst the eight communities. This is about 50% of the total wetland area, but does not take into account the rice fields belonging to the communities outside of the Ramsar site boundaries, but roughly confirms the estimates mentioned above. There are about 540 ha of gardens (which may be an overestimate), 5 ha of graveyards, 3 ha of sacred forests and 11 ha of reforested area in Kele. Fish conservation zones are recognized in Kele and Kiat Ngong. The Beung Kiat Ngong baseline report (IUCN, 2011) shows that there were a total of 323 ha of rice fields in the wetland area and about 4.5 ha of gardens according to field measurements in 2009.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "beb8a7c3-ab9e-4fb9-830b-cae4ef02f36b": {"__data__": {"id_": "beb8a7c3-ab9e-4fb9-830b-cae4ef02f36b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate change vulnerability assessment for Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar Site, Lao PDR", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dcbdf54806c527e4dea5c7ad18c3a9ad595daa771189cf0593f2f3343fd82d20"}, "2": {"node_id": "7a922fe5-35f4-4e03-a3d0-d78e60196e8f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "73d4cac81353e8d6aa8741daf4f7fca04fcedf69599a6cbe863eca13be8c9040"}}, "hash": "5cbdbbd1ae2a760e2ea60a4d0a55a1133ef8cf4bc5e0dc4ba5afbf451f3c18c7", "text": "32 Table 3.3: Village land use statistics Total Areas of different use Purposes Population Village Total Areas Land for Shelters Agriculture Production area (Rainfed rice) Irrigated Ricefield Garden Grave yard Village Sacred forest Village land Flatplain area Plateau area Others (island, Streams, ponds) Reforestated forest Village Fish conservation Zone Number of Households Number of Families Village Total ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha PhaPho 1,826 319 382 682 85 236 10 - - 3 - - - - Wet season: 1.5 km long; 15 m wide; Dry season:1.5 km long; 10 m wide (Houay PhaPHo) Nong Mak EK 1,036 107 141 61,085 1 144 - 1 3 - 61 - - - Pha Lai 1,496 283 309 5,252 128 276 30 10 2 0 1 - - 271 Kiat Ngong 1,055 196 223 3,752 840 229 - 500 - - - - - 2 (01 Vang Paa Orr Fish conservation Area (1ha); 01 Vang Paa Boua FCA (1ha)) Phommaleu 7,646 134 162 773 48,166 96 - - - - - - - Kaelae 1,009 163 188 10,300 34 118 - 19 - - 10,300 - - - 11 Thopsok 617 90 94 750 118 land pieces 120 - 48 (Kitchen garden) 3 land pieces - 750 - Phak Kha 838 130 161 5,004 32,178 167 10 10 - - - 752 4,263 2,487,473 Totals 15,523 1,422 1,660 87,598 81,432 1,387 50 539 5 3 11,112 752 4,263 2,487,744 11 Number of Households Number of Families Village 33 3.8 Conservation and zoning of Beung Kiat Ngong The southern part of the wetlands lies in Xe Pian which was declared a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a67cb82a-be9b-4ada-a045-875ad152c4e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "a67cb82a-be9b-4ada-a045-875ad152c4e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate change vulnerability assessment for Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar Site, Lao PDR", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f3b4ec2d5347d85b859b7b7ee361948c4622e22653544ec2867bd3e7c2d55de"}, "3": {"node_id": "34cec779-878b-4734-b3b0-f97902b86398", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b1ba4813bc196393a506b485755800e2339e5a2e6a9384186ded5d6348032ff"}}, "hash": "429325ab301c6eebd59e515c800acdbacf1e73da4f17e699cb3e6bdd4ffdf11b", "text": "nationally protected area (NPA)in 1993.

All villages have a primary school, with secondary schools in Phapho, Phalai and Kiat Ngong. None of the villages mentioned a health centre. All villages had at least one temple except for Phakha which has two. There was quite a lot of variation in the number of latrines, dug and pumped wells. In Kiat Ngong there were 10 biogas plants, though one of these was recorded as being not in operation.

The village consultations gave estimates of the numbers of livestock in each village as shown in Table 4.4. There are a total of 991 buffalo, 2,611 cows, 13 elephants(of which only one remains in Phapho and all the rest are in Kiat Ngong), 1,559 pigs and 8,814 poultry. Kiat Ngong has the largest number of buffalo and Phapho the largest numbers of cattle. This perhaps reflects the main difference between cattle and buffalo: the buffalo go into the areas with floating grass mats, i.e. around the main marsh areas in the north, compared to cattle which feed around the edges and rarely go into the water, i.e. in the farmland around Phapho. 10 out of the 12 elephants in Kiat Ngong are females, and the herd is declining despite the demand for elephant tourism, because the owners do not wish to breed with their animals. One of the two remaining elephants in Phapho died recently and will not be replaced. Around Kiat Ngong, elephants are released to graze in the grasslands overnight. Table 4.4: Livestock numbers in each of the eight wetland villages Changes in livestock numbers since an IUCN survey in 2008 are shown in Table 4.5. When converting these livestock numbers to \u2015grazing units\u2016 (GU) (Elephants = 10 GU; Buffalo = 1.5 GU; Cattle = 1 GU). It can be seen that the number of grazing units of animals using the wetlands has fallen slightly from 4,752 in 2008 to 4,228 in 2014. In analyzing this further there has been a decrease in the numbers of buffalo by 34%, and 38% in the numbers of elephants, but an increase of 13.5% in the numbers of cattle. In some villages such as Phapho and Nong Mak Ek, there have been overall increases. However, all of the other villages recorded slight decreases in the grazing units. Some additional animals may be grazed in the wetlands from other non-core villages: the 2008 report indicates a total of 1,174 grazing units using the wetlands, making a total of 5,430.

There was some variation between the villages, but all noted the importance of fish and eels, while snails and frogs were consistently ranked 3rd and 4th. Turtles varied considerably and only Phalai did not including them. Other villages ranked turtles quite low, while others ranked them 4th or 5th. This would indicate that they are still found throughout the wetland, still valued although rare. In Kele and Phommaleu, the communities noted that there were declines in wetland products, especially fish, due to overfishing and the use of electric fishing. 42 Table 4.7: Ranking of wetland products Village population Fish Eel Shell Frog Wild vegetables Turtles Shrimps Mushroom Bamboo shoot Kha & Pheu (tall weeds) Birds Crickets Total items Use Status PhaPho 1,826 1.Fish; 2.

Importance rank 43 4.6 Perceived non-climate threats to wetland habitats and livelihoods It is clear the wetland products are a substantial livelihood resource for communities living around the wetlands, but declines in these resources are already being noted. The IUCN baseline report (IUCN, 2011) on Beung Kiat Ngong lists a number of threats and the recent biodiversity survey by Timmins and Duckworth (2014) has further elucidated some of the other threats: \uf0b7 Peat extraction for fertilizer, which was stopped in 2010, has left a number of pits in the wetland which have now filled with water and are used as fish ponds. Timmins and Duckworth (2014) comment that peat extraction has targeted several areas, including the northern edge of the main Beung Kiat Ngong marsh and Thong Namniap (both of which have been halted) as well as Nong Phommaleu (where it is still ongoing). In general peat extraction was not particularly extensive: in the main Beung Kiat Ngong marsh, at most around 3 ha had been affected. \uf0b7 Unsustainable harvest of aquatic resources such as fish and wildlife, and of NTFPs such as Malva nuts is an additional pressure. Trees have been cut down to harvest the Malva nuts more quickly. Hunting pressure has reduced the bird and mammal populations dramatically, and decline is also beginning to show in fish populations. Turtles are particularly favoured and hunting pressure on these species is strong. Timmins and Duckworth (2014) state that \u2015Hunting is without any doubt the primary reason for the paucity of species observed, and especially the lack of any resident species of global conservation concern.\u2016 \uf0b7 Changes in numbers of cattle and buffalo. The 2008 report states that with 5,400 \u2015grazing units\u2016 the wetlands provide a very important function for the local economy. It raises concern that with the numbers of grazing units increasing as the population grows, there will be increasing pressure on the wetlands. The trends in livestock numbers discussed above would seem to indicate an overall reduction in grazing units, particularly in buffalo and elephants, but an increase in the number of cattle. In fact cattle do not venture very far into the marsh areas and feed mainly in the dried paddy fields and surrounding areas, so the grazing pressure on the wetlands is in fact lower than before, though there may be increased pressure on the surrounding forest habitats. \uf0b7 Agricultural practices such as increased fertilizer use and future irrigation projects that may divert water from the wetlands are significant threats to the wetland. Agricultural water demands are also likely to become a significant factor in future ecological changes, potentially both decreasing and increasing water levels, depending on the use of the basin in question, e.g. water abstraction for irrigation or dyking of basins to increase water retention. \uf0b7 Tree and bush loss in general is a serious threat to the wetlands, especially the swamp forests. Timber removal is most serious around the wooded edges of the large open wetlands, where relatively large old trees are targeted. The demand for timber is such that even relatively small trees are now being cut. Timber removal is a lesser threat within swamp forests, where the trees have lower timber value. \uf0b7 Illegal encroachment of forest and wetland areas for conversion to agricultural land and plantations. Swamp forests seem threatened most prominently by 44 agricultural clearance either within the wetlands or directly adjacent to them. There has probably been substantial loss of forest between the early 1990s and 2014. Other reasons for swamp forest clearance include: to ease the harvesting of fish from open water pools and to create duck or fish ponds. Swamp forest trees, may also be cut for livestock fodder and firewood.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1f8376c-043b-4fda-ac56-ae7f229697e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1f8376c-043b-4fda-ac56-ae7f229697e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate change vulnerability assessment for Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar Site, Lao PDR", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "982d00370d727ac0061b72f2fb28cd2c0ee25434f9279dda9f080d451af0114b"}, "2": {"node_id": "08e1ef7c-207e-451d-ab25-bcdf1ace2042", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5374603fb66f9f22503db7b89e1dfeb19307050900fbab8990eb34c68c4447ab"}}, "hash": "e0ed5b3676601a12f83e0dfaf9d2c14f988d0fb83ef05e965d0bc5ef28a93424", "text": "Swamp forest trees, may also be cut for livestock fodder and firewood.

The overall picture of the climate is that the hottest months are April and May, and the wettest months are July and August. According to the people in Phalai, strong winds tend to occur in May. The people of Kele say these last about two hours.) Lightning occurs in August/September. In Phapho, forest fires are said to occur every year. The small streams entering the wetlands tend to flow during the wet season. In Phommaleu and Thopsok, the Houay Nong Lak and Houay Kout Pao flow into the wetland from the north respectively. In the wet season the latter stream is recorded to be too high for people to cross easily. In Phakha, the streams drain Phou Asa and Phou Phaema and flow towards the Pha Moud river. The out-flowing streams mentioned by villagers from Nong Mak Ek include Houay Leng Kharm, H. Ta Kouane, H. Sisalieo, Vang Kae and Vang Imoune. 5.2 Historic extreme events In terms of extreme events, discussions raised memories in all villages of the big flood in 1978 which lasted for 15 days in Phakha. Floods in other years affected individual villages usually in July and August. Only in 2013 were floods mentioned in three villages, Phommaleu, Kele and Phakha, and this occurred in September. In addition, in Phalai, floods occurred in 2002 and 2008, and in Phommaleu in 1988, 1991 and 2011. In Thopsok they occurred in 1987 and 1996, and in Phakha they occurred in 2000, lasting for 30 days, and 2010, lasting for 10 days. The flooding causes damage to the rice fields, and houses and tends to reduce the yields of rice. In Phommaleu, people indicated 40% lower rice yields when floods occurred in 1984, 1988, 1991, 2011 and 2013. In Phakha the people mentioned the issue of shortage of fodder for livestock during flooding. Droughts tend to be remembered as occurring in June/July, i.e. during the early wet season, when there is not enough rainfall for rice farming. Droughts were remembered in 1984 in Phapho and Phakha, in 2008 in Phalai and Phakha, and in 2013 in Kele and Phakha. Other individual drought years were remembered in Kele in 1988 and in Phommaleu in 1993, in Phalai in 2003, and in Phakha in 2009. From this discussion, Phakha would appear to be the most drought-prone of the communities. During the drought of 1984 villagers did not plant rice because there was not enough water. During other years rice seedlings died and livestock died. In 1993 in Phommaleu, the response to the drought was to dig a well 15 m deep to reach the groundwater. Whilst no typhoons occurred, a number of villages mentioned strong winds in 1988 in Phommaleu, Kele and Phakha, and again in Kele in 2000 and 2010, and in Phakha in 2009.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4a34372-0fcc-4092-a571-b4b814c8c0b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4a34372-0fcc-4092-a571-b4b814c8c0b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate change vulnerability assessment for Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar Site, Lao PDR", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03ef974e726b3cb5a68581128cb3c1c7aa8e7a24c740b89241e48938b774e53c"}, "2": {"node_id": "cdcfafd3-ff41-4cee-845a-4da081fbe658", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "984a546d4736df33e2be2bd418a7bdf5189c0b8d242604ceb24357bff21aeb90"}}, "hash": "5b74d1041940c22d09ce8b54c26d432de007e9a43486314b72092e2b6815c4c2", "text": "Strong winds are remembered as being associated with high temperatures and occur in April, May, June, and August.

During drought livestock are allowed to roam free to forage for themselves. For floods, the livestock are taken to higher ground and grass may be cut for forage, rice crops may be replanted, and when yields decrease there may be rice sharing and exchanges within the community. Fishing in the flooded wetland areas may be an alternative source of food and income. Seeking employment elsewhere is also a livelihood strategy during floods. For forest fires, when houses and rice stock stores are damaged especially between February and April, the response is to repair them, with help from neighbours in the village. For animal diseases, there are some traditional remedies involving boiling tree bark and red wood.

Overview: Champasak Province in southern Lao PDR is characterized by a specific agro- ecosystem, including the Bolaven Plateau to the northwest that supported smallholder, rain- fed Robusta coffee culture and the Mekong corridor where there is development of commercial agriculture. The rubber concession covers a large area and cassava culture has expanded in recent years. Crops in Champasak Province will face threats from increased precipitation (+175 mm/year) and temperature (+2.5\u00b0C mean annual temperature) that will affect several crops\u2018 yields. Farming systems in the province for both small-holder and commercial plantations will face radical changes in terms of climate suitability in their production systems. Commercial crops for both exportation and subsistence for food security will be affected with high vulnerability for smallholders working with predominantly rain-fed farming systems.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19ab5c59-ae89-4002-ae05-7e5bea5ff941": {"__data__": {"id_": "19ab5c59-ae89-4002-ae05-7e5bea5ff941", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate change vulnerability assessment for Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar Site, Lao PDR", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95370a2e3a07c97e0f1e010402963b8197d02010451203caa2670b5a2848c942"}, "2": {"node_id": "d0591995-4f76-456c-8f1a-dc6b029556ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "621e7083cc94c88d1095709ae9fc700b54c0d5ecea554b353009ef0b04b8f18f"}}, "hash": "94a3a1261abcb47fab75300b453f23408f62784ef839fa71d20a19df793d2c7f", "text": "Agriculture will also have to cope with increased incidences of extreme climatic events. \uf0b7 Temperature -a 2.5\u00b0C increase in mean annual temperature.

The modelling approach was selected in order to incorporate the range and variability associated with predicting future climate change. The magnitude and timing of future climate change is dependent on the IPCC scenario selected as each encapsulates a different trajectory for future greenhouse gas (GHG) levels in the 2 GCMs utilized in this study include: CCMA_CGCM3.1 (Canada); CNRM_CM3 (France); NCAR CCSM3 (NCAR USA); MICRO3_2hires (Japan); GIIS_AOM (GODDARD USA); MPI_ECHAM5 (Germany); and MPI_ECHAM4 (Germany). 49 atmosphere3. A1B, selected for this study, represents a world of rapid economic growth, introduction of more efficient technologies, global population peaking by 2050 and a balance between fossil intensive and non-fossil energy sources (IPCC, 2000). A1B is considered a conservative GHG emissions scenario, and there is already evidence that GHG emissions during the period 2000\u20132007 exceeded even the most extreme IPCC scenarios for that period (SIDA, 2008). GCMs include a full description of atmospheric and ocean circulation dynamics which can vary depending on the GCM used. Studies at the global level have identified that GCMs have varying levels of accuracy for different regions (Cai et al., 2008), which means that some GCMs are better at predicting the future climate of the Mekong River Basin than others. The selection of GCMs for use in this study was made based on the GCMs ability to replicate historic precipitation data (Kummu et al., 2011).Seventeen GCMs have been considered in past studies for the Mekong Basin (Cai et al., 2008; Eastham et al., 2009), of these, outputs from six GCMs showed good agreement with historic precipitation records for the Mekong and have been selected for use in this study. All discussion in this report on changes in climate refers to the change in parameters between two 25-year periods: (i) baseline 1980 \u2013 2005, and (ii) future climate, 2045 \u2013 2069. For both time slices models generated daily data for maximum temperature, rainfall, run-off, soil moisture and stream flow. Statistical analysis was then used to extrapolate results for more than a dozen specific hydro-meteorological parameters for example: number of rainy days during the wet and dry season, seasonal rainfall volumes, mean annual rainfall and flow, duration of flood season, occurrence of consecutive hot days and peak and minimum flows, and these were applied as relevant to specific wetland types and case study sites. Although the models show some differences in results they are in agreement regarding the general trends in temperature and rainfall. The methods for climate projections are more fully described in Climate Change Modelling Manual produced for the MRC(ICEM, 2012) and in the Mekong ARCC study (ICEM, 2013). 6.2 Climate change projections to 2050 The following sections examine the potential climate change trends that are likely to occur in Beung Kiat Ngong up to 2050. 6.2.1 Temperature Maximum temperature A comparison of the current and future maximum daily temperatures is shown in Figure 6.1.

Four narrative storylines were defined, A1, A2, B1 and B2. Each storyline represents different demographic, social, economic, technological and environmental developments (IPCC DDC, 2011a). 50 With climate change, similar patterns are observed, but with an increase of about 2 to4\u00b0C. In January to mid-March projected mean maximum temperature increases from about 32 to 37\u00b0C with daily maxima from 36 to 42\u00b0C. March to early May, mean maxima lie between 36 and 38\u00b0C with daily maxima up to between 42 and 44\u00b0C. Between May to October, mean maximum temperatures range about 34\u00b0C and can be up to 4\u00b0C higher than current. Daily maximum temperatures range about 38\u00b0C. Late wet season there is a slight cooling to about 33\u00b0C,falling to about 31\u00b0C in December, but daily maxima may go as high as 37\u00b0C in December. The relative change in temperature is highest in the early to midwet season. Change is also more marked at end of dry season in April. The number of days of maximum temperature shows that currently there are about 36 days (10%) of the year in which the temperature exceeds 35\u00b0C. With climate change it is likely that this would increase to about 33% of the time or about 120 days per year (Figure 6.2). Figure 6.3 shows the range of maximum temperatures expected. During the wet season the comfort zone of expected maximum temperatures is fully exceeded (mean 30.5 to 33.5\u00b0C). In the dry season the maximum temperature comfort zone is at least half outside the 75% percentile of maximum temperatures, and it is only in the dry season when the overall comfort zone is exceeded (Figure 6.4).

Minimum daily temperatures have been recorded as low as 13\u00b0C. In the future the mean minimum temperatures may rise by between 1\u20132\u00b0C. The biggest differences are likely to occur in December to February. The number of days in which temperature falls below 20\u00b0C decreases from 44 days to 15 days per year (Figure 6.6).With climate change the minimum temperature comfort zone will be fully exceeded in the wet season and partially in the dry season (Figure 6.8). Figure 6.9 shows the combined maximum and minimum temperature comfort zones for Champasak province for both wet and dry seasons. This shows that while the minimum temperatures lie within the comfort zones in both wet and dry seasons, the maximum daily temperatures in the wet season lie completely outside the current normal experience, and in the dry season the maximum temperatures will lie outside of the normal range for 50% of the time. 53 Figure 6.5: Comparison of daily minimum temperatures between current baseline and climate change projections Source: ICEM (2013) 54 Figure 6.6: Changes in the number of days with minimum temperatures less than given temperature Source: ICEM (2013) Figure 6.7: Comparison of ranges of daily minimum temperature between current baseline and climate change projections Source: ICEM (2013) 55 Figure 6.8: Minimum temperature comfort zones during wet and dry seasons Source: ICEM (2013) Figure 6.9: Maximum and minimum temperature comfort zones during wet and dry seasons Source: ICEM (2013) 6.2.2 Rainfall The left image in Figure 6.10 shows the current rainfall distribution pattern in Champasak province indicating that Beung Kiat Ngong lies in one of the wetter areas of the province to the south of the Bolaven plateau that has the highest rainfall.

There will be significant decreases of 11 56 and 12% in February and January and 7% in April. December rainfall shows a marked increase of 35% (increasing from 5 to 7 mm) (Figure 6.12). Figure 6.13indicates predictions of the start of the monsoon. This is measured by the projections for the first month in the wet season when the monthly rainfall exceeds 200 mm. This shows that the probability of receiving 200 mm of rainfall in April is likely to decrease from the current 12% of years to 8% of years. In May the likelihood of the start of monsoon will increase from 60% of years to 76% of years, and in June this will decrease from 28% to 16% of years. This would indicate greater regularity of monsoon starting in May. Figure 6.14 shows the ranges of monthly rainfalls with the normal range of 50% of years falling in the median boxes. The total precipitation ranges in June, July and August i.e. the months when droughts during the rice growing season may occur are shown: \uf0b7 In June rainfall ranges from 120 mm to 440 mm with mean at 300 mm currently changing to 130 mm to 450 mm with mean at 320 mm; \uf0b7 In July rainfall ranges from 130 mm to 600 mm with mean at 370 mm changing to 140 mm to 630 mm with mean at 400 mm; and \uf0b7 In August rainfall ranges from 220 mm to 630 mm with mean at 380 mm changing to 240 mm to 680 mm with mean at 410mm. This means that minimum rainfall years in June/July/August will only increase slightly, i.e. risk of drought years will not be significantly reduced. Comfort zone estimates show the dry season more or less within comfort zone, and the wet season partially exceeded (Figure 6.15). This means that the projected dry season rainfall is more or less within the current range expected, and in the wet season there will generally be more rainfall than previously expected. 57 Figure 6.10: Annual average precipitation and % precipitation change in 2050 in Champasak province, Lao PDR Note: the green dot indicates the location of the point time series data Source: ICEM (2013) Beung Kiat Ngong Beung Kiat Ngong 58 Figure 6.11: Comparison of mean monthly precipitation in a typical year between baseline and climate change projections Source: ICEM (2013) Figure 6.12: Percentage changes in monthly precipitation between baseline and climate change projections Source: ICEM (2013) 59 Figure 6.13: Percentage of years of the months when the monsoon is expected to start Source: ICEM (2013) Figure 6.14: Comparison of ranges of monthly rainfalls between baseline and climate change projections Source: ICEM (2013) 60 Figure 6.15: Rainfall comfort zones for wet and dry seasons (left) and for whole year (right) Source: ICEM (2013) 6.2.3 Storms, droughts and extreme events It is generally considered that storms and extreme events are likely to increase in frequency and intensity with climate change. Figure 6.16 shows a ranking of the maximum daily precipitation in the year. This is taken as an indicator for storm events, when the rainfall in one day ranges between 50 to 150 mm per day. Storms, as measured by daily events of more than 100 mm in a day, currently occur three times per year. With climate change this is likely to increase to four times per year. The intensity of storms is likely to increase. The largest storms will increase in intensity from 120 mm in a day to 142 mm in a day, or around 8.5%. Figure 6.17 is an indication of the dryness in each month when precipitation is less than half of Potential Evapotranspiration (PET). During the wet season between May to September, as is to be expected, the rainfall is always more than the PET, but in February, March, April and November the probability that rainfall will be less than half of the PET tends to increase, i.e. these months will be drier. Note that this figure does not make predictions about drought during the rainy season, which is when the rice farmers recognize drought.

There is projected to be a slight increase in the volumes of rainfall running into the wetland during the dry season: from 226 mm3 to 241 mm3 or an increase of 6.5%. However, most of this increase will occur during May when the increase in rainfall is projected to be 11.6%. During the wet season the volume of rainfall is likely to increase from 772 mm3to 843 mm3, or an increase of 9.2%.

With less rainfall and increased evapotranspiration due to increased temperatures during January to April as shown Figure 6.17, there will be less water in the wetland. A comparison for different climate change factors during these dry season months is shown in Table 6.2. During the dry season it is likely that there will be a tendency for the wetted areas of Beung Kiat Ngong to dry quite rapidly, and for the overall wetland to shrink. 63 Pools of open water are likely to remain but may become shallower as the dry season progresses.

During the early wet season, the increased run-off will fill up the wetted areas of the wetland first, before flowing on out of the southern streams into the Houay Taung and on to the Xe Khampho and Sekong rivers. The total area of the wetland in the wet season is likely to remain more or less the same, since the water levels will be determined by the overall topography of Beung Kiat Ngong and backing up of the flood water levels in the downstream Xe Kampho. 64 7 Vulnerability assessment for Beung Kiat Ngong 7.1 Wetland habitats A vulnerability analysis of the Beung Kiat Ngong wetland as a whole complex is provided in Annex 1.

With the increased temperatures, the grasslands and shrublands drying out during the late dry season are likely to experience greater risk of fire, and this may damage the forested areas on the islands and shorelines. The increase in rainfall in the wet season between May and October is likely to have a high impact, with the inundated area quickly refilling after the drier dry season. But because the water levels in the Beung Kiat Ngong are to some extent regulated by the topography of the basin, excess run-off will pass down the river system into the Xe Kampho river. If this river is flooded and backs up into the wetland, the flood extent will increase, with some inundated areas becoming deeper, such that the grassland may be affected. If this deeper inundation is prolonged and occurs most years, there may be some habitat shifts within the wetland, but these are unlikely to be significant. Events such as storms and floods may increase as a result of increasing intensity from the largest storm in the year (increasing from 120 to 144 mm in a day) and the slight increase in the frequency of storm events. However it is considered that the wetland has a high ecological adaptive capacity to be able to cope with such events, such that there would only be moderate vulnerability. If the Xe Kampho floods and backs up into the southern portion of the wetland, floods may be more prolonged, especially for the villages of Phapho and Phakha. The summary of the vulnerability assessment of the overall wetland habitat of Beung Kiat Ngong is shown in Table 7.1. 65 Table 7.1: Vulnerability matrix of the overall wetland habitats of Beung Kiat Ngong.

Using the hydrological changes associated with climate change described above, the impacts of climate change upon these different wetland habitats are described qualitatively in Table 7.2.

There may be a change in flora to cope with deeper wet season water levels. Small seasonal and perennial streams Seasonal streams will dry out faster in the dry season, but have larger flows, and flash flows in the wet season. Perennial streams running through the wetland, and coming from the southern part of the catchment will remain, though with lower flows in dry season, and higher flows in wet season.

If flooding is prolonged, seasonal ponding may occur. There may be some changes in the extent of freshwater marshes due to drying at the edges in the dry season. Some of the land may become suitable for agriculture, so this may lead to encroachment. Seasonally flooded grassland Dry season: higher temperatures and low rainfall cause rapid lowering of levels and drying of grassland areas Grasslands inundated relatively quickly at start of rains. Water level in grasslands may reach higher levels than at present. Extent of dry grassland areas may change along with changes in species composition. At the landward edges, the grass species may become more terrestrial. In the deeper parts the grassland species that can tolerate higher water levels for longer will be favoured. In the dried out grassland areas, fires may become more prevalent in the dry season. Shrubland Seasonally inundated shrubland on the higher edges of the marsh and islands will be drier in the dry season and more flooded in the wet season. There may be some expansion of these areas since the shrubs are able to withstand both the dry periods and the deeper water levels, with some potential for invasion by Mimosa pigra. Forested areas on islands and around the shoreline Drier dry seasons and lower water tables Areas of forests may be more extensively and deeply flooded. Increased winds and storms Forested areas will not be affected by the slightly drier dry seasons since most are relatively dormant during this time. Many tree species around the wetland will be tolerant to flooding, but if the floods cover the roots of the trees for too long, then they may die. More intensive storms and stronger winds may damage exposed trees in the wetland. Forest fires in the dry season may damage the trees and cause loss of forest cover. 67 Habitat Hydrological implications Potential habitat change Rice paddies Most paddies around the wetland are rain-fed with active water management during the wet season. Before harvesting, the rice paddies are allowed to dry out and remain as fallow until the next rainy season. Livestock grazing during the dry season Increased risk of flooding due to storms and back flow from the rivers Rice paddies will benefit from more reliable onset of rains in May, and potentially more rain during the rainy season. Increased risk of flooding will reduce yields of rice and cause complete loss if prolonged or deep. There will be little impact of drier dry seasons and higher evapotranspiration on rice paddies after the harvest. There is potential for expansion of rice paddy into the wetland 7.2 Wetland plant species 7.2.1 Sedges \u2013 Scirpus grossus Scirpus grossus, or greater clubrush, is a \u2015principal\u2016 weed of four Southeast Asian countries, presumably as a weed of rice crops. It occurs in swampy and inundated places, pools, ditches, and marshes and is locally abundant, especially in the lowlands. It is also a host of Chilo polychrysus, the dark-headed rice borer. It is a robust, widespread and important weed, spreading by stolons and capable of dominating rice crops and wetlands.4 The Mekong ARCC study carried out a vulnerability assessment of a similar species within the Cyperaceae, Lepironia articulata, Grey Sedge, in the Kien Giang in the Mekong Delta. The study states that Lepironia propagates with seeds and rhizomes. Lepironia seeds germinate well although the germination rate is slow initially. It grows in open wet areas, from littoral areas to deep water, in swamps, ex-mining ponds, lakes, and ditches. It is typically grown in swamps with low pH (up down to pH 3). (ICEM, 2014). Increase in temperature will cause water surface temperature to increase but this will likely not affect L. articulate as it grows in deep water. As a sedge, L.articulata is also tolerant to drought. Increase in projected depth and frequency of flooding is certainly not an issue for L. articulata as it is known to grow in depths up to 5.5 metres. The drier dry season might lead to higher frequency of grassland wildfires. The above- ground stems might be burnt off but will regenerate quickly from rootstocks once moisture conditions returns.

It is expected to show low vulnerability to climate change conditions in Beung Kiat Ngong. The more extreme changes between the dry and wet season sizes of the seasonally and permanently inundated areas in Beung Kiat Ngong may lead to some changes in the distribution of the sedge. The increased risk of fire during the late dry season may also enhance these changes. However, as with Lepironia, the vegetative reproduction of Scirpus grossus will allow it to re-establish the stands of sedge as soon as favourable wetted conditions return. 7.2.2 Shrubs \u2013 Sesbania sesban The Mekong ARCC study used Sesbania sesban as one of the indicator species for wetland NTFPs (ICEM, 2014). That report found that Sesbania grows in a wide range of soils from loose sand to heavy clay. It is native to monsoonal, semi-arid to sub-humid regions with annual rainfall ranging from 500\u2013 2000 mm. It grows best where periodic water-logging or flooding is followed by progressively drier conditions. The plant does not require a large habitat: small clumps of S. sesban occur in the wild in moist riverine areas and can be domesticated at edges of ponds and canals. The plant can disperse long distances by water: the ripe fruits and seeds are buoyant. In terms of tolerance, it has outstanding ability to withstand waterlogging and is ideally suited to seasonally flooded environments. When flooded, it initiates floating adventitious roots and protects its stems, roots, and nodules with spongy aerenchyma tissue. It is common along streams, swamp banks, and moist and inundated bottomlands. S. sesban shows some tolerance to moisture stress and tolerates soil alkalinity and salinity to a considerable degree. The plant is resilient to drought. Re-sprouting from the rootstocks can occur easily when moist conditions return. S. sesban is not threatened by human use: flowers are harvested for food and stems are harvested for fuel wood of low value. S. sesban is attacked by nematodes, insects, fungi, and viruses. The leaf-eating beetle Mesoplatys ochroptera can completely defoliate S. sesban, leading to mortality. Caterpillars, Hymenoptera, and stem borers are normally associated with S. sesban. Some potentially destructive root-knot nematodes have been recorded in India as associated with S. sesban. Exposure to temperature is not an issue for S. sesban. The plant temperature comfort zone is between 18\u00b0C to 23\u00b0C (min. 10\u00b0C, max. 45\u00b0C). For rainfall exposure, as a tree legume, the plant is found growing in a very wide range of rainfall environments. S.sesban is less tolerant to drier environments. When soil moisture drops below 12.5%, 55% of leaves will fall. As the plant shows excellent tolerance for inundation conditions, exposure to flooding is not an issue. The change of timing of the onset of the rainy season is likely to affect the flowering of the plants as it flowers at the onset of the rainy season in June-July. This is unlikely to affect the plants in Beung Kiat Ngong. 69 For extreme events, strong winds and storms will cause the stands to collapse but are unlikely to kill the plant. In terms of fire risk, in dry conditions the above-ground stems can be burnt but stands quickly recover when moist conditions return from seeds in the soil.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb8f1aba-e164-427e-a247-cd92b58df03e": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb8f1aba-e164-427e-a247-cd92b58df03e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate change vulnerability assessment for Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar Site, Lao PDR", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2edba172f263ac70ab71a88ca3bc8036177fccc85aa0d8a8a00c2fafcb8dee0f"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe9f60d7-22b3-4e45-bdeb-9c49c392e755", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ed52c37806e88da949b60045a89c08fed504421e177847598ff1c9cbb3a1824f"}}, "hash": "ddf5d9f72d9ef016c21d02215be70302a4dce95863c5ddb2f881f605b90a7d04", "text": "S. sesban has some good traits for adapting to adverse conditions: \uf0b7 Water-impermeable seed coat enabling seed dormancy can help seed to wait out adverse conditions; \uf0b7 Provided there are flooded and moist areas, the plant will survive; \uf0b7 Populations are widespread; excellent tolerance of waterlogged conditions; \uf0b7 Individual plants live for 1.5 years with rapid establishment and early growth; and \uf0b7 Seeds are carried long distances by water. It is considered that Sesbania sesban generally shows low vulnerability to climate change in Beung Kiat Ngong because the species has a wide range of tolerance for heat, inundation, and drought. The projected conditions in Beung Kiat Ngong would not exceed these tolerance ranges. However, if other plants become stressed by temperature and decline, the additional pressure from human collection will increase.

It is spread by the seeds being carried by flood waters reaching new areas, and because it has no uses or natural enemies to keep populations under control, it tends to dominate and exclude other similar shrubs. It is to be expected that the climate changes expected in Beung Kiat Ngong with higher floods in the wet season will tend to enhance its spread. However, because it cannot survive in permanently flooded areas, the increase in seasonally exposed areas due to the lower rainfall and increased drying in the dry season may mean that the areas where it can survive may increase. Mimosa pigra shows low vulnerability to climate change and this will tend to increase its invasiveness. 7.2.4 Swamp forest trees \u2013 Barringtonia sp The MRC wetlands and climate change study on Lower Stung Sen considered the vulnerability of Barringtonia acutangula, one of the keystone species in the flooded forests of the Tonle Sap (ICEM, 2012). In that study the vulnerability of the species was considered to be low largely because of its high resilience to flooding and prolonged inundation and its ability to grow in rocky and pebbly substrates in strong currents nearest the water\u2018s edge. The species can establish itself in areas with only a brief exposure to drying. Flowering and fruiting occurs throughout the year. It responds to drought and increased temperature by shedding leaves to reduce evapotranspiration. When under water, leaves are retained and photosynthesis continues for several months. Assuming that the species in Beung Kiat Ngong is similar to Barringtonia acutangula, which is a widespread species growing in wetlands, lakes and along rivers throughout Southeast Asia, a CAM matrix has been applied for the species growing in these wetlands (see Annex). 70 Overall, Barringtonia acutangula shows medium vulnerability to climate change. It is well- adapted to living in areas that have prolonged inundation and is especially resilient to increased flooding. The trees are able to survive periods of drought and increased temperatures, though increased temperatures in the wet season may have inhibitory effects on flowering, fruiting and seed setting. If the areas that are currently exposed for too short a period to allow other trees and shrubs to survive have increased exposure, then Barringtonia may experience increased competition from these species.

Although Champasak was not included, the nearest provinces were Khammouane in Lao PDR and Mondulkiri in Cambodia(ICEM, 2013). The study included detailed vulnerability assessments for several of the species of interest in Beung Kiat Ngong, including Channa striatus, Cirrhinus microlepis, Clarias batrachus, Trichogaster pectoralis, Oreochromis niloticus (aquaculture). The database entries of these fish species are included in Annex 2 and the CAM matrices for these species are found in Annex 1. The main climate change threats considered were increase in temperature, increase/decrease in precipitation, increase/decrease in water availability, drought, flooding, storms and flash floods. The general findings of the Mekong ARRC fisheries study were: o Black fish tend to be less vulnerable to climate change because they are able to survive poor water quality conditions (e.g.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c20b688a-4ec3-44ca-9f11-4f7ce7846734": {"__data__": {"id_": "c20b688a-4ec3-44ca-9f11-4f7ce7846734", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate change vulnerability assessment for Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar Site, Lao PDR", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2cd329f345b948cc075a499ed460d68f5c1d04fd6503872c4830a1347574f33"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb9976f3-809b-4b6a-97f8-3a1104f2bcfc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "44b3048d745716871efcffd785a569e046d15d3784cc7c2a9f2ed8c5ca89da38"}}, "hash": "ba3bbc5017a5e7a9ebd26d7af42fab5ccd5cec9b2c0eca2d978ac8b0363af2b5", "text": "low dissolved oxygen, low pH, high turbidity and high ammonia); o Black fish are able to withstand harsh dry season environments including high temperatures and anoxic conditions; o Their limited migratory habits make them less vulnerable to wetlands fragmentation; o Most white fish species require higher water quality conditions in terms of dissolved oxygen and alkalinity; o White fish are more vulnerable to increased temperatures, especially at maturation and fry stages; and 71 o White fish are more vulnerable to decreases in water availability e.g. in the dry season.

Shifting rainfall patterns, including longer dry periods, could affect the survival of fish in the dry season. Any changes in temperature will influence their metabolism, growth rate, reproduction, recruitment and susceptibility to toxins and disease. The response of fish to increased temperatures is likely to be a shift in behaviour, and it could be that some species extend their ranges at the expense of others. Because of the higher tolerance of black fish to temperatures compared to white fish, there could be a shift towards greater populations of black fish. Increased CO2 levels are likely to affect fisheries through the acidification of some water bodies. This may affect white fish more than black fish. In Beung Kiat Ngong, the peat swamp waters will tend to be quite acidic, so there may be a tendency for the pH to fall further with increases in CO2 in the atmosphere. With longer dry periods, exposed peat soils may dry out and increase the acidity of the waters when the wet season rehydrates the peat. Increased acidity in the water is likely to be less hospitable for fish, especially white fish. The following are summaries of the vulnerability assessments of particular species. Channa striatus (Pa kho).This is a species of black fish found in a wide range of wetland environments, including rice fields, reservoirs and canals. It is considered to have a low vulnerability to increased temperatures, because the projected temperature increases are well within the tolerable range for this species. It is an air breathing fish, so dissolved oxygen levels are not important. It shows low vulnerability to increased rainfall in the wet season since this will allow easier access to the wetland areas of Beung Kiat Ngong. Flooding will also increase the inundated area, providing additional breeding and feeding areas around the wetland, and will increase population numbers. In the dry season, the species would have moderate vulnerability to the reduced rainfall which is likely to decrease the extent of inundated areas of the wetland, so this will tend to concentrate this species in the remaining areas of open water with increased predation and fishing pressure. Generally the species shows low vulnerability to climate change impacts expected in Beung Kiat Ngong. Clarias batrachus (Pa douk).5 The walking catfish is a black fish species resident in Beung Kiat Ngong throughout the year. The projected increase in temperatures is well within the range of this species, and it is tolerant of both high turbidity and low dissolved oxygen. In the natural habitats of Beung Kiat Ngong, it is likely to have a low vulnerability to increased temperature, and will be able to survive in the conditions in the remaining open water refuges in the dry season. Its ability to \u2015walk\u2016 means that it is able to move overland to more favourable pools as the wetland dries. During the wet season, increased rainfall and water availability, and increased size of the inundated area will be beneficial for this species. It will be unaffected by flooding, though drought in the dry season will cause stress. Generally, vulnerability to climate change impacts expected in Beung Kiat Ngong is low. 5Note that for this species the CAM vulnerability assessment was carried out for aquaculture in earth ponds. 72 Trichogaster pectoralis (Pa kadeut).This is a non-migratory, small black fish, important for food security. It is known to be tolerant to a wide range of temperature, with optimum temperatures between 23 \u2013 28\u00b0C. It is considered to be moderately vulnerable to increase in temperature. It is a resilient black fish species able to withstand reduced rainfall and water availability in the dry season, provided that it has the remaining open water bodies as refuge. This species is considered moderately vulnerable to reduced rainfall, but during drought conditions, as the refuges contract, it will experience greater stress from reduced space and food and increased fishing pressure. With rainfall increasing in the wet season, the rapid expansion of aquatic habitats will encourage its growth, maturity and spawning. Generally, vulnerability to climate change impacts expected in Beung Kiat Ngong is low. Oreochromis niloticus (Pa nin). Tilapia is an exotic species, introduced through escapes from fish culture. Table 7.3shows the temperature range for different species of cultured fish, indicating that this species is particularly tolerant to higher temperatures. With an optimum range between 30 \u2013 32\u00b0C, it will be unaffected by increased temperatures. It is also tolerant to low dissolved oxygen, though perhaps not as tolerant as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f302fa5-5f1a-42f0-8437-8e50f6ac7ed3": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f302fa5-5f1a-42f0-8437-8e50f6ac7ed3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate change vulnerability assessment for Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar Site, Lao PDR", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "175f3f4f55cd65d35fe6018c5453e84e98a6f4f0b07e132a6ccd184729aa8285"}, "3": {"node_id": "94393500-e2c7-478a-81f8-0cacd9213918", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "274da2fd2749f2fb0784eae2f7d3e4fb6e75f85da69140095030949d36124f63"}}, "hash": "a3c1541b2bc9be78a0f14409dcd2a95302dc296a528761c099dc9e7b5c80ed7e", "text": "snakeheads and catfish. As with other resident species, it will be stressed by reduced rainfall and more rapid drying of the wetland in the dry season, which will tend to concentrate the fish into the remaining pools, making them more susceptible to predation and fishing pressure. It will benefit from the increased rainfall in the wet season and flooding, which will extend the inundated area for breeding and feeding. Generally the species shows low vulnerability to climate change expected in Being Kiat Ngong. Table 7.3. Optimum water temperature ranges for commonly cultured fish in the Lower Mekong Basin Source: ICEM (2013) Cirrhinus microlepis, (Pa keng).Also called small-scale mud carp, this species is a white fish that moves into the wetland from the Mekong mainstream and tributaries during the rainy season. It breeds during June and July, with juveniles nursing in the floodplains and leaving at the end of the wet season as the waters in the floodplain recede. It is herbivorous, consuming leafy plant matter and phytoplankton and also insects. It is recognized as a Vulnerable species in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. White fish tend to be less tolerant of higher temperatures than black fish, but this species will be living in the larger bodies of flowing water during the dry season, and so will be less exposed to the lower water quality conditions experienced in Beung Kiat Ngong during the dry season. The increased water temperature in the wet season may affect the nursing juveniles more than the adults. During the wet season, the white fish move into take advantage of the inundated wetland area, with the higher dissolved oxygen and overall improved water quality. Thus they will benefit from the increased rainfall and the larger size of the wetland in the wet season. They may also benefit from the more reliable start of the rains in May. Overall, this species shows medium vulnerability to climate change during its movements into Beung Kiat Ngong. 73 In summary, the black fish populations of Beung Kiat Ngong generally show fairly low vulnerability to climate change. They are adaptable, hardy species that have evolved to be able to cope with the long dry seasons when conditions are at their most stressful. White fish populations only enter the wetlands during the wet season when generally higher rainfall, increased inundation and lower temperatures make the conditions acceptable, and even beneficial, for white fish populations. The populations may depend upon how climate change and other threats affect them outside of Beung Kiat Ngong during the dry season. An unquantifiable cause for concern may be an increase in acidity in the peat areas of the wetland, if the acid sulphate soils release acid into the water as the inundation returns at the beginning of the wet season. 7.3.2 Eels Eels are considered separately from the other black and white fish, partly because the communities consider them differently, rating eels as the second most important wetland product after fish, and partly because they have different behaviour patterns. The eel species found in Beung Kiat Ngong is the Asian swamp eel, Monopterus albus. The swamp eel is a voracious general predator, feeding on fishes, amphibians, and aquatic invertebrates. It has versatile motility and is even capable of moving over dry land for short distances. This behavior is used for relocation according to resource availability. In the absence of water and food, it is able to survive long periods of drought by burrowing in moist earth. The Asian swamp eel is hermaphroditic. All young are females. As juvenile fish begin to mature, some take on the masculine phenotype. Males have transgendered capabilities, allowing them to replenish female populations when female densities are low. This change from one sex to another can take up to a year. Spawning can occur throughout the year. Eggs are laid in bubble nests located in shallow waters. These bubble nests float at the water\u2018s surface and are not attached to aquatic vegetation. Females produce up to 1,000 eggs per spawning event. Swamp eels are an important host for the parasitic nematode Gnathostoma spinigerum.

Nevertheless, the species is tolerant of high water temperatures and low dissolved oxygen, and the projected increases in temperature are within the tolerance range of the species. For M. armatus the drying out of water bodies during prolonged dry seasons would render it moderately vulnerable, but the swamp eel can move away to find other remaining bodies of water, and it can burrow into the mud and survive. Climate change vulnerability of the eel would therefore be low. 74 Increased rainfall during the wet season, the increase in size of the inundated area and flooding are likely to be beneficial for the species, providing both more habitat for its populations as well as larger populations of prey species. 7.3.3 Molluscs The CAM matrix for the Golden Apple Snail was copied from the Mekong ARCC Fisheries report (ICEM, 2013)where the impact of climate change on the invasiveness of the species was assessed. The report also assessed the vulnerability of the ecosystem of the Mekong delta in Kien Giang to this invasive species rather than the vulnerability of the species itself. The following comparison of the climate change vulnerabilities of Pila pilota and Pomacea canaliculata has been developed from a review of the differences in the physiology, reproductive behavior and response of the two species to environmental conditions, as reported in a review of Ampullariid (Apple) snails as agricultural pests(Cowie, 2006). Both species inhabit slow moving or stagnant water in lowland swamps, marshes, ditches, lakes and rivers. Both species are amphibious, being able to spend substantial periods of time out of water breathing air. There may be differences of habitat preference and an indication of this is reported by Timmins (2014) which notes that Pila pilota may have a requirement for permanent water. Both Pila and Pomacea can aestivate under adverse environmental conditions, e.g. during the hot dry season as the water bodies dry up. Aestivation consists of burrowing into the mud and closing the operculum to restrict water loss. Under natural conditions this may last for up to three months until the rains come, but under experimental conditions, aestivation periods longer than one to two years have been recorded in some species. Aestivation can take place at different depths in the mud, with Pila species tending to burrow up to one metre deep into the mud. Pila species tend to undergo anaerobic metabolism during aestivation and may experience considerable weight loss. Pomacea species tend to aestivate nearer the surface with aerobic respiration. For most of these snail species the upper tolerance limit of water temperature is about 40\u00b0C. Cowie (2006) suggests that with P. canaliculata originating in more temperate climates, it has a slightly lower temperature tolerance than the native tropical species. The normal temperature tolerance range for P. canaliculata lies between 15.2\u00b0 and 36.6\u00b0C. The projected increases in maximum temperature in the wet season are generally within this range, though the dry season maximum temperature comfort zone will exceed this slightly. Pomacea species may be able to regulate their body temperature during aestivation through evaporative cooling for up to air temperatures of 41\u00b0C. During the hot dry season experienced in Beung Kiat Ngong, both species of snails will be able to avoid the higher and potentially lethal maximum temperatures projected with climate change, through aestivation. During the wet season, the temperatures are lower and there is plenty of water, so the high temperatures are not expected to stress the snails. Breeding for both snails tends to be seasonal, depending upon latitude, temperature and rainfall. Under the tropical conditions of the Beung Kiat Ngong wetlands the rainfall is likely to determine reproduction, with breeding and oviposition occurring from the start of the rainy season. Cowie (2006) has suggested that in the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, release from the seasonality of its natural range (based upon temperature) may be one of the reasons why P. canaliculata is so prolific. Rapid growth and breeding and hence a rapid 75 succession of generations are permitted year round (or at least as far as water availability permits) leading to rapid population expansion and high population densities. The eggs of Pomacea are laid on the stalks of vegetation above the water and are coloured pink or orange, whereas the eggs of Pila are colourless and deposited in depressions in the banks or mud made by the snails.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a490411b-eb7c-451e-bb0b-5d821814273f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a490411b-eb7c-451e-bb0b-5d821814273f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate change vulnerability assessment for Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar Site, Lao PDR", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c5abffc2e890fb394107b22291e2f91a0addb9eb33c622a1272d84e46dfc2da2"}, "2": {"node_id": "07cf23c4-9b38-4fc7-94c4-36359a1285d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c9dbc2ae023e0909ea3fb387d021be7eb2ac57bc0898122bb0da4125340d911"}}, "hash": "10311f32add66befcf13837a31806b63c661dd64d658e6b51608f23cf4982ac3", "text": "There is a hypothesis that the brightly coloured eggs of Pomacea are a warning to predators that they are distasteful compared to the eggs of Pila.

The temperature threshold for normal maturation of snail eggs may be between 35 \u2013 37\u00b0C. Above this temperature, the eggs may not develop normally. The populations of these snails depend upon a number of factors, especially the availability of food and suitable habitat area, and the duration and intensity of the dry season. The increased rainfall and increased inundation area of the wetland will favour the rapid population growth and spread of the snails, as will flooding when it occurs. However, P. canaliculata is known to be a particularly voracious eater in comparison to other snail species, and though it has its food preferences, e.g. rice plants, it is a generalist. Competition for food sources between the two species is likely to be a factor determining the population sizes. The CAM analysis for P. canaliculata in the Mekong delta supported the hypothesis that climate change would enhance the invasiveness of the Golden Apple snail. However, in comparison to P. pilota, both would appear to be well adapted to cope with a hotter and drier dry season, and both would be able to take advantage of the increased rains and larger wetland area in the rainy season. From the above comparisons it may well be that it is the habitat requirement for permanent wetland areas that determines the populations of Pila and hence the reduction in the dry season size of the wetted area of Beung Kiat Ngong may be limiting. On the other hand, it may be that the higher reproductive capacity and voraciousness of the feeding habits of Pomacea drive its invasiveness, rather than climate change. 7.3.4 Frogs No information on the species of frogs that are found in Beung Kiat Ngong is available. However, a vulnerability assessment of two commonly caught species of frog in Xe Champhone wetlands was carried out as part of the MRC study on impacts of climate change on Mekong wetlands: Rana lateralis (Kiat leuang) and Hoplobatracus rugulosus (Kop). The CAM matrix for these two species is included in Annex 1(ICEM, 2012). In Xe Champhone, both species of frog were considered to have moderate vulnerability, increasing to high when the market and collection pressure for frogs was considered. For Hoplobatrachus rugulosus, the exposure as a result of lower rainfall (in the dry season) was considered to lead to fewer suitable habitats (pools and ponds) and that there was potential for breeding failure if dry periods in the early wet season lead to the drying out of ponds after spawning has occurred. R. lateralis has a more restricted habitat in the forested areas in the south of Xe Champhone, and a combination of drier conditions in the forests leading to lower soil moisture content, and loss of habitat due to conversion could affect the suitability of these 76 habitats for the frogs. As with the other species of frog, the collective pressure would be compounded by increased climate vulnerability. In Beung Kiat Ngong, climate projections indicate that the monsoon will start more predictably in May, but there is no analysis for the frequency dry periods in the early wet season when seasonal pools may dry out. The frogs are opportunistic spawners, responding to rainfall and availability of suitable pools of water. It is considered that the wetland area of Beung Kiat Ngong is more uniformly inundated with water than in Xe Champhone, and the pressure from suitable habitats becoming fewer, or from areas drying out in the early wet season, is lower. 7.3.5 Turtles The Malayan snail-eating turtle is found in slow-moving bodies of water with muddy bottoms and lots of vegetation such as marshes, swamps, rice paddies and irrigation canals. It helps to control populations of snails, which form almost its entire diet, although it also consumes earthworms, aquatic insects, crustaceans and small fish. It is preyed upon by monitors, and the young can be taken by large fish, snakes, wading birds and crows.

Mating usually takes place between the months of December and January, after which female excavates a nest into which a clutch of around four elongated, hard-shelled eggs are laid. Turtle nests are vulnerable to egg collectors with dogs, and also have a variety of natural predators such as mongoose and rats, as well as birds such as coucals and crows. Fire is sometimes used for hunting turtles in the dry season. Turtles, in common with other reptile species, experience Environmental Sex Determination (ESD) such that the temperature of incubation of the eggs determines the sex of the hatchlings. Males tend to be selected when the incubation temperatures lie between 28 and 30\u00b0C, whilst females develop above and below this temperature range. The position of the egg in the nest, and the depth of the nest below the soil surface affects the incubation temperature. One of the serious climate change threats that has been identified for turtles is that with increasing temperatures, the proportion of males in the population will decrease, potentially completely (Loudon, 2012). The pivotal or \u2015switch-over\u2016 temperature can be as little as 1\u00b0C, so that small increases in incubation temperature can completely change the sex ratio of a clutch. Turtles are ectothermic animals with body temperatures dependent upon environmental conditions. This means that all their behaviour, growth and metabolism are dependent upon air and water temperatures. During the hot dry season, many turtles will spend much of their time at the bottom of pools, where it is cooler, to avoid the heat. However, it may be that high 77 temperatures during the early development of the young turtles also lead to behavioural change. Researchers in Queensland, Australia have found that eggs of the Mary river turtle which are incubated at higher temperatures tend to produce hatchlings that showed reduced swimming ability and a preference for shallower waters. This means that the survival chances of turtles incubated at higher temperatures may be reduced, since deeper water, where their food supply is found, provides the young turtles with protection from predators. Young turtles with poor swimming abilities and which linger near the surface are unable to feed and are very likely to get preyed on by birds(Society for Experimental Biology, 2011). The female turtles may show some adaptive capacity to alter the depth of the nests depending on environmental conditions, but research with a marine turtle (Chrysemys picta) did not show consistent results to indicate that this was a reliable mechanism for adaptation to climate change. The research found no effect of nest depth on six parameters of incubation regime, nor on resultant offspring survival, size or sex ratio. However, deeper nests produced hatchlings that weighed less, and were faster at righting themselves and swimming, than hatchlings from shallower nests(Refsnider, 2013). A CAM matrix assessment was carried out for both turtle species included in Annex X, of which the summary is shown below. The major climate change threat to turtles is increased temperature, especially during the period of nesting and incubation of the eggs which takes place during the dry season, when temperatures are highest. Increased temperatures can affect the sex of the hatchlings and skew the sex ratios of populations, with greater numbers of females being produced at higher temperatures. There is little adaptive capacity available for turtles to adjust to this. Also increased temperatures at incubation have been shown to affect the behaviour of turtles which exhibit slower swimming speeds and a tendency to swim closer to the surface. Lower rainfall and higher evapotranspiration in the dry season, which are likely to cause shrinkage of wetland habitats with smaller wetted areas and shallower pools make the turtles easier to catch (i.e. they are more vulnerable at this time). When the rains come and expand the wetted area again, the turtles are likely to benefit from the expanded area and higher availability of food sources. Increased intensity and frequency of storms and flooding should not have any effect on turtle populations.

The study indicates that the species in general shows high vulnerability to climate change especially because increased floods may further restrict the species in the wetlands and its natural habitats in the dry forest areas are already under threat. A similar analysis would apply to Beung Kiat Ngong (ICEM, 2012). 8 Vulnerability of livelihood activities 8.1 Rain-fed rice production The main agricultural activity surrounding the Beung Kiat Ngong wetlands is the cultivation of rain-fed rice in paddy fields. In the eight core villages there are reported to be 1,387 ha of rain-fed rice and 50 ha of irrigated rice. In the past the farmers planted three varieties of rice with different maturation periods: 1. Short maturation period (90\u2013100 days), in the uplands, 2. Medium maturation period (120\u2013130 days), and 3. Long maturation period (140\u2013160 days). The 90 day varieties are planted early in the wet season in order to provide quicker replenishment of rice stores which become depleted by the end of the dry season, overcoming the rice deficit common at this time of year. The later maturing varieties are planted to be harvestable later in the season, and are likely to be more commercial varieties so surplus may be sold. Nowadays villagers mainly use hybrid varieties with a medium maturation period 120\u2013130 days. The average yields of rain-fed rice are about 2.5\u20132.8 tonnes per hectare. In the past, villagers used to harvest 3\u20133.5 tonnes per hectare, but now they get less, possibly because they sell a lot of cattle dung and do not use many fertilizers or pesticides. When they do use fertilizer, it is generally only nitrogen (46-00-00, NPK) and applied 10 days after they sow the seed and again 20\u201325 days after transplanting. The table below shows the seasonal calendar for rice: Table 8.1: Seasonal calendar for rain-fed rice cultivation around Beung Kiat Ngong The critical period when water is required is in the early wet season, between May to July, when the land is being prepared, the seed is being sown and the rice is being transplanted.

This is shown in Annex. The assessment notes that farming systems for both small holder and commercial plantations will face radical changes in terms of climate suitability in their production systems. The livelihoods of smallholders working principally with rain-fed farming systems will be highly vulnerable to climate change, and farmers will have to cope with increased incidences of extreme climatic events. Irrigated rice is cultivated by about 20% of the farmers in the province and will face a critical period of high temperatures towards the end of the dry season.

They do not report incidence of rice borers, though the black- headed rice borer is known to live in the sedges. It is known that the egg hatching period for Chilo polychrysus decreases when temperature rises between 30and 35\u00b0C. The optimum temperature for hatching lies between 23 and33\u00b0C. Above this temperature the larvae dies within the eggs. They also require 90\u2013100% relative humidity (RH), and below 70% RH hatching is impaired. The rate of larval development depends on the temperature, increasing between 17 and 35\u00b0C. Between 29 and 35\u00b0C they only require four instars for full development compared to five or six at lower temperatures. This means that the rice borers may develop more rapidly and become more of a problem with increased temperatures, up to a threshold of about 35\u00b0C(Pathak, 1994). 8.2 Irrigated rice production There are 50 ha of irrigated rice around Beung Kiat Ngong. This is used as a second crop and the rice is planted immediately after the harvest of the rain-fed crop. In Phapho and Phakha, where there are 10 ha of irrigated rice each, villagers collect water during the wet season from a stream in a small dam. They pump the water to their field using a hand tractor. In Phalai where 30 ha of land are irrigated, they impound the water in a medium-sized dam in Houay Ta Uang and they use bigger pumping systems through a canal to the rice fields. 80 The dry season rice cultivation calendar is as follows: Table. 8.2: Seasonal character for irrigated rice cultivation around Beung Kiat Ngong The main vulnerability issue here for irrigated rice is the significant increase in temperatures during the dry season, at times over the critical thresholds for maximum temperatures for rice. Coupled with requirements for water up until the end of March, and the overall reduction in water availability during the dry season, this would make irrigated rice highly vulnerable, with expected decreases in yield as climate change progresses. 8.3 Fishing There are two main methods of catching fish in the wetlands of Beung Kiat Ngong, depending on the season. In the wet season, the fishermen use fish hooks and fish nets (cast and gill nets) in the extended inundated areas of the wetland. In the dry season, especially towards the end when all the fish are concentrated in the pools and remaining open water ponds, fishermen use pumps or buckets to empty these pools and open bodies of water, lowering the water levels so that they can catch all the fish in that pool. A small pool may yield 3-5 kg of fish, but a larger pond may yield 50 kg or more. Eels tend to be caught at the beginning of the rainy season when they are emerging from their holes, and in the late wet season when they are beginning to burrow into the mud. The vulnerability analysis of the different fish species in Beung Kiat Ngong indicates that most of the main fish species, especially black fish (e.g. snakeheads) show a fairly low vulnerability to climate change. They may even benefit from the higher rainfall and increased extent of inundation in the wet season. The white fish coming in from the larger rivers for spawning and nursery grounds in the wetlands will also benefit from the greater size of the inundated area. Since they will return to the main rivers at the end of the dry season, they will not experience the lower water availability in the dry season, though they may be exposed to other climate change stresses and other threats in the main river. These have not been considered here. The main impact of climate change on the fishing activities in Beung Kiat Ngong has less to do with the stresses imposed by the changing climate on the fish themselves, and more to do with the increased accessibility and concentration of the black fish in ponds and pools at the end of the dry season, making them easier to catch. This will tend to reduce the overall population size, and eventually, after seasons of increased catch in the dry season, will lead to reduced overall catch. Thus whilst the fish themselves show low vulnerability to climate change, subsistence fishing livelihood may have an increased medium vulnerability as a result of increased W1 W2 W3 W4 W1 W2 W3 W4 W1 W2 W3 W4 W1 W2 W3 W4 W1", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a139a285-fe5d-4423-b4be-b4d36082ce36": {"__data__": {"id_": "a139a285-fe5d-4423-b4be-b4d36082ce36", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate change vulnerability assessment for Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar Site, Lao PDR", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/climate-change-vulnerability-assessment-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-lao", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "926723527b98e9b71e84d71e2573dd805afbb4d9511cf27330c12a335017dba1"}}, "hash": "926723527b98e9b71e84d71e2573dd805afbb4d9511cf27330c12a335017dba1", "text": "W2 W3 W4 W1 W2 W3 W4 Land Preparation X X 15 Days To sow rice seed X X X 20-22 Days Rice Transplanting X X X X 25-30 Days Rice Caring X X X X X X X 45-50 Days Blossom X x 15 Days Mature X X 15 Days Havest and Store X X 15-20 Days Rice Maturation Period May Nov Dec Remark June July Aug Sep Oct Main Activity Feb March Jan April 81 fishing pressure in the dry season. Adaptation responses may therefore consider strengthening local fish conservation rules for fishing during the dry season. 8.4 Drinking water Generally drinking water availability from dug or tube wells has not yet been a problem in Beung Kiat Ngong. However, during the dry season, the availability of drinking water may become an issue in many of the villages as the groundwater table sinks. In Phalai this has not been a problem, but in most of the other villages, e.g. in Kiat Ngong, the ground water level is reported to be seven m below the surface in April. They also report that in some dry years they may have to wait overnight for the wells to recharge. Another issue has been the quality of the ground water from tube wells in Kiat Ngong, where a number of the tube wells that were sunk in the last few years were discovered to have levels of arsenic that are too high for human consumption. Water is now only drunk from those wells where the arsenic levels are safe. With climate change, with drier and hotter dry seasons, it is likely that drinking water availability at the end of the dry season (April and May) will become increasingly problematic. This is likely to be compounded by increasing populations in these communities and increased cattle numbers. It is considered that these communities are highly vulnerable to the impacts of drier and hotter dry seasons, particularly in terms of drinking water availability. 8.5 Livestock Smallholder livestock production with cattle and buffalo is an important local livelihood. There appears to be a trend of increasing cattle numbers corresponding to decreasing buffalo herds. The elephant population has experienced a rapid fall in numbers, and the only remaining substantial herd is in Kiat Ngong. The number of grazing units has been estimated at 4,228, made up of 991 for buffalo, 2,661 for cattle and 13 for elephants. The seasonal pattern of livestock activities revolves around rice cultivation. During the dry season buffalo and cattle are allowed to roam loose around the wetland and forest area between December and May, i.e. after the rice harvest up until planting of the next crop. During the wet season through to harvest, livestock are kept in compounds or tethered to keep them from the rice fields. There are two main husbandry issues for cattle and buffalo. In the dry season when they roam free there is often not enough vegetation for them to eat, especially at the end of the dry season, and water availability is clearly an issue at this time. Also after flooding events there may not be adequate food available, because the grass and shrubs may have died. Fodder planting or collection for the livestock is not normally practiced in the communities. Poor nutrition tend to make the animals more susceptible to diseases such as foot and mouth disease (FMD).For example, there was an outbreak of FMD in Phapho and Kele in February and March 2009. Other threats include storms and lightning, which are reported to have killed cattle and buffalo in Phommaleu, Kele and Phakha. The Mekong ARCC studies on climate change impacts on livestock (ICEM, 2013) notes that generally, cattle and buffalo are relatively thermotolerant and are capable of adapting to longer term temperature changes through regulating their body temperatures, through 82 evaporative heat loss. The Bos indicus breeds are generally more tolerant, and are comfortable up to 38\u00b0C, but require adequate water supply and shade. The study considered Khammouane as a \u2015hotspot\u2016 province in Lao PDR and noted that while stocking densities are quite high with 4,228 grazing units in 14 km2 of agricultural land (i.e. about 400 grazing units/km2),this does not include the large expanse of wetland which is also used by the livestock. The study notes that small holder cattle/buffalo systems are most vulnerable to increasing temperatures, and the very high temperatures expected in the dry season coupled with the lack of suitable fodder will reduce growth rate, reproductive performance and increase susceptibility to disease. It also recognizes the shortage of fodder as a result of floods.

Although the tree is a forest species and not a wetland species, its importance for local livelihoods is such that a vulnerability assessment has been carried out on the species. Scaphium macropodum is a large straight tree up to 45 m tall with diameter at breast height (DBH) around 80 cm. Its leaves vary in shape and size according to age. It flowers in January and early February and fruits form in March to May. The fruits are brown and surrounded by a membranous wing up to 20 cm long and split open when it reaches the ground. The tree has a very restricted distribution in small pockets of low evergreen forest in southern Laos, growing mainly on rocks and shallow soils. It does not survive well outside of the forest and effective cultivation in plantations is not easy. It is a strongly masting species, which means that every three to four years it will produce an abundance of flowers and fruits. The mast years have a much greater production of seed than other years. Villagers report that there may be some connection between rainfall in January which keeps the flowers fresh for increased pollination, and honey bees are recognized as being important for pollination. Climate and rainfall patterns are said to determine the volume and quality of the fruits(Pinto, 2003). In the FAO database on agroforestry crops, the ecology of a similar species, Sterculia foetida, indicates that it can survive in a wide temperature range from 16 to 36\u00b0C, with optimal temperatures between 18 and 32\u00b0C. The preferred rainfall range is between 900\u2013 2000 mm per year. It prefers well drained, heavy to medium heavy soils, with a preferred pH between 6 and 7.5. The CAM matrix for Malva nuts is found in the Annex. The analysis shows that the species is highly vulnerable to increases in temperature, especially in the flowering season(January and February) when maximum temperatures will rise from 30\u201333\u00b0C to 32\u201335\u00b0C. Increased temperature may affect the flowering in several ways, e.g. through inhibiting the formation of the flowers and through reducing populations of honey bees known to be important for pollination. The impact will be felt in terms of reduced fruit production and perhaps reduced frequency of mast years dependent upon favourable climatic conditions. 83 Local people also maintain that fruiting is dependent upon having some rainfall during the flowering period. Climate change projections indicate that there is likely to be less rainfall in January and February, which could further reduce the size of the harvest and the frequency of masting years. The projected increase in temperature towards the end of the dry season when the fruit sets and the nuts are harvested(with maximum daily temperatures rising from 34\u201336\u00b0C to 36\u2013 38\u00b0C), may adversely affect fruit setting and fall. The increases in rainfall during the wet season, along with the projected increases in storms and flooding, are less likely to be of significance to Malva nuts since the trees are likely to be protected from storms in the forest and are above the level of the probable floods.

It is clear that whilst the overall wetlands and ecosystem component species have relatively moderate or even low vulnerability to climate change, the livelihood components on which the people depend appear to be much more vulnerable, apart perhaps from the fisheries livelihoods.

L White fish During the wet season when they are in the wetlands, they will benefit from the larger flooded area and access to breeding sites and food sources. Their higher vulnerability results from their sensitivity to poor water quality and temperature, as well as unknown stresses in the main river during the dry M 85 season.

Unsustainable harvest of aquatic resources such as fish and wildlife, and of NTFPs such as Malva nuts Increases the pressure on the wetland resources, reducing the biodiversity and viability of populations, making the wetlands as a whole less resilient A less resilient wetland will not function as effectively in its ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration. Stresses from climate change will be compounded by those from unsustainable use. Changes in numbers of cattle and buffalo It appears that there is an increase in cattle and decrease in buffalo numbers. Cattle tend to feed around the edges of the wetland rather than inside the floating grasslands. Pressure will be put on the edge vegetation, and the ecological contributions of large herbivores in the grasslands will be reduced. The edges of the wetland area will experience the most climate change stress, drying out more quickly and with potential for higher floods. The vegetation at the habitat edges is where changes will be observed, and the cattle grazing pressure will be highest at the edges of the Beung Kiat Ngong, so there may be a 87 Non-climate change threats to wetlands Trends and pressures Implications with climate change synergistic effect. Lack of grazing pressure within the wet grasslands may change species composition and increase the risk of fire in dry season. Agricultural practices More intensive use of fertilizers and agricultural chemicals, leading to build\u2013up of contaminants. Potential chemical stress on some species may be worsened by climate stress. Tree-cutting General trend will reduce the structure of flooded forest habitat. Increases storm pressure on remaining trees. Illegal encroachment of forest and wetland areas Encroachment for agriculture on wetland areas. With climate change, more land may be exposed during the dry season and become suitable for agriculture, leading to further increases in trend. Fire Fire in grassland and shrubland during the dry season, often started on purpose e.g. for hunting, is a natural process and may be beneficial for the wetland ecosystem, but not if fire coverage is comprehensive. Increasing temperatures and evapotranspiration in the dry season will tend to dry out the grassland vegetation to a greater extent, increasing the risk of fire. Climate change may make fire more of a threat to the ecosystem rather than assomething beneficial. Escapes of invasive and non-native fish species, such as Tilapia from aquaculture ponds Tilapia is already found in the Beung Kiat Ngong ecosystem, so further escapes are unlikely to make this problem worse. Tilapia is probably marginally more vulnerable than the black fish species to the stresses of climate change, so climate change is unlikely to make this threat worse. Invasion by alien species Two invasives are currently becoming a problem: Golden Apple Snail and Mimosa pigra. The snail is already beginning to supplant the native Pila species. Mimosa pigra has been observed on the edges of the wetland. Golden Apple snail and Pila are probably as resilient as each other to climate change, but the Golden Apple snail is more aggressive and, despite predation by Open Bill storks, is spreading widely. It may be spread even more due toincreased floods. Mimosa pigrashows low vulnerability to climate change and is likely to take advantage of floods to spread rapidly over the next few years into the Beung Kiat Ngong wetlands, taking over shrubland habitats. Inadequate human and financial resources to implement regulations and management plans Climate change funding may contribute towards better and more resilient management for the wetlands.

Degradation of the wetland and ongoing loss of biodiversity will reduce its attraction for tourists. the habitat and vegetation, but this will not be as significant as other pressures. Upgrading of existing roads and infrastructure Existing infrastructure in Beung Kiat Ngong consists of dirt roads around the wetland, which are in poor state in the wet season. Culverts and bridges are small. There is no major irrigation scheme. Any road upgrading should ensure adequate cross drainage and correct sizing of bridges and culverts to ensure adequate passage of flash floods, which will get worse under climate change. Construction of hydropower projects in the catchments There are hydropower projects planned and under construction on the Xe Pian river and on the Sekong, but not in the immediate catchment of the Beung Kiat Ngong. This is unlikely to have a compounding effect along with climate change, on Beung Kiat Ngong. Key: Orange = highly significant pressure, Yellow = significant pressure 9.3 Adaptation planning and development of a management plan Looking ahead to adaptation planning, the main conclusion from this assessment is that the wetland ecosystem is less vulnerable than its livelihood components, but that climate change brings an additional stress to the overall wetland ecosystem. There are already indications that the wetland is experiencing stress due to non-climate change factors such as unsustainable harvesting of natural resources, encroachment by agriculture and invasion by alien species. The indications that the wetland ecosystem is stressed is evident from the report by Timmins and Duckworth (2014) which shows the dramatic decline in bird species compared to previous surveys, and the increase in invasives. At present there does not appear to be much stress in terms of abstraction of water for dry season irrigation, so the availability of water during both wet and dry seasons does not yet appear to be problematic. If this were the case then the vulnerability of the overall habitat would be higher and would require water allocation management. This is perhaps in contrast to the wetlands at Xe Champhone where water for dry season irrigation is more important. The wetlands at Beung Kiat Ngong appear to be dynamically resilient to the main pressures of higher temperatures and reduced rainfall during the dry season, counterbalanced by more rainfall and inundation during the wet season. The resilience of the wetlands will undoubtedly be increased by better management measures on the natural resources, especially on very vulnerable species such as turtles; ensuring more sustainable off-take of the natural resources; restrictions on encroachment and tree felling; and measures to counter the invasion of Golden Apple snail and Mimosa pigra. It is perhaps the livelihood components that require greater attention from a purely climate change perspective, because with stronger and more resilient rice production, livestock farming and drinking water supply, there will be less dependence upon the wetland\u2018s natural resources, which would be used to compensate for production losses in the other subsistence sectors. The comparison between the natural ecosystem and its resources, with 89 agriculture and livestock systems is interesting because natural systems appear to be generally less vulnerable than the livelihood systems. However certain components of natural systems on which people depend(e.g. turtles and Malva nuts) are amongst the most vulnerable, and these may require special adaptation measures. 90 10 References Arias, M.

Men, more often than women, use natural resources commercially, which contributes to the formal economy, making men\u2019s activities more visible to policy makers, economists, scientists, and planners. Because of men\u2019s dominant presence in the commercial sphere, historically, early anthropologists, ecologists, and environmentalists paid little attention to the gender dimensions of knowledge systems pertaining to the environment (Aguilar, 2002). Women manage natural resources on a daily basis in their various roles, including as farmers, seafood harvesters, and household providers, and therefore carry unique and critically important knowledge about the environment (FAO, 2014, 2013, & 2011). Typically, women are responsible for subsistence food harvesting, e.g., growing crops, collecting edible forest plants or gleaning near shore for shellfish (FAO, 2014, 2013, and 2011). Women also provide other services for the family, such as collecting fuelwood and water, for which rural girls and women walk substantial distances in sometimes unsafe conditions (FAO, 2014). However, even today, despite their daily interaction with and dependence on natural resources, women have less access to and control over them than men. For example, in fisheries, due to the nature of women\u2019s work in nearshore capture, processing, and marketing seafood rather than offshore fishing, the participation of the nearly 90 million women worldwide (47% of the fisheries workforce) remains informal and invisible (FAO, 2013). The under-acknowledgement of women\u2019s roles in natural resource management has not only led to an undervaluation of the domestic sphere and unpaid work, but also an underestimation of the economic and societal benefits that women provide to the environmental sector. Encouraging women\u2019s fair and equitable direct access to, benefits from, and governance of natural resources, is a globally agreed priority and the subject of many national and international mandates. Not only 6 Introduction does women\u2019s equitable participation and representation empower women and uphold commitments to gender equality and women empowerment, but it makes for better development and sustainability outcomes. Moreover, family and community livelihood is positively affected when women have their own resources and hold decision- making authority regarding those resources. In 2014, Conservation International (CI), an early supporter and contributor to the 2013 pilot Environment and Gender Index (EGI), collaborated with IUCN\u2019s Global Gender Office (GGO) to produce case studies about the state of women in environmental decision making in three countries: Ecuador; Liberia; and the Philippines. The case studies examined: 1) how each country ranks on various gender equality indices, including the EGI; 2) how well women are represented in international delegations; and 3) how many top positions women hold in environmental nongovernmental organizations (ENGOs) and environmental government ministries. The case studies are to serve as a tool for expanding and deepening EGI data and analysis. Key findings from the countries include: \u2022\ufffd In Ecuador and the Philippines, women\u2019s involvement in community- level processes regarding the environment varies by region; \u2013 In some areas, women and girls have very limited exposure to decision-making processes, women and girls are less educated, and stronger patriarchal roles prevent women from engaging in resource management discussions. \u2022\ufffd The Philippines appears to be the strongest performer from a policy standpoint; the Philippines has been a leader, especially within Southeast Asia, for enacting gender-sensitive policies and other policies pertaining to women\u2019s rights since the late 1980s; \u2013 However, in many areas of the Philippines, gender quotas and women\u2019s engagement in resource management circles appear to be strong on paper, but there are inconsistencies in some areas/sectors in upholding those policies and gender quotas for women\u2019s participation. \u2022\ufffd Ecuador has also enacted gender-sensitive policies in environmental management, however the implementation of these appears to be limited, especially given the lack of gender expertise among the staff in the environmental sector. \u2022\ufffd Liberia appears to be trailing behind both Ecuador and the Philippines in environmental protection and conservation as a whole, as well as the systematic engagement of women in this sector; Key Findings 7 Introduction \u2013 However, Liberia is beginning to make a conscious effort to involve women in in decision making in profound ways, with a recent high percentage of female environmental ministers and an active civil society; \u2013 Liberian women\u2019s largest struggle is in rural areas, where women have less access to education, less experience with technical environmental concepts, and thus lower participation rates in environmental decision making.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c06e7b74-796d-4c68-8755-f73c0a11f32a": {"__data__": {"id_": "c06e7b74-796d-4c68-8755-f73c0a11f32a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women in environmental decision making : case studies in Ecuador, Liberia, and the Philippines", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8d336c5036c2a24590b5c29e571f5161cdc7fe4a3d9454388d948dc5d9996da"}, "2": {"node_id": "24eaa996-cb87-409a-970a-34f18e67bc91", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ca3622c010567bf8b0e81d274799cf26c74044eb57b43869f1b56e5e229133b"}}, "hash": "133978c0511b4612299dab7ee7d7ec458f6b2bc639791c8069c20458a61059fd", "text": "\u2022\ufffd All of the research and interviews indicate that women in all three countries face, to varying degrees, patriarchal/sociocultural stereotypes that impede women\u2019s involvement in decision making. \u2022\ufffd While women may not have opportunity to develop technical capacity", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5cb9d92-e762-4237-a775-36fdfb25178a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5cb9d92-e762-4237-a775-36fdfb25178a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women in environmental decision making : case studies in Ecuador, Liberia, and the Philippines", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bae1c5777dcf8f284c4ce0f40975c7ce9b748b04cc1b10d708cdc4ee0b3ba640"}, "3": {"node_id": "7ec35d28-ecd1-4b6b-a259-94e24c92d48c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1752c1bf48d01b3eaff5c7c721a671a110eba3ca59b801fe2681bb79981ac98"}}, "hash": "4491cfa96648317c875e3b4a8f3380fb3fdba173538786f035b94484d8d3128b", "text": "or benefit from technical training, their local or traditional knowledge appears to be undervalued. Targeted recommendations are included in each case study; those recommendations include: \u2022\ufffd Although a multitude of policies are in place, gaps in implementation remain; \u2022\ufffd Empowering women in the environmental sector will require a cultural shift for all countries; \u2013 Women need to be seen as a partner both in the home and in the community, as well as in economic and political spheres; \u2022\ufffd Women, particularly at the community level, need more exposure and access to trainings, education, and financial resources; \u2022\ufffd Men and men\u2019s groups need to be actively engaged to understand the benefits of a gender responsive approach and the full engagement of women; \u2022\ufffd There is a need for better allocation of funds for gender-related work; \u2013 Capacity building of individuals working in the environmental sector to address gender in their projects is indispensable; \u2022\ufffd Awareness-raising about the importance of including women, and promoting their involvement at all levels of decision making, is essential; \u2022\ufffd Establishing women\u2019s groups may help to empower women from neighboring communities; \u2013 For example, sharing stories and struggles within women\u2019s groups may help encourage other women to participate in formal environmental decision making processes, spread capacity, and promote equality between sons and daughters within the family. Moving Forward 8 Introduction \u2022\ufffd Information needs to be shared to demonstrate that there is a higher level of success in environmental projects when women are involved in decisions concerning resource use and access; \u2022\ufffd Opportunities to advance women\u2019s careers at higher levels in the environmental sector need to be addressed; upward mobility appears to be restricted, which seems to be associated with cultural stereotypes; \u2022\ufffd There is a need for more local level sex-disaggregated data for a richer comparison of women at the national and subnational context; and \u2022\ufffd A lack of empirical studies on the implications of women\u2019s participation in environmental decision making at all levels remains for the three countries and beyond; more rigorous local-level research examining the gender dimensions of resource use and natural resource management is needed in order to promote and advance gender work. 9 Introduction Objectives of the Study The four-fold goal of the EGI is to measure implementation of global agreements, promote transparency and accountability at the national level, improve information, and empower and aid countries to take steps toward the promotion of gender equality in relation to the environmental sector. Under this umbrella, national level analysis in the three selected countries aims to contribute to a number of important objectives, specifically: 1. Analyze the state of gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in environment-related sectors; 2. Identify institutional, policy, and other bottlenecks that women face in environment-related sectors; 3. Highlight best practices and facilitate input and engagement with diverse stakeholders; and 4. Develop and disseminate context-specific recommendations to encourage improved action and data collection. As a unique source of national data, as well as regional and international trends, the EGI is compelling and useful for a wide range of audiences. The country case studies aim to primarily serve the interests of governmental organizations (e.g., environment and women\u2019s ministries) and civil society, particularly environmental and women\u2019s organizations, in Ecuador, Liberia, and the Philippines. The case studies reveal performance trends and may help to guide future priorities for implementation of gender commitments and programmes, including those of the researching/commissioning organizations (i.e., IUCN and CI.) Stakeholders may have the opportunity to view otherwise unknown information, review actions needed within each country to advance women\u2019s representation in decision making, and identify comparisons of effective policies or practices amongst each other. Audience 10 Objectives of the Study Methodology Various criteria were carefully considered to select countries for these in-depth case studies. First, IUCN and CI were interested in selecting culturally and regionally diverse countries that could potentially demonstrate various lessons for the international community. Countries in which either or both organizations have existing relationships at the ministry level was essential, as was a governance situation that was adequate to support detailed research. Relationships with civil society were also important, as those stakeholders offered important access to information and analysis.

The ENGOs considered in this analysis were selected based upon their relative influence and size at the national level, according to consultation with participants in each country. Unfortunately, while identified as important early on, other indicators that described the amount of investment into gender and the environment were dropped due to the lack of availability of information (Please refer to Appendix A for a full list of indicators). Within the national policy context, quantitative indicators were selected to ensure representativeness of women\u2019s involvement in the major sectors of the environmental sector: civil society; government; and international environmental delegations. To complement the quantitative indicators, qualitative data were collected through the use of interviews and literature review.

It consists of four distinct regions: El Oriente (Amazon Basin region), La Sierra (highlands including the Andes Mountain Range), La Costa (coastal region), and the Galapagos Islands (off the Pacific coast) (Duffy et al., 2012). With a population of 15.7 million as of 2013, Ecuador\u2019s economy heavily relies on its natural resources, tourism revenue, and agricultural products (World databank, 2014). Rich in natural biodiversity, Ecuador is known as one of the leading countries in Latin America for environmental protection (Larrea et al., 2005). However, the country\u2019s high rates of poverty threaten the sustainability of its resources (Larrea et al., 2005). In terms of gender, Ecuador has made significant progress since the 1990\u2019s in recognizing women\u2019s rights and government policies on gender issues (CONAMU, 2004). Many of these policies established under Ecuador\u2019s constitution tend to focus on women\u2019s rights as they pertain to women\u2019s labor (equal pay for equal work), political participation, sexual reproduction, domestic violence, equal access and opportunity to ownership of resources, and gender budgeting (Quesada-Aguilar et al., 2013; CONAMU, 2004). However, despite legislation progress, in daily life, Ecuadorian women are subject to severe discrimination (CONAMU, 2004). Statistics have revealed that women and girls have lesser access than men and boys to basic social services, suffer pay discrimination, have limited roles in decision making, and suffer high rates of unreported domestic violence (CONAMU, 2004). As in many societies around the world, a culture of male dominance is pervasive across multiple sectors of Ecuadorian society, which has depreciated women\u2019s voice and influence in resource decision making (Duffy et al., 2012; personal communication October 2014). Moreover, many Ecuadorian women are also victims of dual-discrimination, on the basis of not only their gender but their ethnic and cultural origin (CONAMU, 2004). Interviews emphasized that Mestizo women, Andean women, and Amazonian women experience varying degrees of discrimination (with Mestizo women typically suffering the most discrimination), which in turns affects the engagement of women in resource decision making. 14 Country Summaries Since the 1990s, there has been some initiative to link gender and environmental issues (Quesada-Aguilar et al., 2013). In 1995, for example, a regional effort to train individuals primarily from civil society organizations (CSOs) to address gender in natural resource management was initiated with the programme on Managing Ecosystems and Resources with Emphasis on Gender (MERGE) (Arroyo et al., 2002).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5984215-43e3-405c-9c7c-7fad10e565d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5984215-43e3-405c-9c7c-7fad10e565d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women in environmental decision making : case studies in Ecuador, Liberia, and the Philippines", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7714092a9789c180ec645d6b738a1aa45fe1d2e8d349e105aa413dd5d60664cf"}, "2": {"node_id": "14ed6433-31ca-4e8d-8d0a-f9fa0c8315d7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee29b79e83f45507b7d23030f136647cbddf17f1af0ccc9372a1335f355b6061"}}, "hash": "6c8d06d38b59e1f48fb78149efe09fde66b282aa26e8cd34dc80800861291223", "text": "Coordinated by the University of Florida (UF), MERGE was initiated to build capacity of various environmental professionals from CSOs working with communities in Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil.

Toward the end of 2002, the Inter-Institutional Forum on Gender and the Environment was formed and was reportedly working with the Local Environmental Management Directorate on defining guidelines for the incorporation of gender in decentralized environmental programmes (CONAMU, 2004). In 2009, Ecuador\u2019s Ministry of Environment began incorporating a gender focus and gender sensitive indicators in environmental projects. However, despite these efforts, interviews revealed that within environmental organizations and institutions, there are challenges in addressing gender in environmental projects due to a lack of financial resources for gender work and a low awareness about the value of women\u2019s participation in environmental management. Ecuador performed well on the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), ranking 53 out of a total of 178 countries, and it ranks first among Liberia and the Philippines (Table 1.1; see Appendix B for further detail). Ecuador performed moderately well on the gender inequality indices, placing second (in relation to Liberia and the Philippines) in the Global Gender Gap (GGG) Index, Gender Inequality Index (GII) and Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) (Table 1.1). Ecuador was not ranked in the 2013 Environment and Gender Index.1 Results and Discussion Index Performance 1. In the 2013 pilot phase of the EGI, 72 countries were included in the ranking. These were included based on availability of information at the time. 15 Country Summaries Table 1.1 Ecuador\u2019s ranking on gender equality and environmental indices Overall Rank **Ecuador not ranked** 21 out of 142 82 out of 187 18 out of 86 53 out of 178 Index Environment and Gender Index (EGI) Global Gender Gap (GGG) Gender Inequality Index (GII) Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) Environmental Performance Index (EPI) Case Rank (Out of 3 countries) -- 2 2 2 1 Women\u2019s representation in key environmental positions Only a quarter (25%) of Ecuador\u2019s environmental ministers are women (Table 1.2; see Appendix B for a breakdown of ministries). There is a slightly higher percentage, 29%, of female Vice Ministers of Environment (2 out of 7 vice ministers). Within civil society, a select number of national NGOs were considered on the basis of influence and size. Of the eight major NGOs considered for Ecuador, only a quarter (25%) of NGO presidents/executive directors are women and about 32% of NGO board members are women (Table 1.2). However, this presents a small picture of women\u2019s representation in civil society in Ecuador. Some data regarding Ecuadorian NGO board membership and executive leadership were not accessible (see Appendix B for more information). On a national level, it appears that higher levels of environmental decision making appear to be somewhat restricted for women in government and in civil society. While women are participating in government and civil society organizations, men continue to hold the majority of executive positions. In the main international decision-making fora for environmental issues and sustainable development, specifically the so-called \u201cRio Conventions\u201d on climate change, biodiversity and combatting desertification, as well as the financial mechanisms by which these and their programmes are funded, it appears that Ecuadorian women have greater representation, possibly a result of the level of technical 16 Country Summaries expertise among women in these sectors or specific initiatives of these processes to encourage gender balance. For international environmental decision making, the highest representation of women serving as government delegates was at the UNFCCC COP19, where 41% of delegates were women (Table 1.2). Across the UN Rio Conventions (UNFCCC COP19, UNCCD COP11, and CBD COP11), about 38% of government delegates were women (Table 1.2). Both Rio Convention Focal Points and Global Environmental Facility (GEF) Focal Points had an equal representation of women (Table 1.2). It is noteworthy that women\u2019s participation was highest in international climate change negotiations (UNFCCC). This was also found to be the case for women in the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI), a multilateral conservation initiative among six countries in the Coral Triangle region (Luna, 2014). Women in CTI climate change adaptation technical working groups and regional exchange discussions had an average participation rate of 40%, the highest across the CTI\u2019s environmental technical areas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90709158-5755-4836-bdad-baf267f45d16": {"__data__": {"id_": "90709158-5755-4836-bdad-baf267f45d16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women in environmental decision making : case studies in Ecuador, Liberia, and the Philippines", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92c2633b18f903b2f03ed90bc61b2c98b13fc9e605a4efddea6c67d83cfe9146"}, "2": {"node_id": "423ce704-208d-4093-beeb-872e47ec985d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6531bec672b082df1daf726ec062cfdb885e3eefb568f79ca7229f97e47dec36"}}, "hash": "152f19e719b6012261225ee080659f4d208db41cbba2b20ccf8c18eb09acd596", "text": "Climate change adaptation is a relatively new field\u2014compared to biodiversity, fisheries, desertification, forestry, and agriculture\u2014entering the environmental management agenda sometime in the 1990s (Tol et al., 1998).

(2012). Machismo-marianismo ideology refers to the cultural norm that men retain the right to subordinate women and women must hold to their submissive role in society (Stevens, 1973). Even as women move into the labor force in Latin America, the passivity endemic throughout marianismo ideology could explain why so few Ecuadorian women seek work outside the home (only 58% of women aged 15-64 participate in the labor force compared with 83% of men of the same age range), and when they do, they often attain low-paying and low-skilled jobs (World dataBank, 2014; Duffy et al., 2012). The prevalence of machismo-marianismo ideology may also explain why few women serve as ministers and vice ministers of environment 18 Country Summaries and few are present on NGO boards and serve as executive directors and/or presidents. However, women\u2019s relatively strong performance in international environmental delegations suggests that women, while they are not represented well in top leadership positions, are gaining technical expertise in addressing environmental issues. One interviewee commented on the disconnect between women\u2019s involvement in national and subnational decision-making processes: \u201cThe last three ministers of environment have been women and at national levels women occupy many key leadership positions. There are more women studying and working in the environmental sciences than ever before and in meetings on environmental issues, women are often the majority of participants. However, this does not necessarily mean that gender issues or inequalities are resolved ... when you move out of the national context into environmental leadership in local levels, there you have extreme problems in terms of being dominated by men, very few women present, [and] very few considerations of women\u2019s needs or incorporation of gender.\u201d Furthermore, interviews also indicated that there is a culture within Ecuador among women to seek their husband\u2019s approval for mobility outside the home (personal communication, October 2014). Needing a husband\u2019s approval for mobility outside the home can severely restrict women\u2019s ability to advance in any career including in the environmental arena and, in turn, engage in environmental decision making. Women experience this restriction in varying degrees throughout Ecuador\u2019s diverse regions (Duffy et al., 2012). The prevalence of machismo culture is much higher in La Costa (controlled primarily by the fishing industry and home to the mestizo ethnic group) than in El Oriente or La Sierra (where indigenous Amazonian and peasant Andean women have experienced a higher degree of empowerment) (personal communication, October 2014). Higher prevalence of machismo- marianismo culture in La Costa can make gender and fisheries-related projects more difficult. One interviewee noted that there is a higher- level of difficulty in La Costa compared to other regions of Ecuador for engaging women in natural resource management. 19 Country Summaries Interviews also indicated that gender-sensitive conservation work is not a funding priority in Ecuador; therefore, there remains inadequate allocation of funds for gender work. Without proper allocation of funds for gender work, environmental managers and conservation organizations have limited capacity and training to address gender in their projects. Furthermore, for women at the community level, educational attainment and language barriers (lack of Spanish language skills among indigenous women) are significant impediments to their involvement in environmental decision making. Without adequate levels of education, women have difficulty in understanding the technical language of environmental issues. Although in some areas of Ecuador (particularly in the Andean and Amazonian regions) women appear to becoming more involved in the environmental sector, there remains low capacity within institutions to advance women\u2019s role and address gender concerns in environmental projects and programmes. 1. Awareness raising and advocacy efforts should be geared towards: a.

Actions for Moving Forward 20 Country Summaries Liberia Background The Republic of Liberia, a West African country situated in the Upper Guinea Rainforest Region, has a tropical climate and is characterized by tremendous biodiversity and heavy rainfall (IUCN, 2012). Due to extreme poverty, the country is highly vulnerable to environmental and social instability. Fourteen years of civil war led to the destruction of much of the economy, state institutions, and national infrastructure (IUCN, 2012). Nevertheless, since 2003, Liberia has made substantial progress in negotiating peace, and women were instrumental in this process. In 2005, peaceful elections led to Africa\u2019s first democratically elected female Head of State, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf (IUCN, 2012; Piah, 2009). Following civil conflict, Liberia\u2019s economic growth has focused primarily on the use of its renewable and non-renewable natural resources (Bottem and Unrun, 2009; NGP, 2009). Even after nearly a decade of peacebuilding efforts, however, there is still significant pressure on Liberia\u2019s environment and ecosystem services due to the overexploitation of resources, violence, displacement of people, and other effects associated with Liberia\u2019s civil conflict (Piah, 2009; NGP, 2009). During the conflict, the destruction of natural resources was severe, resulting in the displacement of many communities, which disproportionately affected women\u2019s engagement in income-generating activities (MGD, 2009). In times of conflict, displacement can further exacerbate the lack of access to land and natural resources, which is at the center of women\u2019s poverty in most developing contexts (UNEP, 2013). During conflict, women often become the primary earners for their family; thus the loss of land makes them and their families particularly vulnerable to poverty, as sources of income are lost (UNEP, 2013). As a result, during peacebuilding efforts, the Liberian government put significant emphasis and priority on addressing gender inequalities and engaging women in natural resource management (Bottem and Unrun, 2009; NGP, 2009). Liberia\u2019s National Environmental Policy recognizes and acknowledges women\u2019s vital role in conservation and environmental management and aims to ensure their participation in all levels of environmental decision making (MGD, 2009). 21 Country Summaries However, despite the progress made in peace-building efforts to address gender gaps, \u201cwomen and girls continue to have limited access to education and health services, and the formal economy. Women have been left out of opportunities and participation in management and decision-making positions at all levels of the society,\u201d (MGD, 2009). Socio-cultural norms and practices that support female marginalization and male superiority perpetuate gender inequalities and women\u2019s subordination in Liberian society (MGD, 2009). The cultural expectation of women\u2019s roles as care takers and providers restricts their participation in the formal economy, leaving women to continually miss out on opportunities and participation in management and decision making at all levels of society (MGD, 2009). To ensure further progress for gender equality in Liberia\u2019s economic development, under the Ministry of Gender and Development, the Liberian government has instituted the National Gender Policy (NGP), intended \u201cto eliminate all gender related problems in Liberia\u201d (MGD, 2009). Under the NGP, the Ministry of Gender and Development is committed to addressing gender concerns in natural resource management and the environment. Under this umbrella, the NGP\u2019s objectives are: \u201c(1) To promote the active involvement of men and women in environmental decision making at all levels; [and] (2) to mainstream gender concerns and perspectives in all policies and programmes for sustainable development,\u201d (MGD, 2009). The time frame for the implementation of Liberia\u2019s NGP is 10 years (2010-2020) with a five-year midterm evaluation.

Liberia\u2019s weakest category on the EGI was Livelihood. Livelihood indicators include poverty levels, food adequacy, levels of anemia, solid fuel use, access to improved water sources, and access to sanitation.

Currently, 75% of Liberia\u2019s environmental ministers (3 out of 4) are women (Table 2.2). Within civil society, a select number of national NGOs were considered on the basis of influence and size (according to those consulted for this study.) Of the four major NGOs considered for Liberia, 53% of board members are women while none had women as president and/or executive director (Table 2.2). However, these data are not fully representative of the situation of Liberian women in civil society; many of the data regarding Liberian NGO board membership and executive leadership were not accessible. 23 Country Summaries Similarly, the information regarding vice ministers of environment was also not complete (see Appendix B for more information). In Liberia\u2019s international delegations for environmental conventions, women have a lower participation rate than in government and civil society positions. Liberia had the most female government delegates to the UNFCCC (38% women), followed by CBD (33%), with the UNCCD having no female delegates (Appendix B). Across the UN Conventions, delegates averaged only 24% women. For the three Rio Convention focal points, only one was a woman (CBD) and Liberia\u2019s GEF focal point is a woman (Table 2.2; Appendix B). Interestingly, as observed in Ecuador\u2019s UNFCCC delegation, Liberia\u2019s delegation in UNFCCC has the highest participation of women (38%) (Table 1.2; 2.2). This result is perhaps indicative of the level of investment each country has put forth for women engaging in climate change decisions and also the level of education and technical training provided for women within this sector. There have also been profound changes in UNFCCC decisions in recent years, including direct mandates to Parties to include and support women delegates.2 2.

At the management level of the EPA, I work alongside two women [but] there is [still] a minimal amount of women participating in decision making ... I think it is gradually getting better.\u201d The space for the inclusion of women in environmental decision making is just now being created (personal communication, September 2014). The NGP is working to increase women\u2019s involvement in decision making, but limitations abound. Most interviewees acknowledged Obstacles to Women\u2019s Participation 25 Country Summaries that the challenges for women to engage in environmental decision making are greatest within community structures in rural areas. In these community structures, because of women\u2019s cultural domestic roles, women are often found in the background of discussions, as it is traditionally the man\u2019s role to be the decision-maker (personal communication, September 2014). As a result of traditional roles, often only boys are sent to school, leaving girls and women uneducated and reliant on their husbands to make generally all major decisions outside of their domestic care taker roles (personal communication, September 2014). With boys and men receiving education, they are able to participate in the formal economy more than girls and women, perpetuating gender segregation in the labor market and limiting women\u2019s opportunities for economic empowerment (MGD, 2009). Due to these structural constraints associated with the gendered division of labor, women perform a larger percentage of unpaid work caring for family and the home (MGP, 2009). These responsibilities severely restrict their ability to participate in formal decision-making processes and thus leave women with less access to credit, training, and information that could improve their livelihood options (MGD, 2009). Moreover, lower levels of education and literacy rates among women in rural areas (as compared to their urban female counterparts and rural/urban men) further restricts their capacity to understand technical environmental language that is required to participate in certain environmental management circles (personal communication, September 2014). Interviews indicated that Liberia could benefit from women\u2019s involvement because women typically opt for more viable solutions and think in the long term, thus it is mutually beneficial to advance their role. 1. Within government, Liberia has laid out the key policies to advance gender work, including the Liberia Poverty Reduction Strategy and the National Gender Policy. Comprehensive implementation of these policies should be prioritized; 2. International donors should provide continued support to aid Liberia in its reconstruction process and guide allocation of funds to continue implementation of gendered policies and gender-responsive development on the ground; 3. The international community should provide technical assistance to the Liberian government and civil society for addressing gender Actions for Moving Forward 26 Country Summaries inequalities, aid in awareness-raising about the importance of including women, and promote women\u2019s involvement at all levels of decision making; and 4. For government and civil society programmes and projects, there should be a focus on giving rural women access to education and support that helps to shift traditional norms about women\u2019s roles in society. Activities should be focused on educational and economic empowerment in order to increase women\u2019s confidence to participate in decision making; 5. Across all stakeholders, an understanding of the value of women\u2019s knowledge should be fostered: while rural women, especially, may not demonstrate or believe they have \u201ctechnical\u201d knowledge, they have local knowledge, expertise, and capacity that contributes important information to environmental decision making; a. Project teams and rural women themselves should be educated so that they understand the importance of women\u2019s local knowledge, which should then be utilized to advance their role in environmental decision making. 27 Country Summaries Philippines Background The Philippines is an archipelagic nation in Southeast Asia, with over 100 million people inhabiting the nation\u2019s 7,100 islands (Burke et al., 2012). The country\u2019s primary environmental sectors are agriculture, fisheries, and forestry (ADB, 2008). In 2008, the environmental sector comprised 18.8% of the Philippine GDP and employed roughly 36.6% of the total labor force (ADB, 2008). Efforts to protect the environment in the Philippines have seen mixed success. The Philippines is still facing rapid depletion of environmental resources, but at the same time the country has seen improvements in its institutional framework to address environmental problems, such as better interagency coordination and higher capacity to prosecute environmental crimes (EC, 2009).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7958f451-2130-414e-8ea3-0ed89b486aaa": {"__data__": {"id_": "7958f451-2130-414e-8ea3-0ed89b486aaa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women in environmental decision making : case studies in Ecuador, Liberia, and the Philippines", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4019a13f3f5eb476a16e2de5d5c2911d8c1b63a1e43ba8b7fd5bc48bd30c8e9d"}, "2": {"node_id": "48d8a95d-0841-48cb-8ab9-425b15a68933", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5840c511a005df2736e73fabc935be319c589d5793b7b9e179b5105d3198263a"}}, "hash": "3bbe7444eb25868d6716d6ec9bf4d1e31c4e26298b82f8b1af7ab08e32bad552", "text": "The Philippines is also extremely vulnerable to natural disasters, such as the devastating Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, and has established a comprehensive institutional and legal framework for disaster response and management (Luna, 2001).

Beginning in the 1990s, the Philippines began incorporating gender into environmental policy. By 1998, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and the Department of Energy (DOE) had fully implemented a gender focal point system, following Executive Order (EO) 273, which adopted the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (PPFD) (DENR, 1998). However, despite its performance on policy variables, implementation of policies appears uneven and slow (UNDP, 2010). The Republic Act 7192 (otherwise known as Women in Development and Nation-Building Act 1992) states that: \u201call government departments shall ensure that women benefit equally and participate directly in the development programmes and projects of said department, specifically those funded under official foreign development assistance, to ensure the full participation and involvement of women in the development process.\u201d The programme on Gender and Development (GAD) requires a minimum 35% participation rate of women in community programmes across the environmental sector. However, UNDP (2010) 28 Country Summaries reported that there are often discrepancies in Philippine gender policy implementation. Clabots (2013) also found in her case study on women in marine protected area (MPA) management in the Philippines that many fisheries programmes were severely lacking in compliance with the Republic Act and the GAD programme requirements. Inconsistency in upholding gender progressive policies can limit women\u2019s empowerment in environmental decision making. The Philippines placed between Ecuador and Liberia on the EPI, which reinforces the mixed success the Philippines has experienced in environmental protection (Table 3.1). The Philippines placed first out of the three countries for the EGI, GGG, GII, and the SIGI (Table 3.1), which is expected given the country\u2019s global recognition and within Southeast Asia as a strong performer for enacting progressive gender- sensitive policies aimed at the advancement of women\u2019s rights (UNDP, 2010; WB, 2012).

For example, Clabots (2013) found in her case study in the Central Visayas region that women in certain barangays (villages), the smallest Philippine unit of governance, were excluded from MPA management. Men in this particular village 29 Country Summaries had reported that staff from the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) told them women were \u201cnot allowed\u201d to participate (Clabots, 2013). Interviewees also recognized the gender imbalance in participation at the community level, stating: \u201cI think at the national level, women are well- represented. We have women commissioners, we have women senators, women directors. However \u2026 I think at the community level, women are less represented. So there is an imbalance,\u201d (personal communication, September 2014). Evidently, although GAD requires a minimum of 35% participation rate of women, policies may not be strictly enforced in all regions and levels of the Philippines. It appears that women in the Philippine national government are also not taking on top positions. Only 20% of Philippine ministers of environment are women and only 36% vice ministers of environment are women (Table 3.2). Interestingly, most interviewees did not identify a gender imbalance at the national level: \u201cEven at the national level ... we have very active women participation in national committees for climate change, for marine protected areas, for fisheries \u2026 The head of the division under the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), who\u2019s looking after the protected areas system (NIPAS) in the Philippines is a woman \u2026 So I\u2019d say that in the Philippines the capacity of women to lead in conservation is [well] recognized,\u201d (personal communication, October 2014).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88ed62ce-3549-433a-aee2-685355b33a18": {"__data__": {"id_": "88ed62ce-3549-433a-aee2-685355b33a18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women in environmental decision making : case studies in Ecuador, Liberia, and the Philippines", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "099f309cc16018e3c68be98e3c2d17268f949e4415455be9593060cae13dba75"}, "2": {"node_id": "e83e275d-624a-489f-86f1-e6dbb23c78c8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3dfc6f480d685b072ddb2e86481451356b70088b85c7460b4aa1ec31d9a0340e"}}, "hash": "1c9258ac54ef0655f26f244430abc0a6e365e2858730cde9bf45cc02e174a3f9", "text": "Women\u2019s representation in key environmental positions 30 Country Summaries The analysis for these case studies solely examined government-held positions at the ministerial and vice ministerial levels; therefore it is possible that women in government may be better represented at lower levels of governance (as directors, division chiefs, etc.).

UNCCD, CBD) Rio Convention Focal Points GEF Focal Points 46 16 50 The majority of Philippine informants agreed that women\u2019s participation in environmental management is strong overall. One interviewee stated: \u201cFor the environment, there is a very good participation of women in environmental work in the Philippines. In fact [for marine conservation], in all the committees I sit in, there are more women than men, even at the local level. [...] Our most successful mangrove conservation work on site is headed by a women\u2019s group,\u201d (personal communication, October 2014). In addition to the policies established, the data reflect that overall there are efforts to engage women but cultural stereotypes may prevent women from participating in some community structures and achieve higher positions within government (personal communication, October 2014). Since 1989, to strengthen women\u2019s voice and influence in natural resource management and policy, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has initiated several mechanisms, including the creation of the Technical Working Committee on Women (TWCW) to serve as DENR\u2019s Women in Development Focal Point (PCW, 2009). The TWCW\u2019s function was to ensure that DENR policies, programmes and projects met the needs and interests of the women they served, as well as the interests of their female employees. Obstacles to Women\u2019s Participation 32 Country Summaries The Philippine Strategy for Sustainable Development (PPGD) also set specific objectives, \u201cto ensure the full participation in and benefit by women from sustainable development,\u201d (PCW, 2009). These objectives include gender mainstreaming and the promotion of women in decision making (PCW, 2009). However, despite the Philippines\u2019 policy advances, women still face certain obstacles, notably a male-dominant culture, which women experience to varying degrees across different areas of the Philippines and socioeconomic status (personal communication, October 2014). In the higher socioeconomic bracket, interviews indicated that it is more difficult for women to obtain high-level environmental decision-making positions. For example, women can occupy high-level positions in the environmental sector but they must have the academic pedigree (master\u2019s degree or Ph.D. with experience), while men occupy these positions without the same academic credentials and are hired solely based on their experience. Although the country performed relatively well on the quantitative variables, the low percentage of women serving as ministers of environment (only 20% are women) is indicative that this sentiment is in fact playing out within government. Nevertheless, Filipina women\u2019s greatest struggle is in the under- developed and impoverished provinces and municipalities. The state of the Philippines\u2019 environment is a direct result of economic and social factors, including poverty and rapid population growth (PCW, 2009). The role of women is critical in combating poverty, an important part of which is ensuring women can control their own reproductive health and family size, in order to maintain resource sustainability (PCW, 2009). Women in impoverished, rural areas of the Philippines have limited educational opportunities and they experience greater gendered stereotypes that prevent them from engaging in natural resource management (personal communication, September 2014). Women, especially in the Mindanao province, have very limited exposure to decision-making processes (personal communication, October 2014).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce5c2728-76b3-4bd8-b2a9-95b361a755b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce5c2728-76b3-4bd8-b2a9-95b361a755b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women in environmental decision making : case studies in Ecuador, Liberia, and the Philippines", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76f01646f9165f9b815eb0da310510b377924a5493bfb0fd4baed17ffa801638"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1952395-867d-4e13-8a81-1f38418f9425", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/women-environmental-decision-making-case-studies-ecuador-liberia-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f5c479cb23757f1a65b5ca8a010d4fc498fac3280da6ae25d8512d6c3b25c4c"}}, "hash": "583770973dca0d2022e145ae58c2b972dbe1a165a170eaa3ebed39d48acf0df1", "text": "There is a preference to send sons rather than daughters to school, restricting daughters\u2019 ability to pursue a living outside the informal economy and receive education (personal communication, October 2014). 33 Country Summaries Actions for Moving Forward 1.

At professional levels, a business case for increasing women\u2019s leadership should be considered, training and empowerment programmes for women should be pursued, and professional women\u2019s networks should be supported. 34 Country Summaries Conclusion The governments of Ecuador, Liberia and the Philippines are all making conscious efforts to advance the role of women in environmental decision making. However, each country has its unique obstacles and hurdles to overcome before gender balance is achieved and gender equality is improved. Moreover, each country demonstrates that obstacles to women\u2019s participation and leadership vary amongst regions and levels of society. Since the 1990s, Ecuador has enacted a number of policies regarding women\u2019s rights and political participation. Moreover, the Ministry of Environment has initiated a gender-sensitive approach to natural resource management, highlighting the importance of addressing women\u2019s needs. However, over the past couple decades, Ecuador\u2019s agenda for gender-sensitive natural resource management has focused solely on the inclusion of women. There remains an inadequate understanding of the reasons for gender-sensitive projects and how to best integrate the meaningful participation of women. There are a number of women occupying leadership positions within the environmental sector; however, this does not guarantee that gender analysis is conducted in environmental projects. It appears that Ecuador\u2019s most pressing problems are the lack of fund allocation for developing/supporting gender expertise in the environmental sector and strong cultural ideologies that prevent women in community structures from participating in management and decision making. Liberia, a post-conflict nation, is still in the rebuilding process to reestablish state institutions, national infrastructure, and restore decision-making processes. Women have been at the forefront of the rebuilding process, and gender equality has been a strong priority for the Liberian government. Liberia has enacted both gender-sensitive environmental policies and the National Gender Policy, which ensures and promotes women\u2019s participation in resource management, but compared to Ecuador and the Philippines, these policies are still in their infancy. Rural Liberian women are in the greatest need of support, where they suffer from extremely low literacy rates compared to that of their urban female counterparts and both rural and urban men. Efforts should be focused on building the capacity of Liberia\u2019s environmental sector (government and civil society organizations) to address gender in their projects and implement relevant national policies, educating women in rural areas, and working to educate men about women\u2019s roles inside and outside the home. 35 Conclusions The Philippines is well advanced from a policy standpoint. Beginning in the late 1980s and carrying into the 1990s, the Philippines passed a multitude of policies and programmes to ensure and promote women\u2019s involvement in economic development and in turn natural resource management. The Philippines has experienced much success in engaging women in natural resource management at multiple levels, however, government projects in certain provinces and municipalities have been found to be inconsistent in upholding gender-sensitive policies and gender quotas. It is within these areas, where women need to be better educated on their rights and promoted as equal partners both inside the home and in the community. Furthermore, Filipina women seem to experience difficulty in achieving higher-level positions within government, even though their educational attainment is often higher. Therefore, professional women\u2019s networks that focus on empowering women into leadership roles should be supported. The common theme among these three countries, which represent very diverse cultures and geographical landscapes, is that the majority of women, in both rural and urban areas, experience some degree of discrimination inherent in the historical patriarchal system and related set of cultural expectations, restricting their ability to reach high- level environmental decision-making positions.

WHO, 2012 (http://www.who.int/topics/anaemia/en/) *forthcoming Anemia in women reduces their work productivity and places them at risk for poor pregnancy outcomes including increased risk of maternal mortality, perinatal mortality, premature births and low birth weight. Greater percentages of women with anemia is also an indication of inadequate nutrition for women. 90% (United States) - best performer 38% (Mali) - worst performer Final percentages are 1990 - 2012 averages. Higher value indicates less anemia.

Our inclusion of this measure of biome protection assumes that a more diverse and geographically larger area of protected area in a country translates into a greater possibility that women have access to the natural resources they need. It also assumes that good governance in a country always includes both the environment and gender equality. Although there is some new evidence connecting women\u2019s participation to protected areas, we have not yet researched this connection ourselves. And conversely, a country with a high percentage of protected areas may have laws and practices in the gender equality arena that are not as positive, or vice versa.

The definition of X may vary by country. An increase in growing stock usually means higher quality forests, whereas a decrease in growing stock generally indicates degrading forest conditions. Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2012 (http://epi.yale.edu/epi2012/ rankings) original data sources used: FAO\u2019s Growing stock in forest in Global Forest Resources Assessment (www.fao.org) Data period covered 1990, 2000, 2005 and 2010 Women are dependent on access to and control of forest resources, including Non-Timber Forest Products. 99.98 (Spain) - best performer 0.35 (Saudi Arabia) - worst performer Data from 2000 - 2005. This variable measures the change in forest growing stock between 2000 - 2005. The best condition receives a value of 1 (converted from zero in the original EPI indicator).

The analysis consisted of keyword searches and the extent of gender mainstreaming in reported actions5. 5. The analysis of country reports to the Rio Conventions and CEDAW was a labor-intensive undertaking and included the review of more than 300 reports over the course of 6 months. The EGI core team handled the large majority of reports that are in English and additional consultants were brought into handle a handful of reports in Spanish, French, Arabic, Russian, and Portuguese. The keyword search for the Rio Conventions included the words gender, sex, female, women, woman, gender equity, and gender equality. The keyword search for CEDAW included the words agrarian, agricul* (agriculture, agricultural), credit, energ*, environment, farm*, fish*, food, food security, land, loan/loans, natural resources, rural women, and water. The search terms were developed based on a sample group of country reports to these conventions. Some words that we did not include for the CEDAW analysis - including forest* and biodiversity - will be included in the EGI\u2019s 2nd phase. The keyword search required careful analysis of the terms included in the report - as one example, many mentions of \u201cfemale\u201d referred to livestock and not women. The second part of the report analysis was a gender analysis of actions and projects included in the report. The following elements were scored: a) Inclusion of a gender-related action/project in the report, b) Gender/women included in project title, c) Gender/women as one of the objectives, d) Explanation of the project\u2019s contribution to gender equality or women\u2019s empowerment, e) Specific activities on gender/women described, f) M&E of gender-related actions mentioned, g) Implementing institution mentioned, h) Implementing institution has gender expertise, i) Timeframe devoted to gender-related activities listed, j) Resources allocated to gender-related activities. This analysis was more qualitative than the keyword search and involved careful analysis of projects throughout the report. One of the overall challenges we faced was the scattered availability of reports online. Often country reports were missing online or organized in a fashion that made it difficult to determine the country\u2019s most recent report (and activities). On several occasions, the team would encounter a group of countries\u2019 latest reports after having completed analysis of earlier reports that seemed to be the latest. Another challenge was the lack of continuity between country reports - one country may prepare a report of over 150 pages while another country submitted a report of less than 10 pages. We got around this challenge by controlling for the number of pages. While the report analysis was a painstaking process, this is the first effort of its kind to analyze gender-environment in a large group of country reports to the Rio Conventions and CEDAW. We believe it is an important contribution to the EGI and hope the act of monitoring will contribute to accountability to global gender mandates and create momentum for future actions on gender-environment. 73 Appendix Gender analysis of UNFCCC country reports Gender analysis of UNFCCC country reports Description Description Source/date Source/date Highest value Highest value Lowest value Lowest value Data notes Data notes Inclusion of gender terminology and gender-related action in UNFCCC National Adaptation Programmes for Action (NAPAs) and National Communications (NCs).

More than 6,000 people from 170 countries attended this event which enabled conservation professionals to take stock of progress made since the previous congress, in Durban, South Africa, in 2003. And also to discuss the challenges that have emerged since then. From this point of view, Africa is particularly under pressure. The causes are many and have been the subject of numerous evaluations, some of them led by the IUCN Program on African Protected Areas & Conservation (IUCN-Papaco) since 2006. In addition to poor management effectiveness, one of these causes is the weak governance of most PAs, which negatively impacts on all activities that are conducted on the ground. That is why IUCN-Papaco focuses on governance in the context of a roadmap for Protected Areas: more ethical behavior, more legitimacy for decisions, accountability and transparency in the way they are made, more stakeholders involved, more professionalism for managers, more ownership of the tremendous assets that PAs offer, more recognition for those who succeed, more durability for conservation... these are the directions that this roadmap tries to promote for the future of conservation in Africa. To ensure a good participation of Africa at the congress, we launched a call for proposals open to stakeholders involved in and around PAs. The objective was to prepare key messages that would be brought to the congress by a team of conservationists coming from all over the continent. This was a great success and we received more than 150 proposals (from 33 African countries). After a rigorous selection process, 22 candidates were selected and became our \u201cchampions\u201d. Their messages cover all aspects of PA good governance, PA management efficiency and the sustainability of conservation. Together, they deliver a comprehensive and consistent message about the present and the future of protected areas on the continent and were to some extent \"the voice of Africa\" at the congress. All these champions indeed travelled to Sydney and were able to speak clearly and loudly about conservation in Africa. And they were listened to. This book is about this fantastic journey. It gathers all these experiences and tells you the story of our 22 champions, their messages and their hope.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aec08180-9ad4-493e-ac70-a9136d340c0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "aec08180-9ad4-493e-ac70-a9136d340c0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Twenty-two stories of conservation in Africa : key elements for effective and well-governed protected areas", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2cfb3495c5963209cc46161b4737afb1112b7814286943e3acb1773e448f461"}, "2": {"node_id": "ddf7a051-b08b-43e0-85da-902611dab44a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35dfa9c9b8033a2a80468d939977f49480c8d83929ecf3619820c5a4adc27494"}}, "hash": "339aa1a4e37bfc31062ca9b0ea4b90a7fea3e4592103f2d84a4d5a0234074adb", "text": "Whilst certainly not comprehensive, it gives you a good overview of what Africa can produce in terms of conservation when stakeholders, on the ground, commit themselves for the sake of African Nature.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS None of this work would have been possible without the financial support of the French Development Agency (Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement \u2013 AFD) through the IUCN- France partnership, the FIBA Foundation (Fondation Internationale du Banc d\u2019Arguin) and the EU and ACP Secretariat through the BIOPAMA (Biodiversity and Protected Areas Management) Programme. It is thanks to their help and support that the project of the 22 champions was created and run. Our deepest appreciation also goes to the 22 champions themselves for their hard work on their stories and on their presentations at the World Park Congress. Despite all the Papaco\u2019s - sometimes heavy - demands, they answered to all our expectations and their reactivity and optimism made it very pleasant for us to work with all of them. Finally, we would like to thank Guy Broucke, Christine Mentzel and Stella Musiiwa from IUCN as well as Daniel Marnewick from BirdLife South Africa who gently offered to proofread this book and helped us to finalise it. ! !

INTRODUCTION: THE EVOLUTION OF PROTECTED AREAS GOVERNANCE IN AFRICA The International Union for Conservation of Nature defines a protected area as a clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values (IUCN 2008). Protected areas are organized in six management categories (from a strict nature conservation approach to sustainable use of natural resources) that today include more than 200,000 protected areas spread across the globe. They are managed by different stakeholders (states, local populations, private companies, etc.) who determine the governance of these PAs, defined as the process of decision-making and interaction between those who \u201cgovern\u201d the protected areas. In Africa, the general trend for a long time has been to let the State be responsible for protected areas management.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82125504-9586-4380-9116-f721c3545beb": {"__data__": {"id_": "82125504-9586-4380-9116-f721c3545beb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Twenty-two stories of conservation in Africa : key elements for effective and well-governed protected areas", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0bba972c2229fa407685be5ebb9d9e2d1a75d143f15293f33c29826122e510c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "a2c5b8df-bd85-456d-b1db-824a431859d0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e4f03d9e88c68d80acb2897f574dbb24dd3cc79c6e98e4201c2c6513670568a"}}, "hash": "75de572aeab9457c7ef74660548d126b4dd9833327b08afeb49ea24b27999a9e", "text": "This led to the exclusion of other stakeholders from natural resources management and nature conservation.

However, with a significant rate of biodiversity loss over the last decades, even the most optimistic observers recognize that conservation in Africa is at stake. Although many challenges remain and the continent still has a long way to go, African protected areas seem to slowly move from this exclusive approach to more open and effective types of governance. The 22 stories that are presented in this document are some examples of the challenges that African protected areas face and of the solutions and adaptations that can address these challenges. These case studies underline the importance of three major aspects that reflect the shift of PA governance in Africa and the evolution of the key actors that are involved in this governance. State governance, whilst necessary, seems to be modernizing and accommodating the circumstances of its time, with changes in practices and scales (Part 1). The integration of a broader range of stakeholders brings more and more skills to PAs governance institutions and thus enhances its quality (Part 2). Furthermore, integrating local populations into the management of PAs ensures their legitimacy and thus allows them to reach their conservation goals (Part 3). Finally, development and conservation should not be opposed as the promotion of local development thanks to conservation policies can ensure the commitment of all stakeholders to conservation (Part 4). ! PART 1 PROTECTED AREAS MANAGED BY THE GOVERNMENT: CHANGES IN PRACTICES AND SCALE As mentioned in the introduction, innovative management of protected areas is on the increase in Africa and the proportion of repressive and inefficient protected areas appears to decline in favour of more efficient and well-managed areas. Although this contrast in management efficiency is often associated to the antagonism private vs public management, the change of protected areas management in Africa is not necessarily a shift between state- managed protected areas and privately managed protected areas. Indeed, some governments have shown their capacity to evolve and to implement new policies of conservation adapted to their time: policies that implement changes in practices and scale. Effective state-led conservation policies Concerned by the effectiveness of its protected areas, the government of Senegal decided, in 2012, to thoroughly reform its approach to conservation by putting in place collaborative and effective tools aiming at the creation of two new marine protected areas per year that would be managed in collaboration with all stakeholders (From top-down to bottom-up, Binta Ba Diaw). In the meantime in southern Africa, Botswana went further and made certain that the integration of multiple actors in the management of protected areas would not endanger the effectiveness of protected areas and would allow them to fulfil their goal of long-term conservation (Improving protected areas\u2019 management effectiveness, Virat Motshereganyi). Conservation beyond borders Because biodiversity issues do not necessarily stop at political borders, states sometimes have to collaborate to implement effective conservation policies. In this regards, Leseho Sello\u2019s story about the collaboration between Mozambique and South Africa (Beyond Borders) and Nicholas de Goede\u2019s description of the tools that explain the success of the collaboration between South Africa and Namibia in the \u01c0Ai-\u01c0Ais/Richtersveld Transfrontier Park (Recipe for a good couple life) show that this collaboration is possible and desirable.

To do so, it supports the implementation of volunteer groups composed of local populations of the MPA. GOVERNANCE KEY ACTORS The identification of local actors starts with the exploration of the area of interest in terms of coastal and marine biodiversity (future MPA) and goes on with the formalization of the status of this zone as a PA. During this process, the CCMPA contacts the administrative authorities of the locality and various decentralised technical services, civil society organisations and development NGOs. ! \u201cCreate two new MPA per year and take into account the needs of the population living close to these areas\u201d! LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS TRAINING TO USE OF PARTICIPATIVE PLANNING TOOLS For the second step of the process, the CCMPA organises a workshop to train local stakeholders (populations, members of communities\u2019 organisations, officials, members of decentralised technical services) in the use of participative diagnostic and planning tools to enable them to actively participate in the data collection and in the planning of future activities within the protected areas. These diagnostic and planning tools include: resources mapping based on GPS location and seasons calendar, problem trees, analysis of all stakeholders interests, objective trees as well as a consistency chart drawn in order to check that goals and action planning are consistent. Once the stakeholders are trained in the use of these tools, they are able to be fully integrated into the shared governance of the MPA and to evaluate the quality of the PA\u2019s governance and management. PARTICIPATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE MPA\u2019S RESULTS The participative diagnostic analysis consists in a prior analysis of the area\u2019s biological and socio-economical characteristics by local stakeholders and the CMCPA. Once this is done, their report is presented to the local communities, members of local administrations, organisations and decentralised technical services. After the presentation and discussion of these results, all the above-mentioned stakeholders approve the results and give recommendations allowing the team in charge to finalise the diagnostic report. PARTICIPATIVE PREPARATION OF THE ACTION PLAN Once the local stakeholders validate the diagnostic analysis, the team starts to write an action plan based on it. To do so, the team organises a local planning workshop where the participants will have to identify the main environmental issues of the MPA. Then, taking these threats, challenges and opportunities into account, they define the strategic goals to pursue and the answers to give to the challenges previously mentioned. Finally, they set the deadlines and identify the means to achieve the expected results. \u201cParticipate to the data collection and to the planning of future activities\u201d! \u201cFully integrated into the shared governance of the MPA\u201d! \u201cAnalysis of the area\u2019s biological and socio-economical characteristics\u201d! \u201cThe strategic goals to pursue and the answers to give\u201d! ! ! Story n\u00b01 \u2013 Binta Ba DIAW ! 3 WRITING THE MANAGEMENT ACTION PLAN (MAP) Based on the diagnostic analysis and the action plan, the CCMPA can then write a management action plan. Using what was agreed with the local stakeholders, they summarize the conclusions of the participative diagnostic analysis and of the planning workshop. Once this document is finalised, it is printed and shared with the local actors, presented and validated by them. One or several workshops are organised to present it to all the stakeholders. During these meetings, the communication is adapted to the diversity of the public and must be accessible for everyone to understand it and express potential criticism. CONCLUSION The participatory writing process of the MAP organised by the CCMPA is a crucial step to the implementation of community marine PAs. It allowed to put in place a concerted approach to identify sites of interest for the conservation of marine and coastal biodiversity as well as local stakeholders, to train the local stakeholders in the use of participatory analysis and planning tools, to integrate them in the process of analysis and planning of the MPA\u2019s activities and to organise a workshop for the restitution and validation the MPA\u2019s plan of action with all local stakeholders. This process of learning by doing guarantees the appropriation of the MAP by local stakeholders. Recognizing the endogenous knowledge during the phase of analysis and planning of activities increases the chances of future success of the MPA\u2019s management since it anticipates and takes into account the potential conflicts and frustrations of local stakeholders. ! !", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bee89128-1321-4faa-b110-d3bdcad32f5c": {"__data__": {"id_": "bee89128-1321-4faa-b110-d3bdcad32f5c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Twenty-two stories of conservation in Africa : key elements for effective and well-governed protected areas", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3473f17ec291b5bd9698c0bdd3b2b45ba535ddd8326b6b9b3f2eb164c3769118"}, "2": {"node_id": "c7f1694e-547a-434e-9aa6-65eb78d2924c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9aef4159346e47cc87f0ebb934e3daa220ec34c0a728f91a5e4e33429c4c05a0"}}, "hash": "080f24ab29ddb6c2234ad75e4eb227e7edd9c7a4e3e5eaf6ce220592482d974f", "text": "! ! ! ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 4!

However, despite these efforts, habitat and wildlife losses have continued to rise across the African continent with increasing poverty for communities living around these areas. As a result, it is becoming apparent that the hope for conserving the global biodiversity cannot be nested within the current PAs model but may require new models that not only engage stakeholders but also strategically influence meaningful and resourceful partnerships. For the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) a deliberate effort was made to have a specific program that deals with PAs system management. As one of the programs under CBD, the Program of Work on Protected Areas deals with direct actions for planning, selecting, establishing, strengthening and managing PAs; ways and means to improve governance, participation and equity; and enabling activities related to PAs. In Botswana, inadequate management and lack of effectiveness is a key challenge faced by PAs. To improve the financial and operational sustainability of PAs in Botswana, BirdLife Botswana in partnership with the Department of Environmental Affairs and the Department of Wildlife and National Parks, implemented a project named \u2018Strategic Partnerships to Improve the Financial and Operational Sustainability of Protected Areas in Botswana\u2019 over a period of five years (2009 to 2013). GEOGRAPHIC AREA, STAKEHOLDERS AND RESOURCES Botswana that has a total land area of 581,730 km2, had established, by 2008, an impressive PAs estate which incorporates more than 40% of the total land territory, approximately 243,000 km2, representative of the diverse national habitats and ecosystems. However, current funding streams for PAs management systems seem to be inadequate in some areas where biodiversity is threatened because PAs are not fulfilling their management functions. This is primarily the case in areas (covering approx. 30,000 km2) located in spaces with growing human populations and accompanying economic activities, which place direct and indirect pressures on biodiversity. \u201cNew models that not only engage stakeholders but also strategically influence meaningful and resourceful partnerships\u201d! \u201cStrategic Partnerships to Improve the Financial and Operational Sustainability of Protected Areas in Botswana\u201d! \u201cProtected areas are not fulfilling their management functions, primarily in areas located in spaces with growing human populations and economic activities\u201d! The main threat to biodiversity in these areas arises from the conversion of natural habitats into other \"productive\" land uses such as cattle rearing (beef is the second highest foreign revenue resource export after diamonds). The expansion of cattle into wildlife areas has led to habitat fragmentation leading to increasing pressure on adjacent PAs, and high levels of human-wildlife conflicts. This correlates with high levels of human resentment against conservation initiatives in site-adjacent populations. The conservation areas currently comprise about 7.7% in national parks, 10.3% in game reserves, and 24% as Wildlife Management Areas (WMA). The latter is based on wildlife utilization by local communities, a Community Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) concept adopted to conserve biodiversity whilst involving communities in the management of natural resources within their vicinity. A large proportion of Botswana\u2019s PAs estate (ca 70%) lies in remote dry land areas with little human habitation. LEGITIMATE AND RECOGNISED STRUCTURES Park management committees are created and now recognized by the government to provide a platform for multi-stakeholders. These committees are set to discuss mainly s management issues in order to increase benefits and credibility of the PAs system to stakeholder. These committees constitute (1) Communities around the pilot area (Southern Sua Pan): e.g Mmatshumo, Mosu, Mmea and Mokubilo villages; (2) Private sector (e.g Debswana Mining Company and BotAsh Mining Company), and (3) The government departments, (e.g Land Board, Boteti Council\u2019s Physical Planning Unit, Department of Tourism (DoT), Botswana Tourism Organization (BTO), Boteti District Administration, Department of Wildlife and National Parks and the Department of Environmental Affairs).

LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY In order to be sustainable, ss need to be financially self-sustaining and to have direct economic returns to the local communities. Under this project, the three PA management options that were assessed were government governance, private governance and co- management/joint management approaches. The best PA management system is the one that maximizes/optimizes operational and financial sustainability of PA operations. Consequently, Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) was employed and the option with the highest net present value (NPV) was selected. In order to validate the results obtained from the CBA, Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) was also applied. The advantage of MCDA is that it uses various criteria rather than just relying on financial criteria in selecting the best PA management system. Based on the two appraisal techniques, co-management/joint management emerged as a preferred sustainable option for financial sustainability and management effectiveness of natural resources. The project followed up with instituting training sessions for park managers and developing a co-management module for the country\u2019s wildlife training institute such that the concept is included into the curriculum. CONCLUSION Establishing a legal tool for partnerships in natural resource management-policy, legislation and enforcement-is a critical step to initiate a process of improving PAs\u2019 management effectiveness. Then PAs financial and management effectiveness need to be continuously evaluated. \u2022 Protected areas need to be financially self-sustaining that is why economic evaluation of natural resources needs to be established as a basis for discussion and for decision-making.

By attaining this goal it would be possible to stimulate and promote economic development, through increased tourism opportunities in the two PAs whilst safeguarding the unique biodiversity which is supported by and cooperatively managed by the two countries. Translocation of animals As part of the collaboration between the two countries, the government of Mozambique requested donation of animals from South Africa to be introduced in Maputo Special Reserve. The objectives of introductions were to complete various levels of chain and restore natural processes essential for Maputo Special Reserve, address the requirements of re-establishing the biodiversity mix previously present in this globally recognized biodiversity hotspot and improve game viewing potential for tourism development. To that effect the two governments initiated a multi-year endeavour with wildlife donated from different reserves from Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa which resulted in a total 909 animals being successfully translocated since 2010. In 2013, 88 zebras, 72 nyala, 75 impala, 48 warthog, 73 blue wildebeest, 12 giraffe and 24 kudu were translocated. The translocations were backed up by aerial surveys and counts, which have been taking place annually since 2011. The translocated animals are responding positively to their new habitat and are multiplying, especially giraffes, zebras and blue wildebeests and this has resulted in better sightings and increased tourist satisfaction at MSR. Until recently, there was no accommodation inside Maputo Special Reserve but a new community lodge is currently being built in Ponta Chemucane within the concession area of MSR. The visitors to this 18-bed community lodge will now benefit from the abundance of game together with turtle sightings and bird- watching. The improved sightings will also benefit the communities as it is anticipated that more sightings will increase tourism flows and thus more income to this community lodge.

Namibia Wildlife Resorts also forms part of the ARTP as they are the tourism operator within the National Parks in Namibia. A treaty between South Africa and Namibia was signed by the presidents of both countries in 2003 and kept the park boundaries as they already were defined, for a total surface of 6 045 km\u00b2 (604 500ha). The Transfrontier Park is governed by the Joint Management Board, which is advised by the Park Management Committee, comprising of the respective park managers of the two parks. The parks are managed by South African National Parks, the Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism and the Namibia Wildlife Resorts. All organisations are government funded. STRUCTURES FOR TRANSBOUNDARY GOVERNANCE Park managers, and then International coordinators, came together in 2010 and, with the participation of the Peace Parks Foundation, established a document called the Joint Operation Strategy. This document covers all aspects of the management plans of the respective parks and is a dynamic, working document that can be adapted when necessary. It covers all joint day-to-day operations, such as law enforcement, staff training, border crossings, income generation projects, community involvement etc. Once the paper exercise was completed, the implementation was done through the establishment of a Park Managers committee composed of park managers, section rangers and tourism managers from both parks. Police officers and Immigration Officers can also be invited as and when required. Every six months, the committee presents a report covering all challenges and successes of the Joint Management Board. If possible, all issues are sorted out, otherwise they are taken to higher authorities. Indeed, once a year a bilateral ministerial meeting takes place between the ministers and chair persons of both countries and all interventions that need higher input are discussed there. Bilateral fundings Financing of all of the above meetings are covered by the Department of Environmental Affairs and the Peace Parks Foundation. The Joint Management Board meetings are usually sponsored by Peace Parks Foundation while the ARTP has a ring fenced account that is \u201cThe Joint Operation Strategy covers all aspects of the management plans of both parks\u201d! \u201cEstablishment of a Park Managers\u2019 committee\u201d! managed by Namibia Wildlife resorts (the tourism arm of the Transfrontier Park) and unanimous decisions between all committee members have to be reached before any funds can be utilized. LEGITIMATE, RECOGNISED STRUCTURES The National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act (Act 57 of 2003) or the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (Act 10 of 2004) are the legislation that govern the RSA side. Namibia has similar legislation on their side. One of the sections of the Joint Operation Strategy \u2013 the form that guides the day to day cross border operations and functions is looking at the harmonisation of policies and procedures. ARTP has done a lot in this regard. For example cross border radio licences were received from both countries\u2019 communication authorities so that a radio network can legally be operated across the border. This would not have been possible in the past and is a good example of the success of the treaty signed between Namibia and South Africa. DEVELOPING INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS TO ENABLE DECISION MAKING. As mentioned above, the ARTP is governed by a Joint Management Board. This Joint Management Board has only a strategic role and is not dedicated to design practical tools that would help the coordination of the activities within the transfrontier park on the ground. But thanks to the commitment of the staff in the field, the Park Management Committee was formed and thereafter the Joint Operation Strategy, which is the tool aiming at coordinating the decision making of the ARTP, was drawn up. The Joint Management Board endorsed the Joint Operation Strategy and that made decision making a lot easier on the ground. Once the Park Management Committee has made a decision it is implemented immediately. An example would be the cross border tourism product i.e. Desert Kayak Trails. The idea has been on the table for a while and after a successful donor application to GIZ the project is in full swing. LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY In the initial stages the ARTP was totally funded by governments. Yet, thanks to continuous efforts by the staff on the ground, a lot of sponsorships - such as Peace Parks Foundation, GIZ, Department of Environmental Affairs and Honorary rangers - have added their contribution to get the ARTP fully functional as it is today.

This collaboration then evolved in time to eventually become formalized by a ministerial agreement: the agreement between Rwanda and the Transboundary Greater Virunga Collaborative (TGVC). Another high- level agreement between the three neighbouring countries is expected to be soon signed despite the tense political relation that remains in this area. A THREATENED BIODIVERSITY The Greater Virunga area is facing increasing threats from poaching affecting the Gorillas and other flag species that represent the core area of tourism activities in the region. Illegal trafficking of ivory, hunting and logging are other additional important pressures on those PAs. The PAs of each of the three countries could not face all these threats individually in a sustainable way. Thus Uganda, Rwanda and DRC agreed on a joint strategy to protect and \u201cArmed conflicts and political instability\u201d! \u201cA high level agreement between the three countries\u201d! \u201cProtected areas of each of the three countries could not face these threats individually\u201d! conserve the biodiversity of the region of the Albertine Rift by putting together their human resources. JOINT STRATEGIC PLANNING Management of the Greater Virunga The executive secretariat of the TGVC is responsible for the implementation of the joint strategic plan. To this end, four transboundary consultative committees have been set up. They are in charge of guiding decision making related to ecological monitoring and scientific research within the Greater Virunga landscape. Meanwhile the administrative council and the park managers meet on a regular basis and participate to the decision making related to the global management of the landscape. Decision makers together with representatives from civil society from DRC and Rwanda also benefit from site visits in order to better understand the real impacts of Ugandan oil exploitation on biodiversity and assess its impact on the landscape. The strategic plan is supported by technical partners that are in charge of the implementation of the outcoming field activities, of the investigations on illegal trafficking of natural resources as well as of the study of alternative revenues that could be provided by REDD+ or other similar opportunities. Involving and supporting local communities Different types of activities aiming at supporting community development are being developed within the Greater Virunga, such as beekeeping, ecotourism, construction of drinking water tanks, etc. Moreover, the neighbouring communities of the PA are themselves involved in the management of the park. Local communities are widely informed and they actively take part to the operational planning process and to the evaluation of the joint strategic plan. Thanks to their involvement throughout the process, their perception of biodiversity conservation has progressively changed. Now they are more willing to conserve natural resources and to use them in a sustainable way. JOINT SURVEILLANCE AND GOOD PRACTICES OF MANAGEMENT Today an operational joint surveillance system is being implemented across the national borders of the Greater Virunga landscape thanks to joint patrols that include rangers from the three different countries. Intelligence on illegal activities within the landscape, provided by this surveillance system, is shared among all the park managers.

CONCLUSION This experience of collaboration between DRC, Rwanda and Uganda within the Greater Virunga landscape demonstrates that conserving biodiversity in armed conflict and politically unstable areas is still possible. This has been made possible thanks to a high level political collaboration that enabled joint surveillance activities and involvement of local stakeholders in developing new income generating alternative activities. ! \u201cPromotes the dissemination of good practices\u201d! ! ! Story n\u00b05 \u2013 Freddy MANONGI! 17 PART 2 TOWARD A BROADER PROTECTED AREAS\u2019 GOVERNANCE: MORE STAKEHOLDERS FOR BETTER RESULTS In order to strengthen protected areas\u2019 governance and to promote good decision-making, it is important to widen the available skills of governance structures. Indeed, the diversification of actors involved in the management of protected areas could ease the sharing of relevant information and knowledge that are specific to each group of actors and could thus benefit conservation. Diversity of actors, diversity of knowledge In the Central African Republic, the NGO \u201cMaison de l\u2019Enfant et de la Femme Pigm\u00e9s\u201d promotes the use of participatory mapping as a tool for local communities to express their knowledge about resource use and influence the management and creation of protected areas (From hunting to mapping, Jean Bruno Ngougnogbia). Similarly, the involvement of women in conservation activities can highly benefit conservation. This has been proven in Rwanda where the Association des Ecologistes Rwandais (Rwandese Environmentalists Association) promotes the participation of women in conservation and sustainable use of natural resources (When women take the lead, Dancilla Mukakamari). When private actors get involved in conservation The next two stories of this chapter on the diversification of conservation stakeholders describe the key elements of the success of two privately led conservation initiatives in Southern Africa. In the Namib Desert, Namibia\u2019s private landowners decided, thirty years ago, to commit their farm lands to conservation and created the largest private nature reserve in Southern Africa run by effectively well-organised institutions (When private landowners commit to conserving nature, Nils Odendaal). In South Africa, the NGO Birdlife South Africa aims at expanding the protected area network outside of state-owned national parks and nature reserves by setting a proactive partnership with the South African government and the landowners whose lands form part of the Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas in order to ensure the legal protection of these lands (Stakeholders\u2019 collaboration driven by an international NGO, Daniel Marnewick). Involving future generations Going further with the involvement of diversified and numerous actors, the Wildlife Clubs of Kenya thinks forward and works with the young generations in Kenya to teach them about the necessity of protecting their environment and making them tomorrow\u2019s conservationists (Involving youth to build the future, Margaret Otieno).

These communities were not taking part in the management of the park until recently, when an innovative approach involving neighbouring communities was developed and tested to improve PAs\u2019 management. This project is implemented by the NGO \u00ab Maison de l\u2019Enfant et de la Femme Pygm\u00e9s \u00bb, and supported by the Rainforest Foundation UK. It promotes an approach based on participatory mapping, which enables a better understanding of the traditional uses of natural resources around the park.

Being a negotiation and lobbying tool, participatory mapping helps parks managers (at national and local levels) to understand the concerns and issues raised by local stakeholders. Indeed by drawing a map representing the area where they usually harvest natural resources for their livelihoods, the local communities \u201cLocal communities have illegally exploited the park\u2019s wildlife and natural resources\u201d! \u201cTraditional knowledge about natural resources\u201d! can explain and argue for their use. This step allows building confidence between the communities and the association\u2019s team that is driving the process. Step 2: Manuscript map of resources use drawn by the communities The members of the community display all their traditional knowledge regarding geographical, biological and sociological aspects of natural resource use by anticipatively drawing a map. Step 3: Training of local cartographers A few members of the community are chosen by their peers and trained in the use of GPS and data collection techniques. Step 4: Data collection Local cartographers walk into the forest together with some technical staff from the association in order to geolocate with a GPS the sacred sites as well as areas where they used to harvest non-timber forestry products (such as mushrooms, caterpillars, fruits, etc.) or to set traps to catch game. Step 5: Digital participatory mapping Data that have been collected by local cartographers are collated by the GIS staff of the association in order to build a georeferenced participatory map. The comparison between the digital and the manuscript maps enables us to correct possible mistakes or omissions that may have been highlighted on the handmade map but not yet georeferenced. Once ready, the final digital map is discussed and validated by the local communities. CONCLUSION Participatory mapping enables the creation of good quality maps that gather all necessary information for wise decision-making and good governance in terms of sustainable use of natural resources. By taking into account the information provided by the map for the zoning of the PAs, PA managers can avoid the usual conflicts related to the use of natural resources by the local stakeholders. Participatory mapping in CAR helped increase communities\u2019 understanding of their rights and eased the implementation of initiatives led to reinforce PAs\u2019 governance at local and national levels. By taking into account communities\u2019 traditional use of resources and lands occupation, participatory mapping takes advantage of traditional, historical, social and cultural knowledge of these communities and promotes their right to be involved in the management of PAs. Moreover, by using it as a lobbying tool it ensures a fair dialogue between all stakeholders. \u201cSacred sites and areas where they used to set traps to catch game or harvest non timber forestry products\u201d! \u201cFinal digital map is discussed and validated by local communities\u201d ! ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 20!

In Rwanda, a gender based approach is being used to ensure the participation of women in conservation.

To formalize the process, a memorandum of understanding was signed between ARECO and the Rwanda Development Board (RDB), the government authority in charge of PAs management in Rwanda. The pilot phase of ARECO\u2019s interventions started in 2003 in the Mukura reserve and its activities were later extended to the Volcanoes and Nyungwe National Parks, in 2006. Among the main activities conducted were: ! Organisation of awareness raising campaigns to inform and encourage women to participate in PAs\u2019 conservation; ! Facilitation of the enrolment process for women in community-based organisations; and ! Training of women in natural resources management including agroforestry, bamboo domestication and processing, rain water harvesting and sustainable agriculture. This training includes study tours organised in Burundi and DRC to promote transboundary exchanges. Within the Volcanoes National Park for example, ARECO currently facilitates 12 women- based cooperatives in different areas around the park. Nowadays these cooperatives bring together 3 545 members including 75% of women compared to 10% in 2006. WOMEN\u2019S COOPERATIVES ARE LEGITIMATE AND RECOGNIZED STRUCTURES Nowadays 60% of the cooperatives are registered with the Rwandan Cooperative Agency and the rest are still in the registration process. This legal status gives members the right to access funding and other opportunities. The cooperatives can also benefit from revenues from tourism and conservation activities that represent 40% of the budget allocated to communities. This funding is allocated to women\u2019s cooperatives provided they are well organized and certified as community-based organizations.

CONCLUSION The Rwandan new gender approach shows that women have new innovative ideas and practices that contribute tremendously to the quality of governance, conservation and livelihoods in PAs. This experience is an example of the success of positive discrimination that is necessary for women to get involved in conservation and governance of PAs. Involving women in the management of natural resources is key for sustainable conservation and good governance in PAs. The role played by NGOs in empowering women and communities in general is therefore important since they facilitate communication and collaboration between government institutions and grassroots communities. ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 24!", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9bab30f-7145-486a-b3c0-47592be81b76": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9bab30f-7145-486a-b3c0-47592be81b76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Twenty-two stories of conservation in Africa : key elements for effective and well-governed protected areas", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bbd1fd29985c9c012823d45c7fad4aff7dc319a382bf96d0009730e2f980d8d7"}, "2": {"node_id": "08e5de90-bbf3-45d0-8940-5667494c7f4f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a16e21fb81dccdf95289314b775077e75d99e49ad6e45178fcac929f014a39b"}}, "hash": "fe6fc01a8216ee81c9d5e6f85e33858da45f27d12256f0e59a4c34c90bb0c5a2", "text": "! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 24!

Recognizing the importance of wilderness areas, the NamibRand Nature Reserve has exclusively set aside more than 15% of its total area for wilderness. LANDOWNERS COMMITING THEIR LANDS TO CONSERVATION The NamibRand Nature Reserve is a non-profit private nature reserve and does not receive any aid from the government. All landowners have themselves decided to sign an agreement which sets aside their land for conservation, now and in the future. Landowners who form part of the NamibRand Nature Reserve have signed Articles of Association, which binds their land to the reserve. The Articles govern what can and cannot be done in terms of resource use and restrict the land use of these former livestock farms to conservation and tourism. All landowners who commit their land to the Reserve also become directors of the Association and they form part of the board that governs and makes up the top decision making body of the Reserve. By signing the Articles of Association these landowners all subscribe to a common conservation vision for the area which is underpinned by a set of objectives and environmental goals, which the directors have agreed on. These landowners have all come together because they all share the vision that this ecologically important and sensitive area should be used for conservation only. They all agree that livestock farming in particular is unsustainable and detrimental to the environment and biodiversity in this area. Their common resource is nature and the indigenous biodiversity production systems that can be sustainably utilised through eco-tourism.

Large landscape conservation is vital for a robust ecosystem in the hyper arid ecosystem of the Namib and Pro-Namib area as animals need to migrate large distances in search of grazing. For this reason, the NamibRand Nature Reserve has joined with other likeminded, conservation and tourism land users in the area to form the Greater Sossusvlei- Namib Landscape Association. This initiative aims to also apply the principles of good governance, cooperative management and the application of a broad vision for the benefit of socio-economic development and environmental conservation in an area that now encompasses almost 2 million ha. CONCLUSION It is possible to run a large, well managed and well functioning private nature reserve which is funded privately without donor and government aid. Good governance systems and benefits, be they indirect or concrete are necessary so as to reward participants. The rights over natural resources are important as people who can benefit from the sustainable utilization of their natural resources, non-consumptive eco-tourism in this case, are more inclined to take ownership and thus be incentivised to care and look after this resource. Regular feedback, consultations and participation are also key to a successful conservation initiative such as the NamibRand Nature Reserve. \u201cBroad vision for socio- economic development and environmental conservation\u201d! ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 28!

There are over 12 500 IBAs worldwide. The ultimate aim is to conserve these IBAs into the future, and the most effective means to achieve this is to attain legal protection associated with sustainable governance at these sites. However, developing countries have limited resources to invest in PAs expansion, or to structure sustainable governance of these sites. Of South Africa\u2019s 122 IBAs, less than 40% are legally protected. Biodiversity Stewardship was initiated in 2005 by the national government and NGOs to assist the expansion of the PAs network. Through voluntary legal agreements with landowners, Biodiversity Stewardship provides a cost effective conservation tool for securing biodiversity, promoting the sustainable management of natural resources and expanding the PAs network outside of state-owned national parks and nature reserves; while also allowing development objectives to be reconciled with conservation. BirdLife South Africa has recently provided assistance to formally protect 60 000 ha of a grassland and wetland IBA, and is working to declare a further 60 000 ha in the next three years in grasslands and estuaries.

DEVELOPING INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS TO ENABLE DECISION MAKING Each Biodiversity Stewardship site, declared as either a Protected Environment or Nature Reserve, needs a management authority elected by and representing the land owners. Each site also needs a management plan. These management plans are supported by government departments, government programmes (e.g. working for Water), and non-government conservation organisations and are audited once a year. DEVOLVING RESPONSIBILITY AND RIGHTS BACK TO THE LAND OWNERS The Stewardship concept is a new way of achieving conservation. The Biodiversity Stewardship Programme offers a range of conservation options which aim to set up positive, proactive partnerships with landowners, to support and encourage them as they take on the responsibility of managing and protecting the natural assets that are in their care. In order to support this management, appropriate benefits are offered for land that has been set aside for conservation. These include management support and fiscal benefits, as well as protection from unsustainable land developments. LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY Biodiversity Stewardship relies on land owners to implement appropriate land management, and on government to support this management. However, many of the land practices also involve commercial operations which depend on making profit. Therefore a monitoring protocol, by way of an annual audit, is implemented to ensure management follows the management plan. The annual audit also interrogates stakeholder satisfaction and future needs. \u201cLandowners declaring around 100 000 ha of Protected Environments\u201d! \u201cSetting a national standard\u201d! \u201cSet up positive, proactive partnerships with landowners\u201d! ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 30!

The teacher asked and received assistance from the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife (MTW), where Mr John Pile, seconded by the UNDP/FAO, helped to develop the Wildlife Clubs idea. The original idea of building the Wildlife Clubs of Kenya (WCK) came from within the country, from the local youth themselves. After a weekend meeting, the formation of the national WCK was delegated to the National Museum\u2019s Education Section (Nairobi) with moral and financial support coming from the Elsa Wild Animal Appeal, the African Wildlife Leadership Foundation, the East African Wildlife Society and Kenya\u2019s Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife. Together with the Ministries of Education and Natural Resources, they formed a council and drafted a constitution for the association. Finally, in December 1968, the Wildlife Clubs of Kenya Association was created and registered as a charitable, Non-Governmental Organization.

WCK is a membership organisation and its members range from school clubs to community groups. Categories of membership include primary schools, secondary schools, tertiary educational institutions like universities and colleges, associate membership (i.e. adult individuals), corporate membership and community church groups that currently constitute more than 3000 clubs and over 300,000 individual members. Despite being a membership organisation, the KWC opens its environment conservation activities to organised groups and community members living within and around areas of biodiversity importance. HAVING LEGITIMATE, RECOGNISED STRUCTURES WCK is managed by a National Secretariat with backing of a 20-member Governing Council and an Executive Committee composed of specialists in conservation education, business and public administration. The organisation\u2019s engagements are guided by the WCK Constitution. Because of the important responsibility undertaken by the WCK, the government of Kenya has recognised the organisation as a key partner and involves WCK in the activities of the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Water. Moreover, the WCK has a legal existence in schools and is recognised by the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) - who are the custodians of the country\u2019s wildlife - and Kenya Forest Service (KFS) - who are custodians of the country\u2019s forests. This recognition enables WCK to conduct activities in the parks and forests legally.

For example, the theme for 2014/2015 is \u201cCombating Poaching through Education for Sustainable Development\u201d through which WCK aims to make youngsters aware of the sustainable commercial value of live rhino and elephant in the form of job creation, tourism and other related industries.

This has been proved to be a powerful tool for conservation because it empowers the communities with knowledge of the importance of the resources. CONCLUSION Since 1968, the WCK has proved to be an efficient programme with well organised and legitimate institutions. Thanks to this legitimacy, the WCK was able to organise all sorts of activities to sensitize youth to conservation in Kenya and to provide the best opportunity for young Kenyans to gain lifetime knowledge and experience of the country\u2019s flora and fauna. More than 90% of Kenya Wildlife Service personnel belonged to a Wildlife Club during their childhood and most park wardens and rangers claim to have found their conservation career path through WCK membership.

Local and indigenous populations\u2019 rights over resources When dealing with the legitimacy of protected areas and thus with the ownership of natural resources, not only should local communities\u2019 rights be taken into account but also indigenous peoples\u2019, whose ancestors have been living in these areas and using their resources for generations and generations. In Kawawana, Senegal (Marine conservation by and for fishermen, Salatou Sambou), this aspect has been taken into account by local fishermen whose resources were mainly overused by fishermen coming from other provinces of the country. In DRC, this idea is also currently being discussed and indigenous and local peoples\u2019 rights over resources should soon be legally recognised (National recognition of local traditions, Joseph Itongwa Mukumo). Making concessions Finally, part of the protected areas\u2019 legitimacy comes from their ability to make concessions to benefit the population. This is one of the reasons for the success of the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, which made the deliberate choice to integrate wildlife and cattle with conservation activities - a choice that benefits both the local farmers and the conservancy\u2019s wildlife (Because conservation has to make concessions, Martin Mulama).

Thus it is not a surprise that many conservation policies have failed in sub-Saharan Africa. Indeed, there is a permanent conflict of interest between official managers and local communities, who are no longer considered \u201cowners\u201d of protected areas. However, no one can be more interested in planning and implementing sustainable forest management than local communities who rely on the forest for their daily livelihood and the maintenance of ancestral cultural values. Consequently, a change of mind-set allowing the consideration of traditional knowledge and skills in the management of natural resources is essential. Community-based systems for natural resources management are becoming widespread and are proving to be viable options for sustainable management of natural resources. The policy on nature conservation in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire dates from the colonial era. Since political independence in 1960, the country passed a series of laws and decrees and ratified most international conventions related to biodiversity conservation. Meanwhile, several state institutions were created with specific missions related to the management of an important network of protected areas. However, despite these measures that reflect a certain political will for nature conservation, more than 50 years after the independence of the country the situation is alarming. Indeed, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is one of the tropical countries that recorded the highest rates of deforestation. Since 1960, the country has lost about 67% of its original forest cover. The effects of deforestation and illegal hunting of wildlife in the country have been devastating. Animal populations are becoming scarce in most national parks and forest reserves, with many species hunted to near extinction or even extinction. \u201cAllowing the valuation of traditional knowledge and skills in the management of natural resources\u201d! \u201cThe effects of deforestation and illegal hunting of wildlife in the country have been devastating\u201d! If the enormous human pressures on natural resources in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire are inherently related to population growth and poverty, the chaotic situation just described shows the ineffectiveness of conservation policies in the country. Thus a series of adjustments of these policies is currently being promoted and includes the empowerment of local communities for nature conservation. The case of the community-based conservation project of the Tano\u00e9 forest, southeastern C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, is considered as a promising pioneering experience. The Tano\u00e9 Forest provides habitat for a number of rare and highly threatened primate species and is a priority area for conservation that had not received attention until recently.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0dfc5fb3-4b63-4d98-9a63-d14a3c2f3581": {"__data__": {"id_": "0dfc5fb3-4b63-4d98-9a63-d14a3c2f3581", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Twenty-two stories of conservation in Africa : key elements for effective and well-governed protected areas", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "011745051380ff41ba9dd339b12a6cfdd3c388a85456c22a22b85d31461de9c3"}, "2": {"node_id": "805fa9f1-b0c9-401d-9f11-9436e4c608cb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf4593b5de577ce06d478ae1f1cbc067c802d8c938ec8042b14ba312e8f553e5"}}, "hash": "91b5f9dbc69c4248648b3bd4231941866df971ebce85e9bceb76fb794affbbf3", "text": "Primate habitat is threatened by unsustainable land use, including oil palm and chainsaw milling and monkeys are killed for bushmeat by impoverished local communities.

This is accompanied by capacity building for forest conservation and development activities in a mutual-learning process so that communities become independent in conceiving and carrying out such activities. The project also focuses on awareness raising for communities to clearly understand and adopt the concept of sustainable development. Future project finance will be ensured by strengthening the current growing partnership for the conservation of the Tano\u00e9 forest and by exploring potentials for REDD+ mechanisms. A special effort will be made so that the traditional partners of the project maintain or increase their annual contribution and other national and international partners will be invited to join the network. However, communities are expected to clearly understand that the fate of the forest is primarily their responsibility. CONCLUSION The main strengths of the project are its originality and the outstanding preliminary achievements. Indeed, the Tano\u00e9 forest will no doubt be the very first relatively large community-managed protected forest in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The project is one of the rare ones in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire involving several villages where communities receive continuous technical support from scientists, conservationists and governmental authorities. In terms of achievements (i) a national classification committee has been established by the Ministry of Environment, local associations have been settled in most villages of the project area and training sessions are organized in addition to the process of learning by doing; (ii) a preliminary demarcation of the forest has been made by communities, signboards have been settled in strategic places, and preliminary management rules have been elaborated by communities; (iii) the biological and anthropological dimensions of the conservation value of the forest have been highlighted; (iv) a critical mass of informed and skilled locals are engaged in conservation actions; (v) alternative livelihoods such as smart cultivation of vegetables and cassava are experiencing growing success. All these have resulted in significant reduction of the intensity of chainsaw milling, clearing for agriculture, and hunting in the Tano\u00e9 forest. The preliminary success of the project is increasingly used by decision makers and conservation practitioners in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, neighbouring Ghana and elsewhere to advocate for community empowerment in managing natural resources. \u201cCapacity building for forest conservation and development activities\u201d! ! !

KOUDERIN, Regional Research and Education Center for integrated development (CREDI-ONG) INTRODUCTION Since the creation of the national agency in charge of protected areas management in Benin (CENAGREF), conservation efforts have mainly been focused on the national parks W and Pendjari in the northern part of the country. However, after the February 2004 Kuala Lumpur CBD conference - where an ambitious program of work on PAs was developed - Benin realized the necessity of expanding its network to other types of protected areas in the southern part of the country. In this context, the Regional Research and Education Center for integrated development (CREDI-ONG) launched the Sitatunga Valley initiative: a community-based approach of natural resources management. CREATION OF THE SITATUNGA VALLEY COMMUNITY-BASED NATURE RESERVE In 2006, CREDI-ONG created the PANTODON fish farm in the village Kpotomey in order to promote integrated fish farming. As soon as the farm started, hunters from the village came to offer bush meat to the employees of CREDI-ONG who soon realized that the bush meat market was very wide and included many IUCN red-listed species. CREDI-ONG thus decided to start an awareness campaign to educate local communities on sustainable management of the natural resources of this area still rich in wildlife although located only 30km from Cotonou. A wildlife inventory was carried out and a lobbying campaign eventually led to the signing of a legal act formally recognizing the creation of the Sitatunga Valley community-based nature reserve in 2010. LOCAL COMMUNITIES ESTABLISHING THE RULES OF NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT New approaches to natural resources governance are slowly being developed in West Africa. In Benin, local management of natural resources often follows traditions that are based on the animalist religion.

The TCMR\u2019s role is to deliberate every quarter on decisions regarding natural resources management and community development. The reserve governance system also includes groups of youth organized in environmental clubs named \u201cKnowing and Protecting Nature\u201d. These groups are involved in environmental education and tourism guiding. Site visits and discovery trips between clubs are supported by CREDI ONG, thus enabling the youth to gather experiences from other regions and other countries. Women are deeply involved in reserve management as well. They are in charge of providing catering, accommodation and information to the visitors of the reserve. They benefit from capacity building and technical support from CREDI ONG in order to improve their services. In every village, they are organized in women groups that are also included in the consultation framework and they elect two women that take part in the TCMR. PROMOTING TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE In order to reduce the negative impacts of traditional hunting in the Sitatunga Valley, CREDI- ONG actively involves hunters in ecological monitoring activities and tourism guiding within the reserve. Thanks to these activities, hunters receive alternative income that is compatible with conservation. Whenever hunters decide to completely convert their activities into conservation friendly income generating activities, they can benefit from micro-credit to develop livestock farms for instance. Meanwhile CREDI-ONG provides training that is aimed at transforming their usual hunting activities into sustainable and controlled activities. In line with this process, a hunting plan has been developed and validated in a consultative way with other community stakeholders. This plan, which has been implemented on the basis of the hunters\u2019 traditional knowledge, describes the hunting practices that are allowed because they have a lesser impact on wildlife. It also details the periods during which hunting is allowed or not and the species for which hunting is prohibited. COMMUNITY-BASED MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND LOCAL DEVELOPMENT In Benin, as well as in many developing countries, conservation of natural resources faces a major and fast growing demand in terms of socio economic needs. \u201cThe lack of formal legal act describing the management of natural resources in the Sitatunga Valley is not a weakness\u201d! ! ! Story n\u00b012 \u2013 Martial KOUDERIN! 41 However, the Sitatunga Valley claims to be a lever for sustainable local development. To this end, the TCMR has developed a Territorial Development Plan (TDP) that reconciles nature conservation and local development challenges. This plan is driving every new project aimed at improving neighbouring communities\u2019 livelihood. The mission of CREDI-ONG is to mobilize technical and financial partners to assist the implementation of the TDP that has been previously validated by all the stakeholders. Within this framework, sanitation and water projects are being developed in the surrounding villages. The promotion of agro-ecology in the areas around the reserve also represents one of the strategic axes of the plan as it fairly combines development and conservation objectives. CONCLUSION Nowadays, trying to manage natural resources while not considering local knowledge and practices and communities\u2019 needs is an aberration. In Benin, the creation and the management of the Sitatunga Valley Community-based Nature Reserve that has been coordinated by CREDI-ONG highlights the success of locally managed natural resources system through an appropriate governance framework. This reserve has halted the fast degradation of natural resources of the area that was driven by a major and fast increase of the human population density. After less than 10 years, the trend seems to progress thanks to a noteworthy awareness and engagement of local communities. ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 42!", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "163bb0d4-38bc-445a-85b0-c3c1d5a4d5af": {"__data__": {"id_": "163bb0d4-38bc-445a-85b0-c3c1d5a4d5af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Twenty-two stories of conservation in Africa : key elements for effective and well-governed protected areas", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1915b4a68582ef46e4dc90bdc1f67107b67537ad1ad935217696d952544cc041"}, "2": {"node_id": "55a63472-e3c8-4b75-8429-8d4cef519b51", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b4000488ce7b61c6924e6c6b70c168f5f0a966a798f79e95e3c3bc8287efc33"}}, "hash": "f9f68f46a5d9a8d637e1856877c2db92182c915d8e0d022ba125707628c325e4", "text": "! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 42!

Increased loss and fragmentation of key biodiversity areas (KBA) and hotspots along conservation biodiversity corridors has taken place in the face of various conservation practitioners on the ground. Although more qualified conservation personnel have been released into the system, the magnitude of biodiversity loss has been increasing for the past decade. A similar scenario can be witnessed along the Chimanimani-Nyanga Mountains Biodiversity Conservation Corridor of Zimbabwe, a corridor consisting of five fragment Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) and forming part of the Eastern Afromontane biodiversity hotspots. FRAGMENTED APPROACH OF THE CORRIDOR\u2019S CONSERVATION Despite of the presence of different conservation institutions and experts at each site of the Chimanimani-Nyanga mountains corridor, the lack of a coordinated approach towards biodiversity conservation has resulted in poor management of Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) and ultimately loss of biodiversity. To address this governance gap, BirdLife Zimbabwe embarked on a programme 'Stakeholder capacity building for Key Biodiversity Area management planning in the Chimanimani-Nyanga Mountains biodiversity conservation corridor' aiming at improving biodiversity conservation by promoting a collaborative and coordinated approach towards conservation and management of KBAs by all relevant stakeholders. \u201cImproving biodiversity conservation by promoting a collaborative and coordinated approach\u201d! CAPACITY BUILDING TO PROMOTE PARTICIPATIVE MANAGEMENT BY ALL STAKEHOLDERS AROUND THE CORRIDOR BirdLife Zimbabwe has initiated and facilitated this capacity building process that has, so far, received great support from all stakeholders. Institutional mechanisms promoting participative management of biodiversity - Stakeholder Management Advisory Groups (SMAGs) and Local Conservation Groups (LCGs) - were set up at each site. Members of the SMAGs consist of Parks Managers, Foresters, District Environmental Officers, Rural District Councils Conservation Officers, District Administrators, Civil Society Organisations and Environmentalists from the Private Sector. On the other hand, the LCGs are groups of volunteers (including traditional leaders) from the local communities, within or adjacent to Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), who share the same interest of conserving biodiversity. The role of the SMAG is to advise the authority responsible for the management of the sites, assist in providing solutions to problems faced at the sites, and help raise awareness on biodiversity conservation. The LCGs help raise awareness on biodiversity conservation within local communities and transmit a community voice in decision-making regarding conservation and management of the KBAs. Both groups received intensive trainings to help them build-up their knowledge, networks, and drive the process. Several KBA site meetings have been conducted by these groups where site specific issues were discussed, conservation gaps at sites identified, and discussions for possible solutions to the problems held with involvement of the responsible management authority of a site who take note of advice from the groups. Most line managers of the KBAs have acknowledged the role played by these groups and a need for cooperation among stakeholders in addressing threats to KBAs. Moreover, the local communities, through LCGs, have identified the role they can play for improved KBA management. Traditional leaders, who are part of the LCGs, have also noted advice provided by the members of the groups during meetings. However, more technical support and guidance is still required by these established groups for effective interventions in biodiversity conservation of KBAs.

Within this area, the Mangagoulak rural community is particularly vulnerable as it is already threatened by pollution, coastal erosion and climate change. Adopting new strategies and innovative approaches thus seemed essential to face these challenges. Representatives from the government of Senegal, NGOs and local associations thus joined their efforts to develop measures aimed at stopping the degradation of the region\u2019s ecosystem and promoting the regeneration of natural resources in this area of Senegal. RAISING AWARENESS ON THE OVEREXPLOITATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES The dramatic drop of fish stocks in Mangagoulak has induced awareness among the members of the Kawawana fishermen association, who decided in 2008, to create a community-based protected area to reverse this trend. Indeed, because Mangagoulak is located within the estuary of Casamance, it is easily accessible to many fishermen coming from other areas of Senegal. This major pressure on marine resources has led to severe disturbance of the ecological balance of the marine ecosystem. Thus, since 2008, villagers, community-based organizations, local authorities and local technical departments of the ministries in charge have met several times in order to design a proper system to manage fishing and avoid overfishing. NECESSITY TO MAINTAIN TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE The local communities of Mangagoulak are mainly composed of Diola people, which hold a wide set of traditional knowledge and practices (in particular from animism religion) aimed at preserving their environment. Traditionally, many forests, islands and rivers are considered \u201cMeasures aiming at stopping the degradation of the region\u2019s ecosystem and promoting the regeneration of natural resources\u201d! sacred sites (\u201cgni-gni\u201d in Diola) that are strictly regulated and controlled. Diola people therefore have a strong interest in creating community-based protected areas in order to manage their natural resources. IDENTIFYING STAKEHOLDERS TO INCLUDE IN THE GOVERNANCE SYSTEM OF THE COMMUNITY-BASED PROTECTED AREA In Kawawana, the Mangagoulack Fishermen Association has played an important role in organizing consultations with local authorities and local technical services of the government in order to develop adequate management rules for the protected area. It retains the main responsibilities regarding the management of this ICCA (Indigenous peoples\u2019 and community conserved territories and area) whose sustainability is now ensured by its official recognition at national level. DEVELOPING SIMPLE TOOLS TO HELP DECISION-MAKING Assessing the current resources management impacts on the Kawawana ICCA is essential to enable corrective actions. This assessment consists of a regular monitoring of the resources and this data has enabled the implementation of appropriate fishing rules in Kawawana. This simple monitoring protocol has been developed in a participatory way and clarifies the role of each stakeholder. It aims at clarifying who is responsible for organizing the field staff in charge of monitoring, the equipment needed, the samples that have to be collected, when they should be collected, etc. CONCLUSION The successful creation of the Kawawana ICCA inspires new perspectives for participatory, fair and effective management of marine ecosystems in Senegal. This story highlights the importance of considering traditional knowledge related to natural resources management. It demonstrates that involving local communities is necessary to ensure sustainable harvesting and that it helps them to maintain their cultural identity and rules.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "acfb5837-dc1a-42a2-a7ff-006baf500d9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "acfb5837-dc1a-42a2-a7ff-006baf500d9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Twenty-two stories of conservation in Africa : key elements for effective and well-governed protected areas", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d810fdf8491080ddee78bb6e809bc832ace1ec56024440579ddcc399bc1cefb8"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f64da74-b16c-46bc-a843-66c5f25c840d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ad29ff8c07c34794af915b136a167def1491409c14ebdf644b93af020e6f632"}}, "hash": "09ed6170d1a1a148a656c68d15c62cc6080403974cefa0bf2a7e6999dea69d88", "text": "The fact that the establishment of Kawawana has been supported throughout the process by local authorities and technical services of the government will help to transfer responsibilities at local level, in particular in terms of monitoring fishing activities.

Even if new laws and strategies have been written on this matter since then, access to natural resources remains prohibited to some neighbouring communities of protected areas (indigenous and local people) and their participation in the governance and management of protected areas remains low. The legal recognition of Indigenous peoples\u2019 and community conserved territories and areas (ICCAs) as official protected areas would help to improve this situation by: (i) Pacifying the relationships among local stakeholders around PAs and thus improving the management effectiveness of these zones that are currently the source of many conflicts; (ii) Strengthening the traditional rights of indigenous people in their ancestral territories and thus capitalising on their cultural knowledge on nature conservation; (iii) Increasing the number of protected areas at national level and thus the percentage of DRC territory considered as protected, in compliance with targets no 11 and 18 of the Aichi protocol. KEY ASPECTS OF THE PROCESS This project seeks to demonstrate the local and global benefits of ICCAs in DRC in order to lobby for their legal recognition within the national law. The first national workshop on this topic, organized in 2012, was aimed at explaining the concept of ICCAs to the representatives of indigenous people, civil society and protected areas of ten different districts. The statement that came out of this meeting mentions that ICCAs are one of the best tools to improve natural resources\u2019 management, as they combine biodiversity conservation, sustainable development and pacification of conflicts around existing protected areas. \u201cICCAs are one of the best tools to improve the natural resources\u2019 management\u201d! Once adopted, this concept has been translated into a road map detailing the steps that will lead to the identification of the ICCAs with the local stakeholders. The next step will be to develop appropriate strategies to ensure their good management.! On this basis, three ICCAs have now been identified within various ecosystems (forest and non forest ecosystems). The ICCA located in Eastern DRC includes four community-managed forests nearby Lufito, Kissa-Kilali, Kambushi and Busisi villages. The one in central DRC includes three sacred ravines that are protected by the Bantou and Batwa communities. These areas, located within the traditional territories of indigenous people, outside of existing protected areas, are now fully recognized by the national institution in charge of nature conservation in DRC, the ICCN, and will thus, hopefully, be included in DRC future national biodiversity conservation strategies. ! CONCLUSION In DRC, local and indigenous communities are more and more interested in the concept of ICCAs because it recognizes and emphasises their traditional knowledge in line with good practices of governance and management of natural resources. The identification and the legal recognition of three ICCAs represent a major step forward in terms of diversification of governance systems of protected areas in DRC. This model will help improve the quality of PA governance and increase the respect for traditional knowledge of local stakeholders in terms of natural resource conservation. \u201cIdentification of the ICCAs with the local stakeholders\u201d! ! !

Prior to 2005, the 90,000 acres area currently occupied by the Conservancy and then known as Ol Pejeta Ranching Ltd was used extensively for cattle ranching.

The Conservancy thus works to conserve wildlife, provide a sanctuary for great apes and to generate income through wildlife tourism and complementary enterprise for reinvestment in conservation and community development. WILDLIFE-LIVESTOCK INTEGRATION The model is effectively contributing to the vision of the Conservancy as the Conservancy has recorded a 58% increase in total wildlife between 2006 and 2012. Specifically, the critically endangered black rhino has increased from 20 in 1993 to 101 in 2013 making it the largest black rhino population in East Africa and one of the only 8 in Africa with a population of over 100. The chimpanzee sanctuary is now fully-fledged and largely funded from internal revenue. Visitation has increased three-fold within the same period thanks to the abundant, diverse and healthy wildlife that is a characteristic of well managed and secure protected areas. Similarly, the Conservancy has diversified its revenue streams through complimentary enterprise such as beef and wheat farming - thus contributing to the much needed alternative revenue stream from tourism - that has contributed to establishing an elaborate Community Development Program that focuses on health, roads, water, education, and agricultural extension. By incorporating community livestock in this model by allowing organized grazing of the community livestock in the Conservancy when there is less graze outside, the initiative demonstrates an effective and equitable model of protected area management. In return the wildlife is tolerated outside of the Conservancy and neighbouring communities are willing to participate in conservation issues. Based on the achievements so far, an agreement has been signed with the Agricultural Development Corporation in the neighbouring Mutara area (Government Ranch, north of Ol Pejeta Conservancy) to implement a similar model, essentially availing a further 20,000 acres for \u201cA 58% increase in total wildlife between 2006 and 2012\u201d \u201cAllowing organized grazing of the community livestock\u201d \u201cNeighboring communities are willing to participate in conservation issues\u201d ! !

CONCLUSION The Conservancy demonstrated leadership by pioneering the wildlife-livestock integration model when it was considered inconceivable. The model itself was developed as a result of creative thinking to achieve a win-win situation for wildlife conservation in a region dominated by pastoralists. This initiative has led to an increase of wildlife, number of tourists, revenue streams, established community development program and presents optimism that conservation goals can be achieved. By allowing organized grazing of the community livestock in the Conservancy when there is less graze outside, the initiative demonstrates an effective and equitable model of protected area management. In return wildlife is tolerated outside of the Conservancy and neighbouring communities are willing to participate in conservation issues. As the decision to integrate wildlife and livestock was deliberate, it was well planned and captured in a 5-year management plan that was implemented through annual work plans. The plan was subjected to annual external evaluations for the first 3 years and to annual internal evaluations for the last two years. Although the Conservancy is fenced, gaps have been established strategically along the fence to ensure wildlife connectivity remains with the larger Laikipia ecosystem, in recognition of the landscape approach and importance of the connected protected area system. This model shows that conservation goals can be achieved if well planned and managed. The Conservancy is currently working on its 2020 strategic plan that will build on the lessons learnt from the initiative and see it strive to become an innovative and sustainable conservation and development model to conserve biodiversity - particularly endangered species - and to contribute to economic growth and improved livelihoods of rural communities. Consequently, wildlife-livestock integration is a form of multiple land use that can be used to achieve conservation goals, especially in pastoralist areas. ! ! ! ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 52! Story n\u00b016 - Martin MULAMA PART 4 Conservation and development, two faces of the same coin: protected areas as a revenue catalyst As mentioned in the previous chapter of this book (Part 3 Strengthening protected areas\u2019 legitimacy: working with the local communities), the support of local populations is a crucial factor impacting PA effectiveness. Unfortunately, conservation and development are sometimes presented as two different and opposing concepts, with PAs perceived as a constraint to development. To ensure the effectiveness of conservation policies it is thus important to highlight their role in development, particularly in Africa.

Voluntary regulation Informing and educating local populations about the sustainable use of natural resources aims to empower them in the management of these resources. This proved to be an effective answer to overfishing in Madagascar (Auto-regulation by communities for marine conservation, Alasdair Harris) and the overuse of forest resources in Burkina Faso (Ensuring the sustainability of natural resources uses, Alexis Kabore), where local communities realised the necessity to constrain their own fishing, hunting and harvesting activities in order to maintain these activities on the long term. The good balances Finally, accounting for the value of the environment, and of PAs in particular, can sometimes help to make the right choices between conservation and development (Counting and accounting for good decision-making, Ravaka Ranaivoson). Conservationists can sometimes be brought to make concessions in this regard but should nonetheless try to limit the negative impact of development activities on PAs (Development and conservation, a matter of concessions, Tom Obong Okello). Story n\u00b017 - Financial challenges of conservation THE NGORONGORO CONSERVATION AREA: WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS TO THE CHALLENGES OF MULTIPLE LAND USE? Freddy S. MANONGI,!Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority INTRODUCTION The Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) in Tanzania was established in July 1959 and was the first Tanzanian site to be inscribed - the same year - on the World Heritage List. In 2010, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee inscribed NCA as a mixed property on the World Heritage List, making it the only East African facility of the list with mixed status. Internationally, since 1981, NCA is also recognized as a part of the Serengeti- Ngorongoro Biosphere Reserve, under UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Program. NCA is a successful multiple use PA, where indigenous people (est. 87,851) are, so far, living harmoniously with wildlife in an area of 8,282 km2. NCA encompasses the spectacular Ngorongoro Crater (250 km2), which is the world's largest unbroken caldera. It also encompasses the Oldupai Gorge, one of the world's most important prehistoric sites, where anthropologists Louis and Mary Leakey made many of their greatest discoveries. Footprints that were most likely made by Australopithecus afarensis as well as fossils of the same early humans can also be found in one of the sediment layers inside NCA. There are large populations of wild life in the crater - including wildebeests, zebras, elands, Thomson and Grant gazelles as well as hippopotamus and a visible population of black rhinoceros. It is a major achievement for the government of Tanzania that the co-management of people and wildlife in a PA has worked for 50 years. The multiple use management approach in Tanzania has been adopted by the government of Tanzania to reach conservation goals. Nonetheless, it has also been shown that the NCA model is constrained and needs to be reviewed in order to achieve the goals of sustainable natural resource conservation, and tourism and human development as defined by the Government of Tanzania. CHALLENGES FACED BY THE NGORONGORO CONSERVATON AREA The growing local human population (from less than 8,000 in 1959 to about 87,000 today) in NCA seems trapped in a state of poverty with no views on how to mitigate between their basic needs, traditional lifestyles and contemporary development aspirations. Agriculture is not permitted in NCA because it would likely increase the conflicts between wildlife and agro-pastoralists. To compensate, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA) provides food to all the people of NCA as well as development support in terms of water projects, health and education programs for the \u201cIndigenous people living harmoniously with wildlife in an area of 8,282 km2\u201d! \u201cMitigate between their basic needs, traditional lifestyles and contemporary development aspirations\u201d! people residing in NCA.

TENTATIVE ANSWER BY THE NCAA Programs to relieve hunger, improve human health, educate locals, and livestock breeding have been adopted recently by the NCAA. Poverty alleviation projects through tourism initiatives and provision of livestock and other incentives to the very poor people in NCA have been implemented. Illegal immigrants have been relocated to a site outside NCA. NCAA annually spends a significant amount of money to build schools, health centres, roads and dams for the local community. Zoning was adopted in 2006 to control human use and development in NCA. Programs to control invasive species and manage pasture for livestock and wildlife have been implemented. FURTHER REFORMS ARE NECESSARY However, these programs have not completely solved the current conflicts between tourism, human development and conservation. In order to ease the current conflicts and achieve broader conservation goals the systems of governance and management of NCA require a totally new approach. There is an urgent need to determine trends and to see what has worked well in managing the difficult balance between nature conservation, tourism and people. Most importantly, there is also a need to determine what can be done to improve the situation for people, tourism management and conservation of natural resources in NCA. All these could be achieved through true and genuine multi-stakeholder analysis, consultations and engagement, and re- planning of the NCA model to achieve broader goals for conservation, tourism and human development.

Hluhluwe- iMfolozi Park is the largest conservation and ecotourism provider in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife is the government authority, and is driven by a new concept of conservation that is radically different from the conservation models that were put in place since the country\u2019s colonial and apartheid times. South Africa is now committed to promote a concept of conservation linked to issues of development and human needs, which is based on building an harmonious relationship between people and parks. For ecotourism and conservation policies to be successful in PAs, the attitudes and level of participation of local communities play a major role. The general attitudes of community residents towards tourism can be improved by both tangible and intangible benefits that these populations receive from being involved directly in decision-making processes. In each community, there are different groups of people who need different levers for motivation and satisfaction. These levers should be identified so as to promote good attitudes towards ecotourism and conservation in PAs. A study aiming at evaluating the socio-economic impacts of ecotourism in rural areas adjacent to HiP with specific reference to Nompondo community was launched in 2013.

This could be caused by the fact that the way of including these people in ecotourism and conservation ventures is still inappropriate and doesn\u2019t take into account their low level of education. As a consequence, the majority of people from the community were not of the opinion that ecotourism and conservation programs in HiP would help maintaini their traditional skills. A Local Board comprising representatives from different sectors impacted by the management of PAs (tribal and local authorities, regional tourism, environmental groups and business sectors) has been set up to deal with this issue. Its role is to promote local decision making related to the management of the park and to promote the integration of adjacent communities into the activities of the park. However it is important to note that community members are not given equal participatory roles. The majority are men, except in the case of handicraft private enterprises, where women dominate. BENEFITS RECEIVED BY COMMUNITY RESIDENTS FROM THE HIP The park system attempts to empower some of the community members as much as possible by giving them opportunities to sell their products in the park. These residents\u2019 incomes have generally increased thanks to conservation and ecotourism projects. This resulted in the establishment of the Vukuzame craft market and the Nselweni Bush Lodge. HiP offers some community services to the residents through HIV/AIDS education and improvement of linking roads to communities. The park also provides environmental education through the Sifundimvelo programme (Learning nature) for high school groups of learners and the People and Parks programme. Even though many other respondents indicated that their income had increased thanks to the ecotourism and conservation businesses, a majority of respondents still think that the distribution of revenue from ecotourism and conservation ventures are not fair and transparent enough. Communities wish that ecotourism would generate increased revenues, and provide more infrastructures such as roads, electricity, schools and health clinics. \u201cLocals should decide of the nature of ecotourism and conservation ventures\u201d! \u201cEcotourism and conservation programs in HiP would not help maintaining their traditional skills\u201d ! \u201cPromote the integration of adjacent communities into the activities of the park\u201d! ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 58!

However, they also indicated that the curtailed access to the park\u2019s wildlife resources and recreational resources is legitimate to some extent since free access could endanger conservation agendas. Of the Nompondo community respondents, 44.4% deplore the fact that locals do not have the priority over jobs in the park. This is mainly due to the low educational background of the majority of the residents. Many might not be employable by the park. Another source of conflict comes from the fact that some of the residents did not receive accrued benefits from conservation and ecotourism ventures. 42% agreed that this was driven by the fact that the opinion of locals are not taken into consideration when developing ecotourism and conservation projects. As a result of these conflicts, a third of the respondents stated that the number of poachers hiding within the community has increased.

These artisanal and traditional fisheries are vital to hundreds of millions of people, providing a lifeline for families and coastal economies, and underpinning food security for entire nations. Already one-and-a-half billion people live around our tropical coasts, dependent on the planet\u2019s richest yet most threatened marine biodiversity. They include some of the poorest and most vulnerable people on earth. Throughout the world\u2019s oceans, there is growing evidence that marine conservation works best when local communities are responsible for fisheries management. This is particularly the case in low-income countries, where national capacity for enforcement of marine and fisheries legislation may be weak. Locally Managed Marine Areas (LMMAs) are areas of ocean managed by coastal communities to help protect fisheries and safeguard marine biodiversity. Found throughout the world\u2019s tropical and subtropical seas, and encompassing diverse approaches to coastal management and governance, their sizes and contexts vary widely, but all share the common theme of involving coastal communities in marine and fisheries management. THE ROLE OF BLUE VENTURE IN EMPOWERING COASTAL COMMUNITIES For over a decade, marine conservation NGO Blue Ventures has been supporting coastal communities in Madagascar to establish dynamic and locally appropriate conservation strategies and governance systems that improve fisheries sustainability and climate change resilience. With some of the world\u2019s largest locally led marine conservation initiatives, Madagascar is leading the way in the Indian Ocean\u2019s rapidly growing LMMA movement. Most are currently being incorporated into the Madagascar PAs System (SAPM) as sustainable use areas, conforming to the IUCN Category V and VI classifications. There are currently 36 LMMAs in Madagascar; the majority focused on the vast coral reef and mangrove ecosystems of the country\u2019s west coast, together covering nearly 11,000km2; some 11% of Madagascar\u2019s continental shelf.

CONCLUSION The LMMA approach to coastal management is gaining momentum and popularity among communities, government authorities and conservation organisations throughout Madagascar and the broader western Indian Ocean region. Yet despite notable successes, many of these pioneering grassroots conservation initiatives are being developed in isolation, with limited communication or sharing of lessons learned between isolated communities. Blue Ventures\u2019 experience in Madagascar has shown that peer-to-peer learning is a highly effective tool for building local capacity and confidence for fisheries management and catalysing the adoption of community-led conservation efforts. With this in mind, we are supporting Madagascar\u2019s growing network of LMMAs to promote the exchange of know-how, experiences and best practice. The cornerstone of this network is a regular meeting of LMMA representatives from throughout Madagascar, providing an invaluable opportunity to meet face-to-face, share experiences, explore common issues and develop collaborative solutions. ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 62!

The threats that it faces are the consequence of a top-down approach that does not include the local population in decision-making processes and that leads to poaching, overexploitation of fisheries resources, illegal grazing, etc. In the Burkinabe part of the complex, the AFAUDEB (Association Faune et D\u00e9veloppement au Burkina \u2013 Association for Wildlife and Development in Burkina Faso) managed to implement processes of shared governance for natural resources management in the villages surrounding the WAP. This has enabled the reconciliation of nature conservation and socio-economic benefits at local level. CONTROLLED HUNTING ZONES The Controlled Hunting Zones (CHZ) are community-based PAs that have been established with the participation of local communities and local authority.

Thousands of women and men have benefited from technical training developed by AFAUDEB in order to strengthen the internal organization of the local associations in charge of processing the NFTP. The associations of villagers are responsible for harvesting, processing and selling NTFP. All villagers\u2019 associations are united under a regional cooperative that is responsible for extending the market outlet and the diversity of products made out of NTFP. It also promotes good practices of harvesting and processing NTFP (environmental friendly methods of processing that use less firewood, for instance). The products extracted from NTFP range from oil (of shea, baobab, balanites, neem) to soap (made from shea butter), juices (of baobab, tamarind and balanites) and biscuits (of baobab, and honey). This production contributes significantly to the livelihood of the community. The families of the community use part of it and the rest is sold on local or urban market, providing them with an additional incomes that can replace the illegal and unsustainable use of natural resources (such as poaching, overexploitation of timber).

Story n\u00b020 \u2013 Alexis KABORE Local communities are better organized and work together with new key partners (local authority), and a local agreement is established between communities and validated by the administration which sets up the rules of a sustainable use of natural resources (NTFP, ecotourism). Moreover, villagers themselves implement the ecological monitoring of the CHZ and can then adapt their practices according to the evolution of natural resources that they themselves witness. CONCLUSION The success of this tangible experience of shared governance is based on a bottom-up approach of joint decision-making at local level. Indeed, the rules dealing with the management of natural resources and the allocation of the sales benefits take into consideration the interests and the traditional habits of local communities. Only then did the local and national authorities formalize these rules. The model of PAs management promoted by AFAUDEB demonstrates that one of the best ways to set up shared governance is to ensure sustainable and profitable ways of adding value to natural resources of PAs and their periphery. Good organization, appropriate capacity building and innovative practices are essential. ! ! !

RANAIVOSON, Fondation Tany Meva INTRODUCTION Madagascar hosts 1/20th of the worlds\u2019 biodiversity and has a high rate of endemism (more than 70%) which has led to rate the island among the 34 biodiversity hotspots in the world. Among others, species of lemurs, amphibians, birds, baobabs and orchids are unique to this place. The area dedicated to conserving this rich diversity of fauna, flora and different picturesque habitats covers 12% of the national territory. However, different pressures, mainly driven by poverty, threaten this biodiversity: i.e. slash and burn, poaching, small-scale mining, wood fuel and charcoal production. Such practices contribute to the loss of 0.53% of forest on the island per year.

Meanwhile, this would help reduce the number of people living in poverty (currently more than 75% of Malagasy people) and malnutrition, as well as increase access to drinking water and electricity. Assessing the economic value of the biodiversity and using this value as a way to support development may be a solution to cope this challenge. CONSIDERING SHORT, MID AND LONG TERM VALUE OF NATURAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT DECISION MAKING While assessing the economic value of natural resources, it is important to compare their short-term value - if they are used and destroyed - with their long-term value - if they are maintained. In both cases, the assessment has to consider the advantages and drawbacks of each option regarding social aspects (health and education), environmental aspects (ecosystem services such as water supply) and economic aspects (income, employment and agriculture). One key element that impacts the success of this approach is the involvement of the population surrounding the parks in the economic assessment process of the natural resource, so that they can take part in the analysis of the projects to be developed in the future. Indeed, those projects must also consider the specifics of the local context (social, economic and environmental) and the needs of the local population (technical needs, capacity building and financial support). MADAGASCAR\u2019S NATURAL CAPITAL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED \u201cECONOMIC WEALTH\u201d Its biodiversity is certainly one of the main incentives for people to travel in Madagascar. Nature-based tourism, and in particular in PAs, is a leading sector in Madagascar, which generated around six million USD in 2010. However, on the other hand, the degradation of its natural resources costs Madagascar 450 to 500 million USD per year, approximately 9% of its GDP. In order to consider natural resource as part of a country\u2019s wealth, one key step is to \u201cvalue\u201d the natural resources and to include them in the national accounting. This accounting will thus help choosing, in each case, what the best option would be between conservation and development (with the required compensation if needed). Identifying the stakeholders to be involved in the conservation and development programs is key as they have an important role to play in defining the suitable measures to implement in terms of policy, regulation and strategy. \u201cInvolvement of the population surrounding the parks\u201d ! \u201cThe degradation of its natural resource costs Madagascar 450 to 500 million USD every year\u201d! ! !

That is why it is important to disseminate these tools dedicated to assessing the economic value of natural resources. Replicable and adaptable The value of natural resources for local populations is different depending on locations and countries, however the aim of their exploitation remains the same: for subsistence or for profit. Tools for economic assessment are the same (i.e. the System of Environmental Economic Accounting established by the United Nations) and can be applied in different countries. Moreover, these tools apply to every type of governance of PAs. CONCLUSION PAs may participate in development as long as all the stakeholders are involved in the process. Therefore, all the targeted audiences - local communities, population, authorities, donors, decision makers - need to have the right information on: (i) the reasons why they have to conserve the biodiversity, (ii) the reasons why they should get involved, (iii) and the ways for them to contribute to this initiative.

But in fact, there is an urgent need to \u201cvalue\u201d natural resources in order to qualify them as \u201ceconomic wealth\u201d. Therefore, their integration in public finance may be one of the solutions to reinforce citizen commitment from local populations with authorities and private sectors. Neither conservation nor development are optional, but both sectors could work in synergy. The results of the assessment of the economic values of natural resources can be used as a tool to do so. ! !

OKELLO, Uganda Wildlife Authority INTRODUCTION In Uganda, commercially viable quantities of oil and gas resources have been discovered in the country\u2019s Albertine Rift region. These resources are estimated to yield up to 3.5 billion barrels of oil. The country is excited by this discovery and is fast tracking exploration and development efforts. Like other oil producing countries, Uganda expects to earn foreign exchange from export of petroleum products as well as taxes levied on oil companies and service providers. The oil sector is also expected to create jobs and contribute to household income and to generate electricity, which is an important driver for industrial development. Unfortunately, the Albertine Rift region, where the oil and gas reserves have been discovered, has the highest biodiversity rate in the country. The area has five national parks, eight wildlife reserves and several forest reserves. Within MFNP, 5 oil fields have been discovered and efforts are underway to start the field development program. Therefore a project has been developed in order to enable legal instruments, policies and practices in place, and to mitigate the impacts of oil and gas exploration and development in PAs and thus prevent from the ultimate loss of biodiversity. This presentation aims at exploring the best practices that Uganda governmental institutions responsible for environmental, PA and oil and gas management, as well as other stakeholders, are pursuing to achieve this critical balance between getting oil out of the reservoirs while not compromising conservation in Uganda\u2019s largest and oldest national park, the Murchison Falls national park (MFNP). \u201cThe Albertine rift region, where the oil and gas reserves have been discovered, has the highest biodiversity rate in the country\u201d! \u201cCritical balance between getting oil out of the reservoirs while not compromising conservation\u201d!

After over five years of exploration activities involving seismic studies, exploration and appraisal drilling of 33 wells as well as feasibility studies for production infrastructure, the Ugandan government, in partnership with two oil companies, is in the final stage of the preparation of the production phase.

ENABLING POLICIES AND LEGISLATION In October 2009, a national committee comprising The Uganda Wildlife Act (Cap 200 of the Laws of Uganda 2000) mandates the PA Management Authority (Uganda Wildlife Authority) to control and monitor industrial and mining developments in wildlife PA. The Act also mandates the authority to develop plans and guidelines that will promote conservation. Objective 9 of the National Oil and Gas Policy provides guidance for ensuring that oil and gas activities are undertaken in a manner that conserves the environment and biodiversity. According to this policy, UWA is the entity in charge of monitoring the compliance of oil and gas activities to the regulations governing wildlife operations in PAs and of monitoring the impacts of oil and gas activities on wildlife.

The following initiatives, tools and guidelines have been developed and implemented in order to prevent the potentially known and dangerous impacts of this development on the environment. The project first focused at national level on the following initiatives: 1. working with lead agencies to develop a Sensitivity Atlas for Albertine graben to show case the environmental sensitivity of the graben and act as baseline for monitoring oil and gas activities; 2. developing the Strategic Environment Assessment to guide decisions on planning of the development phase; 3. developing the Albertine Rift Environment Monitoring Plan; 4. developing operational guidelines to guide, coordinate and regulate the activities of oil companies while working within protected areas; 5. continuing to build capacity of PA managers on oil and gas issues through training, study tour to countries showcasing good environmental practices; \u201cThe tourism site directly overlaps with the oil fields\u201d! \u201cEnsuring that oil and gas activities are undertaken in a manner that conserves the environment and biodiversity\u201d! ! ! Story n\u00b022 \u2013 Tom OKELLO! 71 6. developing an MoU between UWA and the oil company to further guide operations in MFNP. Then the project also worked at the protected area level by: 1. developing a detailed sensitivity atlas for the national park based on biodiversity sensitivity to oil and gas activities and other developments. Ecologically sensitive areas have been mapped out and categorized as avoidance features. These include breeding grounds, watering points for wildlife and areas with large aggregations of wildlife. 2. working with WCS to carry out research on impacts of oil on ranging patterns e.g through the collaring of elephants and lions and monitoring their movements in relation to oil activities; 3. working with oil companies in carrying out biodiversity surveys e.g surveys on birds, mammals, and fish to establish baselines; 4. convincing Oil companies to pay daily entrance fees like other visitors to the PA (negotiated as conservation fees); this money is then ploughed back into conservation; 5. establishing and equipping fully fledged oil monitoring unit at PA level to enforce daily compliance monitoring with backstopping from UWA HQs technical staff; 6. encouraging oil companies to hold quarterly stakeholders\u2019 engagement and awareness meetings at field level to sensitize the public on their activities; 7. providing with all oil companies\u2019 staff and staff of their sub-contractors, induction on conservation before entering to work in the national park; 8. recruiting and training 100 dedicated staff to work with oil companies and ensure their activities are within the approved guidelines; 9. taking out of the PA all drill wastes (both solid and liquid) upon completion of drilling; 10. restoring immediately all sites and access routes after completion of well testing. The restored sites are monitored for a year to ensure non-colonization by alien species.

Moreover, the routine inspections and monitoring of oil activities have pressurised the developer to adhere to the mitigation measures (e.g. improved chemical handling on drill pads, self-reporting of accidents). Those biodiversity surveys have been carried out together with the oil companies (e.g. surveys of birds, mammals, and fish to establish baselines which will be used for future monitoring).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb3a1459-2a08-4c8d-b126-5df252adec28": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb3a1459-2a08-4c8d-b126-5df252adec28", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Twenty-two stories of conservation in Africa : key elements for effective and well-governed protected areas", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c76033ae39de6dbd3d934eecdd0353157cc7e20f2d276bb3a7ee47b50fed2989"}, "2": {"node_id": "3306b8de-3b69-4f70-bee3-bb603582c239", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ab6f0eeb045d3aa300fc14db0800d7ed2243026d7a61179651ffb7265904cdb"}}, "hash": "1de48b05cdb0ef6c42a947306b8886333d3a083ea707f1dea4ab7f32a9b1d3d3", "text": "Thanks to their competent staff to this regard, the companies have also adopted good practices such as: no flaring in PAs, reduction in drill sizes, location of the building support infrastructure (material storage", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d4d5e4a-8bbd-49c3-9055-118880316bd9": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d4d5e4a-8bbd-49c3-9055-118880316bd9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Twenty-two stories of conservation in Africa : key elements for effective and well-governed protected areas", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/twenty-two-stories-conservation-africa-key-elements-effective-and-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "830e374b3e9f5714c2ef9b6e281a4886ce766f0755e990d3dc772e0ca76786bb"}}, "hash": "830e374b3e9f5714c2ef9b6e281a4886ce766f0755e990d3dc772e0ca76786bb", "text": "and staff camps) outside of the PA.

Drafting process and acknowledgements A working group was established to revise the IUCN Technical Guidelines on the Management of Ex Situ Populations for Conservation to clarify the process and bring the guidelines into line with developments that had taken place since their publication in 2002. This process started with an analysis of decision-making steps for evaluating ex situ activities for conservation benefit during the Annual Meeting of the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Conservation Breeding Specialist Group (CBSG) in Cologne, Germany in October 2010. This analysis was undertaken by individuals involved in a range of taxonomic and disciplinary SSC Specialist Groups, in situ conservation organisations, and the zoo and aquarium community. Subsequently, a drafting team was formed under the auspices of CBSG, comprising Kristin Leus (CBSG Europe, Copenhagen Zoo), Kathy Traylor-Holzer (CBSG), and Philip McGowan (Galliformes Specialist Group).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3995ab9e-3674-4dcb-a5b5-cfa714238dd7": {"__data__": {"id_": "3995ab9e-3674-4dcb-a5b5-cfa714238dd7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-species-survival-commission-guidelines-use-ex-situ-management", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN Species Survival Commission guidelines on the use of ex situ management for species conservation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-species-survival-commission-guidelines-use-ex-situ-management", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af9bd617e985fd7999a119ba2df74404bf94fe9bac32566eb86e235c6bb61399"}, "2": {"node_id": "584e7477-3eae-4a4a-80ad-abde655c151b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-species-survival-commission-guidelines-use-ex-situ-management", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e058cf2f51391b2e483beda96b9cc5764d9de53e4066ae6bd1a6a5e7e9f189df"}}, "hash": "3fbc1866271882326a5419c43d5fa4718e2bda69c79a69c4ac92c6f03b16f4e4", "text": "They were supported by representatives from all SSC Subcommittees, namely Mike Maunder (Plant Conservation Subcommittee), Yvonne Sadovy (Marine Conservation Subcommittee), Paul Pearce-Kelly (Invertebrate Conservation Subcommittee), Topiltzin Contreras MacBeath (Freshwater Conservation Subcommittee), and Mark Stanley Price (Species Conservation Planning Subcommittee).

The final draft was submitted to and approved by the SSC Steering Committee on 29 August 2014. The drafting team (Kristin Leus, Kathy Traylor-Holzer and Philip McGowan) would like to express heartfelt thanks to each and every person that contributed to the development of the guidelines. We also acknowledge the support of home institutions and organisations of all contributors for allowing them the time to carry out this work. We hope that these guidelines contribute to the evaluation and, where appropriate, application of ex situ management for effective species conservation. i Guidelines Section 1: Introduction As habitats and ecosystems become increasingly altered and populations evermore impacted by human activities, a growing number of species will require some form of management of both individuals and populations to ensure their survival. Effective species conservation planning should consider all options when assessing what actions are necessary to address the conservation pressures facing a particular species. Ex situ management (see Section 2 for definition) is one possible option that can contribute to the conservation of threatened species. The range of ex situ scenarios and tools is diverse and can target different conservation needs and roles and, therefore, serve various purposes. Ex situ management has been used to deliver conservation benefit for threatened species. Species extinctions have been prevented and for an increasing number of species there have been conservation restorations or introductions following periods of ex situ management. However, the need for, and suitability of, an ex situ programme must be carefully evaluated as part of an integrated conservation strategy. In order to be successful, ex situ programmes need to be carefully planned and implemented in a way that provides conservation benefit. In addition, as conservation challenges become more complex and urgent, the need to further develop scientifically based and innovative approaches to ex situ conservation will increase. Not all species will require an ex situ component as part of their conservation strategy, and not all ex situ populations will have a direct conservation purpose. These guidelines are intended to be used in situations in which ex situ management is being considered as part of an overall integrated species conservation strategy. The aim of these guidelines is to provide practical guidance on evaluating the suitability and requirements of an ex situ component for achieving species conservation objectives. They should not be misconstrued as promoting ex situ management over any other form of conservation action, and specific elements should not be selected in isolation to justify ex situ management for conservation. Indeed they are intended to ensure that proposals for any such activities are rigorously designed and scrutinised, whatever the taxon or scale of operation. Accordingly, the need for risk assessment and sound decision making processes in all ex situ management for conservation is emphasised, but with the level of effort in proportion to the scale, risk and uncertainties around any such activity. These guidelines replace the 2002 IUCN Technical Guidelines on the Management of Ex Situ Populations for Conservation. In addition, aspects of these guidelines merge with many other disciplines in contemporary conservation, which also have their own guidelines or policies. Within IUCN, these guidelines should be seen as complementary to, and consistent with, the following key works: \u2022 IUCN Guidelines for Reintroductions and Other Conservation Translocations (2013)1. In those cases where individuals are used for population restoration or conservation introduction following a period of ex situ management, these guidelines should be consulted together. \u2022 IUCN Guidelines for the Prevention of Biodiversity Loss Caused by Alien Invasive Species (2000)1. \u2022 IUCN (2008).

Many populations both within and outside protected areas are subject to varying intensities of management such as anti-poaching interventions, predator or pathogen control, the provision of supplementary nutrition, habitat modification (e.g. controlled burning or flooding), the application of assisted reproduction, restriction of natural migration and dispersal, meta-population management, population regulation, etc., that show some characteristics in common with those used in the intensive management of ex situ populations. While we encourage the evaluation of the full \u201cin situ to ex situ\u201d spectrum of population management options in the process of identifying the most suitable conservation strategies for a species, these guidelines are designed to provide guidance for situations towards the ex situ end of the spectrum. For the purpose of these guidelines, \u201cex situ\u201d is defined as conditions under which individuals are spatially restricted with respect to their natural spatial patterns or those of their progeny, are removed from many of their natural ecological processes, and are managed on some level by humans. In essence, the individuals are maintained in artificial conditions under different selection pressures than those in natural conditions in a natural habitat. These are generally circumstances in which humans exercise control over many of the natural dynamics of a population, including control of climate and living environments, access to nutrition and water, shelter, reproductive opportunities, and protection from predation or certain other natural causes of mortality. Ex situ management may take place either within or outside the species\u2019 geographic range, but is in a controlled or modified environment. This may include highly artificial environments where individuals are stored as dormant in subzero conditions (e.g. seedbanks, genome resource banks), or semi-natural conditions where individuals are subject to near natural environments. 2 http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/gpap_home/gpap_capacity2/gpap_bpg/?10734/Ecological-Restoration- for-Protected-Areas 3 http://www.iucnredlist.org/ 2 These guidelines are specifically intended for situations in which individuals (or live bio- samples) of any species (or other taxonomic unit) are present ex situ for any period of time for a clearly defined conservation purpose. For simplicity, the guidelines use the terms of \u201cindividual\u201d to represent both individuals and live bio-samples and \u201cspecies\u201d to represent any taxonomic unit of conservation interest. These guidelines apply to: Ecological contexts - All taxonomic groups (animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, protozoa, etc.); - All taxonomic levels (e.g. species, subspecies or different groupings of these); - All population levels (e.g. all individuals of a species, single population, multiple populations); - All live entities (not only whole living organisms, but also gametes, seeds, living cell lines, etc.); and - All geographic levels (e.g. local, national, global). Management contexts - Both situations in which individuals need to be taken from the wild and brought under ex situ management, and situations in which the management of existing ex situ populations may be utilized or adapted for conservation benefit; - The complete spectrum of very short term to very long term ex situ phases that may or may not include all life stages or reproduction; and - Only ex situ populations with clearly defined conservation goals and objectives that contribute to the viability of the species as a component of its overall conservation strategy. While many different types of ex situ populations exist, with many different and sometimes overlapping roles and contexts, ex situ management for conservation only applies to those ex situ populations that have conservation as their primary aim. The ex situ activities must benefit a population, the species, or the ecosystem it occupies and the primary benefit should be at a higher level of organisation than the individual. The conservation goals and objectives can be diverse and may include not only providing individuals for reintroduction or other conservation translocations, for genetic rescue or as insurance against extinction, but also for allowing tailored conservation education, conservation research and training that targets the reduction of threats or the accruement of conservation benefits for the species. This does not preclude these ex situ populations for conservation from having additional roles that are not necessarily, or only indirectly and generally, related to conservation.

Often primary threats such as habitat loss, invasive species, or overexploitation lead to small isolated populations, which then in turn become highly susceptible to additional stochastic threats that can lead to a feedback loop of population decline and eventual extinction (often referred to as the \u2018extinction vortex\u2019). It is in such instances that intensive management, including but not restricted to ex situ management, can be of particular conservation value if deemed appropriate for the species and situation. 3 Ex situ conservation has the potential to: Address the causes of primary threats Ex situ activities can help reduce primary threats such as habitat loss, exploitation, invasive species or disease when specifically designed conservation research, conservation training or conservation education activities directly and effectively impact the causes of these threats (e.g. training in the recognition of specific life stages or gender characteristics for preferential exploitation, education to limit the spread of an invasive species, or research into disease epidemiology or treatment). Offset the effects of threats Ex situ activities can improve the demographic and/or genetic viability of a wild population by ameliorating the impacts of primary or stochastic threats on the population. Small populations that are vulnerable to primary threats and stochastic processes may require some form of intensive management of individuals and populations to improve demographic and genetic viability and avoid extinction. Challenges faced by small populations (e.g. reduced survival, reduced reproduction, decreased population size, and genetic isolation) can be counteracted by a range of population management options, such as head start programmes to address high juvenile mortality, or population reinforcement to balance age and sex distribution. Buy time Establishment of a diverse and sustainable ex situ rescue or insurance population may be critical in preventing species extinction when wild population decline is steep and the chance of sufficiently rapid reduction of primary threats is slim or uncertain or has been inadequately successful to date. Examples include ex situ populations in response to severe disease threat, catastrophic events or continued habitat degradation. Restore wild populations Once the primary threats have been sufficiently addressed, ex situ populations can be used for population restoration (reinforcement or reintroduction) or conservation introduction (assisted colonisation or ecological replacement). As such, these guidelines should be seen as complementary to, and consistent with, the IUCN Guidelines for Reintroductions and Other Conservation Translocations1, and any ex situ programme for conservation that includes a return of individuals from ex situ conditions to natural conditions must equally refer to these. For a growing number of taxa ex situ management may play a critical role in preventing extinction as habitats continue to decline or alter and become increasingly unsuitable. Furthermore, it should be acknowledged that even under the most optimistic of climate change impact and adaptation scenarios, an increasing percentage of species (for example, polar and mountain species; reef corals and their dependent species) may have little likelihood of long-term persistence in the wild, despite the option of assisted colonisation in certain carefully selected cases. At present, many threat assessment processes are inadequate in predicting the complex impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on the potential persistence of a species in situ (either within its current or a new range). 4 Section 4: Integrating in situ and ex situ conservation planning There is an increasing need to ensure the integration of in situ and ex situ conservation planning to ensure that, whenever appropriate, ex situ conservation is used to support in situ conservation to the best effect possible. These guidelines would therefore ideally be used as an integral part of, and complementary to, existing species conservation planning processes (Figure 1). Any ex situ conservation support should follow a logical process from initial concept to design, feasibility, risk assessment, decision-making, implementation, monitoring, adjustment and evaluation. Furthermore, the Species Survival Commission\u2019s approach to conservation planning for species1 requires the specification of goals, objectives and actions: \u2022 A goal is a statement of the intended result in terms of conservation benefit; \u2022 Objectives give clear and specific details for how the goal will be realised; and \u2022 Actions are statements of what should be done to meet the objectives. When used strategically ex situ conservation can be a potent tool for species conservation that does not undermine, but complements, the imperatives of field conservation. Potential ex situ goals, objectives and actions should therefore be evaluated alongside potential in situ activities in the process of conservation planning to ensure that they are used appropriately and to best effect. More specifically, before an ex situ conservation programme is developed or continued, it is important to consider the roles it can play, the characteristics", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf09f355-80f5-46e8-b49d-5b926b3ff289": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf09f355-80f5-46e8-b49d-5b926b3ff289", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-species-survival-commission-guidelines-use-ex-situ-management", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN Species Survival Commission guidelines on the use of ex situ management for species conservation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-species-survival-commission-guidelines-use-ex-situ-management", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c4cbfef3c30e90728bf9428dce09e913088d16a09844728af6abce83fac589fe"}}, "hash": "c4cbfef3c30e90728bf9428dce09e913088d16a09844728af6abce83fac589fe", "text": "and dimensions it should take, and what factors will impede or likely contribute to conservation success. As is the case for conservation planning in general, these evaluations are ideally made by a multi-stakeholder group, including both in situ and ex situ expertise and experience. These guidelines outline five steps (Figure 1) to evaluate the appropriateness of ex situ management as part of a comprehensive species conservation strategy. They explore the conservation role and design, feasibility, and risk assessment, and guide a final decision on whether or not to proceed with an ex situ programme for conservation. The five-step process also provides input for the formulation of clear goals, objectives and actions for any ex situ conservation programme undertaken after the decision making process. FIVE-STEP DECISION MAKING PROCESS to decide when ex situ management is an appropriate conservation tool Ex situ management should be applied to the conservation of a species where, on balance, stakeholders can be confident that the expected positive impact on the conservation of that species will outweigh the potential risks or any negative impact (which could be to the local population, species, habitat or ecosystem), and that its use will be a wise application of the available resources. This requires an assessment of the potential net positive impact, weighted by how likely it is that this potential will be realised, given the expertise, level of difficulty or uncertainty, and available resources. The following five-step outline provides a logical decision-making process that can be applied to evaluate the appropriateness of ex situ management as a tool to support the conservation of a species and to identify the form that such management would need to take. All steps of the process should be documented for transparency and clarity. 5 STEP 1. Compile a status review of the species, including a threat analysis. A detailed review should be undertaken of all relevant information on the species, both in the wild and ex situ, with the aim of assessing the viability of the population(s) and to identify and understand threats that affect the species. This is a normal step in any conservation planning process and may therefore for some species already be available in existing conservation strategies or action plans. If not, this process would ideally be conducted in the wider framework of the creation of one integrated conservation strategy for a species. a. The status review should contain information on all factors that are appropriate to the life history and taxonomy, current population status, and other factors that are relevant to the demographic and genetic viability and ecosystem function of the species being considered. The structure of the status review (and threat analysis \u2013 see b. below) should, wherever possible, be consistent with IUCN processes that also compile information on status, such as the IUCN Red List Assessments3 and the IUCN/SSC Species Conservation Planning approach1. The character and scale of the status review will vary depending on the precise circumstances, including data availability and relevance. Important information gaps concerning the status should be noted. b. A threat analysis should be undertaken to identify the specific historical, current and likely future primary direct and indirect threats as well as stochastic threats facing the species in the wild and the constraints limiting its viability and conservation. This analysis should, wherever possible, utilise the rapidly growing data knowledge on anticipated climate change scenarios to predict likely changes in status. This provides the framework for evaluating specifically how ex situ management of the species may contribute to its conservation. c. Genetic and demographic modelling should where possible be used to assess the viability of the wild population. This can be very valuable to guide population management by identifying the effects and relative importance of threats (including stochastic processes) and the strategies that may address them effectively. d. The status of any free-living populations living outside of the species\u2019 indigenous range, as well as the status of existing ex situ population(s) (if any), should be reviewed, including current population size, demographic and genetic characteristics, provenance and history, taxonomy, and any programme goals and management methods if applicable. e. In the absence of sufficient data for a thorough assessment, other information may be considered as evidence suggestive of current or impending population decline or reduced viability, such as population trends, likelihood of future habitat loss, vulnerability to climate change, projected impact of invasive species, and restricted range to one or few locations. 6 STEP 2. Define the role(s) that ex situ management will play in the overall conservation of the species.

There should be a clear statement on how the proposed ex situ programme will contribute quantifiable benefits to the conservation of the species and address certain specific threat(s) and/or constraints to its viability as identified in the status review and threat analysis. This should include quantifiable goal(s) and objectives, and how success towards those objectives will be measured and assessed. When sufficient data and expertise are available, population modelling can be effective in assessing the potential impact of the ex situ programme on the viability of the wild population. b. Potential roles (purpose/function) that an ex situ programme might serve for the conservation of a species generally fall into the four categories of Addressing the causes of primary threats, Offsetting the effects of threats, Buying time, and Restoring wild populations (see Section 3) and more specifically include but are not restricted to: \u2022 Insurance population (maintaining a viable ex situ population of the species to prevent predicted local, regional or global species extinction and preserve options for future conservation strategies); \u2022 Temporary rescue (temporary removal from the wild to protect from catastrophes or predicted imminent threats, e.g. extreme weather, disease, oil spill, wildlife trade). This could be appropriate at either local or global scale; \u2022 Maintenance of a long term ex situ population after extinction of all known wild populations and as a preparation for reintroduction or assisted colonisation if and when feasible; \u2022 Demographic manipulation (e.g. head-start programmes that remove individuals from the wild to reduce mortality during a specific life stage and then subsequently return them to the wild); \u2022 Source for population restoration, either to re-establish the species into part of its former range from which it has disappeared, or to reinforce an existing population (e.g. for demographic, behavioural or genetic purposes); \u2022 Source for ecological replacement to re-establish a lost ecological function and/or modify habitats. This may involve species that are not themselves threatened but that contribute to the conservation of other taxa through their ecological role; \u2022 Source for assisted colonisation to introduce the species outside of its indigenous range to avoid extinction; \u2022 Research and/or training that will directly benefit conservation of the species, or a similar species, in the wild (e.g. monitoring methods, life history information, nutritional requirements, disease transmission/treatment); and \u2022 Basis for an education and awareness programme that addresses specific threats or constraints to the conservation of the species or its habitat. c. One ex situ programme may serve several conservation roles \u2013 either simultaneously or consecutively. It is recognised that an ex situ population can also serve to avoid extinction of a species that has no chance in the foreseeable future for persistence in the wild (for example in the face of climate change). In such circumstances a careful appraisal of the allocation of available resources should be made, and a prioritization based on conservation benefits and other values may assist in the decision making. 7 STEP 3. Determine the characteristics and dimensions of the ex situ population needed to fulfil the identified conservation role(s). The identified conservation purpose and function of the ex situ programme will determine its required nature, scale and duration. a. Biological factors that are important in assessing requirements for achieving the programme\u2019s aim and objectives include: \u2022 The number of founders (unrelated individuals of wild origin) required to attain the genetic and demographic goals of the ex situ population. This may involve making use of founders (and their descendants) of existing ex situ populations and/or sampling (additional) individuals (and where appropriate propagules or biomaterials from individuals) from the wild, across different habitat types, populations, etc.; \u2022 The number of individuals or bio-samples to be maintained or produced ex situ; \u2022 Whether reproduction or propagation is required during the duration of the programme; \u2022 The likely required length of programme (in generations and in years) where possible; \u2022 The relative risk for artificial selection/adaptation (genetic, phenotypic, etc.) during consecutive generations in ex situ conditions; \u2022 Whether the ex situ phase is envisaged to be followed by a release (which has consequences for the required characteristics of the ex situ environment); and \u2022 The type of environment required to maintain the individuals in a suitable condition during the length of the programme. b. These lead to the following practical considerations that should be evaluated: \u2022 The most suitable geographic location and scale for the ex situ activities (for example, inside vs. outside of the current/indigenous range; a centralized vs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3d9a03d-85c9-46e5-a134-4296b9e46e50": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3d9a03d-85c9-46e5-a134-4296b9e46e50", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-species-survival-commission-guidelines-use-ex-situ-management", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN Species Survival Commission guidelines on the use of ex situ management for species conservation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-species-survival-commission-guidelines-use-ex-situ-management", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "995643559af49075f739eeda845e0a7c7985649c176f013afa1bd975f9640490"}}, "hash": "995643559af49075f739eeda845e0a7c7985649c176f013afa1bd975f9640490", "text": "a multi-facility programme; etc.). Where possible ex situ management should be undertaken within the range states and under similar climatic regimes to the wild population. However, because the current distribution of ex situ facilities and professional capacity generally does not match with the geographic areas of greatest species loss, the need for capacity building and the availability of material resources and suitably trained and committed personnel requires consideration; \u2022 Whether whole living organisms and/or live bio-samples (e.g. tissue or gametes/seeds/spores) will need to be maintained ex situ; \u2022 Whether whole living organisms and/or live bio-samples will need to be marked and tracked and if so, how; \u2022 Whether individuals from existing ex situ populations (potentially with other, or additional, roles than conservation) can be included in the ex situ conservation programme, thus reducing the risks to the wild population associated with the removal of individuals; \u2022 The intensity of genetic and demographic management required to achieve the roles and goals of the ex situ programme; \u2022 The potential bio-security risks associated with the project, both at the ex situ location(s) and in any subsequent population restoration or conservation introduction if this is planned; \u2022 The welfare issues associated with the programme; \u2022 The potential options for, and benefits of, maintaining individuals on public display vs. in non-public facilities that restrict access, visibility or disturbance; 8 \u2022 The degree of human proximity and interaction that can be allowed in terms of the potential for habituation of ex situ individuals to people, due to the management approach chosen and/or exposure to the public; \u2022 The legal and regulatory requirements for removing individuals or biomaterials from the wild and/or transporting them regionally, nationally or internationally; \u2022 The ownership of, and access to, individuals and bio-samples and the degree of assurance of ongoing commitment to the programme by both holding and owning parties; and \u2022 The fate of any individuals or bio-samples remaining in the ex situ programme when its purpose has been achieved. Population models may be used to determine the necessary population size, composition and level of management needed to meet the conservation role(s) of the population. 9 STEP 4. Define the resources and expertise needed for the ex situ management programme to meet its role(s) and appraise the feasibility and risks. It is not sufficient to know the potential value of an ex situ programme designed to meet a specific conservation role \u2013 it is also critical to evaluate the resources needed, the feasibility of successfully managing such a programme, the likelihood of success at all steps of the programme, including where relevant any subsequent return to the wild, and the risks, including risks to the species in the wild and to other conservation activities. These should be balanced against the risks of failing to take appropriate conservation action. a. It is essential to assess the resources required to establish and maintain an ex situ population with the characteristics defined in Step 3 in order to achieve the aims and objectives stated in Step 2. These should be considered in detail at this stage. Some of the practical factors that will determine the overall scale of resources required include: \u2022 The facilities, infrastructure and space required; \u2022 The staffing required (in terms of numbers, skills and continuity); \u2022 The risk for the spread of disease (need for biosecurity, quarantine, diagnostics, research on pathogens and disease, etc.). \u2022 The risk of catastrophes impacting the ex situ programme (natural or human- caused catastrophes, such as fire, civil unrest, etc.); and \u2022 The finances required for all essential activities over an adequate period of time (in proportion to the expected total length of the programme). b. Other factors that need to be determined to investigate the feasibility and risks of the proposed project include: \u2022 The probability of obtaining the required resources, including technical experts and project managers with the required skill sets. Effective ex situ management for conservation will require effective multidisciplinary teams within the biological, technical and social skill sets; \u2022 Competition for resources with other programmes for the same or other taxa as well as opportunities for cost sharing; \u2022 Available expertise in husbandry/disease control/cultivation/propagation/banking for relevant life stages for this and/or for related/comparable taxa. In some areas of the world, particularly in regions facing the highest rates of biodiversity loss, the capacity for skills in ex situ conservation may need to be strengthened. Similarly, the increasingly diverse range of candidate species and challenges to be addressed may require additional tools and techniques; \u2022 The degree of stability in, or level of agreement about, the taxonomy of the taxon", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0db09f36-e390-48d4-9581-b586afbbbe92": {"__data__": {"id_": "0db09f36-e390-48d4-9581-b586afbbbe92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-species-survival-commission-guidelines-use-ex-situ-management", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN Species Survival Commission guidelines on the use of ex situ management for species conservation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-species-survival-commission-guidelines-use-ex-situ-management", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7273ba42f7885510843630791d8d3f9bdb8809af308f13a1fd1bb221ce9ab104"}}, "hash": "7273ba42f7885510843630791d8d3f9bdb8809af308f13a1fd1bb221ce9ab104", "text": "in question and the degree of knowledge on evolutionary significant units, genetic population structure and risks for inbreeding and outbreeding depression; \u2022 The critical governmental and non-governmental partner institutions and the probability of successful collaboration among these (including partners responsible for field conservation); \u2022 The degree of compatibility of the ecological, demographic, behavioural or other characteristics of the species with the type of ex situ management proposed; \u2022 Requirements to ensure the welfare of any living individuals ex situ.

An ex situ conservation programme may need to meet regulatory requirements at any or all of the international, national, regional or sub- regional levels. This may among others involve regulations for the capture or collection of individuals from the source populations, for the movement of individuals across international borders (e.g. CITES) and across jurisdictional or formally recognised tribal boundaries, for dealing with benefits arising from the use of genetic resources and/or traditional knowledge (e.g. Nagoya Protocol), for veterinary and phyto-sanitary aspects, and for the holding of wild individuals in ex situ conditions; \u2022 Any formal endorsements required for the project from relevant in situ and/or ex situ entities, and how likely they can be obtained; \u2022 Where relevant, assessment of the impact of the removal of individuals from the wild on the remaining wild source population (e.g. through modelling); \u2022 The likely impact on the remaining wild population and its habitat of establishing, or not establishing, an ex situ population. Special consideration may be given to situations in which all remaining wild individuals may need to be removed due to a very high probability of extinction in the wild that cannot be mitigated in time; \u2022 The ecological risks (e.g. containment of potentially invasive species, hybridisation risks) and what is required to minimise them; \u2022 Any health and safety risks (for people and/or other species) and what is required to minimise them; and \u2022 Any potential political, social or public conflicts of interest and how they can be dealt with. A review of the cultural status of the species should be conducted to ensure that any ex situ conservation management is compatible with local traditions and values and supported by local communities at the source location(s) and/or the ex situ location(s). Mechanisms for communication, engagement and problem-solving between the public (especially key individuals most likely affected by or concerned about the removal of individuals from nature or the maintenance of individuals ex situ) and ex situ managers should be established. A review of the factors mentioned above will allow the assessment of an overall probability of the ex situ programme achieving the intended results in terms of conservation benefit. The scope of the risk assessment should be proportional to the level of identified risk. Where data are poor, the risk assessment may only be qualitative but it is necessary, as lack of data does not indicate absence of risk. 11 STEP 5. Make a decision that is informed (i.e. uses the information gathered above) and transparent (i.e. demonstrates how and why the decision was taken). The decision to include ex situ management in the conservation strategy for a species should be determined by weighing the potential conservation benefit to the species against the likelihood of success and overall costs and risks of not only the proposed ex situ programme, but also alternative conservation actions or inaction. The relative importance (weight) of potential conservation benefit vs. likelihood of success, costs and risks will vary for each species and situation, according to factors such as, but not limited to: \u2022 The severity of threats and/or risk of extinction of the wild population; \u2022 The significance of the species (ecological, cultural, sociological, economic or evolutionary distinctness, value of the species in leveraging large scale habitat conservation, etc.); and \u2022 Legal and political mandates. In general, any conservation management strategy including ex situ management is warranted when potential conservation benefit is both high and likely to be achieved. Similarly, ex situ management is not warranted if there is little conservation benefit, feasibility is low, and costs and risks (especially to the wild population) are high. If the decision to implement ex situ management of a species is left until extinction is imminent, it is frequently too late to implement effectively, thus increasing the chance of failure and risking permanent", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85037cf0-6032-4276-ba50-319f5f522758": {"__data__": {"id_": "85037cf0-6032-4276-ba50-319f5f522758", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-species-survival-commission-guidelines-use-ex-situ-management", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN Species Survival Commission guidelines on the use of ex situ management for species conservation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-species-survival-commission-guidelines-use-ex-situ-management", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40ce1b1dc25882dfd99a83f602eef0dfe8224f13cc7ef6a3646f3fe95476fbdb"}}, "hash": "40ce1b1dc25882dfd99a83f602eef0dfe8224f13cc7ef6a3646f3fe95476fbdb", "text": "extinction of the species. This reinforces the need for comprehensive strategic planning for species to be undertaken as early as possible. Documentary evidence of information gathered and decisions made for Steps 1 through 5 is highly important, regardless of whether the decision to proceed with the ex situ management is positive or negative. Archiving of documents in publicly accessible libraries and on public web sites is recommended. 12 SECTION 5: Programme implementation, monitoring, adjustment and evaluation Implementation If a decision is made to establish or continue an ex situ management programme, further considerations that are important in the development of this programme include: \u2022 Actions needed to achieve the identified goals and objectives of the programme should be formulated and implemented (including actions to mitigate the most important risks identified in Step 4). Actions should be specific, measurable, have time schedules attached, and indicate the resources needed and parties responsible for their implementation; \u2022 Data collection and management protocols for all important aspects of the programme should be developed in order to enable adequate monitoring; \u2022 Any ex situ management programme should be developed within national, regional and international conservation infrastructure, recognizing the mandate of existing agencies, legal and policy frameworks, organisational conservation strategies, national biodiversity action plans or existing species recovery plans. Of noteworthy mention in the context of these guidelines are the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the International Agenda for Botanic Gardens in Conservation, the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation, the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, the World Zoo and Aquarium Conservation Strategy, the Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources and the Interlaken Declaration; \u2022 Any ex situ conservation programme should adhere to national and international obligations with regard to access and benefit sharing (as outlined in the CBD); \u2022 The ex situ programme should consult during its planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation stages with all relevant stakeholder groups, professional associations and organisations, both with regard to the indigenous range of the species and the location of the ex situ programme; \u2022 The ex situ programme personnel should stay up to date with relevant scientific work and scientific publications; \u2022 Where multiple bodies such as government agencies, non-government organisations, academia, private organisations, informal interest groups, etc. all have statutory or legitimate interests in an ex situ programme, it is essential that mechanisms exist for all parties to play constructive roles. This may require establishment of special teams working outside formal, bureaucratic hierarchies that can guide, oversee and respond swiftly and effectively as management issues arise. Different parties involved in an ex situ project may have their own mandates, priorities and agendas that need to be aligned through effective facilitation and leadership in order not to undermine the success of the project. A memorandum of understanding with appropriate parties defining the collaboration structure, ownership issues and responsibilities may be beneficial. Inter-project, inter-regional or international communication and collaboration is encouraged as relevant. The programme should consult with external experts as needed; \u2022 The ex situ project should have a clear and appropriate time frame established. Monitoring, adjustment and evaluation There should be regular evaluations of the ex situ programme, not only of its own success, but also of its role within the overall conservation strategy for the species, which is likely to change over time. 13 The management of an ex situ programme is a cyclical process of implementation, monitoring, feedback and adjustment of both biological and non-biological aspects until either the goals are met or the ex situ programme is deemed unsuccessful. Despite thorough planning and design, inherent uncertainty and risk will lead to both expected and unexpected situations. The monitoring is the means to measure the performance of the ex situ programme against objectives, to assess conservation impacts, and provide the basis for adjusting objectives or adapting management regimes or activating an exit strategy. In addition to refining an ongoing ex situ programme, the conclusions from monitoring may guide other ex situ programmes. Adequate resources for monitoring should be part of financial feasibility and commitment. The purpose and duration of monitoring of the ex situ populations and the species\u2019 situation in the wild (especially those aspects that that the ex situ population is trying to address) should be appropriate to each situation. Learning from ex situ conservation programme outcomes can be improved through application of more formal adaptive management approaches, whereby alternative models are defined in advance and are tested through monitoring. This process means that the models used to decide management are based on the best possible evidence and learning.

To contribute to the body of information on, and understanding of, ex situ management for conservation. Collaborative efforts to develop ex situ management science are helped when reports are published in peer-reviewed journals (as an objective indicator of high quality), and include well-documented but unsuccessful ex situ projects or methods as well as successful ones.

The handbook has been developed for three main target groups: \u2022 those who are commissioning an assessment, e.g. senior-level government officials, who need to know what it will entail and what outputs to expect; \u2022 those who are conducting an assessment, i.e. members of the core team, who need to know how to do it; and \u2022 those who are contributing to an assessment, e.g., experts and stakeholders at the national or regional level, who need to know what it involves. This \u2018road-test\u2019 edition of the handbook is being circulated to engage others in the process of learning about \u2013 and improving \u2013 the methodology. A revised version of the handbook will be published at a later date in order to integrate learning from the road-testing process (see page 7 for more details on road- testing ROAM). The handbook includes descriptions of the individual components of ROAM as well as guidance on how they can be combined and sequenced to suit different needs. As these components continue to develop, they are evolving into distinct and well-defined tools. The six main components or tools of ROAM are shown below, together with the location of the current guidance on them. More detailed guidelines on these tools will be produced throughout 2014 and 2015, as part of a forthcoming \u2018ROAM technical series\u2019 of publications.

Preface This handbook comes at an exciting time in the evolution of forest landscape restoration (FLR). Recent developments have seen FLR become widely recognized as an important means of not only restoring ecological integrity at scale but also generating additional local-to-global benefits by boosting livelihoods, economies, food and fuel production, water security and climate change adaptation and mitigation. The 2011 launch of the Bonn Challenge was a key milestone in this regard. The Bonn Challenge serves as an implementation platform for numerous existing international commitments with restoration components, with a goal to restore 150 million hectares globally by 2020. As such, the Challenge seeks to catalyse early action on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as well as action towards achieving Aichi Biodiversity Target 15 on restoration of at least 15 per cent of the world\u2019s degraded ecosystems by 2020, and international goals related to combating desertification and land degradation. The handbook has been developed by our organizations, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the World Resources Institute (WRI), as a contribution to the Global Partnership on Forest Landscape Restoration (GPFLR) and the Bonn Challenge. It sets out the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) for conducting national or sub-national assessments of FLR potential. This methodology has been developed based on pilot national assessments of FLR potential that have taken place in Ghana, Mexico and Rwanda. As we go to press, numerous countries are continuing, starting or planning their own assessments. We hope that this handbook will inform those assessments and, in turn, be informed by them. The handbook will evolve and be updated. We would very much like to hear from those who have conducted assessments \u2013 particularly if they involved adaptations or innovations to the methodology \u2013 so we may continue to share the learning. We will also be complementing the handbook with a series of guidance materials focused on the tools and components of ROAM. For more information, please contact us at gpflr@iucn.org. Julia Marton-Lef\u00e8vre Andrew Steer Director General, IUCN President and CEO, WRI Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 6 7 A rough guide to ROAM The Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) described in this handbook provides a flexible and affordable framework for countries to rapidly identify and analyse forest landscape restoration (FLR) potential and locate specific areas of opportunity at a national or sub-national level. A ROAM application is generally undertaken by a small core assessment team through collaborative engagement with other experts and stakeholders. A national-level assessment typically requires 15-30 days of work by the assessment team spread over a two-to-three month period. ROAM can support the development of national restoration programmes and strategies, enabling countries to define and implement pledges to the Bonn Challenge target (to restore 150 million hectares worldwide by 2020) and thereby meet their existing international commitments under CBD, UNCCD and UNFCCC. Overall, ROAM can be expected to generate the following types of outcomes: \u2022 Better information for improved land-use decision-making; \u2022 High-level political support for FLR; \u2022 Inputs for national strategies on FLR, REDD+, adaptation and biodiversity, among others, and for mutually reinforcing convergence between such strategies; \u2022 A basis for better allocation of resources within restoration programmes; \u2022 Engagement of key policy-makers and decision-makers from different sectors, as well as other stakeholders with interests in how landscapes are managed; and \u2022 Shared understanding of FLR opportunities and the value of multifunctional landscapes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de3654a3-baf2-40c9-b269-820f3a9d4629": {"__data__": {"id_": "de3654a3-baf2-40c9-b269-820f3a9d4629", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A guide to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "968238e48174796115989c7ee150d50f2731c919b6b07b0c7c3de70a819fad14"}, "2": {"node_id": "92a10013-6865-43b6-b116-80e9a3d4dcea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d5a0120a7332a63926a0195b98dd0f5f83b7e9ddbebbb7d79e7aed3e76d9d18"}}, "hash": "33037c73de6967824040f29a871824bdfb064e750ef305e9326db88f3fa81fc0", "text": "ROAM outputs A ROAM application can deliver six main products: \u2022 A shortlist of the most relevant and feasible restoration intervention types across the assessment area \u2022 Identified priority areas for restoration \u2022 Quantified costs and benefits of each intervention type \u2022 Estimated values of additional carbon sequestered by these intervention types \u2022 A diagnostic of the presence of key success factors and identification of strategies to address major policy, legal and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3e8348d-8be8-426e-9760-ae676c076c93": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3e8348d-8be8-426e-9760-ae676c076c93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A guide to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b5ffe654e1941d6a4a40fdc3cc896f06afc8b54263cbc2486a7f194bde2c300"}}, "hash": "3b5ffe654e1941d6a4a40fdc3cc896f06afc8b54263cbc2486a7f194bde2c300", "text": "institutional bottlenecks \u2022 Analysis of the finance and resourcing options for restoration in the assessment area Road-testing Roam This handbook is based on a limited number of experiences in assessing restoration opportunity in a handful of countries.

If you are, you might want to skip ahead to the next chapter. However, if any of this is relatively new to you, this introductory chapter aims to give you a brief explanation of the context and rationale of FLR and the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM). Forest landscape restoration What is forest landscape restoration? Forest landscape restoration is the long-term process of regaining ecological functionality and enhancing human well-being across deforested or degraded forest landscapes. It is about \u201cforests\u201d because it involves increasing the number and/ or health of trees in an area. It is about \u201clandscapes\u201d because it involves entire watersheds, jurisdictions, or even countries in which many land uses interact. It is about \u201crestoration\u201d because it involves bringing back the biological productivity of an area in order to achieve any number of benefits for people and the planet. It is \u201clong-term\u201d because it requires a multi-year vision of the ecological functions and benefits to human well-being that restoration will produce although tangible deliverables such as jobs, income and carbon sequestration begin to flow right away. Successful forest landscape restoration is a forward-looking and dynamic approach, focusing on strengthening the resilience of landscapes and creating future options to adjust and further optimize ecosystem goods and services as societal needs change or new challenges arise. It integrates a number of guiding principles, including: \u2022 Focus on landscapes. Consider and restore entire landscapes as opposed to individual sites. This typically entails balancing a mosaic of interdependent land uses across the landscape, such as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3b985c6-a394-4305-acfc-d96cbaf2e442": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3b985c6-a394-4305-acfc-d96cbaf2e442", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A guide to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e677d3a86b7ebdbb4dbf0d5da0644d2307532cc40fef20899226a5d87b1f0e5"}, "3": {"node_id": "4283d5e0-8350-445a-b9ca-b0e22ce3221a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9bca52af3bbdd5f2fa395f8aa5bf4b5152f42215e5766cc9498dc000dd292b53"}}, "hash": "b3544b1db760a48c4e12e904ba93fc99d4e7dc7cf02b0e0062bcc01e7211ecce", "text": "protected forest areas, ecological corridors, regenerating forests, agroforestry systems, agriculture, well-managed plantations and riparian strips to protect waterways. \u2022 Restore functionality. Restore the functionality of the landscape, making it better able to provide a rich habitat, prevent erosion and flooding and withstand the impacts of climate change and other disturbances. This can be done in many ways, one of which is to restore the landscape \u201cback\u201d to the \u201coriginal\u201d vegetation, but other strategies may also be used. \u2022 Allow for multiple benefits. Aim to generate a suite of ecosystem goods and services by intelligently and appropriately increasing tree cover across the landscape. In some places, trees may be added to agricultural lands in order to Introduction Road-Test Edition 16 17 enhance food production, reduce erosion, provide shade and produce firewood. In other places, trees may be added to create a closed canopy forest capable of sequestering large amounts of carbon, protecting downstream water supplies and providing rich wildlife habitat. \u2022 Leverage suite of strategies. Consider a wide range of eligible technical strategies for restoring trees on the landscape, ranging from natural regeneration to tree planting. \u2022 Involve stakeholders. Actively engage local stakeholders in decisions regarding restoration goals, implementation methods and trade-offs. It is important that the restoration process respects their rights to land and resources, is aligned with their land management practices and provides them benefits. A well-designed process will benefit from the active voluntary involvement of local stakeholders. \u2022 Tailor to local conditions. Adapt restoration strategies to fit local social, economic and ecological contexts; there is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d. \u2022 Avoid further reduction of natural forest cover. Address ongoing loss and conversion of primary and secondary natural forest. \u2022 Adaptively manage. Be prepared to adjust the restoration strategy over time as environmental conditions, human knowledge and societal values change. Leverage continuous monitoring and learning and make adjustments as the restoration process progresses. While FLR sometimes involves the opportunity to restore large contiguous tracts of degraded or fragmented forest land (what we call wide-scale restoration) particularly in less populated areas, the majority of restoration opportunities are found on or adjacent to agricultural or pastoral land. In these situations, restoration must complement and not displace existing land uses; this results in a patchwork or mosaic of different land uses, including for example agriculture, agroforestry systems and improved fallow systems, ecological corridors, discrete areas of forests and woodlands, and river or lakeside plantings to protect waterways.

Wide-scale and mosaic restoration opportunities (photograph from Rwanda, prior to restoration) Most FLR opportunities belong in one of two basic groups. Wide-scale restoration aims to restore or create a landscape that most people would call a forest, whereas mosaic-type restoration aims to restore or create a landscape of multiple land uses, making farmland more productive. In this photograph, the agricultural lands in the foreground represent a mosaic-type restoration opportunity while the forested hills beyond (including the denuded area to the right, where mining has taken place) are better suited for wide-scale restoration.

Forest landscape restoration therefore complements well other approaches to improving food security and climate change mitigation and adaptation, including climate-smart agriculture and REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation).

Figure 2 shows the map produced from this global assessment. There are many compelling reasons to restore such land. The urgent need for better food and water security and more secure livelihoods among forest communities and the growing demand for forest products and bioenergy all underline the need to massively scale-up current restoration efforts. Meeting these needs while also increasing carbon stocks, improving adaptive capacity and addressing the decline in biodiversity cannot be achieved solely by efforts to tackle deforestation. Avoided The global assessment of FLR potential has given a good overview of restoration opportunities; national- level ROAM assessments can provide more detailed, nuanced pictures of what types of restoration interventions would be suitable and where. Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 20 21 FLR and carbon storage Among the multiple benefits that can be delivered by FLR, carbon sequestration and storage is increasingly important. It is already well known that restoring degraded or deforested land can significantly increase the carbon levels in the soil and rehabilitated vegetation. The fact that these carbon gains come on the back of tangible economic and livelihood benefits to communities makes FLR an attractive option for local people as well as an effective means of sequestering carbon and helping slow down climate change. By helping take pressure off existing forests, FLR also helps to avoid the release of carbon stored in these forest ecosystems. While historically FLR initiatives have not focused on carbon sequestration as one of their primary objectives, they have often yielded considerable carbon benefits. The opportunity to sequester carbon can provide additional impetus for FLR efforts, particularly as it delivers a global benefit while also offering additional financial incentives at a local level via, for example, new employment opportunities and increased household income. The level of carbon sequestration achieved by FLR will depend on both the density of carbon in the restored land and the scale of the restoration. Thus, while restoration of closed forest may yield the greatest carbon impact per unit area, restoration of a mosaic landscape using lower tree planting densities (e.g. an agroforestry mix of trees and crops or improved farm fallow practices) can yield a greater mitigation impact overall, due to the significantly larger areas of land involved. The ultimate package of restoration options will depend on the needs and priorities of local people and national government. The point here is that FLR has major potential as a climate mitigation mechanism but if we are to fully realize that potential, interventions must be designed to deliver against a basket of societal needs. While it may appear counterintuitive, the temptation to maximize carbon benefits in any single FLR intervention needs to be resisted. FLR implicitly involves carbon-intensive land stewardship but that seldom means that a successful FLR programme will deliver the absolute maximum amount of carbon that an individual landscape could theoretically deliver. In other words, carbon should be treated as an important and abundant \u2018co- benefit\u2019 of FLR but not the sole objective. FLR and biodiversity Forest landscape restoration has the potential to generate significant biodiversity benefits. In order to maximize this potential, the following issues should be considered: \u2022 The potential of restoration to re-establish connections between different habitats. In many ecosystems there are habitats that have become fragmented as a result of degradation. Restoration can be used to recreate these connections thereby facilitating the movement of species (e.g. during migration). \u2022 The potential of restoration to increase habitat extent. In situations where very little of a given habitat remains or where a habitat has been lost completely, restoration can be used to recreate a semblance of it. \u2022 The potential of restoration to improve habitat quality. Restoration, by ensuring that a greater diversity of species are found in a given habitat, can be used to improve habitat quality. In identifying possible areas for restoration, consideration should be given to opportunities to improve the extent, quality and connectivity of high-biodiversity areas, including areas rich in biodiversity or home to threatened or endangered species, as well as those that deliver important ecosystem services. Better accounting for the potential biodiversity benefits of restoration can help ensure that these biodiversity benefits are optimized. These impacts can include improved provision of ecosystem services (such as water supply, pollination, erosion control or carbon sequestration) and more resilient ecosystems that are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e43d55e8-4928-4865-b8ad-a87f33459903": {"__data__": {"id_": "e43d55e8-4928-4865-b8ad-a87f33459903", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A guide to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f86db2c6d356c61425707011448b561a00816e174a7e231e78d145d254043449"}, "3": {"node_id": "de13cdad-5de6-4b90-bb55-734c353ee052", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "526d42db245f30f099a9fdd3d6be73b28d1446aa5eb6ccabc07cff92de5d3580"}}, "hash": "dcf83c3772bd6c874bdede5b808056fe6023257d6cecb0d91da570b750432176", "text": "better able to cope with stresses and adapt to climate change. In addition accounting for biodiversity in restoration activities can help countries meet their international commitments such as those associated with the CBD Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets. National and sub-national FLR assessments Why look beyond the global level? While the global assessment of FLR potential (mentioned above) provides some indication of the extent and location of areas suitable for restoration within a given country, the constraints inherent in a global assessment (including the low resolution and the inability to use country-specific data) make it of limited use for supporting restoration strategies within countries. The global assessment therefore needs to be refined and improved through national (or sub-national) assessments, the results of which may be quite different from those seen in the global assessment map. See for example the two different images of Mexico\u2019s FLR potential in Figure 3. A national (or sub-national) FLR assessment can: \u2022 Provide missing landscape-level land-use and economic analysis and data that can be used to improve the quality of land-use decision-making and inform possible reforms (e.g. of land tenure or of agricultural and forestry sectors); \u2022 Set the stage for national-level strategies and programmes of work on FLR, sustainable land management and REDD+, by providing a general overview of the priority areas for restoration, the different restoration options available and their relative costs and benefits, and the key stakeholder groups who will need to be involved in any follow-up work on FLR in the country; \u2022 Build high-level support for FLR, by engaging key policy-makers and decision- makers from different sectors as well as other stakeholders with interests in, or influence on, how landscapes are managed; \u2022 Enhance a shared understanding of FLR opportunities and the value of a multi- sectoral, landscape-level approach to restoration, by bringing government agency staff, civil society actors and researchers together to work on the assessment.

Mexico\u2019s FLR potential \u2013 as shown by the global and national assessments 3a. Map of Mexico\u2019s FLR potential, derived from the global assessment Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology ROAM is designed primarily to provide relevant analytical input to national or sub- national policy and operational processes, such as the development of programmes of work related to a national REDD+ strategy, a national adaptation programme of action, a national biodiversity strategy and action plan, or requests for development assistance. In addition, ROAM will often be able to fill in missing information relevant to other national policy priorities, such as rural development, food security or energy supply. Many of these types of policies tend to ignore the potential of degraded or sub-optimally managed land. Essentially, ROAM involves a stepwise and iterative application of a series of analyses to identify the best set of FLR opportunities applicable to the area in question. This stepwise process (which is presented conceptually in Figure 4) is designed to help address the following types of questions: \u2022 Where is restoration socially, economically and ecologically feasible? \u2022 What is the total extent of restoration opportunities in the country/region? \u2022 Which types of restoration are feasible in different parts of the country? \u2022 What are the costs and benefits, including carbon storage, associated with different restoration strategies? \u2022 What policy, financial and social incentives exist or are needed to support restoration? \u2022 Who are the stakeholders with whom we need to engage? It should be noted that none of these questions is of a purely technical nature, easily answered using hard facts and data alone. A good deal of information will need to come from local experts and other stakeholders with first-hand knowledge of the landscapes and livelihoods in the areas being assessed. So those carrying out the FLR assessment will need to use a combination of \u2018best science\u2019 and \u2018best knowledge\u2019 (as illustrated in Figure 5) to obtain accurate, realistic answers. In addition, many of the questions will necessitate discussion, debate and negotiation among the different stakeholders.

Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 26 27 What does a ROAM application involve? Whether undertaken at a national or sub-national level, a ROAM application will generally involve three main phases of work: (1) preparation and planning; (2) data collection and analysis: and (3) results to recommendations. The overall process of ROAM is illustrated in Figure 6. The individual components within this process, and the order in which these steps are undertaken, may vary to some degree from one assessment to another. This handbook provides guidance on each of these components. A national-level assessment typically requires 15-30 days of work by the assessment team spread over a two to three month period. It is preferable to allow time for sufficient engagement with public and private sector actors as well as civil society and local stakeholders. Broader participation in the process is likely to lead to a stronger sense of ownership in the results and better prospects for follow-up. For example, the assessments in Ghana, Mexico and Rwanda all required approximately two to five weeks of activity, spread out over two to four months to allow for wider engagement and to fit in with other commitments of the key participants. Pilot applications In developing and testing this methodological framework, three national assessments were conducted, in Ghana, Mexico and Rwanda. Each of these \u2018pilot\u2019 applications of ROAM was tailored to provide specific analytical insights and policy recommendations based on the best data available, in response to requests from national authorities. In addition to these three cases, a fourth assessment was carried out in Guatemala, based on the Mexico experience. Box 2 briefly describes each of these pilot applications. In choosing these pilot countries, the aim was to cover a wide range of conditions relevant to national assessments, including for example a diversity of biomes and different levels of data availability, to test ROAM\u2019s applicability across these situations. Box 1. Role of ROAM applications in supporting follow-up restoration projects While ROAM applications are not intended to be land-use planning exercises, and are not designed for planning specific restoration projects, they can nonetheless be a useful point of departure for these types of exercises. The assessment map and other outputs will point decision-makers and planners to areas where they are more likely to find restoration opportunities, and will provide preliminary information on how to go about restoration of these areas (including which type of restoration would be most suitable and what costs and benefits would be expected). These inputs would obviously need to be verified and supplemented through further data gathering, consultations and site visits. Figure 6.

In Ghana, a key objective of the assessment was to fill the large gaps in Ghana\u2019s data on the condition of its forest resources. Since little GIS data was available for the spatial analysis and mapping, the assessment relied heavily on the knowledge and expertise of local and national stakeholders. A rapid \u2018knowledge mapping\u2019 approach covering the entire country (nearly 240,000 km\u00b2) was used. The assessment produced a national-level map of FLR potential and supplementary analyses on, for example, the costs and benefits of possible FLR interventions including the potential carbon sequestration benefits. The map and the economic analysis informed Ghana\u2019s successful application for support from the Forest Investment Programme of the World Bank. The assessment results are also being used for high-level decision-making in the forest sector, and have been in constant demand from a range of national and international stakeholders. In Mexico, the main aim of the assessment was to contribute to the development of a cross-institutional national forest landscape restoration strategy for Mexico. A wealth of GIS was available. While the assessment involved broad-based stakeholder involvement in selecting the restoration-relevant criteria to be included, it was based largely on the amalgamation of these existing data (using a \u2018digital mapping\u2019 approach). The geographic scope was national, covering nearly 2 million km\u00b2. This assessment produced a national-level map of priority areas for FLR which is being used by federal institutions to prioritize actions in support of different national objectives and to formulate the national FLR strategy and strengthen existing policy instruments on forest restoration. In Rwanda, the initial impetus for the assessment came from the ambitious commitment, announced by the Government of Rwanda in 2011, to implement forest landscape restoration countrywide by 2035. The main aim of the assessment was therefore to guide the scaling up of Rwanda\u2019s restoration efforts. Extensive GIS data were available for the assessment, so the pre-existing data could be combined with information and analysis provided by the experts and stakeholders involved in the work. The scale of this assessment was much smaller than the other two, reflecting the small size of the country (approximately 26,000 km\u00b2). A series of assessment maps was produced, relating to the eight \u2018best bet\u2019 FLR interventions identified for the country. Additional outputs included, for example, an initial diagnosis of the country\u2019s readiness to implement such a strategy and a preliminary analysis of the resource mobilization options for financing different kinds of FLR interventions. The results of the assessment have been summarized in a presidential briefing and taken up at cabinet level. Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 31 This phase is likely to involve a series of discussions and meetings to help prepare and plan the assessment, culminating in a national inception workshop to share the plan and seek high-level endorsement of the assessment. Defining the problem and FLR objectives In initiating an assessment, the best way to start is to identify a problem statement or specific challenges and a set of higher-order, national or sub-national objectives to which FLR can make a significant and tangible contribution (see some examples of these in Box 3 overleaf). You may find that the problems have been defined already in policy documents, study reports, etc. They would include any major land-use challenges in your country that result from land degradation, erosion, deforestation, declining soil productivity and significant climatic events such as flooding or drought. It is very useful to articulate how the FLR objectives relate to national, sub-national or sectoral policies, bearing in mind that FLR is relevant to multiple sectors. Aligning the FLR objectives with these priorities \u2013 and keeping this alignment in mind throughout the assessment process \u2013 will help ensure the assessment results are relevant and compelling to key decision-making institutions in the country. Figure 7 shows how the assessment team in Rwanda presented the potential contributions of FLR to the country\u2019s key national development targets relating to forest cover, energy production, access to clean water, food production, poverty reduction and per capita GDP.

Road-Test Edition 32 33 Engaging key partners Finding an institutional home for the assessment It is important that the institutional responsibility for leading the assessment be clearly identified. The assessment needs to be given an institutional home in an in-country institution or as a partnership between several institutions. This is important not only for ensuring credibility and follow-up of the assessment\u2019s findings but also for providing the institutional \u2018hub\u2019 around which the multi-sector and multi-stakeholder collaborative approach of the ROAM application can be built. The actual institution(s) involved could be, for example, a government ministry (such as the Ministry of Natural Resources, or the Ministry of Agriculture) a national agency (such as the National Water Authority) or a non-profit or academic technical institution (e.g. a specialist GIS group at the national university). Any one government ministry will not have all the necessary Box 3. Examples of problem statements and objectives for FLR These are some examples of how a problem statement or a statement of FLR objectives could be articulated. Major problems to be addressed: \u2022 Agricultural land is producing poorly due to erosion and insufficient soil water retention \u2022 Coastal areas are being affected by flooding and salinization \u2022 Forest land has been degraded or converted, so that trees have been removed from the landscape \u2022 Forest reserves and national parks have been fragmented by major land-use changes \u2022 Water quality has declined due to excessive run-off and siltation Long-term objectives of FLR: \u2022 Improve the resilience and productivity of vulnerable forest land \u2022 Control erosion and improve watershed management \u2022 Arrest and as far as possible reverse ongoing land degradation \u2022 Improve income flows of people living in these areas \u2022 Conserve biodiversity, new habitats and ecological connections \u2022 Restore natural coastal protection systems \u2022 Improve the provision of environmental services to local, regional and global beneficiaries Make sure that you clearly articulate the problem statement and objectives before presenting them to decision-makers. Avoid the temptation to apply FLR to every national challenge. It is better to limit the problem statement and long-term objectives to those issues that FLR can help address in a concrete and credible manner. Once you have defined the problem and objectives, you will be much better placed to identify which stakeholders need to be involved in the assessment process. technical expertise required to oversee the assessment (due to the multi-sectoral nature of FLR) so if the institutional home is to be based in one specific government agency, it will be particularly important to ensure close collaboration between different ministries and also with other partner organizations. The inception workshop (described on page 51) will be an excellent opportunity to help forge and strengthen these partnerships. Establishing the team to coordinate and lead the assessment Those involved in initiating the assessment will need to convene a team to coordinate and lead the work. This team may involve three to four individuals who will lead most of the work and analysis, supported by a larger number of specialists who will engage on a more periodic basis, providing advice and insight on their particular areas of expertise. While the make-up of the core team will obviously reflect the local situation, our experience shows that the following dedicated skills are very valuable: \u2022 Team leader: a good understanding of national land-use processes including the overall legal, policy and institutional framework; \u2022 An economist; \u2022 A land-use specialist with good understanding of GIS; and \u2022 A social scientist with clear understanding of formal and customary land and resource rights and gender issues and strong facilitation skills. IUCN and WRI can recommend facilitators who have experience in ROAM processes. A list of facilitators can be obtained by contacting: gpflr@iucn.org. Other participants who the assessment team should actively seek to engage can be selected on the basis of their affiliations and skills, including for example: \u2022 Government decision-makers; \u2022 Stakeholder representatives from for example NGOs, farmer associations and local trade associations; \u2022 Technical staff from government, civil society or the private sector with specialist knowledge of, for example, forests, water resources, biodiversity, climate change, agriculture and tenure; and \u2022 Staff from technical support institutions and universities, with skills in, for example, GIS, economic analysis and institutional analysis.

The map of potential priority areas for forest landscape restoration will be used by the participating federal institutions to formulate a national strategy for FLR, aligning the different existing policy instruments that influence forest restoration, and optimizing and focusing their impact. This strategy, once formulated, will also serve as an instrument for the management of local and international financial resources, to fund the restoration initiatives derived from the strategy. Defining the outputs and scope of the assessment Defining the outputs and scope of the ROAM application will be something of an ongoing process during the early stages of the assessment. It will be a matter for discussion not only within the assessment team but also with other experts and stakeholders during the inception workshop (the multi-stakeholder workshop held to launch the assessment \u2013 see page 51). However it is important for the team to go into the inception workshop with a clear idea of what the assessment can practically deliver, given time and resource constraints, as this will help avoid lengthy, open-ended debate on these fundamental matters or the setting of overly ambitious aims. Outputs You will already have a problem statement and long-term objectives for FLR in your country that relate to existing national priorities (see page 31). Now it is time to establish the outputs for the assessment. These outputs will vary from one assessment to the next. Some countries, for example, may wish to simply identify the major areas of degraded land, while others may want to go further, to prioritize these areas and estimate the costs and benefits of possible restoration interventions. The statement of intended outputs should also articulate how the assessment results are intended to lead to specific follow-up actions. One example of a statement of intended output is provided in Box 4. Geographic scope Defining the geographic scale of the ROAM application will involve balancing the scope and ambition of the outputs with the constraints of resources, time availability and delivery deadlines. For example, while the intention may have been to cover the entire country, constraints may allow for only a sub-national assessment at this stage. Alternatively, a preliminary assessment could be made of the whole country, with more detailed assessments carried out in priority regions at a later date. Stratifying the assessment area Most countries contain significant diversity in terms the distribution of major physical, ecological and socio-economic features. There are hills and flatlands, wet forests and dry forests, coastal areas and inland areas, rural areas and peri-urban areas, etc. The assessment team will need to decide how to divide the national or sub-national assessment area into sub-areas (or \u2018strata\u2019), each relatively homogeneous in terms of its restoration-relevant characteristics. This process of stratification will be important later on, as it will enable the analysis to use the same default values (e.g. population growth rates, labour costs and per hectare productivity) for each sub-area. As the process continues the restoration options and characteristics for each geographic sub-area can be analysed, reviewed and refined based on feedback from relevant stakeholders. Be explicit about the \u2018rules\u2019 you put in place to direct the stratification process. The following \u2018rules of thumb\u2019 may be useful: \u2022 Try to respect district boundaries (i.e. don\u2019t split districts across several sub-areas) as the district level tends to be the lowest administrative unit for which restoration- relevant biophysical, institutional and economic data are available. \u2022 At the same time, try to respect agro-ecological zones (i.e. don\u2019t split these zones into several sub-areas) as the agro-ecological conditions will have a strong influence on the relevance and productivity of different restoration options. \u2022 Limit the number of sub-areas by aiming to capture only the major differences in key restoration characteristics, otherwise the assessment will become a cumbersome process. Aim for between five and twelve sub-areas. \u2022 Optimize the size of the sub-areas, avoiding very small ones, and try to keep them all roughly equivalent in size.

Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 38 39 Identifying potential FLR options The team will need to draw up a preliminary list of FLR interventions that, on first analysis, would appear to be the most appropriate for the national situation. Coming up with a limited number of socially appropriate and economically feasible FLR interventions will require several iterations and this will only be finally settled once the results of the biophysical, economic and institutional analyses (later on in the assessment process) and consultations with \u2013 and feedback from \u2013 stakeholders provide the final pieces of the information \u2018jigsaw\u2019. Most likely you will start with a longer \u2013 and quite detailed \u2013 list of locally appropriate interventions and during the assessment several of these options will be combined and some will be discarded. By the end of the process you will probably have a concrete list of between five and fifteen interventions. At this early stage of the process the best way to produce your list of possible interventions is to classify ongoing restoration activities in your country by: (1) those that take place primarily on forest land; (2) those that take place primarily on agricultural land; and (3) those that take place primarily to protect slopes, rivers, wetlands or coastal areas.

Table 3 shows the preliminary list of potential restoration options drawn up in the Rwanda assessment. The types of restoration options identified for the different sub-areas, and the level of priority assigned to these interventions, relate directly to the characteristics of these areas. For example, the high population clusters, steep slopes and high level of erosion vulnerability found in Lake Kivu shore sub-area make agroforestry on terraced land a high priority restoration option for this area. This preliminary listing of 21 options was subsequently reduced to eight, as described later in the handbook (see page 62). Table 2.

Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 42 43 Identifying the assessment criteria and indicators Beyond the limited number of criteria used to guide stratification, the team will need to identify a broader set of assessment criteria that can be used to analyse FLR potential within each sub-area. Importantly, these criteria should be selected on the basis that they can help assess the core issues of a ROAM application: \u2022 The need for FLR; \u2022 The type and potential of appropriate FLR interventions; \u2022 The scope and availability of land for the different intervention types; \u2022 The costs and benefits of potential FLR interventions; and \u2022 The legal, institutional, policy and financial limitations/opportunities. The criteria selected will vary with the particular objectives of the assessment. Thus, for example, if the purpose is to identify restoration opportunities on the basis of the extent of very degraded land, criteria relating to land and soil degradation will suffice. Alternatively, if the purpose is to prioritize FLR options, further criteria will need to be identified, relating to, for example, the availability of land and the feasibility and benefits of FLR in these areas. Table 4 presents some questions, relating to these five factors, which can be considered when identifying assessment criteria, while Table 5 provides some examples of possible criteria and indicators. Table 6 shows the set of criteria and indicators selected for the Mexico assessment. These were defined through a participatory process involving two separate technical workshops. In the Mexico case, the selection of indicators was based on what cartographic data were available to reflect the chosen criteria. Table 4. Some guiding questions to help direct the identification of assessment criteria Layers of analysis Need for FLR based on existing national priorities Type and potential of appropriate FLR interventions (to address needs) Scope and availability of land, by FLR intervention type Economic costs and benefits of potential FLR interventions Legal, institutional, policy and financial limitations/ opportunities Possible questions to guide selection of assessment criteria What parts of the area are in need of, or would benefit from, restoration? What types of restoration would be most appropriate and most needed? What needs could they help address? What intervention types would be suitable where? What is the overall potential coverage of each intervention type? What types of land tenure regimes are in place? What are the government policies or strategies for these areas? Are land owners and land users interested in restoration? Are there any commercial or community interests in the area? Are there any conflicting interests? How much would these potential interventions cost, overall and by intervention type? What economic benefits could they deliver? To whom? Over what time frame? Which of the existing policy and institutional ar- rangements are conducive to restoration? Which create barriers to restoration? What financing sources are available or could be secured?
