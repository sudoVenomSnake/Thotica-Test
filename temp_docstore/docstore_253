turing nor FDI have always been accompanied with economic growth. Latin America is a case in point. Akyuz (2004) discusses the limits to focusing on export-led industrialization extensively, and points to the rising ratio of manufactured exports to GDP in developing countries without a significant upward trend in the ratio of manufacturing value-added to GDP. As put by Akyuz: In major exporters of manufactures in the South, export values have constantly exceeded manufacturing value-added during the past two decades, and the gap has increased further as exports have grown faster. Thus, the increase in the share of developing countries in world manufacturing exports has not been accompanied by a concomitant increase in their shares in world manufacturing value added. These comparisons relate to value-added generated in developed and developing countries, rather than incomes earned from manufacturing activi- ties. The value-added left in developing countries is smaller and the income earned by industrial countries is larger if account is taken of profits earned by [transnational corporations] on their investment in developing countries (pp. 9-10). Overdependence on foreign resources from exports implicitly requires the assumption that external demand will always exist. Foreign resources for domestic capital accumulation may not always be available when the receiving country needs the investment in particular sectors of industry. This is a very bold assump- tion given that globalization has been integrating many outsiders into the system rather quickly.24 Debates on this issue go back to Nurkse\u2019s theoretical discussion on development from the 1950s.25 Based on the pos- sibility that foreign resources might be insufficient, Nurkse\u2019s theory points out the significance of industrializa- tion depending on domestic market expansion as a better strategy. Domestic demand is certainly a crucial factor, but how to turn an export-driven growth into growth that depends on domestic demand becomes very important at this point. Moreover, there would not be any motivation to invest if there is no demand in an economy. Thus, demand-centered policies are also important. The significance of domestic demand with respect to domestic investment in capital accumulation is critical for a FG pattern of development. This is also mentioned in Akamatsu\u2019s original contribution. Growth in domestic demand proves to be a strong policy for rising employment as well. For instance, estimates show that Chinese export growth over the period 1997-2002 contributed to 2.5 million jobs per year (Feenstra and 23 Backward linkages refer to the purchases of primary supplies (for example, raw materials), secondary supplies (for example, semi-finished products), and tertiary supplies (for example, services such as packaging). Forward linkages imply the marketing and distribution of goods and services in the local economy (UNCTAD 2001). 24 See Blecker and Razmi (2007) for a detailed discussion of a fallacy of composition outcome of the export-led industrialization when all developing countries are specialized in manufactured exports. Price competition led by the growth of output in developing countries has significant effects on the short-run growth of output in developing countries that are specialized in manufactured exports. The study pres- ents estimations showing that depreciation relative to competing developing country exporters increases the home country\u2019s growth rate at the expense of its competitors\u2019 growth. The authors suggest that real depreciations might be contractionary for some major manufacturing exporters.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3fd920c6-96bf-4c53-89d2-abeb62a90e0e": {"__data__": {"id_": "3fd920c6-96bf-4c53-89d2-abeb62a90e0e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Potential for Cooperative Regional Industrial Development Strategies in Asia and the Implications of Emerging China and India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "042b949499e7181cf09404d7f02c204d4b76b7157ef584394febec4f224c5c5d"}, "2": {"node_id": "adf34d9f-6394-44f8-b72e-c1513b21ed4a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bb397e4ea3d33ef4f33af72db7a3484b67232ecd2a03a67221eac284bb018c64"}}, "hash": "977ce71938cb2a7a2d2cb90ed8dbb19e1b7b485b8ec7487dd2f93c2192624589", "text": "The authors suggest that real depreciations might be contractionary for some major manufacturing exporters. 25 See Kregel (2007) on Nurkse and the role of finance in development. 34 Hong 2007).

As Lall (2000) puts it: It is important for countries to secure not just more, but also higher quality FDI. This means attracting more advanced [multinational corporation] activities, oriented to international mar- kets, providing advanced technology, using and creating sophisticated skills, and taking the host economy into a dynamic system of international production (p. 338). Selective targeting policy, which has been emphasized repeatedly in development, has raised attention to this new conceptualization of FDI inflows from a qualitative approach. Criteria such as knowledge intensity and provisioning of resources for innovation have formed new policy measures for FDI. As expected, high quality FDI has stronger backward and forward linkages leading to faster economic growth. In implementa- tion of these policy measures RTAs and BTAs might again play a significant role. As pointed out by Shrank (2003), regional development needs the integrated efforts of both sides of an investment. Third, the breakdown of FDI inflows by different sectors is another key issue. For instance, the composi- tion of China\u2019s FDI outflows have been similar to those of the Republic of Korea during the period 1988-2002, and to Japan\u2019s outflows during the period 1968-1982, targeting resource-rich regions/countries in Latin America and Africa (see Tables 2.6 and B.3). Hong and Sun (2004) suggest that existing FDI patterns in the region provide supporting evidence for a FG pattern. However, such FDI outflows are conditioned on being resource-rich, and this develops a challenge for non\u2013resource rich neighboring economies. It is important to note that investment decisions are made by firms; similarly, external trade is pursued by exporting/importing firms, not by the governments. We do observe shifts in the composition of FDI outflows from China towards the services sector similar to what has been happening elsewhere over the last decade. Furthermore, spatial dualities, particularly in the Chinese economic structure, cannot be ignored. An implicit assumption behind FG-consistent FDI flows is the immobility of labour among different countries; thus, a country moves its labour intensive industries to another country. In China, despite some recent developments in labour regulations, the mobility of labourers is still limited. Accordingly, the gap in production costs due to the immobility of labour among different re- gions of the country partly explains the changing direction of capital flows from coastal areas to the inner land areas. Zhang (2007) shows evidence for a declining trend in the inner-coastal differences in capital formation since 2000. On the other hand, this might turn out to be a challenge for the close-by neighbors with respect to FDI potential. In general, we do see a FG pattern of development in FDI together with emerging China and India; however, one should consider that distance does matter greatly. The theory of economic geography presents some possibilities for neighboring countries located close by. Given the long distances between the coastal and inner regions of China, cheaper transportation costs make it plausible to see a change in the direction of FDI outflow towards these nearby neighbors rather than to the inner regions. With the rise of China and India, there are other benefits to exploit besides trade-related gains. How- ever, their rise also creates challenges, especially for relatively slow growing developing nations in the region. Nevertheless, research on regional integration processes in Asia indicates a wide range of opportunities for all as long as the momentum of economic integration is strong and political will is there. A full and robust integration clearly requires conscientious efforts from all related parties. 35 The general objective of this study is to explore whether there exists a potential for a FG pattern of develop- ment in the Asia-Pacific region within a regional integration process. More specific objectives include providing a framework to carry out the analysis and to pursue empirical assessments of the recent patterns of growth, trade, and investment flows, with a particular emphasis on emerging China and India. The fact that China and India have joined the successor geese family raises the question of whether other neighboring nations should worry about this development. In this respect, we seek to learn what are the possible opportunities and challenges for the countries in the region. In this study we propose a dynamic tool to examine the country sophistication level of exports. We look at whether there exist FG-consistent shifts in the countries\u2019 trade structure over time, and we explore the dynamic shifts in the division of labour among the nations in the region based on an empirical analysis of the sophistication indices of exported goods.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08785db8-7876-4819-b14d-baa701417fb6": {"__data__": {"id_": "08785db8-7876-4819-b14d-baa701417fb6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Potential for Cooperative Regional Industrial Development Strategies in Asia and the Implications of Emerging China and India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "110f71c86b677147bea19c96f0c29c374c1c28b207aff293569f5c005047f50c"}, "3": {"node_id": "4bbea878-05a6-401c-a148-dd99478e3abd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11e84be0ed8e8b758e9160cc8c6e37c16853e8a519c4d3f57832e2245b97bf78"}}, "hash": "fe8fb5529c046f619d0e24cb66b9bd18d3700fc888ca4b3caf90dd19d733476b", "text": "Recasting the FG framework through sophistication curves, we have found that the evolution of the trade structure in the region over the last decade is consistent with a FG pattern of development. We assert that opportunities are available for other developing nations to benefit from increasing trade and investment potential that accompany the growing absorption capacities of emerging China and India. Nevertheless, these opportunities come with challenges, particularly for the slower-growing economies. These developing economies should pay attention to the following points: \uf06c The evolution of a FG pattern needs a holistic approach to regional integration through policies directed at trade, industrialization, and, hence, development. \uf06c The regional integration process should not only consider changes in trade policies, but the process needs to be evaluated using both quantitative and qualitative measures. \uf06c FG-consistent development includes an external trade policy, which is supported by a robust public policy along with an industrial policy. This has important implications for a human development-oriented approach to trade. \uf06c Domestic demand plays an important role in a FG pattern of development. Strong domestic demand establishes the required motivation for domestic investment and attracts FDI. \uf06c Latecomers following China and India should pay more attention to developing domestic demand, given that the transfer of labour-intensive jump-start industries from China and India, with their huge labour reserves, might take quite a long time. 5. Conclusion 36 \uf06c The criteria for receiving high-quality FDI inflows should include qualitative measures along with exist- ing quantitative measures. High-quality FDI is necessary for a country ultimately to join the process of an FDI-led FG pattern of development. The framework we propose here provides an initial step and a methodology for evaluating trade out- comes from an industrial development perspective. A more detailed analysis is required to explore the human development impacts of the regional shifts discussed here. In line with Akamatsu\u2019s argument for an extensive exploration of the process of industrial development, one needs to investigate the historical, political, and institutional structure of an economy in a regional development context. Further research could also focus on forming multi-dimensional sophistication indices to get a better picture of export dynamics. Analysis at more disaggregated levels of industries for an individual country could provide additional insights. These would require a more focused research, which would include the specifics of the changing social, political, institutional, and economic conditions of the individual countries of concern. 37 References Ahearne, A.G., Fernald, J.G., Loungani, P., and J.

Akamatsu (1962) extends his analysis through two variants of the fundamental wild-geese flying pattern: the development of the industrial structure from less sophisticated goods to more sophisticated ones, and the development of relatively less advanced economies turning into advanced economies. This latter has been the central issue in the discus- sions on economic development within the framework of regional economic development. There are three strands of research in the literature, each of which extends Akamatsu\u2019s framework. While the first strand of these contributions discusses the framework within a theory of industrial develop- ment, the second reproduces Akamatsu\u2019s statistical analysis of the patterns, and pursues empirical testing of the framework. The last strand takes a critical view with respect to the validity or applicability of the FG pattern of development. Whether critical or not, this strand raises attention to the framework and underlines its importance to understanding the dynamic shifts in the regional division of labour. The following discussion prepares the groundwork to recast the FG pattern of development with a brief review of selected studies illustrating the three strands. Kojima (1960, 2000) focused on the international spread of the FG pattern as a policy framework. His most extended model of the FG pattern of development (Kojima model III, see Box A.2) has important impli- cations for the cooperative relations among Japan, first-tier countries, and second-tier countries, as well as China. He predicts that the region\u2019s FG framework type of development will spread to new members, such as Cambodia, Lao PDR, India, Pakistan, and Viet Nam, as well as the Democratic People\u2019s Republic (DPR) of Korea (Kojima 2002; 13). Kojima argues that for this to happen there is a vital need for the establishment of an Asian Economic Community (AEC), including the establishment of an Asian Monetary Fund, which should promote a \u201cfunctional regional integration.\u201d His definition of functional regional integration, however, goes beyond liberalization of trade and investment structure. Through integration, member economies can improve their industrial and production structure in terms of technological capacity as well as production and manage- ment systems. Trade liberalization is crucial to expanding trade within and outside the region, he argues, but this should not exclude nurturing infant industries by temporary protection. According to Kojima (2002), functional regional integration should bring not only economic benefits, but also improvements in political and social institutions to the whole region (p. 26). Only in this way will development in the region continue to spread successfully in line with the FG framework.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44131ea1-8a12-4086-aaf6-85d0b5535f2f": {"__data__": {"id_": "44131ea1-8a12-4086-aaf6-85d0b5535f2f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Potential for Cooperative Regional Industrial Development Strategies in Asia and the Implications of Emerging China and India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5e94038a7083f887518f1abe0ed173bec1aa7d403c0114892dccaea670b08e1a"}, "2": {"node_id": "0d2195b3-3427-48ff-b3fe-f3b903d5007b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3f327751cc3a63178a915f177fd376a3b16b920ff0468afa5d13650f24117551"}}, "hash": "2fe2702ec2c737e4f56e71c1ef28450c7ef80356b36861467df69900cd20eedb", "text": "42 Box A.1 Akamatsu\u2019s wild-geese flying pattern Akamatsu (1962) sketches a wild-geese flying pattern of development based on the similarity of the import, production, and export curves to geese flying in an orderly rank, forming an inverse V as depicted in Figure A.1. Three main observations can be made from this figure: \uf06c In all industries there is a sequential order from imports to domestic production to exports. \uf06c The start of imports of crude goods precedes the time for the imports of refined goods; in other words, imports of capital goods come after the imports of consumer goods. \uf06c The import curve shows a decline with the rise in domestic production, and the export curve slopes down (sooner or later) when the industry matures, depending on the characteristics of the goods. Figure A.1 Wild-geese flying pattern Source: Figure 1 in Akamatsu (1962, p. 12).

Akamatsu also formulates a modified version of the single industry development into a regional development type. He describes the historical pattern of economic growth in developing countries similar to the historical stages of an industry. In the modified version of Akamatsu\u2019s framework, the first stage corresponds to the phase during which a developing country imports manufactured goods from advanced countries in exchange for raw materials. The second stage consists of the rise of the domestic production of the imported consumer goods. The third stage refers to the phase when the domestic sector turns into an export sector. The fourth and last stage stands for the emergence of capital goods\u2019 production in the domestic market as well as reverses in the importing of consumer goods. 43 Box A.2 Kojima\u2019s FDI-led FG pattern of development Kojima introduces three theoretical pillars for the FG pattern. The first pillar refers to industrial upgrading, which is based on the accumulation of capital. This he calls Kojima model I: industrial upgrading from labour- intensive to labour-saving industries stimulated by technological progress and rapid accumulation of capital via a high savings ratio. The second pillar puts emphasis on industrial upgrading through FDI, assuming that FDI is pro-trade in his terms. Trade-oriented FDI refers to the flows from comparatively disadvantaged indus- tries in the investing country into comparatively advantaged industries of the host country (Kojima 2000, p. 383). He also discusses the spillover effects created by FDI and possible backward and forward linkages that contribute to the host economy supporting their climb up the development ladder. More specific to the regional extension of the FG pattern, Kojima (2000, p. 386-388) introduces a third model: Kojima model III \u2014 a theory of agreed specialization, which puts particular emphasis on the post- homogenization stage of the economies in order to induce relief from trading wars. The basis of his argu- ment is the need for intra-industry trade promotion when the trade and production structure of integrated economies become quite similar. At this point de facto agreed specialization can be observed within firms; and Kojima suggests that trade and investment activities can be pursued under such agreed specialization. Rising China and India: Are geese still flying? In contrast to the positive view of Asian regional development provided by Kojima (2002), given the recent dynamics in the region, questions have been raised about whether the geese are still flying.26 Emerging China and India, with their particular economic structures, are at the center of the discussion. A growing number of studies have suggested the FG view of the regional economies should instead be characterized as \u201csitting ducks\u201d (Ahearne et al. 2006). China\u2019s huge pool of cheap labour and the undervaluation of its currency rela- tive to other economies in the region form the basis for this view. Thus, there are now two opposing views: While some studies present empirical evidence consistent with the FG pattern (Rose 2007; Kwan 2002), others discuss a shifting pattern from a Japan-led to a China-centered formation (Xing 2007). Ahearne et al. (2006) argue that the two polar views do not do justice to the rapidly evolving trade relationships among Asian economies (p. 2). The authors suggest that Chinese export growth and other Asian economies move together. They both depend on common shocks, confirming the relative importance of foreign income, along with exchange rates, in the determination of export growth. Ahearne et al. also argue that recent dramatic changes in trade shares are consistent with the FG pattern, i.e., a pattern in which China moves into the product space vacated by the first-tier economies, with greater integration of trade across the region in production networks. Evidence of China gaining market share across the globe despite the declining share of other Asian economies is in line with what the second-tier countries experienced earlier on, when they took their place in a number of industries at the expense of the first-tier. Thus, rather than indicating a disruption, Ahearne et al. accept the second view and lay the groundwork for a FG-consistent pattern of Asian development (p. 3).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "45bd1d1f-2a18-44f9-87ee-5018671e60d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "45bd1d1f-2a18-44f9-87ee-5018671e60d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Potential for Cooperative Regional Industrial Development Strategies in Asia and the Implications of Emerging China and India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "889912327c340e27fd48075da45e7eb4ba53570453caa0f0609491995083ac6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "3ea01b56-b649-4200-93bb-1c9e36c1b578", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df5917ff6b1b011cbbe387b1e7baf071094f8aeac496ee6691301ecf5d62109a"}}, "hash": "dbd91aa768d8fe043e8b6245d2fd8e2c7aa704e8156c381108a5453d0159d607", "text": "3).

Whether or not the rise of China is a zero-sum game depends on whether one looks at the outcome of the FG pattern over a short-term or long-term time span. For instance, Holst and Weiss (2004) raise attention to the rivalry between ASEAN countries and China in the short-run. On the other hand, others point out the possible opportunities for economic growth in the long-term, if the necessary steps are taken at the policy level (Batra 2006; Holst and Weiss 2004; Tambunan 2006; De Castro 2006). 26 For more extensive discussions on the issue, please refer to Kwan (2002), Ahearne et al. (2006), and Rose (1997). 44 Flying geese critique The validity of the FG framework of development has been criticized at two different levels, one empirical and the other theoretical. Empirical contributions commonly share the argument that FG model predictions do not materialize in all cases. For instance, Bernard and Ravenhill (1995) argue that manufacturing exports in Southeast Asia emerged without passing through import-substitution industrialization, unlike what hap- pened in the Republic of Korea and Taiwan (PoC). In addition, they show that the reverse importing phase has not been observed in Japan, despite FG predictions. Using as an illustration the production networks in the microelectronics industry as well as the simultaneous boom within the sector across the region, they assert that any research on the recent developments and changes in production relations within the region should focus on production networks, particularly on the relations and linkages between states and local and transnational firms. Similarly, Tung (2003) analyzes international fragmentation of production and product differentiation against the validity of the FG pattern. More specifically, Tung points out that the FG framework does not hold in specific industries when analyzed at the disaggregated level; the electronics industry is one such example. However, we should mention that Kojima (2000) counter-argued these points, demonstrating that Tung and others are incorrectly identifying the FG pattern with the product-cycle theory. Ginzburg and Simonazzi (2005) cite different reasons why the FG pattern fails to explain developments in the electronics sector. They present: a.) the declining ratio of value added that retains from exports within the country, and b.) motivations to lower the costs of pollution created by industries in advanced countries as the determining factors behind FDI flows, rather than FG motivations. They introduce a different reformula- tion of the framework whereby the delocalization of different stages of production across national boundaries is prominent. At the theoretical level, the FG framework has been criticized by its inability to explain the complexities of the structure of the production linkages and their transformation in Asia. Bernard and Ravenhill (1995) call the recent attempts on FG modeling at best a gross oversimplification of the interrelated complications of an industrial development process. The FG model, they argue, is an ahistoric description of the transformations in production, such as the flow of a single commodity from one place to another, isolated from all other changes. Each country experiences the industrialization process at a different historical time under differ- ent social, political, institutional, and economic conditions, which should be included in any analysis of the regional hierarchy among different countries. Similarly, Amsden (1991) argues that development cannot be just based upon a regional division of labour with regional externalities. Rather, there is a need to explore the late industrializers\u2019 development through a general institutional model covering a theory of the specific conditions for specific cases. Amsden also questions the validity of the FG framework, suggesting the Latin American region as a counter example to such a model. The fact that the Latin American experience is characterized by less dynamic FDI coming in the form of subsidiaries from the United States is one reason why the FG framework cannot explain the in- dustrial development in that region. This nature of FDI, as argued, reinforces the bias towards inward-looking industrialization without improving international competitiveness.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a7f56aa-44c4-4845-910e-322fcc269f6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a7f56aa-44c4-4845-910e-322fcc269f6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Potential for Cooperative Regional Industrial Development Strategies in Asia and the Implications of Emerging China and India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49db73519cb7aea93bc40396bfca6e18b6458bfb67c09e0c2dbc19c557279cc3"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba69481a-a088-4c16-b119-825863b9400f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3e5667c14e6a5749011d3c560787cf95e319146ed177f608c9b2609ef995eb24"}}, "hash": "0f3ca259418f80c7b3cfe0825387d642139062afb3ea51173402b3db1e98fd22", "text": "It is important to emphasize at this point that a FG framework does not encompass only a harmoni- ous movement of sectors from less comparative advantage areas to others, recently termed as \u201crecycling of comparative advantage\u201d; rather, it has a dimension of conflict by which \u201c\u2026local producers find themselves in a death struggle against imports and \u2018pour their hearts\u2019 into copying foreign goods and inventing new ones to win the upper hand over imports\u2026\u201d (Rowthorn 1996: p. 38).

Unlike various interpretations of the FG pattern presented as a smooth spread of industrial upgrading, the FG framework in its original version is seen as embodying rather complicated aspects of the process of industrial development within each country and in a regional context.

First, we calculate the product sophistication index for each export product (SP). We then use the product sophistication indices to calculate a sophistication index for the whole export structure of a country (SC). Step 1: Assuming that highly sophisticated products are exported by high-income countries and lower ones are exported more by low-income countries, a product sophistication index (SP) is calculated for each product (i) exported across the globe. This index uses the shares of each country (j) in global exports, calculated as the ratio of total exported value of a product (i) in country (j) (Xij) to the total value of world exports of that product (Xi) while taking the weighted average of these shares using GDP per capita (Yj) of each exporting country as weights: (1) Step 2: Assuming that the higher the advancement level of the export structure of a country the higher the share of highly sophisticated products (i.e., high-technology, high value-added manufacturing goods), a country sophistication index for country (j), SCj is the share of each country\u2019s manufactured exports (Xj i) in total global manufactured exports (Xj) as weighted by SPi: (2) This allows us to compare the index level of each country, which corresponds to the mean of the distri- bution of sophistication indices of all exported products. We followed Kwan\u2019s (2002) calculation for the most part, but our indices carry some differences, as follows: \uf06c Kwan uses US imports as a proxy for world exports. In this paper we use countries\u2019 exports to the world to calculate SPi and SPj because US imports do not constitute a good proxy for total exports for some of the countries in the region. 50 \uf06c In terms of GDP per capita, we use per capita GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) rather than the nomi- nal values. Significance of the GDP levels of exporting countries in determining SPi reveals the implica- tions of using a price-adjusted measure. Since per capita GDP (PPP) provides a standard separated from price disparities of the same product, we believe this prevents any variation in SPi caused by differences in the price of corresponding goods in different countries. Since these price disparities are observed more in non-tradable sectors, excluding them by using PPP is crucial, as our study covers trade-related sectors. \uf06c Kwan calculates SPi by repeating Step 1 (above) for each year covered in his analysis. Thus, the resulting index for each product is not fixed over time. In that case, when the exporting country\u2019s share stays the same between two consecutive periods we might still observe shifts in the distribution structure due to the changes in the performance of the exporting economies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "432b794c-d3d8-42da-830b-e0d538b33efd": {"__data__": {"id_": "432b794c-d3d8-42da-830b-e0d538b33efd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Potential for Cooperative Regional Industrial Development Strategies in Asia and the Implications of Emerging China and India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab4f632137e6cb882f9fef383c79cb80fc9128fef2abc281387c7106c0c88b76"}, "2": {"node_id": "12c88077-610f-4a36-9d44-13f5dbafbfa1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/potential-cooperative-regional-industrial-development-strategies-asia-and-implications-emerging-china-and-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc04b763b278e7db7814a77dbdfce9a6a67825ad8bc252bb51d1df74645a63a2"}}, "hash": "5b1925883fba534354aa1df252eb9467142ca4f9a3731b40e22893fd13e47bcb", "text": "In other words, a comparison of distribu- tion of the sophistication indices between two points in time might, on one hand, reflect the changes in the export structure of an economy and, on the other hand, reflect the changes in the GDP levels of the main exporting economies if the GDP of different years are used. Thus, changes in GDPs over time can make a significant difference in the advancement level of the exports and, accordingly, the economy. Let us explain the underlying logic behind our third modification with an example. Suppose we would like to compare the distribution of export sophistication indices for country A in 2000 and 2005. Assume that country A\u2019s cumulative GDP growth rate adds up to 20 percent over the six years but that export shares for all goods stay the same.

This shift might be considered a structural shift in exports in terms of the advancement level of products, leading us to think that it is an FG-consistent shift; and, in fact, this might be true as long as GDP growth reflects the changes in the sophistication level of exports. However, GDP growth might overestimate the implications of any struc- tural shift. On rather different grounds, both shifts can be argued as significant indicators of a FG framework. Nevertheless, a decomposition of each effect on the indices is required in order to understand better the underlying dynamics. For this reason, in our second step calculations we, unlike Kwan, include the calculated for a single year \u2014 not for each year \u2014 and use it as a proxy for the average of sophistication indices of the exported goods over the period of analysis. Because we present snapshot descriptions over a 10-year period, the mid-year\u2019s indices best serves for our purpose. It is possible to argue that growth performance over time comprises one important aspect of the FG pattern of development, yet our indices will not include them due to the reasons explained above. This is the limitation and the scope of the empirical methods introduced in this paper. Pros and cons of sophistication indices As any other summary statistic, the method we use has both pros and cons. First, unlike the current industry classification standards, which limit the sophistication content of products into a limited number of groups, the sophistication index enables us to analyze the product characteristics in a wider range with relative or- dering of each product. The sophistication index removes the binary characterization of technology-based classifications. It also has the advantage of providing unique continuous scores for each product at any level, involving a quite detailed range of products. Second, analyzing the product characteristics based on the average income of exporting economies captures more than just technical characteristics. Product sophistication goes beyond \u201cfactor intensity com- parisons\u201d proposed by the conventional international trade theory as a major theoretical pillar. Factors such as differentiation, susceptibility to fragmention of the process of production, resource availability, and others are also important in terms of trade performance, as mentioned by Lall, Weiss, and Zhang (2006). The sophistica- tion index contains more information in this respect compared to conventional measures. 51 Third, there exists a recent finding on the close correlation between the quality of export products and growth performance (Hausman et al. 2006). This shows that sophistication indices, by measuring the quality of exports, can predict subsequent economic growth, which has important implications in terms of the FG pattern of development, which is at the centre of the current study. With respect to the shortcomings of our method: first, unlike RCA, SP does not provide information about relative specialization of an economy\u2019s export structure. Second, as with any other one-dimensional index, it is not possible to disentangle the structural shifts in exports unless it is reflected in the level of sophis- tication; i.e., moving from textiles to low-tech machinery exports that have similar SPs may not be captured. If possible, a multidimensional sophistication index might preclude any such potential drawbacks, and the points raised here partly lay the groundwork for recommendations for further research presented in the last section of this paper.

When countries enter into export-driven industrialization, often the first commodities they produce are labour-intensive, non-durable products, such as textiles and garments. Lack offoreign exchange and access to credit can limit the volume of industrial capitals in the countries. A large reserve army of labour contributes to keep the average wage level low. Growth of the labour-intensive sectors has been a stepping stone towards economic development in Asia as the success cases of East and Southeast Asian countries illustrate. Some Asian LDCs have already joined this development path. Labour-intensive sectors such as ready-made garments have been providing a regular income to millions, especially women with no or little education, who would otherwise still be excluded from participating in income-generating activities. Many of them send part of their income to their families in rural areas. A majority of the remittances are used to purchase of basic necessities and agricultural inputs, for education fees for siblings, and repayment of debts by their families. Although remittances from migrants in abroad have been regarded by some as a key to poverty reduction, job creation in home countries brings other benefits. For example, the indirect jobs are also created near the factories as the demand for housing, services, dining, and transportation arises with the number of manufacutring jobs created. With the end of quota-based trade on textiles and clothing, the LDC exporters of these products are in need of export diversification so as to reduce the negative impacts generated by trade liberalization, if any. Diversification also has a positive impact on the economic growth. A cross-country study shows that export diversification is positively associated with the growth in per capita GDP (Raihan 2007). Diversification of industry portfolios that leads to job growth should be of particular interest to countries where there is a high demand for job creation. Prospects for export diversification A series of studies in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Nepal, commissioned by UNDP, have identified the production of specific goods and services, which will not only enhance export potential but which will also have high human development benefits. Selection of sectors were based on the following criteria: revealed comparative advantage; export prospects and their sustainability; use of local inputs; and potential for creating employment, particularly for women and other disadvantaged segments of the society. Use of local inputs is important for creating backward linkages and higher value-added in the economy. Employment creation, especially in rural areas, is crucial in the view of human development and sustainable development. The selected sectors which are common among these four countries are food processing, handicrafts, herbs and herbal products, and tourism. www.undprcc.lk 1 Toward Export Diversification Given their richness in biodiversity and the climatic conditions, these countries have a great potential for producing high-value added products such as organic products and herbal extracts or medicinal plants. Cultural diversity in these countries also provides an enriched variety of handicrafts in materials and design. Many of these products are unique to their locality and may be eligible for Geographical Indication protection, which can result in higher premiums to producers. Having a number of the World Heritage sites, national parks and cultural heritage, these countries have a great potential to pursue tourism for sustainable development. Tourism can also provide markets for handicrafts and processed food as souvenirs or to be consumed at hotels and restaurants. For better industrial policy environment: Issues and policy options for Asian LDCs One of the main factors in determining the prospect of increased exports as well as investment from both domestic and foreign investors is the socio-economic environment that influences returns from investment. Macro-economic instability, poor infra structural facilities, and deteriorating law and order are a few examples, which can hamper the profitability of investment. Better trade and an improved industrial policy environment for businesses, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in rural areas, is essential to export diversification for sustainable development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5dca5a9d-3e32-4d8a-ab38-aff307c7765a": {"__data__": {"id_": "5dca5a9d-3e32-4d8a-ab38-aff307c7765a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/toward-export-diversification-trade-and-industrial-policy-environment-asian-ldcs-joint-policy-brief-issue-2", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Toward Export Diversification: Trade and Industrial Policy Environment in Asian LDCs - Joint Policy Brief Issue 2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/toward-export-diversification-trade-and-industrial-policy-environment-asian-ldcs-joint-policy-brief-issue-2", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f9c8e023a101ce84a2a47e6fae86dd4d7dc5e62b56995d69845f7862ebbf0a6"}, "2": {"node_id": "dfbf8a93-ecfa-4f49-98da-8b522ddeca3d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/toward-export-diversification-trade-and-industrial-policy-environment-asian-ldcs-joint-policy-brief-issue-2", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab8fa1cacbf44e68bba5be5fb5a384351f5c1036d225dfd016d2c61dbb52e008"}}, "hash": "cf0ad323b3f05ffdbc3c95083d9fbfc9fca3b14e4011c8dbdca409e90483f217", "text": "Major structural barriers and supply-side constraints need to be removed.

Lack of access to finance also hinders the prospect of accessing better technology, which may eventually result in reduced productivities of firms and industries. The problem is severe particularly for the SMEs, including those in the export-oriented Issue 2 June 2008 sectors. High interest rates and a lack of collateral in the form of land and buildings for advancing loans are found to be bottlenecks for SMEs trying to access formal credit channels. Banks are hesitant or unwilling to lend to SMEs as they do not consider them to be attractive and profitable undertakings. A number of micro-finance institutions (MFls) have provided small loans to SMEs and farmers but their interest rates are often higher than commercial banks partly due to the high operation costs of MFls. In the case of Cambodia, the interest rates charged by MFls are 3-3.5 percent per month - very high by international standards and relative to business profitability in rural areas (EIC 2007). Most MFls have failed to raise resources locally; as a result, MFls depend on funding from overseas banks. An increase in local saving and deposits for MFls is crucial for the sustainable financing of small enterprises in Cambodia. Promotion of savings and deposit accounts and diversification of saving and deposit options are possible tools to increase local funding at MFls. SME's enhanced access to loans from commercial banks should be achieved. Development of an effective SME financial reporting system and a credit information sharing system can assist the goal. Sound monetary policy is a key for the LDCs to keep inflation rate - and thus interest rates - low. Better infrastructure Weak physical infrastructure appears to plague trade and industrial development in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Nepal. Proper infrastructure and reliable services are vital for connecting all the players along the value chain and ensuring a smooth delivery of the final goods to the markets. Investment in roads, railways, waterways, ports, telecommunications and basic utility services such as electricity and water will assist industries to improve their competitiveness by cutting lead time and production costs. A survey shows that utilities account for significant share of the total production costs of the manufactured goods (EIC 2007). The recent fuel price hike is likely to diminish cost competitiveness further at various stages of the value chain, such as processing ---------------------- www.undprcc.lk 2 Toward Export Diversification and transportation, in these cou ntries. In addition to enhanced access to services, supply of reliable services is vital as power interruptions and quality of telecommunications are serious problems in LDCs. Maintenance of the existing infrastructure should also be strengthened. Private sector participation into this investment can be yet other effective policy measures. Improved trade facilitation measures Cumbersome administrative procedures and requirement of trade documentation by government agencies increase the cost of doing business significantly and weaken the competitiveness of the exporting firms. These obstacles take various form s. such as licensing, inspection and customs regulations. Table 1 compares the costs and procedures involved in trade for selected Asian countries with the sub-regional average. Lao PDR and Nepal, both landlocked LDCs, perform poorly in all categories compared to the sub-regional average, particularly in the costs and time involved in trade. For example, the time and cost required in Lao PDR to export and import goods are double the sub-regional average. Cambodia seems competitive in terms of costs of export or import procedures, but more documents and time are required to complete trade procedures than in neighboring countries, e.g., Viet Nam. In most of categories, Bangladesh is performing better than the sub-regional average. However, in comparison with a competitor in the region, Bangladesh is lagging behind the India - its biggest competitor in the region - in number of days required for export and import. Issue 2 June 2008 Reforms in the government administration in trade matters, licensing, and custom procedures are needed urgently to improve trade facilitation in these LDCs. Involvement of all stakeholders, including the private sector, in this process is a key to success. Investment in human development Despite having an abundance of labour, a shortage of skilled workers is a major constraint in the new startup and expansion of the manufacturing and service sectors in many LDC s. When export diversification and increased backward linkages are of high priority, as in the cases of the LDCs under consideration, such goals can be preconditioned by the limited availability of a skilled workforce in all levels ranging from management to specialized work.

Many producers are supplying the increasing competitive markets. Certification or designation as environmentally-friendly products or fair-traded goods is seen as means to create a niche market and add premium to such products. Standards and certification are useful measures to ensure the quality of goods and services. However, these system as well as other measures such as sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measu res can become barriers in exports when lDCs cannot meet requirements for international standards. To overcome these issues, technical and financial assistance should be provided in these LDCs so that producers and service providers, especially SMEs, are well informed about standards and certification processes and manage the quality assurance. The capacity of certifying agencies should be enhanced as well. For products, which are derived from, or use local or indigenous knowledge in the production, the intellectual property over such knowledge may be an issue. This may be the case where products are sold without benefits accruing to the communities or groups that have supplied the local or indigenous knowledge. A mechanism that formally involves all legitimate stakeholders including community knowledge holders should be established to develop relevant policies and laws on intellectual property rights, biodiversity, and protection of local knowledge. In the case of products such as herbs, herbal med icines, and medicinal plants, there is also a need to expand the rights of local communities over forest resources management to maximize benefits for local harvesters and minimize illegal collection of resources. The studies of Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Nepal have identified a number of sectors with significant export potential. Even at their currently underdeveloped status, these sectors are contributing Issue 2 June 2008 to export earnings and generating employment opportunities in LDCs. Further development and expansion of these sectors, therefore, is likely to have a considerable positive impact on employment creation, poverty alleviation and human development. Though the country experiences suggest that there have been some efforts in providing assistance to the development of the labour-intensive sectors, a number of critical constraints continue to hinder the goal of export diversification. The respective governments and private sectors need to make concerted efforts to overcome these constraints. References Economic Institute of Cambodia (EIC). 2007.

Human security refers to, among other things, the elimination of poverty and hardships, ensuring all stakeholders have a voice in decision-making, the protection of individual and community rights, freedom from fear, and protection from natural disaster and environmental imbalances. Its paramount objective is to ensure respect for the dignity and worth of the human person. From 24 April to 01 May 2007, UNDP Paci\ufb01 c Centre, in collaboration with the Paci\ufb01 c Islands Forum Secretariat, the University of the South Paci\ufb01 c, femLINKPaci\ufb01 c and the Citizens\u2019 Constitutional Forum convened a series of consultations on the topic of human security. The consultations were designed to provide a participatory forum for discussion, with a view to developing: \u2022 A regional partnership for the advancement of women\u2019s human security concerns; \u2022 A regional platform for regional civil society to lobby and co-operate to advance human security; and \u2022 A regional Human Security Framework for consideration at the June 2007 meeting of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0cc5acc-da94-47f4-8fbd-02031f3229d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0cc5acc-da94-47f4-8fbd-02031f3229d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1da6cdce0de329a17e4d79f6fddef01551aa92d65ce548a01d37da56f843f611"}, "3": {"node_id": "5c4febc1-37be-470d-8d09-a0305cfb9c9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a05c0a244a3d39085fe9a8838da2ce19a7008682e9ce480c6cd71bb8e3ff4279"}}, "hash": "09ad671d5acb73bd31c8a9817941d8ec0839d72912309701b7b09a7a2fe22992", "text": "Paci\ufb01 c Islands Forum Regional Security Committee (FRSC). The consultations each proceeded through a three stage process. Firstly, they took stock of existing human security concerns as experienced and understood by Paci\ufb01 c people. In the second stage they identi\ufb01 ed response capacities, in particular for contribution to a comprehensive early warning mechanism on human security. In the third phase, they generated recommendations for working towards the achievement of human security. Despite following a common overall pattern, each of the consultations was distinct in its outcomes. Women\u2019s Consultation Delegates at the regional consultation on women, peace and human security agreed on priority issues in the region for achieving women\u2019s human security, including: \u2022 Exposure of women to violence throughout the Paci\ufb01 c; \u2022 The need for an improved response from law and justice agencies; \u2022 Failure of disarmament and other post-con\ufb02 ict interventions to guarantee safety for women; \u2022 Inequality of women in access to, ownership of and decision making about the use of resources; \u2022 The economic inequality and poverty faced by women and need for improved macro-economic policies; \u2022 Weak governance and the problem of corruption; \u2022 The unequal access to education of women and girls \u2013 brought about both by lack of school places and the cultural preference for educating boys; \u2022 The in\ufb02 uence of discriminatory and/or ignorant knowledge, attitudes and practices on levels of violence, public health, sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS; Human Security Consultations Report 2007 ii \u2022 Violence and negative stereotypes of women in the media; \u2022 The exclusion of women from leadership at all levels. To address these issues, delegates highlighted the following measures as important for enhancing human security for women and men in the region: \u2022 Implementing a strategy to tackle violence against women involving research on the problem, awareness raising and concerted action by governments; \u2022 Bringing about reconciliation in post-con\ufb02 ict areas; \u2022 Including women as peacemakers and leaders in politics, the security sector and communities; \u2022 Strengthening women\u2019s machineries at the national level with greater \ufb01 nancial resources and political in\ufb02 uence; \u2022 Reforming policy to tackle gender based violence, plan and budget for women\u2019s equality, and put women into decision making roles; \u2022 Campaigning to eliminate violence, discriminatory laws and practices, harmful behaviours and negative stereotypes in the media; \u2022 Encouraging businesswomen and getting women into fairly paid work. Participants at the women\u2019s consultation agreed that an outcomes document would be shared with participants, with an opportunity for them to offer comments. PIFS was asked to act as a focal point for co-ordinating the strategy and activities elaborated by participants. Civil Society Consultation Participants in the CSO consultation followed a similar process, but brought a different set of perspectives to bear on human security issues within four thematic areas: Paci\ufb01 c culture and environment; communities, equality, and opportunities; security sectors and the state; and governance. While CSO representatives endorsed the concerns about women\u2019s equality and inclusion raised in the women\u2019s consultation, they also identi\ufb01 ed the following challenges: \u2022 Population growth and land con\ufb02 icts, particularly in urban and peri-urban areas; \u2022 The need to broaden and deepen existing concepts of security in use within the security sector to include human security; \u2022 The need for more effective measures to reduce armed violence such as disarmament, demobilization and reintegration; \u2022 Lack of accountability and leadership in reducing electoral violence and legitimizing national elections; \u2022 Failure to ensure self-determination, participation and democracy in relation to freedom of information, inclusion of local and remote communities in national decision-making processes, and implementation of human rights. Participants identi\ufb01 ed speci\ufb01 c strategies and responses for moving forward, acknowledging the need for concerted attention to women and youth as cross-cutting in all responses.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c4febc1-37be-470d-8d09-a0305cfb9c9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c4febc1-37be-470d-8d09-a0305cfb9c9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1da6cdce0de329a17e4d79f6fddef01551aa92d65ce548a01d37da56f843f611"}, "2": {"node_id": "a0cc5acc-da94-47f4-8fbd-02031f3229d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09ad671d5acb73bd31c8a9817941d8ec0839d72912309701b7b09a7a2fe22992"}}, "hash": "a05c0a244a3d39085fe9a8838da2ce19a7008682e9ce480c6cd71bb8e3ff4279", "text": "These include: \u2022 Devising non-violent approaches to mediating land registration that makes sense in Paci\ufb01 c cultural contexts; \u2022 Increased attention on peace education within schools; Human Security Consultations Report 2007 iii \u2022 Devising clearer mechanisms for monitoring human rights and national elections; \u2022 Strengthening capacity of new/emerging/fragile states in security sector reform with particular attention to the emerging issue of the privatization of security; \u2022 Identifying problems which require monitoring and clarifying the terms of what is to be monitored; \u2022 Establishing early warning systems to identify and respond to increases in threat levels; \u2022 Strengthening civil society networks, and speci\ufb01 cally the Paci\ufb01 c People Building Peace (PPBP) network, to respond to these issues.

These can be seen as important practical steps for civil society to assert its place as a key stakeholder in promoting and advancing human security in the region. Regional Human Security Conference The multi-stakeholder Regional Human Security Conference was focused on discussing and developing a draft document entitled \u2018A Human Security Framework for the Paci\ufb01 c\u2019, for submission to the Paci\ufb01 c Islands Forum Regional Security Committee (FRSC) deliberations in June 2007. Participants from Paci\ufb01 c governments, the private sector, the church, and academia raised a number of additional points for consideration in developing a Human Security policy document for the FRSC, based on their unique perspectives, knowledge, and priorities. These included: \u2022 The dif\ufb01 culty of incorporating a Human Security framework into government work plans already underway, especially given budgetary limitations; \u2022 The need for a more prominent role for environmental concerns, especially in relation to small islands and atoll states; \u2022 That Human Security is a new concept for governments and will take time to become accepted; \u2022 The need to consider what Human Security means for new/fragile/emerging states, where the remoteness of the state from many of its citizens remains an issue; \u2022 That traditional forms of governance and power structures need to be considered and included; \u2022 That it is problematic to promote the security of individuals under the concept of human security, when the security of families is more meaningful in Paci\ufb01 c contexts; \u2022 That normative western-centric assumptions are inherently built into the concept of Human Security, which Paci\ufb01 c people need to challenge and negotiate rather than accept uncritically. Participant working groups also aimed to identify speci\ufb01 c actions and realistic approaches to mitigating threats and building partnerships, that take into account the realistic challenges of advancing a new concept among governments and at a regional level. Concrete recommendations included: \u2022 Recognizing the need for a whole of government approach to mitigate the effects of climate change, and the development national action plans by national government for this purpose; \u2022 Conducting research on youth and unemployment in the Paci\ufb01 c; \u2022 Initiating a dialogue on population mobility and remittances in the Paci\ufb01 c; \u2022 Promoting micro-credit and entrepreneurship in a way that re\ufb02 ects local traditions and values; Human Security Consultations Report 2007 iv \u2022 Raising awareness and knowledge on human security issues by sharing information at both grassroots and national levels through the medium of civil society networks; \u2022 Developing a Paci\ufb01 c early warning mechanism co-ordinated by PIFS in liaison with national level focal points; \u2022 Studying disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration experiences in the Paci\ufb01 c to analyse relations between combatants and society, and identify best practices within Paci\ufb01 c cultural contexts; \u2022 Developing a mediation mechanism drawing on eminent persons, with equal representation for women, drawing on the capacities of both traditional and modern leaders. \u2022 Compiling a database of quali\ufb01 ed senior men and women for this purpose. Discussions on partnerships for human security drew further attention to the need to contextualize human security for the Paci\ufb01 c region. It was noted that effective partnerships would need to include governments and civil society, but also traditional power structures, the private sector, and religious institutions, in order for concerted and multi-layered responses to coalesce around common goals and interests.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f57f470-6c97-4bf3-b22b-f6235b2f358b": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f57f470-6c97-4bf3-b22b-f6235b2f358b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2cda16d499c68f32694d002dc1939e2df2783fe4abb67eaf93c8720c7e3cbdbc"}, "2": {"node_id": "db4619e1-a060-4dad-a5b4-6577ffb28b8c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a5fa90ec976696fcd452677b041e2b6821d1a3b2a04657f166404172e92fd5e"}}, "hash": "dc3a51a696bd46a9a707da2b42f9261ae9c6381507d7af62697854ec0932573f", "text": "Based on the discussions in the third consultation, key points that were taken forward for inclusion in the revised Human Security Framework document, for consideration by regional governments, were: \u2022 That the framework would concern itself with the region delimited by PIF membership; \u2022 That Human Security issues would emerge equally from the concerns of the 16 PIFS member countries; \u2022 That the paper would place more emphasis on threats, capacities and responses; \u2022 That a stronger emphasis would be placed on the richness of the history of the region, including pre-colonial experiences of security, as the basis from which to de\ufb01 ne Human Security for the Paci\ufb01 c in a more Paci\ufb01 c-centred way; \u2022 That the model of human security focussed on the relation of the state to the individual would be more in line with regional values if reconceptualised as the relation of the state to communities and thereby to the individual; \u2022 That vulnerability to environmental hazards would be given greater emphasis.

The report argued for a reorientation of security thinking: From an exclusive stress on territorial security to a much greater stress on people\u2019s security. From security through armaments to security through sustainable human development.1 The report noted seven main areas under which threats to human security can be categorized: economic, food, health, environmental, personal, community and political security. The precise de\ufb01 nition of human security has since been the focus of considerable debate. However, the shift in thinking and in institutional behaviour towards the advancement of security for people, as an urgent part of, and as an important contribution to, sustained and equitable human development, has not been fully realized in any region of the world. The consultations initiated in the Paci\ufb01 c region on this topic in April-May 2007 were designed to develop clarity and momentum around human security from the perspective of people in the Paci\ufb01 c. The advancement of human security is linked to UNDP\u2019s broader mandate to promote the ful\ufb01 lment of the goals set out in the Millennium Declaration, through a human rights based approach to development. In line with this mandate, and under its regional programme to strengthen crisis prevention and management architecture, UNDP Paci\ufb01 c Centre, in partnership with the Paci\ufb01 c Islands Forum Secretariat, together with the University of the South Paci\ufb01 c (USP), femLINKPaci\ufb01 c and the Paci\ufb01 c People Building Peace/Citizens Constitutional Forum, organised three consultations with the overall theme of \u2018Promoting Crisis Prevention, Human Security, and Peace-building in the Paci\ufb01 c Region\u2019. The UNDP Paci\ufb01 c Centre and its partners conducted these consultations from 24 April to 1 May 2007. The series of consultations included: a Women\u2019s Network Human Security Consultation; a Con\ufb02 ict Prevention Network Human Security Consultation, and a Regional Human Security Conference. The recommendations developed in the \ufb01 rst two consultations were carried forward by representatives from the consultations, to be fed in to the subsequent discussions. The consultations were designed to achieve two overarching objectives. The \ufb01 rst objective was to support the Paci\ufb01 c Islands Forum Secretariat\u2019s efforts under the Paci\ufb01 c Plan, to develop a clear and comprehensive Human Security Framework for implementation by regional governments, speci\ufb01 cally designed for the unique conditions in the Paci\ufb01 c region. In this regard, the consultations sought to elicit the contributions of women\u2019s organizations, con\ufb02 ict prevention organizations, academia, the business community, faith-based organizations, governments, intergovernmental groups, development agencies and donors to the draft Human Security Framework, as a document re\ufb02 ective of the need for a collaborative approach between all different stakeholders. The resultant document would then be submitted to the Forum Regional Security Committee for consideration in advance of its June 2007 meeting. The second objective was to facilitate the establishment and/or strengthening of regional and national partnerships through which civil society organizations, national governments, and the PIFS could interface and collaborate to promote human security.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9301df22-b766-47e6-87c7-000d6ff35adc": {"__data__": {"id_": "9301df22-b766-47e6-87c7-000d6ff35adc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd33852a8541b1a48870857fae1dce87dfe126101d7ab2b307521fc955e93ce9"}, "2": {"node_id": "f485ec8e-3646-4923-8fe2-6538e2acfcf6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "63a7057f79260a6bc293261e0e511217632e69e79da73f4cf7952ab1e2a407b4"}}, "hash": "d182d044d32a2adfac2f994e919a46480b8b4dd2a687ed7d94961c7d054b5afd", "text": "This multi-stakeholder process sought to add 1 Human Security Consultations Report Human Security Consultations Report 2007 Human Security Consultations Report 2007 1 United Nations Development Programme, Human Development Report 1994, (New York/Oxford, OUP, 1994), p.24.

The consultations followed a similar process, although each was speci\ufb01 cally tailored to suit the needs and interests of participants. Each consultation attempted to engage participants to think about what human security means for them and their communities. The consultations then encouraged participants to de\ufb01 ne the core human security issues relevant in their own context, identify monitoring capabilities, and identify speci\ufb01 c and practical responses. 3 REGIONAL CONSULTATION ON WOMEN, PEACE AND HUMAN SECURITY IN THE PACIFIC REGION 2.1 BACKGROUND The Women\u2019s consultation was designed to support the development of a critical mass of women and a women\u2019s regional platform to engage national and regional actors for crisis prevention, human security, and peace-building across the Paci\ufb01 c. While women can be credited with some of the most successful peace-building and crisis prevention efforts in the Paci\ufb01 c Region, their efforts are insuf\ufb01 ciently recognized at political levels. This consultation had the following speci\ufb01 c objectives: \u2022 To share perspectives and personal experiences of women regarding human security, and offer these as inputs into the development of civil society perspectives on human security in the Paci\ufb01 c Region; \u2022 To discuss strategies for establishing a regional network of women promoting crisis prevention, human security, and peace-building; \u2022 To identify potential gender-sensitive early warning indicators, and to propose suggestions for building women\u2019s capacity for early warning and crisis prevention as well as policy research, analysis, and advocacy; \u2022 To develop a statement on women\u2019s perspectives on peace and human security to be presented at the subsequent two consultations and for submission to the FRSC. 2.2 CONSULTATION PROCEEDINGS The structure of the consultation is set out in the agenda included at annex A. Participants at the conference are listed in annex B. 2.2.1 OPENING REMARKS HE Peter Eafeare, PNG High Commissioner to Fiji, opened the conference by noting the contribution of many participants to achieving progress in the \ufb01 eld of women, peace and security, and welcoming the meeting as a follow-up to the regional gender, peace, and security meeting of 2006. He highlighted the forum leaders\u2019 interest in expanding their focus to cover a broader set of human security issues, especially women\u2019s issues, and highlighted the Biketawa declaration as the appropriate framework for PIFS to work to enhance security in the region. The High Commissioner noted the importance of engaging with churches and other religious organisations to ensure that the spiritual needs of Paci\ufb01 c citizens are not forgotten while physical and material needs are addressed, and re\ufb02 ected that after personally witnessing many of the security- related crises that have affected PNG, including displacements on Manus, the con\ufb02 ict on Bougainville, and security dif\ufb01 culties near the Western border, the renewed search for solutions was of special importance for him personally. Mr Garry Wiseman, Manager of UNDP\u2019s Paci\ufb01 c Centre, then offered opening remarks. He stressed the importance of the consultation as an opportunity to ensure that the voices and concerns of women Human Security Consultations Report 2007 2 Human Security Consultations Report 2007 4 are integrated into the human security framework that is being developed for the Paci\ufb01 c. He pointed to the grave impacts of con\ufb02 icts in the region for women and their children, in terms of long term- displacements, food shortages, increases in female headed households, physical and psychological trauma, unwanted pregnancies, poor health, increases in domestic violence and the breakdown of education and healthcare. He also highlighted the absence of women from leadership roles throughout the region and the failure to recognise their contribution to peace by including them in recovery planning and peace processes. Human security and gender issues were said to be central for UNDP to the ful\ufb01 lment of human rights and a rights-based approach to development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "acbe8d5c-1ece-4d54-a8fb-ce3d0811f110": {"__data__": {"id_": "acbe8d5c-1ece-4d54-a8fb-ce3d0811f110", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "757d21fa49924b65a4fe059a960f97071bd9c9c736b2613a116ad6ebdd0526a7"}, "2": {"node_id": "d9e431af-66d2-4d8a-9b8e-61a0a1556a98", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7728dbbbbbbffa1c22cbb6d1fd4241c4444bcc27edacba2895352bf0d977e922"}}, "hash": "bbd504fda1fdd3b747de95ccda7bd87a88b2a9691417c70c85f18bf767101832", "text": "2.2.2 SHARING KNOWLEDGE: PRESENTATIONS ON HUMAN SECURITY Dr Henry Iverature, Regional Governance Advisor at the Paci\ufb01 c Islands Forum Secretariat of PIFS, gave an introductory presentation on the purpose and context of the consultations, stressing that in 2006 the forum leaders\u2019 meeting in Nadi emphasised the need to look at security issues not only in terms of armed con\ufb02 ict and law and order, but also from a human security perspective that focuses on human needs. He noted that the 2007 consultation was an opportunity to examine security issues taking into account women\u2019s perspectives, within a process designed to lead to greater development of the region\u2019s crisis prevention and management architecture.

Dr Iverature also drew attention to the existing Paci\ufb01 c Plan strategic objective 12.6, on increasing women\u2019s representation in parliament and decision-making, as a key heading under which progress towards human security for women could be achieved. Sharon Bhagwan Rolls, Co-ordinator of femLINKPaci\ufb01 c, pointed out that the legal and normative framework provided by UNSCR 1325 requires parties to a con\ufb02 ict and other actors to respect women\u2019s rights, and to support their participation in peace negotiations and post-con\ufb02 ict reconstruction. She noted that UNSCR 1325 emerged from a concerted effort by allied NGOs working together with governments and UN entities, and highlighted the role of femLINK, working with UNIFEM Paci\ufb01 c, in localizing UNSCR 1325 in Fiji, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Ms Rolls described the conference as part of a process to identify concerns and ways of working connectedly at local, national and regional levels, in order to strengthen regional peace and security in a way that is harmonized with national and local realities. She also highlighted the need to take forward the signi\ufb01 cant existing commitments in the Biketawa Declaration and the Paci\ufb01 c Plan to implementation of UNSCR 1325 and CEDAW, as well as to the broader peace and security agenda in the region. Gina Torry, Co-ordinator of the New York-based NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security, then presented the background paper for the conference (included at annex G). She noted how, prior to the adoption of UNSCR 1325, women had been effectively frozen out of con\ufb02 ict prevention and peace- building activities. She outlined headings under which the human security of women needed to be taken forward as: human rights, justice, health, education, participation in economic and political life, and access to land, resources and housing. She argued that women-friendly peace-building requires a gender sensitive analysis of and response to these issues. Human Security Consultations Report 2007 5 THEME ISSUES IDENTIFIED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION Ms Torry elaborated the links between global policies on gender and human security at the top of the policy pyramid, and the regional, national and local levels at the bottom. She used the example of the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security to demonstrate that a coalition of NGOs forms a stronger and more effective platform to advocate for policy changes, and for monitoring their implementation, than ad hoc lobbying by individual organisations. A plenary session followed to allow participants to respond to Ms Torry\u2019s paper. Participants raised the following issues: that emphasis needs to be placed on human rights and the security of persons in any human security framework; that it needs to be acknowledged that men hold power in the region, and need to be convinced to take forward women\u2019s concerns; that quotas alone are insuf\ufb01 cient to ensure women\u2019s participation in peace-building and post con\ufb02 ict decision making; and that beyond humanitarian relief and peace negotiations during con\ufb02 ict, and post-con\ufb02 ict peace-building, additional attention needs to be paid to addressing women\u2019s needs and enhancing their potentials before con\ufb02 ict breaks out. 2.2.3 IDENTIFYING THREATS, MONITORING CAPABILITIES AND RESPONSES Participants then identi\ufb01 ed key themes for consideration during the working group phase of the consultation and joined the working group that was handling the theme of most relevance and interest to them. The working groups were then asked to: \u2022 Identify the key issues and challenges in relation to the group\u2019s theme; \u2022 Identify existing capacity to respond to these issues and challenges, including monitoring capability; \u2022 Identify strategies or responses to each issue/challenge.

It was agreed that the outcomes document from the consultation would be shared with participants, with an opportunity for them to offer comments, while it was requested that PIFS act as a focal point for co-ordinating the strategy and activities elaborated by participants. The model was put forward of NGO working groups at national level being linked to women\u2019s networks at grassroots level and to a mechanism at the regional level. This regional level body would frame and take forward the agenda of the national working groups at the regional level. It was noted that the national and regional working groups need routinised access, through membership of relevant committees, to dialogue and communication with the MFA and the FRSC, to ensure that gender considerations, UNSCR 1325 and CEDAW are taken into account. The regional body would also feed its agenda up to the international NGO working group. It was further pointed out that changes at the level of the Paci\ufb01 c Islands Forum Secretariat have to be initiated and driven by PIF member governments.

REGIONAL CONSULTATION ON CIVIL SOCIETY, HUMAN SECURITY AND PEACE-BUILDING IN THE PACIFIC REGION 3.1 BACKGROUND The shifting focus from a state-centric to a human-centric security paradigm, has led to a growing recognition that civil society organizations have an important stake in the achievement of human security and are well placed to make important contributions to it. The imperative for governments to forge partnerships with civil society organizations to promote human security and good governance is also increasingly recognized at the global level. While recent actions by civil society have been partly successful in the Paci\ufb01 c, partnerships between CSOs, governments and inter-governmental bodies remain weak. The second in the series of human security consultations therefore brought together members of the GPPAC/Paci\ufb01 c People Building Peace civil society network with the following objectives in mind: \u2022 To develop and endorse a regional civil society platform, covering key issues of concern and recommendations for action, for use in advocacy with regional governments and international organisations; \u2022 To contribute, on the basis of this platform, to the development of a human security framework for the Paci\ufb01 c region; \u2022 To develop and endorse a formal agreement on the vision, agenda, structure and activities of the GPPAC/Paci\ufb01 c People Building Peace civil society con\ufb02 ict prevention network in the Paci\ufb01 c. 3.2 CONSULTATION PROCEEDINGS The consultation was structured as set out in the agenda included at annex C. Participants and delegates to the conference are listed in annex D. 3.2.1 OPENING REMARKS The consultation began with an opening address by Mr Jone Dakuvula, Programme Director of the Citizens\u2019 Constitutional Forum (CCF) and Regional Initiator of the Paci\ufb01 c People Building Peace Network. Mr Dakuvula welcomed participants and explained that the gathering was an opportunity for civil society organisations to engage the PIFS and regional governments in developing a comprehensive common approach, and joint activities, to strengthen existing security commitments in the region. On behalf of the PPBP network, he welcomed the opportunity for members, \ufb01 rstly, to review and re\ufb01 ne the structure and priorities of the network and, secondly, to enter into dialogue with partners to establish a clearer basis for collaboration and cooperation. Mr Garry Wiseman, Manager of the UNDP Paci\ufb01 c Centre, also offered opening remarks. He highlighted the importance of listening to the voices of Paci\ufb01 c peoples in order to respond properly to human 3 8 Human Security Consultations Report 2007 Human Security Consultations Report 2007 9 security issues in the region, and welcomed the opportunity to do this presented by the consultation. He further noted the vulnerability of the region to natural disasters, and the increasingly common violence and lawless behaviour associated with unequal access to the bene\ufb01 ts of development. 3.2.2 INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSULTATION The consultation began with a series of presentations in which participants and guest speakers shared their knowledge and experience on human security. Mr Samuel Doe of the UNDP Paci\ufb01 c Centre then introduced the objectives for the consultation outlined above, and provided an overview of the evolution of the concept of human security. He then emphasised the place of monitoring systems and preventative action in operationalising human security. 3.2.3 PEACE AND CONFLICT UPDATES There was then an opportunity for participants to take stock of the current situation across the region, during a session set aside for CSO participants to offer peace and con\ufb02 ict updates on their local/ national contexts. Representatives of New Zealand and Australian CSO groups were asked to focus on their countries\u2019 policies toward con\ufb02 ict and human security concerns in the Paci\ufb01 c, and how CSOs are working on these issues in the region.

Despite this threat, much progress has been made toward peace and disarmament through the establishment of legal and judicial institutions, and settling of grievances. - Related problems of reintegration into communities of those who took part in the conflict, lack of opportunities to encourage reintegration, and lack of respect for and challenges to traditional leadership require traditional, local, and international cooperation in order to be successfully addressed. - Critical security threats in Fiji include personal and political insecurity; lack of access to secure and adequate land tenure, housing and food; inadequate provision of health and education services; environmental vulnerability; and economic insecurity. - The pervasiveness of these threats reflect the lack of adequate long term, inter-sectoral strategies to fulfil economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights in the country. - The political status of Kanaky \u2013 New Caledonia as a colony of France is the single most critical threat to the marginalised indigenous people of the country. The outnumbering of the indigenous population by non- indigenous people has raised questions about land security and rights. The lack of recognition afforded to traditional society by the legal system has contributed to the loss of traditional identity. Human Security Consultations Report 2007 10 LOCATION CSO PEACE AND CONFLICT UPDATE New Zealand Papua New Guinea Samoa Solomon Islands Tahiti Tonga - A referendum on Kanaky \u2013 New Caledonia\u2019s independence from France is scheduled for 2018. - The policies of four New Zealand bodies with responsibilities or interests in security in the Pacific islands showed interesting comparisons as well as stark contrasts. The stances of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the New Zealand Defence Force were aimed at implementing the policies of the New Zealand Government through support to the Pacific Islands Forum and the defence of New Zealand\u2019s interests in the region. - In contrast, NZAID and the CID have attempted to address all aspects of conflict by recognising the vital necessity of starting from the root causes rather than only providing assistance when situations were beyond local control. New Zealand-based CSOs usually work in partnership with local agencies throughout the Pacific and a few have local offices in island countries. - The critical security threats in Papua New Guinea are violent discontent among unemployed youth (including violence against women, rape, and domestic abuse), theft, and the spread and impacts of HIV/AIDS. - Problems of lawlessness, and the inability of local authorities to deal with it, are exacerbated by police corruption. Other persistent problems include the amassing of firearms in the Highlands, the lack of recognition of traditional land ownership, and widespread election-related violence. The last problem is being addressed through awareness campaigns. - The most critical security threat facing Samoa is the lack of grassroots-level awareness of the impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise, on the environment on which local communities are dependent for their livelihoods. Other environmental concerns also exist, such as the impacts of poor waste disposal practices. Samoa is addressing these issues primarily through wide-reaching awareness campaigns on the need for environmental adaptation strategies and the better use of existing resources for income generating activities. - Other prevalent problems in Samoa include domestic violence, lack of participatory decision-making and inappropriate responses to problems. - Discontent among Solomon Islanders has resulted from an inappropriate government system and the unequal distribution of development benefits throughout the country. Frustration at this continued state of affairs has manifested in violence and lawlessness throughout the country since the 1990s. Root causes of these problems are being addressed through a constitutional review process. - Other critical threats faced by the Solomon Islands are the spread and impacts of HIV/AIDS and havoc wreaked by natural disasters. - The critical threat faced by the people of Tahiti \u2013 French Polynesia was identified as French colonial rule including the exercise of control over nuclear testing, related local frustrations and the potential for political violence, and human rights violations. - As with Kanaky \u2013 New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna, the colonial status of Tahiti \u2013 French Polynesia precludes the implementation of the concept of human security because the people have no sovereignty. - The Privy Council, Cabinet ministers, and governors of Ha\u2019apai and Vava\u2019u are appointed by the King. Proposed political reform of this system has been resisted by beneficiaries of the system as they would lose their political powers and comfortable economic status. This has resulted in intimidation, interference with civil society and the media, and manipulation of the Privy Council\u2019s law-making power. - Instruments of peace and stability such as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5051621e-aefa-4604-b0c9-c02fb57efb91": {"__data__": {"id_": "5051621e-aefa-4604-b0c9-c02fb57efb91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ee43b0e49f90f463edfe2ec72da5960bf71d4880e1f98059f6d095cc11ecbc6"}, "3": {"node_id": "c073a4eb-c7c0-4789-bcc3-79b5963e671e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35f57a15c373037b4eedfb91cf2c43887fe1971640aa98493dab104cdda5a3ad"}}, "hash": "658ebcbc56d598a549a8c66effae7f69e4bf91cc89f1b8670c80e41ca7ef7f4f", "text": "the cultural taboo system are perceived to be suppressing the people of Tonga.

The lack of political reform is perceived as the greatest threat to human security in Tonga. - There is urgent need for internationally-supported sustained dialogue to address current restrictions, prevent future ones, curb corruption and abuse of power, and progress political reform to ensure the long term security of Tonga. Table 2: Summary of CSO updates on peace and con\ufb02 ict issues in their local/national contexts Human Security Consultations Report 2007 11 3.2.4 BACKGROUND PAPER PRESENTATION The peace and con\ufb02 ict updates were followed by the presentation of the background paper to the consultation prepared by Dr. Vijay Naidu, Director of the Development Studies Programme of the Paci\ufb01 c Institute of Advanced Studies in Development and Governance, University of the South Paci\ufb01 c. The Paper, entitled \u2018Human Security in the Paci\ufb01 c\u2019 is included at annex H. Professor Naidu began with an analysis of what the paradigm shift from state security to human security might mean for the Paci\ufb01 c region. He then identi\ufb01 ed a range of issues that have present or future human security implications for the Paci\ufb01 c, and offered some starting points for working group discussions. After reviewing the existing regional treaties, bodies, and normative mechanisms that presently exist and considering how these could be used as the basis for a broader human security agenda, Dr. Naidu addressed the issue of what roles civil society organizations can play in enhancing human security in the Paci\ufb01 c, and how these organizations can most effectively \ufb01 t in to a broader, concerted, human security strategy for the region. 3.2.5 THEMATIC PRESENTATIONS The section of the consultation devoted to sharing of knowledge then continued with a series of thematic presentations. Sharon Bhagwan Rolls began by presenting the outcomes and proceedings of the preceding conference on Women, Peace, and Human Security in the Paci\ufb01 c (summarised above and presented in the separate Outcomes Document for the \ufb01 rst consultation). Dr Steven Ratuva presented a paper on land and resources in relation to con\ufb02 icts and highlighted the persistence of the false perception that land tenure in the Paci\ufb01 c can be understood as a single issue to which there could be a common response. Dr Ratuva argued that the concept of land in the Paci\ufb01 c has three important dimensions: it carries an intrinsically spiritual quality and provides a connection with ancestors; it provides a medium for expressing socio-cultural relations, kinship, and identity; and it provides the resource base for economic survival, as a physical commodity. As such, he categorized land disputes into four basic types involving different combinations of parties: intra-local con\ufb02 icts within a particular community, for example between family groups living in the same area; inter- local con\ufb02 icts between local groups, for example over land or boundary de\ufb01 nitions; inter local-macro con\ufb02 icts between a local group and an outside entity such as the state or a company; and inter macro- macro con\ufb02 icts between two large entities such as companies or between the state and a company. Mr Sam Doe made a presentation introducing early warning and early response (EWER) mechanisms. Mr Doe stated that a number of EWER mechanisms have been developed in recent years in an effort to focus attention on preventative action and timely responses to crises. Civil society and community- based organizations are uniquely positioned to contribute to early warning and response mechanisms due to their close ties to local populations and the existing communication networks they can access, which are often inaccessible to outside agencies and governments. Mr Doe discussed the example of WARN (the West African Early Warning and Response Network) and reviewed its origins, structure, and methods of implementation across West Africa.

The presentation introduced the idea of peace education within schools and in the wider community, and stressed the importance of developing strategies for integrating peace education into already existing curricula instead of offering peace education as a distinct activity. He gave examples of existing education policies in Paci\ufb01 c countries, arguing for a greater reference to peace building in education curricula, and highlighted the existence of initiatives on which to build in future through networking and partnership. Beyond the need for peace education, he also drew attention to the need to lobby governments for greater access for children in the Paci\ufb01 c to quality education in a more general sense. He then suggested co-operation between PPBP network members to review regional education policies and lobby for the inclusion of peace education within them. Ms Nainasa Whippy, Non-State Actor Liaison Of\ufb01 cer, Paci\ufb01 c Islands Forum Secretariat, then made a presentation on the subject of civil society engagement with PIFS. Ms Whippy explained the process by which PIFS would engage with CSOs on human security with respect to the Paci\ufb01 c Plan. She observed the growing recognition by governments of the role and contribution of CSOs in community development, service delivery, policy design, and knowledge of local issues, demonstrated by the consultative status given to certain non-state actors, and the initiative to include accredited NGOs as observers in non-con\ufb01 dential PIFS meetings. However, she also re-af\ufb01 rmed the need to strengthen PIFS\u2019 liaison, consulting, and engagement with non-state actors, a key priority of the current PIFS Secretary General. She mentioned that peace-related advocacy could be strengthened by establishing a Human Security presence in the existing NGO advisory group, for example by creating a seat/position dedicated to Human Security issues. To in\ufb02 uence policy decisions, it was noted that CSOs need to work through regional decision-making processes. In practice, this requires CSOs to engage on nationally-relevant issues that \ufb01 t with the existing agendas of states. Ms Whippy also pointed out that the policy of allowing observers into meetings was very new and further requests for change could be staggered to allow members time to adjust to the new arrangements. In the following plenary session, participants discussed ways to engage with PIFS on human security. They noted that need for the network to attain consultative status with PIFS, as well as to select a delegate to engage in PIFS discussions on human security, to be drawn from among the network members on a rotating basis. The discussion also covered the relation of human security to the Paci\ufb01 c Plan. While human security did not feature explicitly in the Paci\ufb01 c Plan, it was also noted that the Plan is subject to review, that the idea of adopting a human development security plan had already been under consideration, and that it could be a successful strategy for this to be the focus of renewed advocacy attention. Participants also inquired as to what tools, processes and procedures they need to be aware of to engage successfully with PIFS. It was pointed out that CSOs know relatively little about the internal workings of the forum, and hence are ill-equipped to engage with it. The suggestion was made that the Forum develop a schema explaining how it is structured, what the different windows of entry are, and what is required to access them. The PIFS Representative supported this idea.

Security Consultations Report 2007 14 Paci\ufb01 c Culture and Environment Under the broad heading of Paci\ufb01 c Culture and Environment participants stressed the implications for human security stemming from the negative effects of globalisation, including: displacement, migration, immigration and squatter settlements; irresponsible actions by big (and small) businesses (particularly with reference to resource extraction and logging industries), the power and pressure wielded by outside economic actors; the effects of trade agreements and the implications of regional- speci\ufb01 c obstacles to trade in terms of macroeconomic uncertainty and therefore uncertainty in the lives of ordinary people. Participants made reference to tensions between traditional owners of land and newer systems of ownership, including land that was expropriated under colonialism. It was noted that most Paci\ufb01 c nations lack the capacity to undertake thorough registration of land and ownership. The participants welcomed the emphasis PIFS currently places on the theme of land and con\ufb02 ict minimisation, and wished to see other actors engaged in taking this issue forward. Participants also identi\ufb01 ed a need for legislation on intellectual property rights to protect the (traditional) knowledge and genetic resources of Paci\ufb01 c countries. Concerns were raised with the unequal distribution of pro\ufb01 ts from multi-national companies that hold concessions to operate in Paci\ufb01 c countries, with the contrasts between wealthy actors in extraction industries and poor local communities cited as a source of tension and con\ufb02 ict. Participants likewise raised the need to revisit and strengthen relevant regional agreements such as the Noumea Convention and Apia Convention to protect the Paci\ufb01 c environment. The signi\ufb01 cant threat posed by natural disasters to human security in the region was also noted, along with the long-term implications of climate change for many small island states. Displacement resulting from natural disasters was also identi\ufb01 ed as a threat, especially as identity and cultural linkages with ancestral lands make rede\ufb01 nition of land ownership so sensitive in the Paci\ufb01 c context. Weaknesses were pointed out in existing natural disaster and climate change management approaches, including lack of effective early warning systems, co-operation from high energy-consuming countries in reducing emissions, and the lack of a co-ordinated response to natural disasters. It was also argued that lessons need to be learned from the tsunami that recently hit the Solomon Islands, including the problems such as the inability of military relief personnel to communicate with local communities. Communities, Equality, and Opportunity The working group on Communities, Equality, and Opportunity focused on the pervasive nature of multi-faceted political, economic and social violence. The pervasive nature of political violence was said to be most clearly manifested in inter-ethnic violence, violence related to elections and violence and con\ufb02 ict between militaries and police. Social violence was de\ufb01 ned by participants as gang violence in communities, domestic violence and gender-based violence in families and communities. Violent masculine behaviours were emphasised as a particular threat to human security in the Paci\ufb01 c. This violence was associated with the increasing availability of small arms and light weapons, and likewise with an increase in drug and alcohol abuse. Structural problems associated with violence were said to include dominant patriarchal cultures and the socialisation of violence as an acceptable form of response to con\ufb02 ict. These root causes interact Human Security Consultations Report 2007 15 with proximate causes of unemployment and poverty, increasing urbanization, and population growth in urban and peri-urban settlements. The resultant intra-community tensions lead to various forms of economic and social violence. Participants also observed that political violence stems in part from decolonialisation processes that left in place systems of governance that divided groups along religious or ethnic lines, and that have been unable to resolve inequality between these groups in terms of economic, social and political decision making.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a82de695-76a2-4fa1-a6e5-277b18d087e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "a82de695-76a2-4fa1-a6e5-277b18d087e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9dec4059ada3623c9cbdd20eb077341c714ca9f0938de770824c95b4d0f64a8"}, "2": {"node_id": "7497eacf-289d-43e7-80fa-da3a38d46489", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42302e72a731c73d25ce74633797b698b25f727975bde5dbdae4ff48b2930fa7"}}, "hash": "bd0a3067d7dd3efcd7002bdb1a35620f2cb0f1a4239fcb9b5d598d947a1f07dc", "text": "Security and the State The working group on Security and the State identi\ufb01 ed a key challenge as being broadening and deepening the traditional concept of security within the security sector throughout the region.

A second core issue identi\ufb01 ed under the heading of security and the state was that of inter-group relations and intra-local con\ufb02 icts. Participants linked problems in inter-group relations to tensions over land and the situation of marginalised groups. Participants wished to highlight the need to enhance mechanisms for dealing with inter-group tensions, for example in Solomon Islands, Royal Marshall Islands and Papua New Guinea. A third core issue highlighted under the heading of security and the state was that of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and other measures to reduce armed violence. Participants noted the lack of detailed analysis of the track record of previous peace-building interventions, speci\ufb01 cally in relation to how they address the concerns and draw on the potentials of women. A further issue of concern was the development of the private security sector in the region, and how the sector is regulated. Governance Participants identi\ufb01 ed the most signi\ufb01 cant governance issues on the human security agenda as: accountability and leadership; self-determination, participation and democracy; and ful\ufb01 lment of human rights, and in particular economic, social and cultural rights. In terms of accountability and leadership, participants highlighted signi\ufb01 cant problems with political violence, electoral violence, and electoral manipulation in the region, and noted the need for much greater accountability of leaders and government entities to Paci\ufb01 c people. They emphasised the lack of leadership codes for political leaders in some Paci\ufb01 c countries, and the need for a new generation of political leaders to emerge. In terms of electoral processes, participants highlighted the lack of regulation of electoral funding, the failure of elected leaders to stick to electoral promises, the regulation of voter education by traditional leaders, the need for electoral monitoring over extended periods, and the acceptance of violence as a form of political action. Human Security Consultations Report 2007 16 In terms of self-determination, participation and democracy, participants noted problems in relation to freedom of information. This included the failure to translate of\ufb01 cial documents into local languages and to pass on information effectively to remote populations, the lack of understanding of essential policies, laws and commitments, the lack of cohesion between local, provincial and national governments, and the lack of gender-disaggregated information either for policymakers or the public. They also noted the neglect of youth issues and the need to encourage the empowerment and political participation of youth (for example through sustaining momentum in relation to youth parliaments). In terms of human rights, the participants were concerned by the low level of rati\ufb01 cation and implementation of international human rights instruments in the region, and wished to see better monitoring and reporting at the national level to UN bodies on the implementation of human rights treaties. A further concern was over the level of access to information about human rights among Paci\ufb01 c people. Participants were also critical of the fact that the right to self-determination of colonial peoples was still not recognised and acted upon in relation to all Paci\ufb01 c territories, and that, although the Raratonga Treaty addressed nuclear testing, it failed to address victims\u2019 rights to compensation. 3.2.7 PLENARY DISCUSSION ON WORKING GROUPS The working groups were followed by a plenary discussion to discuss cross-cutting themes and share the results of group work. The participants acknowledged women and youth as cross-cutting issues in the four thematic areas, and noted that many of these issues play out in overlapping ways at the local level. Participants particularly noted the need to devise non-violent approaches to mediating contentious issues of land registration in a way that makes sense for Paci\ufb01 c cultural contexts, and called for increased attention to peace education. There was also discussion of the challenges that new/emerging/fragile states face in relation to the \u2018of\ufb01 cial\u2019 security sector, and the growing trend towards the privatization of security.

The group suggested that PPBP could address some of these concerns and should consider undertaking awareness-raising and communication, lobbying, early warning and early response systems, capacity building, and knowledge sharing. 3.2.8 CIVIL SOCIETY NETWORK-BUILDING The remainder of the discussions then focused on the establishment of the PPBP network. Working groups were each asked to form opinions on: the name of the network; whether and for how long the secretariat would remain with CCF; the content of a new work-plan; and the formation of a governing board and steering committee. Human Security Consultations Report 2007 17 Some interim arrangements were discussed, including a governance board to draft a constitution and formalize the structure of the organization for consideration at the \ufb01 rst annual general meeting. Discussion on the structure of the secretariat focused on the need for clarity on current staf\ufb01 ng resources and interim funding, and the reality that PPBP cannot continue to depend on the support of CCF, but should instead be self-supporting. The working groups identi\ufb01 ed a set of criteria for deciding the composition of the interim steering committee. It was agreed that selection criteria should based on skills and experience in the following areas: \u2022 Knowledge of relevant issues; \u2022 Knowledge of the network; \u2022 Mediation skills; \u2022 Knowledge of donors; \u2022 Financial management; \u2022 Gender representation; \u2022 Regional representation; \u2022 Practical administrative skills; \u2022 Commitment and availability (including willingness to work via email). The role of UNDP Larry Attree gave a brief presentation to explain the roles and responsibilities of the UNDP Paci\ufb01 c Centre in relation to the emergent Paci\ufb01 c People Building Peace network, which helped to inform the subsequent plenary discussion on the network. Mr Attree outlined the work of the Paci\ufb01 c Centre as focusing on strengthening sustainable peace architecture in the Paci\ufb01 c region. This was said to include: providing technical assistance to the Paci\ufb01 c Islands Forum Secretariat in relation to human security; developing regional expertise through the establishment of an annual tertiary education course on human security; mainstreaming gender in the work of regional stakeholders on human security; and supporting civil society networking and platform development on human security for both women\u2019s organisations and the GPPAC network. Work under the latter heading was said to include interim support for the PPBP network should participants be able to agree on concrete steps for developing the network in the coming months. PPBP Network structure Following the presentation, the plenary discussion chose to focus on a number of issues common to discussions of the three working groups. It was unanimously decided that the PPBP Secretariat should be a transitional body working toward the establishment of an independent regional organization over a 12-month timeframe, and should retain its current name, \u2018Paci\ufb01 c People Building Peace\u2019. CCF offered to continue as Secretariat to the network until the end of 2007, if offered the \ufb01 nancial support of the UNDP Paci\ufb01 c Centre. The selection of Suva as the location of the headquarters of the transitional body precluded regionally- based representation on the Interim Steering Committee which was tasked with guiding the network through the transition period. The need to include regional representatives would be addressed through the appointment and resourcing of national focal points. Human Security Consultations Report 2007 18 A group of thirteen nominees were elected to form an Interim Steering Committee Absent nominees would have the opportunity to decline their appointments once advised. The large number of members of the Interim Steering Committee was chosen to account for occasional unavailability of members and the possibility of forming working groups or sub-committees. The workshop agreed that a timeframe of approximately one year should be spent focusing on establishing the organization rather than on programme development. The group also decided that decisions on network membership, involvement of other relevant organizations, collective rules of appointment and responsibilities of national focal points, rules of procedure, and distribution of tasks should be handled by the Interim Steering Committee. Another decision was that the recommendations produced by the consultation should be used as the starting point for the transitional body and Interim Steering Committee. The participants instructed the Interim Steering Committee to develop a three-year plan, a constitution, a website, a budget, and a database of contacts and current programmes. A critical task was the formulation of a coherent summary of plans for presentation to the next donor meeting.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f5ce786-3e8d-4c3e-ac4a-b7321f2b80c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f5ce786-3e8d-4c3e-ac4a-b7321f2b80c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af8bbaf7b8813f5387089cdc5d6d4dba7da62e77a0a93c998adef455be29669c"}, "2": {"node_id": "ac2b4b83-2504-473d-ad43-92d39338318b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29d52beef5ebaa2eae2991ccf8318c80cfb027214a8927f4659b920380fa4294"}}, "hash": "4516068139fb4e01d139fe9e3becd44696c8113548338d0de5e408dd864a6576", "text": "The \ufb01 rst meeting of the Interim Steering Committee commenced immediately following the closure of the consultation. 3.2.9 REPRESENTATION IN THE FOLLOWING CONSULTATION In addition to the six participants who remained from", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e969532-8359-4bbf-be2f-be916448c4f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e969532-8359-4bbf-be2f-be916448c4f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a31bbb7583bced9788fa81e2f652fcaedcf33cc8a28f86bfb1adcae0ac5779a8"}, "3": {"node_id": "42d7eee6-f217-4b88-a1a9-fdf13d7d0d1f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "572db3318d78ec256a387108aa4c0148833650dabe14a74bb7562f35db0ec404"}}, "hash": "868303e09eede1cf7f9ff65b67658d512a8f0b4cca1cc7790418f6ec7180c222", "text": "the women\u2019s consultation, six of the participants from the second event also remained in the \ufb01 nal, multi-stakeholder discussion, in order to represent the views of the PPBP network. 19 REGIONAL CONFERENCE ON BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS FOR CRISIS PREVENTION, HUMAN SECURITY & PEACE-BUILDING IN THE PACIFIC 4.1 BACKGROUND The third in the series of consultations broadened the focus from civil society perspectives, to include governments, security institutions, the private sector, and religious institutions. The event was co- organised by UNDP Paci\ufb01 c Centre, the University of the South Paci\ufb01 c (USP) and the Paci\ufb01 c Island Forum Secretariat (PIFS). The objectives of the conference were to: \u2022 Share perspectives on human security between a variety of stakeholders; \u2022 Generate consensus on the need to promote human security in the Paci\ufb01 c Region; \u2022 Create a foundation for multi-stakeholder partnerships and platforms for human security; \u2022 Offer constructive criticism to the draft human security framework paper in advance of the June 2007 Forum Regional Security Committee (FRSC) meeting. 4.2 CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS The conference was structured as set out in the agenda included at annex E. Participants and Delegates to the conference are listed in annex F. 4.2.1 OPENING REMARKS The conference began with opening remarks from Garry Wiseman, Manager of the UNDP Paci\ufb01 c Centre. Mr Wiseman emphasised the pervasive nature of human security threats in the region, and called for renewed efforts to develop concerted strategies that bring together governments, citizens, and regional bodies to address these threats collaboratively. He emphasized the need to incorporate a gender perspective throughout all aspects of analysis and response, and called attention to the environmental impacts of rising sea levels and climate change. Further opening remarks were made by Professor Graham Hassall, of PIAS-DG, University of the South Paci\ufb01 c. Professor Hassall introduced the conference by calling on states and citizens at national and regional levels to take the initiative in addressing human security issues. He outlined the role of USP as an institution of research and knowledge dissemination that is committed to \ufb01 nding solutions to problems in the region. He described policy making in the \ufb01 eld of human security as a challenge to governance that requires the development of new ways of thinking, as well as greater collaboration and coordination, and therefore challenged the conference participants to come up with a workable policy framework and to ensure connectivity among partners. 4.2.2 INTRODUCTORY SESSION ON HUMAN SECURITY Sam Doe, Senior Civil Society and Con\ufb02 ict Prevention Expert, UNDP Paci\ufb01 c Centre, again provided an introduction to the concept of human security to the conference. Participants then offered comments. A key challenge identi\ufb01 ed was the willingness of governments to accept the individual as the focal Human Security Consultations Report 2007 4 Human Security Consultations Report 2007 20 point of security when there are other competing priorities. Participants wondered whether the Paci\ufb01 c region\u2019s concerns are suf\ufb01 ciently integrated into the existing human security paradigm. Concern was also expressed about the absence of spirituality from the framework. Participants were unsure about the implications of a shift in focus from the \u2018sovereign state\u2019 to the individual, and there was some uncertainty about what mechanism would facilitate this shift. It was asserted that the Paci\ufb01 c used to live by a system in which ensuring the security and viability of communities was the basis for governance. It was suggested that human security would be more acceptable in the Paci\ufb01 c if it were to focus on communities rather than individuals. This adaptation of the concept of human security would more closely re\ufb02 ect the traditional, locally determined systems of governance that used to exist before colonisation changed the relation of governments to citizens, and citizens to citizens. 4.2.3 PRESENTATION OF THE DRAFT HUMAN SECURITY FRAMEWORK Dr Kennedy Graham of the University of Canterbury then introduced the draft human security framework document for discussion by participants, inviting them to offer comments with a view to its revision based on the proceedings of the conference.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42d7eee6-f217-4b88-a1a9-fdf13d7d0d1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "42d7eee6-f217-4b88-a1a9-fdf13d7d0d1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a31bbb7583bced9788fa81e2f652fcaedcf33cc8a28f86bfb1adcae0ac5779a8"}, "2": {"node_id": "7e969532-8359-4bbf-be2f-be916448c4f3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "868303e09eede1cf7f9ff65b67658d512a8f0b4cca1cc7790418f6ec7180c222"}}, "hash": "572db3318d78ec256a387108aa4c0148833650dabe14a74bb7562f35db0ec404", "text": "He noted that the draft framework was no more than an outline that would require ongoing elaboration, and that it had been prepared at the request of the Paci\ufb01 c Islands Forum Secretariat in accordance with the Paci\ufb01 c Plan. He also emphasised the importance of integrating the proposals put forward in the paper with the positions that governments would be willing to support. He then outlined the contents of the draft regional framework. He stated that the draft human security framework for the Paci\ufb01 c aimed to take account of existing global frameworks (for example, the UN High Level panel", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "571e739c-5a63-4283-96e2-e15e9af97ca7": {"__data__": {"id_": "571e739c-5a63-4283-96e2-e15e9af97ca7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "595f24eb4cc83102678339791e566e950bb4eca0782eb4f09cdc352ec3fa2678"}, "3": {"node_id": "314cf813-513b-4587-aac9-d46574efe07c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57da07cb927e22d3d58072fb4b184d97f745258b8b60b427a2241a8464b5ead5"}}, "hash": "2a0383975da215e1b7c57d80a8b28643c2bb5289d2b06c947ea31bb24e506d25", "text": "on Threats, Challenges and Change report: A More Secure World \u2013 Our Shared Responsibility), and to relate these to the speci\ufb01 c context of the region. The threats identi\ufb01 ed by the High Level Panel included inter-state aggression, terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, intra-state instability and civil war, trans-national crime and socio-economic threats. Recognising the primary threats in the Paci\ufb01 c as regionally distinct, Dr Graham de\ufb01 ned the most important threats in the Paci\ufb01 c as: \ufb01 rstly, socio-economic threats; secondly, intra-state instability; and, thirdly and less signi\ufb01 cantly, terrorism and organised crime. Inter-state aggression, inter-region instability and WMD proliferation were characterised as only minor threats in the region. He pointed out that UNDP\u2019s conception of human security2 should not necessarily be described as a \u2018western\u2019 concept, but could instead be construed as a reinsertion of a non-western conception of security, representing a departure from a security paradigm based on the Westphalian system of states. He noted the distinct challenges facing the Paci\ufb01 c as proclaimed in the Suva Declaration: \u2022 The remoteness of the region; \u2022 The wide geographical dispersion of states within the region; \u2022 Fragile ecosystems; \u2022 A limited resource base; \u2022 The cultural clash between traditional lifestyles and the individual orientation of cash economies; \u2022 The cultural diversity within Paci\ufb01 c nation states. 2 De\ufb01 ned as \u02bbeconomic security, food security, health security, environmental security, personal security, community security and political security\u02bc in United Nations Development Programme, Human Development Report 1994, (New York/Oxford, OUP, 1994), p.24 as discussed above. Human Security Consultations Report 2007 21 He emphasised the need to distinguish the approach to human security in the Paci\ufb01 c region from the approach to security threats taken in other regions in the world because of these and other unique threats. He called for a dual timeframe for the implementation of the regional human security framework, to take account of the fact that evolutions in government policy take place over a longer term, while recognizing the need for speci\ufb01 c actions and more immediate responses from the region\u2019s governments. Dr Graham then outlined the relation of human security to the Paci\ufb01 c Plan, and argued that although the concept of human security had not been explicitly articulated as a central principle of Paci\ufb01 c Planning thus far, work towards achieving human security was inherent in each of the four key pillars of the Paci\ufb01 c Plan. The initiatives proposed in the draft human security framework can be summarised as follows: \u2022 Integration of human security into national development strategies \u2022 An early warning system \u2022 A mediation mechanism \u2022 A standing peace support mission capability \u2022 Con\ufb02 ict resolution education \u2022 Employment generation \u2022 Improved land management \u2022 Enhanced demographic planning \u2022 Good governance \u2022 Improved law enforcement \u2022 Human Rights ful\ufb01 lment \u2022 National women\u2019s empowerment programmes to counteract GBV \u2022 Upgrading strategies for responding to climate change \u2022 Engagement with regional civil society \u2022 Engagement with the private sector Dr. Graham noted that the conceptual framework of human security in the paper is based on three main pillars of political stability, economic sustainability and social ful\ufb01 lment, each containing a number of speci\ufb01 c sub-issues. Participants were invited to challenge and rework this conceptual framework in the course of the conference. Dr Graham concluded by further emphasising issues that are speci\ufb01 c to the Paci\ufb01 c and require careful consideration, including: regulation of maritime zones; prevalence of violence; youth anomie; and resource constraints. 4.2.4 GOVERNMENTAL RESPONSES TO THE DRAFT HUMAN SECURITY FRAMEWORK Governmental respondents were then invited to offer either of\ufb01 cial responses or unof\ufb01 cial views on the draft framework presented by Dr Graham. Vaine Makiroa Mokoroa, Director of the Central Planning & Policy Of\ufb01 ce, Of\ufb01 ce of the Prime Minister, Cook Islands, noted that his government had recently launched its national development Human Security Consultations Report 2007 22 plan.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "314cf813-513b-4587-aac9-d46574efe07c": {"__data__": {"id_": "314cf813-513b-4587-aac9-d46574efe07c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "595f24eb4cc83102678339791e566e950bb4eca0782eb4f09cdc352ec3fa2678"}, "2": {"node_id": "571e739c-5a63-4283-96e2-e15e9af97ca7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a0383975da215e1b7c57d80a8b28643c2bb5289d2b06c947ea31bb24e506d25"}}, "hash": "57da07cb927e22d3d58072fb4b184d97f745258b8b60b427a2241a8464b5ead5", "text": "He outlined the challenge of integrating the concept of human security into the existing national development plan, especially given the 27 strategies already scheduled for implementation under the plan. He particularly highlighted this in the context of the limited resources available for development in the Cook Islands. Teabo T Awerica, First Secretary, High Commission of Kiribati in Fiji, noted with concern the lack of reference in the draft framework to research and statistics documenting the situation of Small Island States. He further pointed out that the Government of Kiribati\u2019s key issue of concern is environmental, and thus noted that the issue of environment needed to be given greater priority in the framework.

He suggested there might be an overemphasis on recognizing and protecting individual rights, when the rights of families are much more relevant in the paci\ufb01 c context. He also noted the lack of suf\ufb01 cient human resources to devote to delivering a concerted strategy on human security at the national level in Palau. Two representatives from Solomon Islands offered responses. Ethel Sigimanu, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Women, Youth and Children, noted the newness of the concept of human security for the Solomon Islands government, and concurred that the traditional focus of governments in the region to date has been on issues such as terrorism and border integrity. Thus she af\ufb01 rmed that a new understanding has to be developed focusing on the individual as the focus of government security efforts, and that this would take time. Ms. Sigimanu linked the key human security threats in the Solomon Islands to ethnic tension and the violence of last March, noting that these issues are related to other processes and structural causes. She noted the need for a full understanding of the draft human security framework at local, national and regional levels before it can effectively be adopted. The approach presented to governments would have to be consistent and coherent, and describe a partnership approach between government, communities and civil society. She concluded by calling for further consultation between the different stakeholders, and emphasised the need for early warning mechanisms to be established to cover security threats and natural disasters. Sir Paul Tovua, of the National Peace Council for Solomon Islands, noted that there continue to be signi\ufb01 cant security challenges for Solomon Islands. He noted that for states that are both colonised and independent of colonial masters, the system of government, and the remoteness of government from its citizens remains a problem. He advocated the empowerment of traditional structures to address this. Sir Paul also drew attention to the problem of irresponsible exploitation of resources in Paci\ufb01 c countries, likening the impact of extraction industries and logging companies to the more visibly devastating impact of the recent tsunami on the country. The representative from Tonga noted his frustration at not being consulted earlier in the process. After thanking Dr Graham for his paper, he noted that he was overwhelmed by the scope of the paper. He stated that a paper of such scope would be dif\ufb01 cult to implement, but that the government of Tonga was committed to political reform. He commented that Samoa and Tahiti/French Polynesia were not listed as having distinct human security threats and should be added. He also requested that Tonga not be described as a \u2018feudal\u2019 but rather a \u2018monarchic\u2019 state. He concurred with the view that the family is disintegrating with the in\ufb02 uence of Western values. He was concerned that a security paradigm for Human Security Consultations Report 2007 23 the Paci\ufb01 c would emphasise too much security for individuals, without noting the need to build on the family support structures which are so bene\ufb01 cial and distinct in the region. Dr Graham responded to these comments by identifying an overall readiness to accept the concept of human security on the part of governments. He recognised that resources for governments to implement new initiatives on human security were constrained, and stressed the long term process that would be involved in shifting emphasis from state security to human security. He furthermore pointed out that emphasis on the individual has been a problematic model in the West, leading to patterns of over-consumption, the loss of a sense of community and the atomisation of society. He recognized that the familial and communal structures of traditional societies need to be brought into the paper as an original contribution of the Paci\ufb01 c to the concept of Human Security. The issues of colonialism and self-determination, and of keeping the region free of nuclear testing, were also raised as key human security issues in the region, and it was further argued that the paper under-emphasized the impacts and consequences of globalisation. 4.2.5 NON-GOVERNMENTAL PERSPECTIVES ON HUMAN SECURITY The afternoon session began with presentations of multi-stakeholder perspectives. The \ufb01 rst presentation came from Bishop Qiliho from the Paci\ufb01 c Conference of Churches (PCC). He raised the question of what we mean by security, and emphasized the need to talk in terms of \u2018wholeness\u2019 (mental, physical and spiritual balance). He characterised the Paci\ufb01 c as a religious area, and argued that it was therefore appropriate to include the dimension of spirituality in regional policy", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ed8650d-e808-4e5c-88db-60dd5b8e8fa5": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ed8650d-e808-4e5c-88db-60dd5b8e8fa5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef6e1c939fb1574cfa0e6ef25d58c7dc304d3550ba29600ac8079d6653612cb9"}, "3": {"node_id": "a689b144-0979-4aa6-a1f9-f3bbd44c80cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85e72e8a46323c631c9d7fa9de005e1e265f3ce2309a0321aff1ff248e0578ba"}}, "hash": "bfa2ec7f2142e40ee77e8934cc2486eebf96abd79767f1f486e5946d477a1d32", "text": "discussions. He also pointed out that individuals should be understood as members of families rather than simply as individuals themselves. Mr. Laitia Tamata brought a more traditional state security perspective to the discussion, but noting that while the Paci\ufb01 c has contributed to successful peacekeeping operations elsewhere, it has been less successful at keeping peace within the region itself. A potential human security framework therefore should aim to identify the alternatives to military action before resorting to force is considered. Peter Donigi, of PIAS-DG USP, former Ambassador of Papua New Guinea to the United Nations, raised a number of points for discussion by the conference that aimed to uncover and unpack some of the assumptions underpinning Dr Graham\u2019s paper. He \ufb01 rst challenged the assumption that the Paci\ufb01 c peoples accept the concept and the institutions of democracy as a given. He also challenged the effects of capitalism and the equation of capitalism with democracy, and noted the western assumption that land ownership relates to what is on top of the land and not what is below it as highly problematic in the Paci\ufb01 c. He pointed out the reluctance of the United Nations General Assembly to de\ufb01 ne human security, and therefore questioned the ability of the Paci\ufb01 c to take control of human security issues if the UN has been unable to do so. He questioned whether the issues identi\ufb01 ed as human security issues in the paper actually represent the true causes of con\ufb02 ict in the region, noting that much of what has been characterized as \u2018causes\u2019 are actually \u2018effects\u2019 of broader dynamics such as colonial legacies and destructive resource extraction. Finally, he urged that any regional response should not be developed based on the strategic interests of Australia. Ms. Emele Duituturaga spoke on private sector3 perspectives, and began by noting that the state is responsible for creating a viable context for business development, by providing infrastructure, 3 De\ufb01 ned as including multinational companies, government-owned private sector enterprises, and smaller businesses and ventures Human Security Consultations Report 2007 24 telecommunications, tax breaks and law and order, and highlighting the dif\ufb01 culty of accessing land faced by business investors in the Paci\ufb01 c. When investments disappear because of unreliable access to tenure or demands for compensation, the whole of society loses. She af\ufb01 rmed that human security is a responsibility for the state, and noted that an important issue to be addressed is cultural degradation. Ms Duituturaga concluded by stating that youth bulge is the rationale for realigning policy to re\ufb02 ect the needs of youth, and that a key threat comes from over-exploiting natural resources irresponsibly. A representative from the Secretariat of the Paci\ufb01 c Community (SPC) gave comments on the draft framework outlining the relevant response capacity of SPC. In her immediate response she considered it very positive for the framework to be aligned with the Paci\ufb01 c Plan, but noted that it should also link up with other frameworks approved by Paci\ufb01 c leaders and avoid replicating existing mechanisms. She outlined some existing programmes that have synergy with human security, such as public health programming, support for food security, education, and training and empowerment of youth. She also noted that due to the growing in\ufb02 uence of Asia in the Paci\ufb01 c, as well as the potential for threats such as avian in\ufb02 uenza to emanate from Asia, that North Paci\ufb01 c countries and issues need to be covered. Sharon Bhagwan Rolls offered a presentation summarising the outcomes of the preceding week\u2019s women, peace and security consultation (see summary above and separate outcomes document). Jone Dakavula gave a presentation representing the views of the Paci\ufb01 c People Building Peace network on the draft human security framework. He \ufb01 rst outlined the evolution of PPBP GPPAC, and emphasised the need for prevention of violent con\ufb02 ict to be a focus for the region. He stressed the interdependence between development, security and respect for human rights, and noted the added value that CSOs can bring, for example in mediating and resolving con\ufb02 icts, and in being able to respond more rapidly than larger organisations.

Reinvoking these structures would therefore, he argued, not necessarily re\ufb02 ect a solution to many human security problems from the perspective of Paci\ufb01 c women. 4.2.6 PIFS PERSPECTIVE ON HUMAN SECURITY Lawrie Cremin, Political and Security Of\ufb01 cer at the Paci\ufb01 c Islands Forum Secretariat, then made a presentation on the approach of PIFS to human security and its role in taking forward the draft human security framework. He con\ufb01 rmed that the outputs and recommendations from the workshop would be tabled at the June 2007 Forum Regional Security Committee (FRSC) meeting. This meeting would be broken down into two days of deliberation on a variety of issues \u2013 the \ufb01 rst day focusing on conventional security matters, including law and order, drug traf\ufb01 cking, and counter-terrorism, with the second day reserved for considering a wider array of issues. He noted that in the 2006 FRSC Human Security Consultations Report 2007 25 GROUP ISSUES AND CHALLENGES MONITORING CAPABILITIES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION meeting, it was decided that Human Security was a key concept that would enable a more holistic approach to a wide range of issues. Mr. Cremin challenged participants to think of ways to bring their concerns about human security to the table in ways that are amenable to states, and drew attention to the relatively conservative approach of PIF member governments, as well as their strongly differentiated characteristics. He argued that these differences between states mean that they are naturally cautious in approaching new ideas for collective approaches, particularly those which require a commitment of scarce resources. He therefore recommended that the conference focus on what could be delivered in the following twelve months, to lay the foundations for a further compact of action between governments and civil society to mitigate against future con\ufb02 ict in the region. He put forward three recommendations for consideration: \u2022 To support the plan for a regional early warning system; \u2022 To solidify the civil society networks coming from the previous two consultations as formative bodies to be built on in the future; \u2022 To set plans in motion to host annual Human Security conferences to regularise civil society interaction with governments at the regional level. He concluded by laying out the challenge as one of presenting the outcomes of this conference in a way that will make governments comfortable with the idea of human security while also demonstrating that there are suf\ufb01 cient resources available to attain it. This would require a cautious approach that would succeed in laying the foundation for future work. 4.2.7 IDENTIFYING THREATS, MONITORING CAPABILITIES AND RESPONSES Participants then broke into working groups and were asked to identify: key issues and challenges in relation to human security; monitoring capacities in relation to these; and responses and partnerships to address them.

He emphasised the need for partnerships in the region to be appropriate to the region, and thus for more emphasis on linking with traditional leaders, church groups (particularly in view of their extensive reach in the region) and the private sector. Dr. Boege particularly noted that approaches to human security for the Paci\ufb01 c must take into consideration the unique hybrid forms of politics and governance that exist in the region, in which local customary patterns and logics mix and overlap with introduced state and civil society patterns and logics. Recognition of the hybrid nature of Paci\ufb01 c governance systems was therefore asserted as an important starting point for any Human Security Consultations Report 2007 28 endeavours that aim at con\ufb02 ict prevention, development, peace-building and human security in the region. Dr Boege also noted the need to overcome misunderstandings that are the basis for many disputes \u2013 for example through dialogue to explain the different conceptions business owners and Paci\ufb01 c communities have of land. He noted dif\ufb01 culties arising from weak and strong partners assuming they have an equal relationship, drawing particular attention to how \ufb01 nancial resources, and even the processes that are followed (conferences, application procedures etc) change the dynamics of a relationship in a way that suits western actors but often does not \ufb01 t the people they are designed to help. Dr Boege also noted the need for village chiefs to be present in future discussions, and that it might be helpful for there to be a network of more traditional prominent \ufb01 gures in the region. This was supported by an illustrative example from Peter Donigi of the effectiveness of traditional, non-judicial approaches to dispute mediation. Dr Boege further discussed the need to contextualise human security for the Paci\ufb01 c, and drew attention again to the dilemma of whether to present human security as for the individual or for the family/ community. He also said that there would be much to gain from peer-to-peer exchanges, so that the lessons learned on peace-building in the region (Bougainville, Guadalcanal) could be shared with actors elsewhere. He noted that resource extraction industries could be engaged in relation to human security concerns by drawing attention to the \ufb01 nancial loss for previous businesses that have undertaken their operations with ignorance of the divisive effects and environmental impacts of their work. He noted the possibilities of networking globally to generate consumer pressure for corporate social responsibility. 4.2.9 IMPLICATIONS OF THE CONFERENCE FOR THE DRAFT HUMAN SECURITY FRAMEWORK In the \ufb01 nal session of the conference, Dr Kennedy Graham discussed how the conference would inform the redrafting of the human security framework document. He noted that the discussions had combined vision with realism. He thanked the representatives from governments for their comments, as well as noting that the civil society consultations of the previous week had also raised important points for the paper. He summarised his conclusions around six main points: \u2022 That the Paci\ufb01 c region for the purposes of the human security framework would be de\ufb01 ned as including PIF member states (and that the framework would not be driven by the security agenda of the metropolitan states); \u2022 That the paper needed to be structured to move more quickly from threats to capacity to response; \u2022 That the paper should place greater emphasis on the richness of the history of the region, and particularly the pre-colonial experience; \u2022 That human security could be de\ufb01 ned innovatively in the Paci\ufb01 c as achievable through the relation of the state to the community to the individual, rather than the relationship of the state directly to the individual.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c0b5ed2-6d00-4739-b922-5912266ef696": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c0b5ed2-6d00-4739-b922-5912266ef696", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "634422b1c388fa7ef23d4254b1f9980d19f9dc819f663ca4e9fe93737d0b622b"}, "2": {"node_id": "e0070497-3c99-4138-ad4e-3454118ccaca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6175adf17c4e99d28008670cf34b3eac122c9d5e2a7f431730f29eac2c0ed726"}}, "hash": "0fcf575890e031a980ed59bb3877df481915abd066a0882467a3d2a18196a2e3", "text": "More emphasis would also need to be placed on individuals and communities taking responsibility for their own human security; Human Security Consultations Report 2007 29 \u2022 That the uniqueness of the Paci\ufb01 c could be better de\ufb01 ned in the paper; \u2022 That vulnerability to environmental hazards could be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58a2fb1c-be7b-4d41-84b8-7103c2895e30": {"__data__": {"id_": "58a2fb1c-be7b-4d41-84b8-7103c2895e30", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "561f3555e314f2e089c7549a696ad9b77ce58f3f53ef33033362522d74b93671"}}, "hash": "561f3555e314f2e089c7549a696ad9b77ce58f3f53ef33033362522d74b93671", "text": "given much greater emphasis. Dr. Graham considered the need for further clarity as to whether weak governments should be seen as a threat or an imperfect response mechanism to con\ufb02 ict in the region, and concurred with the need for faith based organisations and the importance of religion in the region to be given greater prominence in the paper. He stated that nuclear testing and decolonisation debates would be handled with respect to the geographical delineation of the PIFS region, and noted that the private sector as both a threat and a potential partner in peace-building would be given greater attention. He also identi\ufb01 ed an emerging consensus on the need for an early warning and mediation mechanism in the region. Some \ufb01 nal comments to the conference called attention to the potential pitfalls of focusing uncritically on communities and families, because the assumption that it is always better to strengthen family and community structures presupposes that such structures do not in some instances uphold violence, injustice and inequality (for Paci\ufb01 c women in particular). Thus any strategy to work with communities and enhance community structures needs to be sensitive to the injustices and violence that individuals can be exposed to within those structures. Garry Wiseman concluded the conference proceedings with comments noting that the implementation of a human security framework is a long term process, of which this conference represents only the \ufb01 rst step. He thanked the various presenters for their contribution and the partners in conducting the workshops. 4.2.10 EVALUATION OF PROCEEDINGS The consultation process was evaluated through participant evaluation forms, completed at the end of each of the three separate consultations. For an analysis of these forms see Annex J. CONCLUSION An important achievement of the consultations was that they strengthened the consensus that, given the multi-dimensional nature of human security, responding effectively would require multi- stakeholder and multi-sectoral partnerships and collaboration. The draft human security framework that emerged from the discussions drew from the contributions of experts and practitioners from different sectors, including government of\ufb01 cials with important responsibilities in relation to peace and human security, intergovernmental bodies, the private sector, academia, religious organisations, development and donor agencies, and CSOs engaged in campaigning, mediation, community development, peace education, and advocacy on women\u2019s rights. The consultation successfully established the foundations on which national and regional platforms could be built to ensure the human security of individuals and their communities in the Paci\ufb01 c Region. Notwithstanding the overall recognition that the concept of human security raises some of the most critical issues for the Paci\ufb01 c region, participants pointed out important challenges that proponents of the concept are likely to face in implementing the framework in the Paci\ufb01 c. Given that the region (through the Paci\ufb01 c Plan) and many national governments already have existing national development strategies, the introduction of human security, with its demand for institutional realignment, will come up against resistance. Tact is therefore needed in how the concept is introduced and what is expected of governments in the short-term. It was also noted that the concept of human security as it has been de\ufb01 ned at the global level would be better adapted to the Paci\ufb01 c regional context if it is geared more to values important in the region. Thus the emphasis placed on the security and ful\ufb01 lment of the individual would need to give way in the Paci\ufb01 c context to a concept of human security geared more towards the well-being and viability of families and communities. Likewise, beyond the emphasis placed on social ful\ufb01 lment under the existing secular model of human security, attention was drawn to the importance of spiritual ful\ufb01 lment as a component of human security for Paci\ufb01 c peoples. Participants in both the women\u2019s and civil society consultations agreed that growing political, economic and social violence, including the ubiquitous nature of gender based violence, is a key threat to human security in many Paci\ufb01 c countries. Even where multinational assistance missions are deployed to end con\ufb02 icts or breakdowns in law and order, participants pointed out that neither their presence nor the implementation of subsequent programmes has effectively addressed the human security concerns of women and girls. Having reviewed the human security framework which highlights the identi\ufb01 cation, monitoring, analysis of, and response to threats, participants in all three consultations broadly agreed that in addition to the plethora of environmental hazards facing Paci\ufb01 c peoples, increasingly salient man-made threats are exacerbating the insecurity of individuals and communities in the region. These growing challenges include the pervasive nature of violence in paci\ufb01 c communities;", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77dd36fb-c6db-4843-9149-7172b9152360": {"__data__": {"id_": "77dd36fb-c6db-4843-9149-7172b9152360", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bab51e18b9848aec12c225623208b277164ec00c5ca92b1a9931b948aea437f4"}, "3": {"node_id": "d17bf93e-9510-4f4a-9297-0426595b5609", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e41fb54e5881f2b093caddfe3c39cd75e2d1dc4517c927b76db4368f83b3e461"}}, "hash": "98d9993353a8377a0e0d864ad2a6aaa2efeba58b845b457bf3fd05c3609c149a", "text": "population growth and the problem of \u2018youth bulge\u2019 coupled with insuf\ufb01 cient land and lack of equitable access to opportunities; the proliferation of small arms and light weapons throughout the region; and weaknesses in attempts to disarm, demobilize and reintegrate ex-combatants (both in post-con\ufb02 ict environments within the region and personnel returning from peace-keeping missions); and electoral violence linked to \ufb02 awed electoral processes. 30 Human Security Consultations Report 2007 5 Human Security Consultations Report 2007 31 In order to respond systematically to the de\ufb01 ciencies in the human security situation, recommendations common to the three consultations included the following: \u2022 Commissioning in-depth research at institutional and community levels to expose the magnitude of gender based violence including economic and social costs and document the social and political exclusion of women; \u2022 Launching of a broad-based and sustained campaign at all levels of society to educate both the general public and traditional and criminal justice institutions, in particular on the devastating effects of violence against women and its repercussions for social stability. The campaign should also target the repeal of all discriminatory laws; \u2022 Strengthening women\u2019s collaborative structures at local and national levels to work concertedly for the end of gender-based violence including the operation of an early warning mechanism to monitor gender based violence; \u2022 Participants requested the PIFS Gender Unit as the interim coordinating body for multi- stakeholder collaboration to implement the recommendations from the Women, Peace and Security consultations of June 2006 and April 2007; \u2022 Establishing a Paci\ufb01 c early warning system to identify and respond to increases in threat levels, co-ordinated by PIFS with national-level focal points; \u2022 Conducting local, national, and regional reviews of land ownership and tenure regulation and practices, and the development of appropriate solutions to land related disputes, also taking gender issues into account; \u2022 Establishing national councils to mediate land disputes with emphasis on traditional dispute resolution mechanisms; \u2022 Conducting research on youth and unemployment in the Paci\ufb01 c, to identify speci\ufb01 c solutions and inform youth-sensitive national and regional development policies; \u2022 Reviewing national and regional policies on mercenaries; \u2022 Assessing the level of reintegration in communities after disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR), and, if necessary, launching community based DDR to reduce the number of guns in circulation, and to enhance reintegration efforts and help develop safer, more integrated communities; \u2022 Development by governments of national strategies to prepare and respond adequately to the effects of global warming. Beyond these speci\ufb01 c recommendations, a prominent theme emerging from each consultation was the need for robust partnerships and broad-based collaborative efforts in order to address multi- faceted human security concerns. It emerged that effective partnerships should include not only governments and civil society, but also traditional power structures, the private sector and religious institutions. It is important that such partnerships do not paper over the very real differences that exist between stakeholders, but rather should seek to engage divergent views in constructive dialogues about mutually acceptable solutions. Therefore, partnerships should seek to identify opportunities for concerted and multi-layered responses around common goals and interests, while also recognizing that this requires \ufb02 exibility and genuine commitment to working out differences. As a result of the \ufb01 rst consultation with women, it was suggested that a multi-stakeholder partnership should be developed to take forward the recommendations emanating from that consultation, possibly to be coordinated by the Gender Unit of PIFS. As a result of the second consultation with civil society, the Paci\ufb01 c People Building Peace (PPBP) network was nominated as the lead collaborative Human Security Consultations Report 2007 32 framework through which civil society organizations will promote human security in the Paci\ufb01 c region. A 13-person Steering Committee with a 12-month work plan was agreed, with the PPBP to remain provisionally housed with the Citizens Constitutional Forum (CCF) in Suva, Fiji. The consultations have underscored that an effective strategy to address the pervasive and critical nature of human security threats to the peoples of the Paci\ufb01 c, as identi\ufb01 ed by participants, will require a long-term effort from donors, government, civil society, religious institutions and the private sector.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d17bf93e-9510-4f4a-9297-0426595b5609": {"__data__": {"id_": "d17bf93e-9510-4f4a-9297-0426595b5609", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bab51e18b9848aec12c225623208b277164ec00c5ca92b1a9931b948aea437f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "77dd36fb-c6db-4843-9149-7172b9152360", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "98d9993353a8377a0e0d864ad2a6aaa2efeba58b845b457bf3fd05c3609c149a"}}, "hash": "e41fb54e5881f2b093caddfe3c39cd75e2d1dc4517c927b76db4368f83b3e461", "text": "A partnership strategy to provide the underlying framework for this effort will, it is hoped, be adopted by PIF member governments in the coming months, and should be taken forward by extensive national-level consultations taking the needs and potentials of Paci\ufb01 c people fully into account.

The reality for many women, both in the Paci\ufb01 c Island Region and around the world, is that they are excluded from the very structures that make the decisions to sustain peace or engage in con\ufb02 ict. 4 Parts of the introduction to this paper directly reference and excerpt text from: \u02bbMaking Peace Work For Women \u2013 SCR 1325 Five Years On Report\u02bc. New York: NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security, 2005. Annex G Human Security Consultations Report 2007 48 The consequences of women\u2019s exclusion and marginalization pose a signi\ufb01 cant threat to sustainable human security. These consequences are far reaching and manifest into core security risks such as the absence of legal and human rights, lack of protection against gender-based violence and access to justice, health, education, as well as exclusion from participation in economic life, credit, land and natural resources. These consequences not only constitute underlying sources of political and economic instability, but also result in the weakening of social and family units. Just as important as the equal inclusion of women\u2019s needs and priorities is the effective implementation of gender policy and analysis. Genuine gender policy and analysis takes not only women into consideration, but critically examines the different roles, needs and priorities of both men and women, girls and boys, and in this context attempts to identify policies and practices that enhance equality and just outcomes for all actors in society. Further, a comprehensive gender approach also takes into consideration important dynamics such as ethnicity, class and culture. Likewise, it is not enough to merely \ufb01 ll quotas, but to engage women from a range of backgrounds who are also champions of the principles of human rights, peace and democracy and those women directly affected by con\ufb02 ict. Critical analysis of existing norms, institutions, and practices is required to arrive at a place where sustainable peace, democracy, and development can \ufb02 ourish. Such a critical lens must consider existing gender dynamics within speci\ufb01 c contexts and evaluate mechanisms and institutions for building change. These considerations and challenges must be acted upon holistically in partnerships between international, regional and national organizations, governments and civil society. Yet, despite increased understanding of what it takes to build sustainable peace and development, governments and the international community have not been very successful. This is perhaps most evident in the fact that roughly half of all countries that emerge from con\ufb02 ict lapse back into violence or instability within \ufb01 ve years. While the reasons that a peace fails to be sustained are always complex, weaknesses in international and regional responses are clearly a contributing problem.5 Weaknesses in current international and regional responses can be signi\ufb01 cantly strengthened by a holistic approach to the human security framework. Such a framework includes a comprehensive mainstreaming of gender perspectives, policy and analyses within the context of broader peace- building and development priority areas: from international and regional institutions and mechanisms, to national machineries to early-warning indicators and crisis prevention, politics, justice, economic participation, poverty reduction, small arms reduction, health, education, capacity building, land, resources and the environment. To date, several of the Paci\ufb01 c Island Forum (PIF) Member countries6 have committed themselves to a number of national, regional and international commitments to the advancement of women and girls and have demonstrated their commitments to gender equality by the adoption and implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW),7 the Millennium Development goals, the Paci\ufb01 c Platform for Action.8 Since the adoption of the Biketawa Declaration in 2000, PIF Members have also progressed towards the incorporation of the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 in the Paci\ufb01 c Plan for Regional Cooperation (2005) and with the high level adoption of the outcomes of the 2006 PIFS Gender, Con\ufb02 ict, Peace and Security workshop. Paci\ufb01 c Leaders now have the opportunity to intensify their commitment to and accelerate efforts towards collectively identifying a gender inclusive human security platform for development in this diverse region. 5 Parts of the introduction to this paper directly reference and excerpt text from: \u02bbSCR 1325 & the Peace-building Commission \u2013 SCR 1325 Six Years On Report\u02bc.

Only Tonga and Palau and Nauru are yet to ratify. 8 The Paci\ufb01 c Platform for Action for the Advancement of Women identi\ufb01 es key areas that need to be focused on to achieve gender parity and is grounded on international and and national development frameworks. Human Security Consultations Report 2007 49 III. Engendering the Paci\ufb01 c Human Security Framework Building on existing work and commitments, a regional coalition of women and gender experts promoting crisis prevention, human security, and peace-building should be established in order to strengthen Paci\ufb01 c regional and national human security frameworks, and to ensure effective partnerships between governments, CROP agencies, civil society organisations and development actors. The coalition would comprise non-governmental organizations. The establishment and funding of such a regional coalition would play an important role in efforts to mainstream gender and in identifying, analysing and responding to threats to human security in the Paci\ufb01 c. A Paci\ufb01 c Regional Committee on Women, Peace and Security, promoting crisis prevention, human security, and peace-building, could provide critical ongoing support the development and strengthening of a Paci\ufb01 c regional responsive human security framework, by continuing to advance implementation of the agreed recommendations of the Regional Workshop on Gender, Con\ufb02 ict, Peace and Security, in particular by: 1. Providing an annual update on Gender, Peace and Security issues during the annual Forum Regional Security Committee (FRSC) meeting. 2. Coordinating and disseminating a gender audit of peace agreements and regional declarations (e.g. Biketawa, All State of Forces Agreement, and related Parliamentary legislation) to ensure compliance with Security Council resolution 1325. 3. Assisting in the establishment and/or reconvening and strengthening national and regional Women, Peace and Security Committees made up of government and civil society to assisting PIF member countries in the implementation UNSCR 1325, CEDAW and other gender equality commitments as well as assisting in a review of existing national security and defence policies to ensure gender mainstreaming in the Paci\ufb01 c Human Security framework, while also developing national action plans for the implementation of 1325 including: a) Developing training workshops, awareness raising toolkits and guidelines to support 1325 implementation. b) Translating1325 into local languages. c) Documenting and sharing relevant experiences, information and strategies 4. Enabling women in civil society organizations to input into all aspects of con\ufb02 ict prevention, management, formal negotiations and resolution, including all reconstruction efforts, through inclusive consultative processes, empowerment training and capacity building of key individuals and organisations, establishment of processes and mechanisms to sustain their active and informed participation and engagement, and attention to building an environment which supports them to work in solidarity. 5. Conducting a regional study, building on the UNDP/UNIFEM/RRRT review of CEDAW implementation in nine Paci\ufb01 c countries, which identi\ufb01 es critical gaps in the advancement of women and gender policy that pose underlying security threats in the Paci\ufb01 c Region. 6. Establish a regional early warning system on peace and security in order to ensure a shift from reaction to prevention, in partnership with governments and CROP agencies. This should be coordinated by PIFS, to collect and disseminate gender disaggregated data on the range of women\u2019s human security concerns in the Paci\ufb01 c Region, covering issues of HIV/AIDS, levels and impacts of violence, perceptions of security, access to land, housing, resources, health and education services, levels of poverty and political empowerment. Human Security Consultations Report 2007 50 7. Contribute to the monitoring and transmission of information to policy-making and response frameworks, in order to ensure a shift from reaction to prevention. In doing so, relevant information and early warning could be communicated by the coalition nationally, regionally and internationally. 8. Produce detailed and concrete shadow reports reviewing legislation, policies, programmes, administrative procedures and regulations to ensure national compliance with the provisions of CEDAW and implementation of UNSCR 1325. The coalition should both submit timely reports to the United Nations on the progress of implementation and be present during any State report to the CEDAW committee or relevant UN body. 9.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "caefbab0-c5d8-4459-a056-978d418430c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "caefbab0-c5d8-4459-a056-978d418430c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3ceb29a4019a00ac987e80adc214a87ca2889d0139085957cfce464b38c2ea6"}, "2": {"node_id": "8a204073-d418-40df-abbe-669c79448917", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aaa4e0f221e5cb9064d2b58e090ff043165bad89ee676078ac7473930f33c4b0"}}, "hash": "4692ec141042c86be19fec2a210a81292ab0da6e523b5344519ca63760725f19", "text": "9.

Weak national mechanisms and machineries for advancing the integration of needs and priorities of women into national policies and programs result in ineffective mainstreaming of gender perspectives, policies and priorities. In turn, ineffective gender integration results in negative implications for national and regional instability and con\ufb02 ict. The Beijing Platform for Action stresses the importance of national machineries and the need for all parts of government to mainstream a gender equality perspective into their work. The Revised Paci\ufb01 c Platform for Action (PPA) recognizes that the successful implementation of the PPA largely depends on the institutional strength of national women\u2019s machineries and organisations. According to the PPA, although many Paci\ufb01 c Island countries reported speci\ufb01 c, targeted expenditures to women and girls in the form of funding of women\u2019s affairs, the national budget allocations ranged from a mere 0.002% to 1%.9 While the PPA recognizes that mainstreaming gender perspectives into budgetary policy is a long-term process, as is the importance of local conditions in shaping and sustaining such processes, it points out that, at present, Paci\ufb01 c Island governments have done little to formulate budgets that are truly gender responsive.10 As noted by the PPA, inadequate funding of national machineries for women and the lack of gender responsive budgets weaken the effective implementation of not only the Paci\ufb01 c Platform for Action, but the Beijing Platform for Action, Millennium Development Goal 3, the Commonwealth Plan of Action and CEDAW. In order to integrate and institutionalize gender mainstreaming efforts throughout government ministries and departments, the PPA recommends that \u2018national machineries for women to be suf\ufb01 ciently \ufb01 nanced and resourced with an increased number of professional and technical staff necessary for gender mainstreaming efforts in policy and legislative processes and capacity-building support for other government ministries and departments\u201911 including the establishment of gender policy and planning units in the of\ufb01 ces of the Prime Minister or President, Finance and Planning departments or equivalent policy-making departments. Recommendations for further action: \u2022 Conduct a series of national Gender and Security workshops in the region with members of government to: raise awareness of gender issues and their signi\ufb01 cance in policies and budgets; promote political will amongst relevant senior of\ufb01 cials and politicians to integrate a gender perspective into policies and budgets; and establish effective monitoring and enforcement system of incentives and/or penalties. \u2022 Create a roster of regional and national gender experts available for government positions and potential gender posts. 9 Revised Paci\ufb01 c Platform for Action.

Cultural beliefs, religious practices and social bias, and a lack of awareness of legal rights hinder the exercise of rights.\u2019 (Para.39) Access to justice, good governance and rule of law is fundamental to the maintenance of peace and security. Women\u2019s lack of access to justice, weaknesses in upholding the rule of law, lack of gender- sensitivity of law enforcement agencies, weakness in response to violence against women are all evident in areas of the Paci\ufb01 c region. This failure in human security signi\ufb01 cantly weakens women\u2019s status and destabilizes communities. Human Security Consultations Report 2007 53 The revised PPA does note considerable progress made throughout the Paci\ufb01 c region in recognising gender issues in relation to legal and human rights, acknowledging the legal literacy and human rights strengthening activities of the Regional Rights Resource Team (RRRT), and their work with UNDP to produce a guide to assist Paci\ufb01 c countries with reporting obligations under CEDAW. However, in a review of CEDAW Legislative Compliance in 9 Paci\ufb01 c Countries UNDP/UNIFEM found that \u2018although the Marshall Islands, FSM and its states guarantee men and women the equal protection of the law and Fiji, Kiribati, Samoa and Vanuatu guarantee equality before the law, and \ufb01 nally Tuvalu guarantees freedom under the law, none of the nine countries examined guarantee women equal bene\ufb01 ts or outcomes as required by CEDAW.\u201912 Recommendations for further action: \u2022 Governments, where appropriate with international assistance, should establish legal aid assistance programmes with effective participation of women\u2019s NGOs working with expertise in this area, to ensure that women not only have access to the judicial process, but also to equal bene\ufb01 ts and outcomes as required by CEDAW. \u2022 Strengthen the capacity of women\u2019s non-governmental organizations in the Paci\ufb01 c Island Region to produce detailed and concrete shadow reports reviewing legislation, policies, programmes, administrative procedures and regulations to ensure national compliance with the provisions of CEDAW. They should both submit timely reports to the United Nations on the progress of implementation and be present during the State reports to the CEDAW committee. \u2022 Strengthen the capacity of non-governmental organizations in the Paci\ufb01 c Island Region to undertake the process of producing detailed and concrete shadow reports reviewing legislation, policies, programmes, administrative procedures and regulations relevant to adherence to Security Council resolution 1325. They should submit and widely circulate annual shadow reports to the Of\ufb01 ce of the Special Advisor on Gender Issues and the Advancement of Women to the Secretary-General in June of each year, in advance of the anniversary of SCR 1325 in October. \u2022 Regional governments should commit to conducting, in partnership with CSOs or development agencies, gender trainings and gender policy development for regional judiciaries and security sectors.

In short, violence against women is costly in \ufb01 nancial and human terms to society, to culture, to public health and to productivity.\u2019(Para. 50) Gender-Based violence is one of the largest and most pervasive threats to overall human security. Failing to engage with the causes and consequences of sexual and gender-based violence has long- term implications for sustainable peace-building and development. Gender-based violence not only affects women\u2019s health and well-being, but also impacts their economic status, productivity and ability to claim or defend their rights. When these vital components are missing, the full and effective participation of women in political, economic and social processes is compromised, thereby also compromising national security, peace and development.13 As pointed out in the Paci\ufb01 c Platform for Action violence against women is extremely costly and destabilizing to society, with far reaching impacts on public health, productivity, family life, culture and many other aspects of society.14 13 Opt. cit.n.6 14 Ibid. Human Security Consultations Report 2007 55 The Paci\ufb01 c Platform for Action calls for the elimination of domestic violence to be made a national priority. The Platform notes that, since 1993, there has been progress made including increased donor support for counselling and civil action centres in several Paci\ufb01 c countries based on a model developed by the Fiji Women\u2019s Crisis Centre. Further, a new model for addressing family and sexual violence in PNG adopts a comprehensive and long-term strategy involving government and non-government cooperation. The PPA also notes that has that there has been considerable improvement in some countries in police attitudes toward domestic violence.15 According to the recent review of CEDAW implementation in nine Paci\ufb01 c countries \u2018All nine countries examined have legislated against sexual assault. PNG in 2003 and the Marshall Islands in 2005 have introduced new sexual assault regimes which, in compliance with CEDAW, include a comprehensive range of offences, graded to re\ufb02 ect the seriousness of the harm to the victim.\u201916 However, despite progress made by the PPA: \u2018violence and sexual violence are common occurrences in Paci\ufb01 c Island countries and go largely unopposed because of entrenched cultural or legal norms.\u201917 For instance, sexual assault laws of seven countries in the review were found to fail to provide adequate protection and penalties for the range of sexual violations perpetrated against girls and women.18 Likewise, common law rules have made it dif\ufb01 cult to prosecute sexual assault offenders. And, although the PPA notes progress made in police attitudes toward domestic violence, the review of the implementation of CEDAW in nine Paci\ufb01 c countries found a lack of minimum sentences and mandatory prosecution and that none of the nine countries examined have incorporated domestic violence offences into their criminal laws.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0874c98-a117-4b00-8a7c-73ce320918e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0874c98-a117-4b00-8a7c-73ce320918e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "713b7f71e0536c248ab259e7bfffa6cbc3fa40cd5096ca9d373808164723e7be"}, "2": {"node_id": "be2e9cf5-8afa-4db0-a057-dbc4f674619d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5be51e816ab31e282987321e54f41f8ca56e21bbc7cca9e7c85b10fc705c07a8"}}, "hash": "0b31e375e278bc97e879f254a6de710cfabba507d99fc0097fe6a3bc026a0fca", "text": "Recommendations for further action: \u2022 Build a partnership for collecting disaggregated data on violence against women and perceptions of human security in the Paci\ufb01 c Region. \u2022 In countries where Common Law rules still apply, call for legislation eliminating the requirements for corroboration, proof of resistance, and admission of prior sexual history. \u2022 Regional governments should commit to the incorporation of domestic violence into criminal law. \u2022 Regional governments and CSOs should commit to improving and monitoring the law and justice response to violence against women,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5152b6c-e559-410a-bf17-ffa5fd1f332d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5152b6c-e559-410a-bf17-ffa5fd1f332d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8215d127a6b46cb74b37cc425c9c0de2dd97f0acb6de7dad845195fbdd44befb"}, "3": {"node_id": "dc38d9a2-0730-49b8-862a-32cae2bc20bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f648a8a50c7631f81e66c5fa62d3a613cc91ed4121d1026bf3917234c7e33b8"}}, "hash": "f3f10670ec86a3fbc6f2c3782960f94530028c42c81213aa0cd16f6ab5187f93", "text": "including increasing numbers of women judges and police, and improving levels of reporting, and prosecution/conviction rates for reported violence against women. \u2022 Developing community level initiatives for protecting women including women\u2019s safe houses. \u2022 PIF member governments should increase female representation in discipline forces, with a target of 25% by 2009 in police, peacekeeping operations in the region and in regional contributions to extra-regional peacekeeping operations; \u2022 CSOs and governments should co-operate in implementing co-ordinated national awareness campaigns to change attitudes to violence against women.

Human Security Consultations Report 2007 59 Article 16 of CEDAW obligates States Parties to eliminate discrimination in family and personal laws including marriage, separation, divorce, child custody, property division, paternity and inheritance. However, the CEDAW review of nine Paci\ufb01 c States found that the application of the indicators in this area revealed low compliance in all. The review also found that each constitution in the nine Paci\ufb01 c countries gives constitutional status to custom law, with none containing a guarantee that equality law will take precedence over custom law. Further, the PPA recognises that violence against women is a signi\ufb01 cant ongoing issue for Paci\ufb01 c countries and that \u2018violence and sexual violence are common occurrences in Paci\ufb01 c Island countries and go largely unopposed because of entrenched cultural or legal norms.\u201920 Women in the Paci\ufb01 c are diverse and are affected by discrimination and discriminatory laws, policies, customs and practices in different ways. The experiences of indigenous women and girls as well as ethnic minorities are compounded by both public and private spheres where they often face an additional layer of violence, widespread discrimination, poverty, cultural marginalization, and lack of access to natural resources and legal rights. Indigenous women and ethnic minorities also face powerful cultural contradictions between group rights and traditions and universal norms. Changes to social and economic life also impacts women in relation to culture and family. The PPA contends that \u2018urbanisation, monetised economies and changing values have contributed to a trend toward nuclear families with a proportional weakening of kin relations. Approximately 30% of the population in Paci\ufb01 c Island countries now live in towns, whereas only twenty years ago the number was less than 10% in most countries.\u2019 The PPA recommends the \u2018promotion and strengthening of family life education where men and women are encouraged to share the commitment, responsibilities, decision-making and duties of raising a family and caring for the elderly, persons with disabilities and with other special needs.\u201921 Without effective application of family and personal law and without establishing and upholding a guarantee that equality law will take precedence over custom law, socio-economic goals such as shared decision-making, prevention and protection from gender-based violence and women\u2019s participation in the economy and political life become very dif\ufb01 cult to achieve. These disparities create serious obstacles to equality, development, peace and security. Recommendations for further action: \u2022 Conduct an in-depth study with indicators, in partnership with regional theological and faith based institutions into the effects of culture, family, tradition and religion on women\u2019s human security in the Paci\ufb01 c. \u2022 Advocate for law reform so that equality under the constitution will take precedence over customary law. Establish legal assistance centers to help women know the law and seek justice. \u2022 CSOs and Governments should address disparities and changes in cultural values through training and outreach, particularly to tackle the pervasive acceptability of violence against women in Paci\ufb01 c Island culture. 20 Ibid. 21 Ibid.

"text": "c Platform for Action (2004): \u2018Recent con\ufb02 ict situations in some of the Paci\ufb01 c Island countries have affected women and children more negatively than other sections of the society. Experience of women and girls in situations of armed con\ufb02 ict, which is intricately linked to their status in society, is that, despite women\u2019s continued role in peace making and social maintenance before, during and after situation of con\ufb02 ict at the community level, women have usually been marginalised in formal peace processes.\u2019 (Para.113) The United Nations Security Council recognizes that an understanding of the impact of armed con\ufb02 ict on women and girls, effective institutional arrangements to guarantee their protection and full participation in the peace process can signi\ufb01 cantly contribute to the maintenance and promotion of peace and security. Human Security Consultations Report 2007 61 PPA recognizes that \u2018in times of armed con\ufb02 ict, human rights violations are frequent. Often these violations disproportionately affect women and children. Since 1993, three Paci\ufb01 c Island countries have experienced violent con\ufb02 icts: Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Fiji. Women played an instrumental role in the peace-making process in Bougainville, and in the Solomon Islands. The Fiji National Ministry of Women was consulted during the process of Fiji\u2019s National Defense Review in 2000, through the Women, Peace and Security Committee and the National Council of Women also made a submission.\u2019 However, as the PPA indicates, despite women\u2019s continued role in peace making and social maintenance before, during and after situation of con\ufb02 ict at the community level, women have usually been marginalised in formal peace processes.\u2019 Under CEDAW women are guaranteed equal protection before the law and all discriminatory laws must be amended. The goal of CEDAW is de facto or actual equality, thus laws and policies must take into account past discrimination, including the disparate impact of con\ufb02 ict on women. Access to justice and redress for gender-based violence is a key component to ensuring peace, reconciliation and stability in society. Until discriminatory laws are removed and compensation for past discrimination is provided women will not have true access to justice nor be able to exercise full participation in society and governance. Recommendations for further action: \u2022 Building on the recommendations of the PPA, recognise and enhance women\u2019s inclusion in early warning systems, con\ufb02 ict prevention peace processes and negotiations and post con\ufb02 ict reconstruction. \u2022 Building on the recommendations of the PPA, recognise the need to address the processes of peace and justice in decision-making and con\ufb02 ict resolutions. \u2022 PIFS should: - building on the recommendations of the PPA, utilise the provisions under the Biketawa Declaration to proactively monitor national security situations with a view to averting potential con\ufb02 icts and resolving possible con\ufb02 icts by peaceful means. - Ensure increased representation of women at all decision-making levels in regional institutions and mechanisms for the prevention, management, and resolution of con\ufb02 ict. - Develop guidelines and materials on the protection, rights and the particular needs of women, as well as on the importance of involving women in all peacekeeping and peace-building measures. - Develop mechanisms and commitments for protecting civilians, including women, in times of con\ufb02 ict and breakdown of law and order. \u2022 PIF member governments should - Include more women in the military, civilian police, human rights and humanitarian personnel. - Ensure increased representation of women at all decision-making levels in national institutions and mechanisms for the prevention, management, and resolution of con\ufb02 ict - Ensure standards are adopted at the national level on the protection, rights and the particular needs of women, as well as on the importance of involving women in all peacekeeping and peace- building measures, and ensure that these elements, as well as HIV/AIDS awareness training, are incorporated into national training programmes for military and civilian police personnel in preparation for deployment.

However, women\u2019s limited access to and control over resources, insuf\ufb01 cient purchasing power and lack of tenure and ownership of land impacts sustainable development and security. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), recognizes that, \u2018As the majority of the world\u2019s poor, women play decisive roles in managing and preserving biodiversity, water, land and other natural resources, yet their centrality is often ignored or exploited. This means that a chance for better management of those resources is lost, along with opportunities for greater ecological diversity, productivity for human sustenance and economic development.\u2019 Human Security Consultations Report 2007 63 Women\u2019s ability to exercise control over environment-related decisions such as harvesting and cropping methods, allocation of bene\ufb01 ts including income, and conservation and environmental regeneration operations is, to a large extent, determined by their position in the family and political participation. The PPA recognizes the poor management of natural resources as a source of con\ufb02 ict in the Paci\ufb01 c region and encourages further examination for options for natural resource management in the context of peace building and con\ufb02 ict prevention. The Consultation notes that only one third or more of people employed at decision-making levels in environmental of\ufb01 ces are women. It also notes that in the past decade there has not been much research on women\u2019s indigenous knowledge, resource management and environmental preservation. It is further noted that women are actively involved in many national, regional and international environmental civil society organisations in the Paci\ufb01 c. \u2018The South Paci\ufb01 c Regional Environmental Programme (SPREP) works at the regional level.

Further, negative impacts on women\u2019s health and lack of attention to their speci\ufb01 c health needs and rights, particularly availability of family planning, creates a destabilizing domino effect which results in wider instability inside of families and communities. The lack of access to or provision of a range of health care services and rights, protection from gender- based violence, and inability make independent health choices contribute to an increase in women\u2019s vulnerability to sexually transmitted diseases, especially as HIV/AIDS. The review of CEDAW implementation in nine Paci\ufb01 c countries reveals that, although all Paci\ufb01 c Island countries provide family planning services, access to services varies. Abortion, for instance, is prohibited in all Paci\ufb01 c Island countries. The PPA recognizes HIV/AIDS as a prime health issue and acknowledges that \u2018there is, in fact, a direct and reciprocal relationship between increased vulnerability to HIV/AIDS and decreased human security. Different social roles and expectations for women and men, some of which are rooted in culture, decrease security and heighten vulnerability both to HIV infection and other social and economic impacts of the disease. Alcohol abuse, cultural and gender inequalities including denial and lack of knowledge about HIV/AIDS, the prevalence of violence and sexual violence against women, and inequality of social and economic status increase women\u2019s vulnerability to HIV/AIDS.\u2019 The spread of HIV/AIDS is on the rise in the Paci\ufb01 c. Entrenched gender inequalities, such as women\u2019s lack of empowerment vis-\u00e0-vis sexual partners, affects their ability to negotiate contraceptive choices and to refuse sex. This signi\ufb01 cantly reduces women\u2019s ability to protect themselves against HIV/ AIDS. The phenomenon of widespread sexual violence, including rape, has worrying implications for the spread of HIV/AIDS. The spread of the disease in the Paci\ufb01 c has deadly and costly impacts that threaten to undermine the very fabric of society, such as leaving children parentless, which in turn will increase the poverty and marginalisation of children and youth \u2013 already a key threat to stability in the region. Recommendations for further action: \u2022 Closely monitor health reforms and the social impacts on women and their families by National Women\u2019s Machineries, paying speci\ufb01 c attention to women with disabilities who often face double discrimination and challenges. \u2022 Strengthen the linkage with national and regional health / HIV-AIDS policy to address the linkage between women\u2019s vulnerability to HIV/AIDS as a result of violence, poverty, etc. \u2022 Ensure greater equality for women in accessing health services. \u2022 PIFS and PIF member governments should adopt comprehensive regional and national HIV/ AIDS strategies. \u2022 PIF member governments, with regional and/or international assistance, should implement strategies to tackle GBV in the worst affected localities.

Women\u2019s effective economic participation in and contribution to the strengthening of national and local economies \u2013 and thereby the strengthening of communities and families - provides increased national and regional stability. It has been widely observed that women use their income to the direct bene\ufb01 t of their families and wider community. Political instability resulting from con\ufb02 ict creates economic disadvantage for women which often results in displacement, which is dif\ufb01 cult to recover. Unstable economic situations for women increases the likelihood that they encounter violence in their day to day lives.24 Women from civil society in Fiji, for instance, \u2018spoke about violence against women and the political upheavals of May 2000- the civilian coup - literally in the same breath. It became evident that many saw a strong correlation between the continuing fact of violence at the national level - the idea that Fiji was stuck in a \u2018coup cycle\u2019, unresolved intercommunal tensions, rising poverty levels - and violence between men and women at the micro level.\u2019 In order for women to be participating and contributing most productively in economic life, a gendered analysis and response to their speci\ufb01 c needs and priorities in the labor force must be addressed. Labor force data must also be collected and analysed in a way that takes into account the political climate and women\u2019s differential labor contributions. The PPA points out that \u2018although labour force data is available for all countries it is dif\ufb01 cult to make regional overviews and comparisons because of different ways information is collected and analysed. For example, the signi\ufb01 cance of women\u2019s contributions to the informal sector may not always be recognised. Even simple differences in the way \u2018work\u2019 is de\ufb01 ned or the way census questions are asked impact on the results. More attention to gender sensitivity is needed both in the collection of data on labour force and economic information and in its statistical analysis.\u201925 24 George, Nicole \u02bbSubmission to Senate Inquiry : Australia\u02bcs Relations with Papua New Guinea and the Island States of the South West Paci\ufb01 c.

It also other has far reaching implications for their status and decision-making in the family, social spheres, participation in political life, ability to claim and defend their rights, self-esteem, and can extend to the well-being of families and communities. The availability of resources for women\u2019s economic empowerment and development, however, is essential. Such resources can assist individuals with their own responses to earning income and can also ensure that issues relating to the environment of rural dwellers and subsistence-based households are sustained - such as women and \ufb01 sheries. Women\u2019s economic participation and its relationship to human security also have ties to global forces such as trade negotiations and liberalisation. The PPA recognizes, \u2018For Paci\ufb01 c women, trade liberalization will bring new economic opportunities as well as job losses in agriculture, manufacturing and \ufb01 shing particularly employment opportunities in these industries, but there are negative effects of globalisation as well including the risk of reduced family food crops as they are replaced by employment in cash crop industries. Regional trade Agreements provide tools to respond to and address the implications of globalisation on Paci\ufb01 c economies and should be encouraged to mainstream gender into government policies to address food security and health issues and other social problems relating to women.\u2019 Recommendations for further action: \u2022 As pointed out by the PPA, more attention to gender sensitivity is needed both in the collection of data on labour force and economic information and in its statistical analysis. \u2022 Ensure women are able to access micro and macro level assistance for their desired economic activities, with particular support to women\u2019s participation in income generating activities in rural areas and in disadvantaged households as well as in women-headed households. \u2022 Building on the PPA, encourage the Forum Secretariat Gender Adviser to jointly collaborate with other relevant agencies to conduct gender impact studies of trade liberalisation under instruments such as PICTA and EPA and monitor the gender implications of trade agreements including those under negotiation, with a view to addressing negative impacts on women\u2019s livelihoods and status, speci\ufb01 cally the impacts of tariff revenue losses, job losses, land registration/privatisation and liberalisation of utilities, health and education. \u2022 Building on the PPA, mainstream gender issues and concerns into trade negotiations and discussions and delay making further trade liberalisation commitment without substantive consultation with countries and territories. Human Security Consultations Report 2007 68 11 Poverty Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW): Article 3: \u2018States Parties shall take in all \ufb01 elds, in particular in the political, social, economic and cultural \ufb01 elds, all appropriate measures, including legislation, to en sure the full development and advancement of women , for the purpose of guaranteeing them the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms on a basis of equality with men.\u2019 Poverty is a key driver of regional and national insecurity. Often, women are among the most impoverished and disadvantaged part of the population. The PPA notes \u2018that in the last decade poverty has worsened in some Paci\ufb01 c countries, and within countries, poverty has increased among certain disadvantaged groups including single mothers, and women and youth.\u2019 The poverty among women is a serious security risk as it is not only an indication of lack of gender equity, but signals potential breakdown of or non-existence of egalitarian social structures, democracy and good governance. The PPA points out that poverty may be measured in a variety of ways but often the information that is necessary for these indicators does not exist for most Paci\ufb01 c Island countries.

Its main objectives are: \ufb01 rst, to highlight the very signi\ufb01 cant shift from \u2018security\u2019 being perceived as the survival of the state to \u2018security\u2019 being broadened to mean the survival or people and their communities; and second, to stimulate discussion on the role of Paci\ufb01 c civil society groups in this wider conceptualization of security. Threats to human security are a mixture of previously known threats as well as some that are completely new. Together they increase the vulnerability of Paci\ufb01 c islands people and communities. It is envisaged that the Workshop deliberations will help formulate a civil society advocacy agenda document for presentation to the Paci\ufb01 c Islands Forum Regional Security Committee (FRSC). Particular attention is given to the role of civil society in establishing human security, in partnership with government, regional and international institutions. It has been increasingly recognized that achieving satisfactory levels of human security requires the involvement of wider civil society. Local groups and communities, women and youth, formal and informal organizations need to share their knowledge and experience of risks and threats to their well being and how best these can be prevented and mitigated. Their expectations about the role of various agencies such as community leaders, local and central government of\ufb01 cers and the extent of their own capacity and preparedness need to be shared. This will help move Paci\ufb01 c people to a more clear sighted perspective on the risks and threats that affect their human security and possible ways of dealing with them at the individual, family, local community, national, regional and international levels. Introduction Paci\ufb01 c island communities have survived and sustained themselves over several millennia by giving due regard to the multiple dimensions of what is being conceptualized as \u2018human security\u2019. Human security focuses attention on the wide ranging security issues that affect people as individuals and communities and threaten safe and relatively secure living, and the ways of tackling them. With the integration into the world economy brought about by colonialism, and in the contemporary period of globalization, the challenges to human security have signi\ufb01 cantly increased and have become more complex. There are many internal and external threats to human security and often external factors Annex H Human Security Consultations Report 2007 70 generate internal changes that may have signi\ufb01 cant consequences for a Paci\ufb01 c Island country. Human Security is de\ufb01 ned as a holistic approach to dealing with the range of threats that affect individuals and communities. In this sense it means achieving freedom from want and freedom from fear. Freedom from want is mainly achieved through employment and meaningful livelihoods. People are able to meet all their basic needs including food and shelter as well as access education, health and social security services provisioned by the state through appropriate public policies and institutions. Freedom from fear means that they are protected from crime and violence, intrusive and predatory actions of the state, and are able to participate in decision making bodies and freely choose representatives to those bodies which make decisions that affect their lives. Human security denotes therefore the elimination of poverty and the empowerment of people to meet a range of challenges to their security. It involves the participation of various actors including the state in anticipating and preventing insecurities, alleviating their impacts and in the longer term, rehabilitation of affected people and communities. It also involves the empowerment of people in Paci\ufb01 c island countries (PICs) to take pro-active measures and also to demand such measures to keep their communities safe from insecurities. Human security therefore focuses on both recognizing the threats to security and how best to deal with them whilst enhancing human development and human rights. Security Threats in PICs The Paci\ufb01 c Island Forum Secretary General has provided a reasonably comprehensive list of threats facing PICs: \u2018Forum Island Countries are faced with a wide variety of security threats. These range from natural disasters, environmental degradation, climate change and rising seas to food shortages and, in broad terms, the challenges of globalization. Economic reform strategies which involve, for example, downsizing the public sector and privatization will, if not properly sequenced, managed and implemented, have social impacts-unemployment and increasing urban poverty for example-that can become a source of security threats. Many more people die from and are threatened by poverty, hunger and disease, and natural and environmental disasters than they are by wars or terrorism in this region\u2019 (Paci\ufb01 c Plan The Way Forward).

As very small and non-competitive producers of raw materials, these island states are extremely vulnerable to \ufb02 uctuations in commodity prices. Most are heavily dependant on one or two commodities. They are price takers rather than price makers. They are producers of (much) that they do not consume and consumers of (much) that they do not produce. Human capital loss is a major concern for some of them. They are variously subject to a full range of natural hazards such as cyclones, droughts, \ufb02 ooding and tidal surges, earthquakes and tsunamis as well as volcanic activities. Brindley (2004) discusses Human Security Consultations Report 2007 71 three different vulnerability indexes which show that PICs are amongst the most vulnerable countries in the world. A composite vulnerability index that takes account of a country\u2019s openness (export dependence), lack of economic diversi\ufb01 cation and its susceptibility to natural disasters to measure vulnerability places Paci\ufb01 c Island Countries (PICS) and other small island states amongst the top 30 of the most vulnerable countries out of 111 countries. \u2018Vanuatu is ranked the most vulnerable of any of the 111 states; Tonga comes in 3rd, Fiji 8th, the Solomon Islands 11th, Samoa 20th, Papua New Guinea 30th, and Kiribati 59th \u2026.\u2019 (Brindley, 2004, p.23). As if economic vulnerability and natural hazards are not enough to deal with, \u2018man made\u2019 disasters abound. These include lack of accountability by state power holders, serious shortcomings in the rule of law, pubic \ufb01 nance mismanagement, outright corruption and military intervention in democratic processes. In a number of the largest countries, security forces have become the primary sources of insecurity.26 Poor leadership and lack of vision and appropriate public policies together with the processes of peripheral capitalism have led to growing social inequality and poverty. In the larger island countries signi\ufb01 cant numbers of children do not attend schools as these are not accessible or affordable. The lack of opportunities for gainful employment and amenities for recreational activities have spawned counter cultures of delinquency, crime and drug abuse amongst unemployed young men and women.27 Sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/Aids are becoming widespread. Idle young men have provided the foot soldiers for unscrupulous leaders in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. Domestic violence and violence against women and children is widespread. In Papua New Guinea, Bougainville and the Solomon Islands weapons including guns have aggravated injuries and mortalities in con\ufb02 icts between groups. For much of the last two decades PICs have experienced stagnating and even periodically declining rates of economic growth even though on per capita terms a number of countries and the region as a whole have the highest development assistance \ufb02 ows. \u2018Despite the size of these aid \ufb02 ows, real per capita growth rates over the period have been disappointing. The average for the Paci\ufb01 c over the 20- year period to 2001 was 0.8 per cent per annum, compared to 1.1 percent for the rest of the world. However, the last decade has been even worse, with the Paci\ufb01 c averaging a contraction of 0.1 per year, compared to the world average of 1.4 per cent growth\u2019 (Brindley, 2004, p. 4).28 Despite this high level of capital in\ufb02 ow, it is anticipated that Oceania will lag behind with Sub Saharan African in achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. These include reducing by half the number of people in extreme poverty and hunger; universal education and gender equality in access to higher education, wage employment and proportion of seats in parliament; reducing child mortal by two thirds; reducing maternal mortality by 75 per cent; combating HIV/Aids, malaria and other disease; ensuring environmental sustainability (reverse loss of environmental resources, halve the number of people without access to safe drinking water and improvement in lives of slum dwellers).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5cb1340b-fd1e-4d20-8950-f3586369a457": {"__data__": {"id_": "5cb1340b-fd1e-4d20-8950-f3586369a457", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d6ad651a52f5402735efb28037bdfa98d7ab54e86e16309246364e89d90c2cde"}, "2": {"node_id": "4238e3c2-c714-433c-931b-111a46ae0972", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c27f52ab18f3af793919cd2f26ffa50c52efc5db33ece50e94ca28e0fd2f3a65"}}, "hash": "698249df089afe2ae0b39f46f6cd87672e91722f7afc5726804ad06528e00c4c", "text": "While PICs statistics with respect to these goals and indicators are distorted by the Melanesian countries in general and Papua New Guinea in particular with almost three quarters of the population, it is never-the-less a sobering reminder of a paradise lost.29 26 The ethnically exclusive Fijian military has engaged in four military coups undermining democratic electoral outcomes; the Solomon Island police was involved in the 2000 coup", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0a3c5a3-97c9-4e9c-a72c-3b15bccbc8f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0a3c5a3-97c9-4e9c-a72c-3b15bccbc8f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ed4c49459d999edbd7f4c8178c52f7b0974424e498b2e99a37fdb8b63f42bcef"}, "3": {"node_id": "0fce28ce-c45b-45a1-91b8-4afa80821123", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ae63f3fcd05449e2b3a305aaf1db7a2fc30c9bd70b50a0ed6d5e823ce40fc2e"}}, "hash": "8b8e43dfdf3b1f3ab3516614fd3281cd55273898cfa7f449a8455c2878aef296", "text": "which overthrew Prime Minister Bart Ulufa\u02bcalu\u02bcs government; the Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu security forces have mutinied periodically. 27 Region wide there is only one job for every seven persons looking for employment (Paci\ufb01 c Regional Strategy Paper 2002-2007, p.22). 28 The heavily remittance dependent economies of Samoa and Tonga have experienced growth.

Human Security Consultations Report 2007 72 Global warming is likely to have a disproportionate effect on atoll states such as Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu. It will have consequences for all island countries further reducing the ability of their people to literally keep their heads above water. They will suffer from salt water inundation with rising sea levels - the consequences of activities in the industrialised world. The question is will the latter take responsibility.30 These natural, socio-cultural, economic and political problems and hazards comprise the security threats that can, and do affect human development and human security in PICs. To prevent these threats and mitigate their consequences the \u2018human security framework\u2019, which is an integrated approach based on partnership of civil society organisations and the state, and with regional and international institutions is intended to provide a comprehensive safeguard that seeks to empower power people. From State Security to Human Security: the Human Security Framework This new partnership approach to human security is a signi\ufb01 cant paradigm change shift from the state-centric model of security that emerged over the last few decades. In this approach security was de\ufb01 ned narrowly as threats to the survival of the state. These were perceived as emanating mainly from external sources. They included cross-border issues, possible military invasion, and Distant Water Fishing Nations\u2019 \ufb02 eets poaching in our EEZs. Political instability was considered to be a signi\ufb01 cant internal threat to the state. This was a factor in the authoritarian approach towards advocates of human rights and social justice. The human security paradigm sees security much more broadly as the survival and safety of people and their communities. There are numerous threats to human security which require a holistic approach bringing together a range of actors to collectively and individually deal with the causes and sources of insecurity. \u2018Human security is concerned with safeguarding and expanding people\u2019s vital freedoms. It requires both shielding people from acute threats and empowering them to make changes of their own lives. Needed are integrated policies that focus on people\u2019s survival, livelihood and dignity, during downturns as well as prosperity\u2019 (UN Commission on Human Security, 2003, iv). The Paci\ufb01 c Plan (2005) accepts this broader notion of security as \u2018the stable and safe social (or human) and political conditions necessary for, and re\ufb02 ective of, good governance and sustainable development.\u2019 The Aitutaki Declaration on regional security cooperation (1997) referred to the region\u2019s \u2018vulnerability to natural disasters, environmental damage and unlawful challenges to national integrity and independence\u2019 and reaf\ufb01 rmed a commitment to a \u2018\u2026comprehensive, integrated and collaborative approach to maintaining and strengthening current mechanisms for cooperation among members in dealing with threats to the security, broadly de\ufb01 ned, of states in the region and of the region as a whole\u2019. The Biketawa Declaration of 2000 identi\ufb01 es a range of \u2018dif\ufb01 cult and sensitive issues including underlying causes of tensions and con\ufb02 ict\u2019 (ethnicity, socio-economic disparities, and lack of good governance, land disputes and erosion of cultural values).

Human Security Framework What can CSOs do? The human security framework signi\ufb01 cantly broadens our recognition of the number and variety of threats that individuals and their communities face in achieving secure and safe living. It is for this reason that the outlook on security is more comprehensive and complex and reliant on multiple partners. It is recognised that human security requires an integrated approach that brings together civil society and the state. Civil society organizations comprise the more traditional community and faith-based entities, NGOs, business groups, trade unions, ethnic and cultural associations. Their role in social, economic, political and environmental spheres can not be overestimated. CSOs are involved in food security and livelihood related activities, they provide education, health and social services as well as seek sustainable development. They settle disputes, mediate and resolve con\ufb02 ict and \ufb01 re \ufb01 ght outbreaks of various forms of violence and contribute positively to peace building. The work of civil society groups enhances social capital. With men, women and children more informed about all aspects of human security, their rights and responsibilities and their entitlements as citizens, they are likely as individuals and as members of CSOs to take initiatives to protect themselves from threats and make informed choices about options available to them on matters affecting their human security. They would be better able to hold duty bearers at all levels to account on their security. CSOs are well placed to mobilize people and their resources to enhance their safety and security. In sum therefore CSOs can play vital roles in generating, promoting, maintaining and taking action on information and action programmes to enhance human security by themselves and as a valued partner of state institutions and development agencies. What could CSOs do in partnership with government and development agencies? CSOs are to be found in nearly all areas of Paci\ufb01 c island societies and as recognized partners of government and development agencies can make an enormous and effective contribution towards efforts to strengthen human security. It is critical that their increasingly indispensable role be recognized. Clearly there are multiple and varied threats to human security that can be dealt with at different levels \u2013 individual, family, community, national, regional and international. CSOs can be a signi\ufb01 cant intermediary connecting individuals, families and communities to government and international organizations. Human Security Consultations Report 2007 74 Second, CSOs can be the vehicles through which individuals and communities can express their concerns about security and how best to tackle them. They can help articulate local knowledge about risks faced by people and their communities. The vulnerability of individuals are likely to differ depending on their age, gender, class, place of residence, ethnicity, tribal and religious af\ufb01 liation. Partnership with CSOs are likely to keep government and development agencies better informed about the nature of threats faced by groups of people and provide appropriate measures and support for them. Often complex cultural values and institutions affect people\u2019s behaviour and relationships, CSOs using their intimate relationships and participatory engagement are better placed to gather the motivating factors that in\ufb02 uence people\u2019s behaviour and affect their relationships. Third, to be more pro-active and effective CSOs would need to be better resourced. Depending on priorities that are agreed on a participatory and consultative basis, government and development agencies could make more resources (funds, equipment and information material) available for CSO use. This is likely to result in more effective use of the pool of resources available to a PIC. Fourth, related to better resourcing of CSOs is the need to build their capacity. This is a critical need that if met, will increase their effectiveness to achieve the objectives they set for themselves. There is scope for the acquisition of more knowledge and skills training in leadership, negotiation and mediation skills, con\ufb02 ict prevention and con\ufb02 ict resolution, research and advocacy, organizational management, accounting and keeping records as well as ICT and networking. In this regard, CSOs can share information and experiences which are likely to broaden knowledge and strengthened capacities to respond to community needs.

In this capacity, CSOs can contribute better in undertaking feasibility studies relating to human security initiatives and help to redirect projects and programmes midstream so that they are more effective. What should CSOs ask Paci\ufb01 c Islands Forum Governments to do? Paci\ufb01 c Islands Forum leaders have discussed security issues in the region. These have resulted in a number of speci\ufb01 cally security-related agreements. They include the Honiara, Aitutaki, Biketawa and Naisonini Declarations. However, while there has been an increased awareness of security issues in general rather than just those that impact on state survival, and the call has been made for a \u2018..comprehensive, integrated and collaborative\u2019 approach, there is no speci\ufb01 c mention of civil society as a portent partner. The potential of ordinary people including women appears to have not been recognized when they are at the forefront of meeting the threats to their communities. Women have played a pivotal role in ending con\ufb02 ict and building peace but this is not always recognized and acknowledged. Women are yet to be regarded as full and equal partners in a range of areas including human security. It is imperative that Forum island governments individually and collectively recognize the role that CSOs have played in protecting and promoting Paci\ufb01 c communities from security threats. This recognition should be accompanied by a willingness to dialogue with CSO representatives in an equitable and open manner. CSOs must be accepted as partners in the work of governments and at the regional level CSO representatives should be effectively represented in regional fora where decisions are made about human security matters. They need to be involved in the implementation, assessment and monitoring of projects and programmes relating to improving the security of people and communities. Human Security Consultations Report 2007 75 Towards a Holistic Human Security Framework The partnership of several actors at different levels in an integrated approach to address human security issues will involve engagement in a number of areas including: \u2022 Governance \u2022 Reconciliation and peace-building, \u2022 Law and Justice systems \u2022 Livelihoods and poverty \u2022 Land, Resources and the Environment \u2022 Education and awareness for reducing violence \u2022 Tackling misuse of arms \u2022 HIV/Aids and violence \u2022 Community responses to human security issues Governance The Biketawa Declaration committed Paci\ufb01 c Islands Forum governments to good governance de\ufb01 ned as: \u2018(i.) Commitment to good governance which is the exercise of authority (leadership) and interactions in a manner that is open, transparent, accountable, participatory, consultative and decisive but fair and equitable.\u2019 (ii.) Belief in the liberty of the individual under the law, in equal rights for all citizens regardless of gender, race, colour, creed or political belief and in the individual\u2019s inalienable right to participate by means of free and democratic political process in framing the society in which he or she lives. (iii.) Upholding democratic processes and institutions which re\ufb02 ect national and local circumstances, including the peaceful transfer of power, the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary, just and honest government.\u2019 These guiding principles provide the bases for the formulation and implementation of public policies that are responsive to the needs of citizens and are equitable. Institutions that effectively provide public goods, promote rule of law and expand physical infrastructure in an open, accountable and inclusive way promote the environment for human development, respect for human rights and increase the capacity of all to actively pursue human security goals. CSOs are critical to ensure that governance involves both participation by all stakeholders in human security-related decision making and the effective and ef\ufb01 cient delivery of services. Reconciliation and Peace-building To some extent tension and con\ufb02 icts are part of human existence and there are routine and established modes of channeling and resolving these stresses in societies. There are traditional and customary modes of resolving con\ufb02 icts. In recent time, however, there have been overt and violent con\ufb02 icts that have unraveled the social fabric of communities, caused the loss of life and destruction of assets, destroying livelihoods, and heightening distrust.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75c07887-f1e8-4713-9d4e-d34f5ea29a21": {"__data__": {"id_": "75c07887-f1e8-4713-9d4e-d34f5ea29a21", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards A Pacific Human Security: Report On Consultation Proceedings", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5935a6e7f5af3e8fe6a1195bf84cc2968ddca0d16d23a88b99171d3488879224"}, "2": {"node_id": "659b8723-9439-4fc6-8b35-cda82ebfbbdb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-pacific-human-security-report-consultation-proceedings", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "902015dece0b210fd70cc44388db831b1e790edf07f3af709a8be6aa8d140b8b"}}, "hash": "bc8d6d43d37d214bf32bd97b3a740b89e5e860fa71cfc38a61c6e0d25697f37e", "text": "The post-con\ufb02 ict situation that has emerged following the brokering of peace by third party mediation can easily be jeopardized without attendance to the root causes of the con\ufb02 ict, and building con\ufb01 dence and trust within and between individuals and groups involved.

The former status quo may need to be signi\ufb01 cantly changed. The process of reconciliation requires active participation of CSOs, especially recognizing and supporting the role of women as peace makers. There are several steps in the reconciliation process: \ufb01 rst, the preparedness of the parties involved in the con\ufb02 ict to accept their part in generating and aggravating the antagonism. Second, there must be a willingness to make reparations for the harm done to others. Third, being prepared to dialogue honestly on how to deal with the root causes of the con\ufb02 ict. Fourthly, being prepared to participate in peace building activities that bring together the former con\ufb02 icting groups. CSOs have a critical role in pursuing pro-active measures to avert the causes of con\ufb02 ict and to contain con\ufb02 ict from escalating and ameliorating its consequences. CSOs including religious groups and women\u2019s organizations have been deeply involved in reconciliation and peace-building efforts in con\ufb02 ict prone areas and post-con\ufb02 ict situations. This needs to be acknowledged and such groups should be seen as most useful partners. Law and Justice Systems Legal and justice systems in the PICs are dualistic in so far as there is a continuation of indigenous institutions and modes of dispute settlement - and the customary system-and the colonially inherited \u2018western system\u2019. Many rural and remote communities as well as urban informal settlements continue to use values and norms that re\ufb02 ect the customary system. There is an emphasis on \u2018restorative justice\u2019 and rebuilding relationships between the aggrieved person\u2019s family/community and those of the offender\u2019s. The arrangements are better understood, more easily accessible and are generally not overly expensive. Exception to this observation is the huge in\ufb02 ation in compensation payments required in the Southern Highlands Province of Papua New Guinea. The more formal legal system based on the adversarial prosecution seeking conviction and defendant\u2019s side seeking exoneration, is more retributional . The growing number of crimes, increasing numbers in prison and the heightened sense of insecurity in urban areas, and indeed, some rural localities provide evidence that the existing system is not working very well. There are issues of whether the punishment \ufb01 ts the crime, especially for \ufb01 rst offenders, the treatment of juvenile delinquents, the rehabilitation of prisoners, support for their families, support for the victims of crime, and recidivism. Civil Society organizations have advocated law reform and have sought to sensitise legal practictioners including magistrates and judges on gender issues and modes of restorative justice. The resolution of certain types of crime such as rape in the customary system may not be adequate as a satisfactory remedy for the victim of this crime. Society and Culture Paci\ufb01 c societies and cultures have evolved over several millennia adapting to the conditions of islands and small face to face communities. In recent decades there has been signi\ufb01 cant social transformation but traditional values and institutions have continued to exist. There are signi\ufb01 cant valued customary institutions which in several instances are recognized in PICs\u2019 constitutions. Customary ownership of land and its inalienability are entrenched in a number of constitutions as is the role of chiefs and persons of rank. The Biketawa Declaration recognizes \u2018the importance of respecting and protecting indigenous rights and cultural values, traditions and customs.\u2019 Human Security Consultations Report 2007 77 There is a danger, however, that the wholesale acceptance of such rights, values, traditions and customs will have negative impacts on categories of the population including women, youth and children. The later tend not to have much say in traditional decision making fora. Besides, there are likely to be serious violations of human rights if \u2018customary\u2019 sanctions against non-conforming members of society are enforced. There is a need to ensure that languages of communities are taught to its younger members as this is most likely path to maintaining the integrity of Paci\ufb01 c island cultures. Livelihoods and Poverty A fundamental challenge for PICs is to ensure meaningful livelihoods and employment of their people. Increasing social inequality has been accompanied by a growing number of people, especially young persons without jobs and access to other livelihoods.

Gross social inequality and poverty manifest social exclusion which can be a signi\ufb01 cant factor in generating social unrest and political instability. The Biketawa Declaration acknowledges the: \u2018the importance and urgency of equitable economic, social and cultural development to satisfy the basic needs and aspirations of the peoples of the Forum.\u2019 Youth unemployment and alienation is a major threat to human security that requires urgent attention. There is a need to expand economic activities, increase food security, generate employment and ensure greater access to resources and opportunities. Economic, social and cultural changes have affected the cohesiveness of communities and the protection offered by traditional safety nets. Cultural norms of reciprocity and sharing with the wider kinship group are being replaced by values that are linked to urban living and the monetary economy. Young people especially need to have hope. There is a need to provide social protection to the very young and the elderly. Civil society organizations can work with local communities to identify and generate new economic opportunities. They can establish self help groups and secure micro-\ufb01 nance for cash earning activities. They can work with families, young mothers, women and youth to build their capacity by the provision of information and training. CSOs can also play a signi\ufb01 cant advocacy role to in\ufb02 uence pro-poor growth policies. Land, Resources and the Environment Natural resource use with due safeguards to conservation and management is at the heart of sustainable development. There is generally inef\ufb01 cient utilization of land for agriculture and other productive activity and it has begun a major source of competition, tension and con\ufb02 ict. Extractive industries such as logging, mining and \ufb01 shing have seriously depleted forest cover and degraded natural environments and affected people\u2019s livelihoods. Short term gains that are rather miniscule Human Security Consultations Report 2007 78 have detracted community and national government leaders\u2019 attention form longer term sustainable development. CSOs have a critical role to give voice to the concerns of local communities about the degradation of their environment, loss of bio-diversity and the loss of livelihoods. CSOs need to be actively engaged in the processes that lead to concessions being granted to extractive industries. Such involvement is likely to reduce con\ufb02 icts downstream. Education and Awareness for Reducing Violence In multi-ethnic and muti-lingual PICs nation building remains a challenge. More parochial identities abound. Domestic violence, inter-personal violence, inter-group violence, structural violence, political violence and sports violence are found in PICs. Suicides are also uncommonly high in some countries of the region. Education can be a signi\ufb01 cant avenue for pro-actively creating awareness for reducing all forms of violence. Changes to the curriculum with greater local content that deals with history, origins of different groups, their cultures, language studies, multiculturalism, explanations for migration and resource competition can help to increase understanding and tolerance. No tolerance of violence in schools, respect for the sanctity of the person, gender equality etc can help to begin the process of changing attitudes and behaviour in wider society. Campaigns by CSOs and information sharing with schools can promote awareness of violence reduction. Tackling Misuse of Arms Fortunately for the region as a whole, the civilian population and police forces remain unarmed. Small arms including combat weapons such as assault ri\ufb02 es and machine guns, automatic pistols etc are limited to areas that have experienced open violent con\ufb02 ict. To these type of armoury have been added home-made weapons including guns. Bougainville, Guadalcanal and Southern Highlands in Papua New Guinea have suffered signi\ufb01 cant casualties from the use of small arms. Recent participatory studies have shown the devastation caused by increases in the level of violence as the result of these weapons. Livelihoods and lives are lost. Communities are keen to see an end to gun violence. CSOs can help educate people about the negative consequences of gun use, identify the factors that contribute to gun violence and work towards the phasing out of guns from communities.

Homophobia, moral judgement and fear emerging out of ignorance affect how infected persons are treated by communities. This is certainly a form of violence against them. CSOs are already playing a signi\ufb01 cant role in educating about HIV/AIDS and as advocates for people who have been infected. CSOs are working in partnership with national governments and at the regional level with the Paci\ufb01 c Community and UN agencies. Human Security Consultations Report 2007 79 Possible Civil Society Agenda on Human Security Civil society organisations are formed by and represent people in the communities exposed to natural, economic, social and political risks and threats. They are in many ways very well placed to research, articulate and inform all other actors on Human Security needs, and indeed to act to empower those affected by such threats. In PICs NGOs and other civil society organisations are already actively promoting, protecting and empowering citizens to participate in processes and activities that enhance their human security. An agenda for advocating civil society role in Human Security would be founded on recognising existing strengths of CSOs, building their capacities and signi\ufb01 cantly enhancing their position as legitimate partners. CSOs have been working in several areas including Human Development, Human Rights and Human Security. The following are possible areas for prioritisation with the relevant CSOs being identi\ufb01 ed together with their priorities for human security: \u2022 There are CSOs and NGOs that promote environmental conservation and sustainability as well as programmes of development-conservation. \u2022 There are CSOs and NGOs that provide humanitarian relief from the consequences of natural disasters such as cyclones, \ufb02 ood, drought , tsunami and earthquakes. \u2022 There are CSOs and NGOs that have been working with the poor to secure their basic needs through advocacy and empowerment. \u2022 There are CSOs and NGOs that have provided education and health services. \u2022 There are CSOs and NGOs that have acted to prevent con\ufb02 ict and work in post-con\ufb02 ict reconstruction. \u2022 There are CSOs and NGOs that have promoted human rights including women\u2019s rights and the rights of children. \u2022 There are CSOs and NGOs that provide refuge to the victims of domestic violence and campaign for an end to violence against women and children. \u2022 There are CSOs and NGOs that promote peace and understanding. Conclusion CSOs are already engaged in creating awareness of risks, relating to health for instance, and tackling many of the threats to human security. Groups of youth, women, environmental and human rights activists have been educating and advocating about a range of issues that impinge on people and communities in the region. With the shift towards an integrated holistic approach to human security, they can be a portent partner to the state, regional and international development agencies in ensuring safer and secure communities. Their potential will be enhanced by the recognition of the work that they are currently doing, treating them as equals partners, making resources available to them and helping them to build their capacity.

The volume of economic activities in these sectors is huge: More than 60 percent of the world\u2019s gross output is accounted for by value-addition in services. Yet because many of these activities were deemed \u201cuntradable\u201d until recently, the share of services in global trade is only around 20 percent,1 with exports valued at about US$ 1.57 trillion. With the advent of new transmission technologies, improved means of transportation and reorientation in priorities of states away from direct control and management of many commercial activities, both the perception and reality of the tradability of services has increased in the past two decades. Since 1980, trade in services has grown faster than trade in goods, despite the former being subjected to complex non-tariff barriers (WTO 2003, 9). Because of the possibilities created by IT- enabled technologies, some forms of trade in services no longer require a simultaneous presence of both the producer and consumer, which used to be one of the distinguishing characteristics of this trade. With the formal entry into force of the binding General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) at the WTO, and commencement of multilateral negotiations in 2000, the role of trade in services in development has become prominent. 1This could be an understatement, since not all services activities are captured in formal balance-of-payments statements. For discussion on problems of collecting accurate services data, see Raghavan (2004). Even when available, they may not be sufficiently disaggregated. There is a particular lack of internationally comparable statistics on South- South services trade. 8 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All The stakes are thus high, not only because services include sectors that are the drivers of modern economic growth, with great potential for generating jobs and incomes, but because they also include sectors where commercial motivations are secondary to the prime human development objective of ensuring basic well-being through decent health, education, energy, and water and sanitation supplies, among others. In fact, the share of services in GDP in countries systematically correlates with levels of per-capita income. In developed countries, such a share typically exceeds 70 percent of national output (73 percent in the United States), while in developing countries, it is around 50 percent (lower in the Least Developed Countries, such as only 25 percent in Lao PDR). Until the end of 1970s, there was a tendency to downplay the role of services in development. It was assumed that growth in services was an outcome of an enlarged development process, mostly sustained by industrial activities, and that as countries entered the post-industrial period, shifts would occur automatically to the services sector. Seen as an offshoot of progress elsewhere, countries did not even find it necessary to have distinct strategies on services (Gibbs and Ognivtsev 2004, 7). It is only since the mid-1980s that the view on the two-way causal relationship between services and economic development has been increasingly accepted. As people\u2019s needs grow, and public institutions in developing countries come under great strain in their attempts to cope with increasing claims on resources, they are compelled to explore a range of options to fill glaring gaps: increase in domestic resource mobilisation for public investments in infrastructure, recourse to overseas transfers, grants and loans, and international trade. Trade in services is additionally crucial because it almost subsumes the hugely important subject of investment under the logic that services can be provided through \u201ccommercial presence\u201d in a foreign market by owners of capital belonging elsewhere. This phenomenon had become so pronounced by the turn of the century that services accounted for more than 60 percent (or US$ 500 billion) of total FDI inflows during 2001- 9 2002. While in the early years finance constituted most of the trade in services, energy, water and telecommunications are now receiving increasing attention; between 1990 and 2002, the value of FDI stock in electric power generation and distribution rose by a factor of 14 (WIR 2004, xx-xxi). In the specific service sectors that are the subject of this paper, the challenge of ensuring universal and affordable access to health, water, sanitation and energy for poor people remains an utmost priority of most national governments. International trade in these services is not, and will never be, a substitute for conscious national strategies aimed at meeting universal goals in favour of poor people. The provision of most essential services is almost entirely a public prerogative, not only because of their strong human rights content, but also because of the large social externalities and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eda811a8-f567-4146-90b5-53a63e4eea6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "eda811a8-f567-4146-90b5-53a63e4eea6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "946043a5a64f569a18d9711f442d34dfea7c7a9d3a83dcf778fbaa29000487e4"}}, "hash": "946043a5a64f569a18d9711f442d34dfea7c7a9d3a83dcf778fbaa29000487e4", "text": "market failures2 involved in access to basic health or water supply (e.g., gains from checking spread of disease). However, there are ways and methods to leverage the forces of international trade to directly and indirectly help countries meet aspects of these urgent public needs. This paper makes an attempt to highlight some of these options. International trade in services can take place between two or more countries in the context of bilateral or regional agreements, or even on an ad hoc basis outside their purview. Since 2000, as per Article XIX of GATS, negotiations have also been launched multilaterally. Contrary to popular perception, however, GATS alone has propelled neither significant trade nor liberalisation of any service in any country, nor has it required revamping of national regulations and laws. Especially compared to the 57-year-old agreement on trade in goods (GATT), which achieved deep cuts in barriers to trade in goods over numerous negotiating rounds, the agreement on services is nascent. Nonetheless, 2 \u201cThe private sector, left to its devices, will not achieve the level of health and education that society desires,\u201d states the World Bank (2004, 3). 10 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All for the purposes of negotiations, the scope of the agreement is sweeping, and proposals on the table in Geneva can in theory cover any service, in any sector, except those \u201csupplied in the exercise of governmental authority.\u201d Article 1.3(c) explains that this means any service that is supplied neither on a commercial basis nor in competition with one or more service suppliers.3 While GATS does not require privatisation or liberalisation, and governments can choose to make no commitments, or schedule limitations on market access and national treatment when commitments are made, the overall purpose of the agreement is clear. Through \u201cprogressive liberalisation,\u201d it is to eventually achieve for trade in services what GATT has achieved so far for trade in goods. A first-ever agreement of legally enforceable rules, GATS draws on GATT principles (such as national treatment), but places them in a different context; at the same time, it extends the scope to measures affecting issues as diverse as FDI flows, qualification of professionals, and movement of data as well as people across borders as service providers (Gibbs and Ognivtsev 2004, 8). To date, with the exception of countries or territories that acceded to the WTO after 2001 (namely, China, Cambodia, Nepal and Taiwan Province of China), not many Asia-Pacific countries have undertaken notable commitments. Worldwide, no member has made a commitment at the WTO on water distribution.4 With some developed countries realising that the flexible \u201crequest-offer\u201d approach of GATS negotiations is not opening up foreign markets fast or deep enough, new proposals can be expected in the future that will seek to pressure and expedite opening of 3 Commercial basis means that there is a notion of profit seeking involved; competition means two or more service providers target the same market with substitutable products. 4 Further, only 24 developing countries have made commitments on hospital services, while 12 developing countries have made commitments on primary education. These contrast with commitments made by WTO members in tourism (90 percent) or financial services (70 percent). 11 \u201ccore critical areas\u201d in developing countries.5 Thus, much of the controversy on GATS appears to be not about its present form and outcomes, but about what the agreement may evolve into (World Bank 2004, 105). It is against this background of stark human development needs, compelling public investment challenges, recent trends in trade in services and the political-economic realities surrounding international trade regimes that this paper is written, primarily for constituencies in Asia-Pacific. The most important motivation behind selecting trade in energy and environmental services is to see to what extent aspects of this trade can contribute to, or upset, the pursuit of human well-being aimed at ensuring universal access to and affordability of essential services by poor people. After detailing the scale of human development challenges in the two sectors, the paper recognises that these sectors also happen to be \u201cbig businesses\u201d with potential benefits in terms of employment, technology transfer and economic growth. In the two sectors, the paper briefly outlines the nature and scope of reforms, including attempts at deregulation and attachment of social obligations and welfare conditions. With empirical as well as anecdotal references to past experiences within Asia-Pacific and other regions, certain policy lessons are drawn, with the caveat that there can be no application of uniform policy across the diverse countries of Asia-Pacific.

One framework that will be referred to repeatedly in this paper is the \u201cfour modes of service supply.\u201d First articulated by the UNCTAD Secretariat in the 1980s, this went on to lay the intellectual basis for the incorporation of the idea in all discourses on trade in services. The four modes of supply through which services can be traded are: Box 1: The Four Modes Mode 1: Cross-border supply \u2013 User in one country receives service from a provider abroad (e.g., IT-enabled medical diagnostics and advice, online energy trading and brokering) Mode 2: Consumption abroad \u2013 User moves abroad to consume a service (e.g., tourists, health patients) Mode 3: Commercial presence \u2013 User is offered service by entities owned by foreign providers (e.g., foreign-owned subsidiary in insurance, sanitation or electricity) Mode 4: Movement of natural persons \u2013 Service provider moves abroad to supply a service (e.g., nurses, construction workers). 13 II. International trade in environmental services and human development The scale of development challenges In the broadest sense, development is about improving the quality of life. The well-being of millions of people still living in absolute poverty in Asia-Pacific depends in part on a wide range of environmental resources, including access to and use of fresh drinking water and sanitation. Close to 2 billion people in Asia lack access to basic sanitation, and more than 650 million have no safe drinking water (WSSCC 2004, 28). The Pacific Island countries are three orders of magnitude smaller in size and population than Asia, but they share the same intensity of environmental problems. Child mortality is widely, uniformly and accurately reported across countries and is therefore a reliable indicator of national environmental health.6 Every day, 3,900 children worldwide die of diseases associated with water and sanitation, which are easily preventable. Almost half the people in the developing world have one or more diseases or infections associated with inadequate water supply and sanitation, like diarrhoea, intestinal helminth infections and dracunculiasis. According to The Lancet (2005, vol. 365), schistosomiasis afflicts 160 million people in the world, which basic sanitation can reduce by 77 percent; similarly, of the 6 million people who are blind because of trachoma, a preventable disease, improved access to water could reduce morbidity by 27 percent. Collectively, these amount to a colossal drain of human potential. The link between health and environmental problems is direct, especially in ever-growing urban settlements. In Pakistan, 40 percent of infant mortality is due to water pollution; in Bangkok, half the city 6 Future research on environmental indices should focus on establishing datasets of child death rates from proximate environmental causes, intestinal infections and respiratory diseases. Statistics for access to safe water and basic sanitation are considered less reliable. 14 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All suffers from air pollution-induced respiratory illnesses. In China, two- thirds of its major cities are seriously short of water, with 700 million people drinking water contaminated by waste (Becker 2004). In India, which accounts for one-quarter of the world\u2019s child deaths owing to poor hygiene, only 200 of the country\u2019s 3,600 towns and cities are reported to have proper sewerage systems. Given these challenges, it is inconceivable how any of the Millennium Development Goals can be met without meeting MDG7, which includes targets to halve the proportion of people without access to potable water and to significantly improve the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers by 2015.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c0840de-484e-45ac-9cf9-534a758b81e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c0840de-484e-45ac-9cf9-534a758b81e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "988a6ae698d310ac04450aa18da5cae9fa926757efab042f61df26482983f4b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "85f54b6a-e738-45d3-8d7e-37eac088e50b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a4f9a904d89e11ef75f46ac22d446b0fb9ee1af82ca315e30b473e0976f4de6"}}, "hash": "dca5d01e1d206d8421b4b665cf7ecc643cfbf0d85047f14f36b1242ef8ac9ddb", "text": "The disposal of hazardous waste, effluent treatment, contamination of sources of water, and preservation of biological habitats are also broad environmental concerns with a bearing on human health, and in turn, people's capability to lead the kind of life they value.

Overcrowding increases risks for contracting communicable diseases. Ignoring of the environmental causes of health burden today will result in a massive \u201chealth debt\u201d that will be far more costly to pay off through curative measures in the future than to prevent the problems now, through basic water, sanitation, shelter and public health interventions. One analysis suggests that each US$1 invested in water and sanitation would yield an economic return of between US$3 and US$34 (Evans et al. 2004). The burden of illness and death from basic diarrhoeal diseases in Asia- Pacific is especially staggering. It is now evident that curing of sanitation problems through installation of facilities alone (e.g., constructing latrines) is inadequate. A complete community approach to sanitation, focusing on hygiene promotion, use of clean food, water and utensils, and hand washing with soap after defecation is more effective in reducing the transmission of diarrhoeal diseases, but these often result 15 from changes in community behaviour and cultural practices that are not spoken of frequently. There is a collective action problem in sanitation, where the actions of a single member affect all others in a community. This requires a collective response in the form of changing attitudes and investing in community infrastructure that follows from individual realisation of the \u201ccommunal\u201d nature of sanitation problems. This approach is, however, difficult to implement and could explain why sanitation has lagged behind demand for water (World Bank 2004, 174). Other forms of environmental support systems also can make significant contributions toward honouring human dignity and achievement of the MDGs. Take the unspoken issue of open defecation, a pervasive phenomenon in poor countries, where the dignity of hundreds of millions of women and men can be enhanced with the provision of clean, private sanitary facilities. Stakeholders responses to environmental problems In Asia-Pacific, enforceable environmental laws, regulations and institutions were mostly created by governments under pressure from NGOs and in response to the requirements of international funding agencies; public interest has been important, but not as powerful as in the industrialised countries, where policies responded to industrial technologies of the time as well as popular demand. While by the 1990s almost all Asian developing countries had formulated environmental standards, the record on compliance is poor in spite of provisions for sanctions to hold governments and commercial interests accountable for their performance. Inaction during the 1990s has been attributed to the view that \u201cthe environment can wait,\u201d which was subsequently overcompensated for by unrealistic regulatory regimes that never found traction (ADB 2000, 2). Environmental institutions in Asia have tested two new approaches: use of market-based instruments (MBIs) and increased disclosure of information on environmental violators. Most of the region\u2019s experience 16 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All has been with fiscal instruments. MBIs have not been used extensively, and so far, only a few have been tested (wastewater permit trading in China, permit trading for CFCs and traffic congestion in Singapore). This is a critical deficit, because market-creating instruments are particularly important in the regulation of privatised utilities. Most Pacific Island countries also have environmental regulations, with some using financial incentives for waste management and integrating freshwater resources with coastal management. There has been limited introduction of small advanced water treatment systems. As in Asia, the transference of plans into action in the Pacific Islands has been difficult (SPREP 2001, 24) The comparative responsiveness of the private sector may be assessed through the growth in the number of firms certified for ISO 9000 quality and ISO 14000 environmental management standards. China and the Republic of Korea have demonstrated remarkable growth in certification, with China now being the global leader, encompassing nearly 100,000 firms certified for quality management. In the leading countries, the dynamism of the private sector is a reason to be optimistic that society will be able to cope with looming issues such as climate change. The lagging countries are not isolated from the impacts of modernity, but have far more fragile coping capacities. The environmental industry and recent trends The environmental industry has grown to more than US$550 billion in revenues in 2003, accounting for 1.8 percent of the global economy (Ferrier et al. 2003, 10). The environmental services sector constitutes about half the total environment industry, valued in 2000 at about US$270 billion. The implicit distinction between environmental infrastructural services and environmental non-infrastructural services is important (Zarrilli 2003, 33). Human development priorities and civil society advocacy, as well as formal GATS classification of environmental services, are more concerned with the first cluster. 17 Broadly,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb913279-d3ff-4e38-8db7-adacc2cbbca9": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb913279-d3ff-4e38-8db7-adacc2cbbca9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18a61d2d88b9a1967ba6273a8a1b8ff1da8bc02a89884443c5ee42df3143fb48"}}, "hash": "18a61d2d88b9a1967ba6273a8a1b8ff1da8bc02a89884443c5ee42df3143fb48", "text": "environmental services are defined as those activities that reduce environmental risk, minimise pollution and enable efficient resource use. The first set of such activities concerns pollution management (such as air pollution control, wastewater management, solid waste management, cleanup of soil and water, noise and vibration abatement, environmental monitoring, analysis, research, assessment and engineering). The second set of activities covers cleaner technology (aimed at eliminating or reducing the impact of technologies, processes and products). The third set falls under resource management, such as solid waste recycling and resource recovery. These environmental services have three important characteristics. First, they overlap with activities in just about all other sectors of the economy, from architecture and construction to auditing and risk assessment. Second, they have the properties of quasi-public goods,7 which make pricing based on consumer use difficult and have implications for human development concerns such as equity, universal provision and affordable access. Third, environmental services typically require large investment to ensure that collection and distribution networks reach the entire population. Owing to their quasi-public goods as well as natural monopoly properties, the public sector has been the primary provider of a range of environmental services until recently. None of the largest environmental companies in the world are from developing Asia-Pacific. The top 71 firms in the sector account for 20 percent of all revenues generated; most are American, but two of the largest are French.8 Other countries with leading firms are Germany, 7 Environmental services are not pure public goods, as classically defined with non-rivalry, non-excludability, and non-divisibility properties. Excludability in the provision of environmental services can be introduced (e.g. disconnecting water supply) and rivalry in consumption also exists (due to congestion in use). 8 There are changes in the fortunes of individual companies in recent years. The aggregate analysis for the distribution of firms remains valid. 18 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All Japan, and the United Kingdom. In terms of sectors within environmental services, solid waste management, water utilities and water treatment are the largest segments, the latter being the most capital-intensive. Firms in France and the U.K. have a lead in water and wastewater treatment, following past privatisation experiences of segments of their water utilities. In the past, U.S. firms were the most competitive in air pollution control services, largely because of the fact that the first comprehensive air quality legislation, the Clean Air Act, was passed in 1970 in the United States. Box 2: Thirsty Kathmandu: Private Participation in the Valley\u2019s Water Supply Even after four decades of donor assistance since the start of commercial water supply in 1966, there remains a huge gap in meeting the demand for potable water by the Kathmandu valley\u2019s 1.5 million people. The Government of Nepal formed a High-Level Private Sector Participation Committee (PSPC) in 1997 to hand over part of the water delivery system to a private operator by 1999. However, the requirement for the private operator to be internationally recognised and experienced in operating facilities similar in scale to the one in the Kathmandu valley resulted in only one company qualifying in each of the two unsuccessful privatisation attempts. In 2001 the World Bank ended its long involvement in the water supply management, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) emerged as the new source of funds and advice. ADB helped develop the Kathmandu Valley Water Services Improvement Plan, which includes a proposal to divert water through a 26-kilometer tunnel from the snow-fed Melamchi River. One-third of the estimated US$464 million in costs will be financed with an ADB loan. Under this plan, a notice for \u201cexpression of interest\u201d was issued in January 2004 and necessary laws were enacted in April 2005. It is not clear yet if the Government can put in place the necessary institutions, including the Water Supply Management Board, Water Supply Tariff Fixation Commission and Water Utility Operator, in time to hand over operations to a private party by the target date of early 2006.

The State of the World\u2019s Children 2004. New York: Oxford University Press, based on a joint effort by the United Nation Children's Fund and the World Health Organization As OECD markets reach saturation, developing countries are emerging as important destinations for the export of environmental services. While the divergent capacities to address environmental concerns across Asia- Pacific necessitate roles for international trade and resource transfer, countries should nonetheless be careful in their choice of approaches and technologies, noting how they are embedded in specific institutional contexts. Employment-displacing technologies, especially in the solid waste management sector, are one such element of concern. On the other hand, in state-of-the-art sub-sectors, such as clean energy, Asia-Pacific countries need to be aware about the abundance of dated approaches, processes and technologies once appropriate for conditions in their countries of origin, but now abandoned or of scrap value there. Table 1: Select Environmental Indicators 21 Given the public monopoly characteristic of many environmental services, opportunities for trade and foreign investment have traditionally been limited. However, the sector has been undergoing significant changes in recent years. With deregulation, privatisation of select activities and growing trade orientation, environment services are set to become one of the fastest-growing service sectors in the future. Barriers to trade in environmental services The significant barriers to trade in environmental services pertain to restrictions on the establishment of commercial presence and on the movement or employment of nationals of the operating company (Modes 3 and 4 respectively). The leading exporters have a number of unilateral initiatives to open up Asian markets. For example, 11 industrialising Asian countries were the focus of the United States-Asia Environmental Partnership (U.S.-A.E.P.), with the mission of promoting U.S. exports of environmentally beneficial technologies. After a decade of promotional work that has seen markets emerge and mature in Hong Kong SAR, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan Province of China, the A.E.P. has now shifted its search to newer markets in India, Indonesia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. Pressures to open up environmental services also are being introduced through regional and bilateral trade agreements and investment treaties (BITs), especially with the United States, which typically insists on six forms of provisions for its firms.9 One important consequence of the investment rules under BITs is the risk of undermining the bedrock \u201cpolluters pay\u201d principle.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d9d83de-0b7e-42ea-8ead-8b7c8c95b5db": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d9d83de-0b7e-42ea-8ead-8b7c8c95b5db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b8f22b9afc59067fdfa1c3b1cc7ba2c5af882f531046f94848047b740d70864b"}, "2": {"node_id": "3e654e59-3dcd-45d7-b0a2-9fa14ea8342b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d8a5b3e4bb193e17ea1ed92333cdf6b8fe699343fd1e0c0c9099c07c79a72bff"}}, "hash": "3828f1459f0ce230fc20d46bbd6459409e863ca20f4ca50f9d8bf7cfe83f22a7", "text": "The accepted norm worldwide is the obligation of the polluter to pay environmental costs; investment rules reverse the principle by requiring governments to compensate investors for the 9 Entitlement to NT or MFN, whichever is more favourable throughout the life of the investment; limits on expropriation; transferability of all investment-related funds, including profits; limits to the host government\u2019s ability to require the investor to adopt performance requirements; right of the investor to international arbitration; and management of investor\u2019s choice. 22 | Trade in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94f6f9d7-c0d7-4163-8105-5b61d98a0123": {"__data__": {"id_": "94f6f9d7-c0d7-4163-8105-5b61d98a0123", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c2640a40d22cb0dfb2f82d3f408c33ad4f87e741470f29626e90c9fa0891331"}}, "hash": "8c2640a40d22cb0dfb2f82d3f408c33ad4f87e741470f29626e90c9fa0891331", "text": "Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All economic costs of complying with environmental regulations (CIEL 2002, 7). Among the 44 top environmental market countries in the world, China ranked 12th in size and experienced the fastest growth, at a rate of 10.6 percent per annum. In particular, China has experienced unexpected growth in investment in the potable water and wastewater treatment segments. Several other Asian countries, like the Republic of Korea, Taiwan Province of China, and Viet Nam also have increased their investments in drinking water and wastewater treatment. The market in this segment is forecast to increase to US$62 billion by 2008 and US$117 billion by 2015 (Helmut Kaiser Consultancy 2004, 13). Other segments significant for Asian country imports are solid and hazardous waste, and recycling systems and remediation. The smallest volumes are in monitoring and analysis equipment, but this segment remains important for local capacity building. From a human development angle, the main policy concern over emerging attempts to open up trade in environmental services is the sweeping nature of multigenerational commitments that countries voluntarily lock themselves into, often without adequate national consultations. Even when projects are badly needed and make economic sense, a part of the general public's ex ante hostility to such schemes emanates from the desire to have these processes subjected to broad civic scrutiny before making long-term commitments. Water privatisation within and without trade agreements Comprising 90 percent of the brain, water is the most important molecule for survival of human life. Because it is simply a matter of life and death on the primary level, and because its secondary uses also are crucial for conduct of livelihoods, issues surrounding its access, quality and affordability deserve sensitive scrutiny and restraint in trade talks, especially those that conclude with binding commitments. Civil society organisations are rightly wary of proposals to liberalise systems that 23 collect, purify and distribute water, as expressed vocally during the Third World Water Forum in Kyoto, March 2003, and elsewhere. The Doha Ministerial Declaration, in paragraph 31 (iii), mandates negotiations on eliminating or reducing barriers to trade in environmental goods and services. The E.U. has since been actively pursuing the liberalisation of environmental services and also sectors that have bearing on water distribution and consumption, arguing that its proposal views the entire water cycle holistically, with both water distribution and wastewater treatment falling under \u201cresource use.\u201d GATS, as a WTO discipline, requires no privatisation or deregulation of public services like water distribution. Countries in fact have unambiguous policy options that they can retain by: i) Maintaining their service as a public or private monopoly, or ii) Opening the service to competing suppliers but restricting it to national companies, or iii) Opening the service to domestic and foreign suppliers and making no GATS commitments, or iv) Making GATS commitment covering the rights of foreign investors while attaching conditions (e.g., on technology transfer or freer movement of labourers) While all options exist and are available, and while no country so far has made any GATS commitment on water distribution, the fact that the issue of water has been brought to the negotiating table has been hugely controversial. Privatisation and liberalisation are separate processes, but in practice, privatisation is only theoretically distinct from liberalisation given the disparities between the capacities of national firms and multinationals in the sector. Privatisation of environmental services has been successful largely in the context of mature institutional and regulatory structures. Developing countries need to build up such capacities, first by incremental experiences with management service contracts, concessions and joint ventures. 24 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All Box 3: Water, Waste and FDI in China The first joint venture between Beijing and foreign companies in the sewage treatment sector, named the Beijing Municipal Drainage Co. Ltd., is the result of collaboration between the Government of China and the French Veolia Water Co. Ltd., Onyx waste services division, along with a Malaysia- based public utility company. The project, with a daily capacity of 100,000 tonnes and a total initial investment of 200 million yuan (about US$24 million) is expected to improve water quality of the Liangshui River, south of Beijing. The plant, located on the upper reaches of the river, is expected to benefit more than 350,000 local residents. The French giant also has recently won a US$737 million, 30-year contract to supply drinking water for the 2.5 million people in the city of Hohhot, in northern China\u2019s Inner Mongolia region.

Sources: Forbes Magazine, 10/05/04 and the Peoples Daily Online 10/14/04, 4/ 24/05 There are, however, numerous cases of unilateral privatisation of utilities to treat and distribute water outside of the WTO framework. Their collective result is mixed. The prime trigger for privatisation has been twofold: i) problems of access and efficiency under public hands, and ii) problems of fresh resource mobilisation to keep up the quality and quantity of services to an ever-growing population. Huge amounts of additional resources are needed -- up to US$180 billion per year in poor countries (from the current US$ 70 billion to US$ 80 billion, according to The World Water Council). In poor countries with narrow tax bases, 25 these kinds of resources and skills can only be viably tapped with official foreign aid or private investment. As one private sector enthusiast puts it, \u201cWater may be god-given, but not the pipes.\u201d10 In China, the world's biggest potential market, the Ministry of Water Resources puts the cost of expected water- and sanitation-related infrastructure at US$26 billion by the end of 2005. Proponents of greater private sector involvement argue that recognition is growing that users do not pay the full cost of the water cycle, which begins in the skies, then goes to the reservoir and ends as wastewater. When the true value of the environmental resource is not accounted, there is wastage and resource degradation. This is one of the main reasons why water is not treated as a precious commodity and almost taken for granted (Wagl\u00e9 2004, 328). The prices determined by the private sector approximate toward charging the true costs of supplying a service and motivate prudent use of the resource. Further, there could be savings on grounds of efficiency. Governments also can put human development-friendly conditions on private suppliers by subjecting them to regulated prices and offering better billing and customer service to raise revenues, while upgrading the infrastructure for long-term sustainability. In other models, the full cost is shared between users and taxpayers as a \u201csustainable social price.\u201d There also could be ceiling rates on tariffs that cannot be exceeded, along with special provisions for low-income groups. Despite the uproar created by the possibility of private companies managing water sectors, only 5 percent of the world\u2019s water is actually distributed by the private sector.11 Even when private sectors take charge, they usually follow a process of \u201centrusting\u201d by the public 10 Gerard Mestrallet of Suez, quoted in The Economist, 19 July 2003. 11 The four big companies are Suez, Veolia, Saur and RWE. 26 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All authorities into a fixed-term contract. \u201cPrivatisation\u201d is often a misnomer \u2013 the management model could be a public-private partnership.12 The provisioning of water services through the public sector is thus a viable option, but approaches need to be innovative and yet ensure government oversight and transparency. Instances of public sector successes \u2013 e.g., Sao Paolo in Brazil, a city of 22 million, where a notable expansion of service has happened under public hands \u2013 provide adaptable lessons for Asia-Pacific. Whatever the model pursued, private companies have had to deal with fierce public opposition at times, sometimes leading to costly withdrawals. Because of high risks and difficulties in making profits in a highly regulated environment, the interest of international water companies in the poorest countries is diminishing. The viability of the market approach for providing these essential services in small markets and the poorest countries deserves a careful assessment (Zarrilli 2005, 3).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18b5414b-6077-4b19-86dc-362f60948f84": {"__data__": {"id_": "18b5414b-6077-4b19-86dc-362f60948f84", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77cda7b5715d274016e1e36f1fe680636e8fa8044151ea127f8a05ddeae12d78"}, "2": {"node_id": "41476097-813d-4309-a493-d2868afbf65b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2360ae96fd406b2e1d3f4efee9e7516d321d3383c1267aad2d820be073afb089"}}, "hash": "377977edf14f3326fbbf55d72ce9c1e0e7ebc0e56cd9572f058609c8bd1686a7", "text": "From a peak of 38 worldwide water and sewerage private projects in 1999, the number was down to 18 in 2002.13 Examples include investors like Suez quitting the American city of Atlanta, Biwater leaving Zimbabwe, and Bechtel having to withdraw from Bolivia, where rioting followed a 35 percent increase in water tariffs; in fact, Bechtel used the Dutch-Bolivia BIT to try to force Bolivia to pay US$25 million for losses related to its Dutch subsidiary\u2019s withdrawal from running the Cochabamba municipal water system.

In most large cities, a substantial share of the urban population is not adequately served by a utility; instead, people rely on water tankers, kiosks and small-scale, independent water providers. To the extent water is provided by public sector organisations, they may not be profit- seeking, but they could be rent-seeking as illustrated by a practice in the city of Karachi during the early 1990s, when an informal group of water dealers invested in a large number of tankers. In league with groups in the Karachi Water and Sanitation Board (KWSB), they were alleged to have disconnected water supply to a number of areas, making them dependent on the tankers for their daily water requirements. When authorities investigated the KWSB and the water \u201cmafia,\u201d it discovered that the senior management was hostage to an extended kinship network controlling the middle management. The empty pipes had rusted and a restored water supply could not meet potable quality standards. The consumers thought they were better off with the tankers, which remain a booming business in the city (Qutub 2003, 44). The type of political regime also matters in the speed with which these schemes are pushed through. Take China and Viet Nam, one-party states with strong Governments: they have already experimented with water- related projects in major cities like Shanghai and Ho Chi Minh City. In China, Veolia signed a 50-year contract in 2002 worth nearly US$250 million to treat, distribute and collect fees for water in Shanghai. This subject is, however, considered too sensitive in countries with active elective politics like India and Thailand, where Governments have been forced to retract sensitive policy measures. GENCO in Thailand was 14 http://www.environmentprobe.org/ enviroprobe/pubs/ev542.htm 28 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All forced to reduce its treatment fees, while in Pakistan, the Government has had to reduce utility charges owing to public pressure. Box 4: Judicial Activism in Delhi\u2019s Air In 1998 Delhi was one of the world\u2019s 10 most polluted cities. The Indian Supreme Court, acting on a public interest litigation in 1996, passed a series of orders, the major one being introduction of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) for public transport in 1998. Five years later, Delhi won the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Clean Cities International Partner of the Year award for \u2018\u2018bold efforts to curb air pollution and support alternative fuel initiatives.\u201d The city converted its entire public transport fleet to CNG. Compared to 1997, carbon monoxide is down by 32 percent and sulphur dioxide by 39 percent. The initiative is a testimony to judicial activism. Although the Government initially dilly-dallied to modify the Motor Vehicles Act to include CNG in its ambit, by November 2002 all public busses were converted to CNG.

The OPP model of sanitation comprises of internal development such as latrines, lane sewers and collector sewers at the neighbourhood levels. It has demonstrated that communities can finance and maintain internal development; contributing US$1.5 million, they have constructed hundreds of thousands of running feet of sewerage lines and sanitary pour-flush latrines in 90,000 houses. The OPP model has been replicated in 42 settlements in Karachi and in seven cities across Pakistan, with varying degrees of success. The critical factor is the degree to which local Government accepts the responsibility for external sanitation comprising trunk sewers and sewerage treatment (Hasan 1997, 11). In rural China, meanwhile, there exist models of cooperative non-profit water and sanitation delivery systems. In the early 1980s, only 50 percent of the rural population in China had access to safe water. By the end of 2002, this figure had reached 92 percent (868 million people). Among them, rural residents with access to piped water supply systems account for 57 percent of the total rural population, a 43 percent increase since 1985. Lessons to be learnt from this experience include: (a) importance of organisational and institutional capacity building; (b) community willingness to participate in financial contributions and sustainability; (c) necessity of sharing knowledge and understanding with users; and (d) integration of sanitation and health education with rural water supply.15 15 http://www.worldbank.org/wbi/reducingpoverty/case-China- RuralWaterandSanitation.html 30 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All There are other examples. Sulabh is an Indian NGO that has been active in sanitation and social reform for more than three decades, constructing and maintaining public toilets and twin-pit latrines for households. Sulabh has constructed more than 6,000 public latrines in 1,075 towns spread across India and converted more than 1.2 million bucket latrines into sanitary ones. It is estimated that more than 10 million people use Sulabh\u2019s facilities every day (Sulabh 2004, 25). Arguably, many civil society organisations in Asia-Pacific have locked themselves into a service delivery mode that supplants rather than supplements grassroots and local Government capacities. The more difficult \u2013 but more rewarding \u2013 work of creating the demand for environmental services is being neglected. At the same time, the recognition of the importance of civic engagement and participation in debates on reforming utilities is growing. Thailand's new constitution, in its Articles 45 and 46, requires stakeholder consultations before project undertakings that might affect livelihoods or the environment. In addition to building up and replicating low-cost, pro-poor indigenous models, Asia-Pacific countries need to ensure that liberalisation is preceded by enhanced domestic legislative and regulatory infrastructures that sustain these approaches. The daunting new demands for services and overwhelming fiscal shortage means that countries will inevitably need to draw on foreign technology and capital. The relevant question to ask, thus, is not whether to open up to foreign investment, but what segment, when, how fast, and with what kind of policy safeguards in place. Liberalisation of environmental services: Marrying investment needs with social obligations The overarching need is to match the legitimate investment crunch in environmental services with human development obligations. Can this be best handled within GATS or unilaterally? If countries decide to undertake commitments on environmental services, or sub-sectors within, at the WTO, what should they see as their framework of 31 potential benefits and losses, and how should they go about framing their responses? Commitments to liberalise in environmental services could be traded off for meaningful reciprocal offers to enhance domestic capacity, or improve access for labour movement, or promote agriculture and fisheries exports. Liberalisation on the part of developing countries also could be tied to conditions such as transfer of technology, which could in turn contribute to implementing Articles IV and XIX of GATS that aim at increasing the participation of developing countries in world trade in services. There also exists a longstanding argument to treat the two factors of production (labour and capital) symmetrically, and to balance Mode 3 and Mode 4 commitments.

At the WTO, there is no agreed template on what environmental services constitute. The current definition includes: sewerage services, refuse disposal services, sanitation and similar services, cleaning of exhaust gases, noise abatement services, and nature and landscape protection services; the latter draws on a 1991 document called the W120 and refers to the United Nations Central Product Classification. This definition has been criticised for being too narrow and not reflecting market realities. In sending requests to WTO members, the European Commission proposed its own classification (based on the 32 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All OECD-Eurostat definition16 of \u201cenvironmental,\u201d which includes, among others, water for human use.17 The formal state of play in the request/offer process cannot easily be determined since information is seldom released publicly, but leaked documents relating to the EC\u2019s first batch of requests, in 2003 to 109 countries, caused a lot of interest. The United States in its initial offer on GATS, while accepting the broader classification of environmental services, has excluded \u201cwater for human use\u201d in the sector-specific commitments. Among the Asian WTO members, six made commitments on environmental services, namely, Cambodia, China, Japan, Nepal, Republic of Korea and Thailand. Four countries have made full market access commitments on all sub-sectors. Republic of Korea limited individual foreign investor ownership of individual companies to 6 percent. In Thailand, foreign equity participation must not exceed 49 percent of the registered capital, and the number of foreign shareholders must be less than half the total number of shareholders of the company. In acceding to the WTO, Nepal undertook commitments strategically. It liberalised 11 services sectors and 70 sub-sectors, which on the surface is high for an LDC. However, a thorough study of the limitations entered in horizontal commitments as well as market access and national treatment columns tells a different story. Its objective was to liberalise only those services sectors in which: a) the Nepali private sector may never get involved, given the huge sunk cost and high gestation period 16 The Eurostat definition of the environmental industry consists of \u201cactivities which produce goods and services to measure, prevent, limit, minimise or correct environmental damage to water, air, and soil, as well as problems related to waste, noise and ecosystems. This includes cleaner technologies, products and services which reduce environmental risk and minimise pollution and resource use.\u201d The EC is approaching the entire water cycle holistically and argues that this is covered under \u201cresource use.\u201d 17 Only 0.1 percent of the world\u2019s water is for human use; more than 99 percent is saline, or glacier or snow (UNEP Atlas 2005). 33 (e.g., pipeline transportation); b) the Nepali private sector is already competitive and is confident that it would be able to outperform the foreign service suppliers, even if the sector concerned is liberalised (e.g., banking services); and c) the sectors where employment potential for the locals is high, e.g., computer and related services (Adhikari 2005). While regional banks and IFIs have often made the case for privatisation of utilities, shifts have occurred in recent years. The World Bank now sees the privatisation of water as \u201cproblematic,\u201d calling for the building up of regulatory capacity, especially for clarity of roles among various levels of government and the regulatory agency. Concessions and leases are more effective than privatisation to achieve efficiencies of competition while retaining strong public oversight (Kessides 2004, 15). Even so, concerns would remain on the grounds of equity and sustainability. The profit-seeking behaviour of private firms, especially under conditions of monopoly, is likely to result in price hikes and exclusion of the poor unable to pay increased rates. Environmental sustainability is a concern as well; for example, a private firm may indulge in unsustainable withdrawal of underground water. In fact, all forms of negative externalities need to be rigorously addressed. Efficient waste collection by a private company may be accompanied by more dumping of trash on sensitive wetlands, as has happened in Chennai, India (Sawhney and Chanda 2003, 23).

This is a low-risk option of service contracts, most appropriate when only operational efficiency is required without significant new investment. Build operate transfer (BOT) and build operate own (BOO): Under BOT, private investment is invited to construct and operate new facilities for an extended period so as to allow recovery of cost and earning of profit. Government retains ownership of the infrastructure facility. A BOO (or BOOT) is a long-term concession contract where the infrastructure assets entrusted to the private party remain Government property, and the Government remains the regulator. Joint ventures: Private and public sectors together assume co- ownership of assets and co-responsibility for the delivery of services, by forming a new company or sharing ownership of an existing company. Full Privatisation: The Government grants the responsibility of providing the service and ownership to the private party. The Government only functions as the regulator of quality and prices. Source: Qutub (2003) Moving forward The human development paradigm views people as the end of all state efforts. The following indicators for empowerment, productivity, equity and sustainability appear most relevant to the environmental services industry: Empowerment: Employment Generation; Transparency and Accountability 35 Productivity: Economic Efficiency; Technology Transfer Equity: Basic Access; Fair Access Sustainability: Technological Sustainability; Environmental Quality The advantage of working with these indicators is that they are objectively verifiable. This list can be useful when countries find themselves confronted with requests to liberalise trade in environmental services, and they ask themselves two pertinent questions: i) Which sub- sectors offer the best opportunities for enhancing human development through liberalisation? ii) At the other extreme, where are the risks for human development? In considering these questions, policymakers should take note of the following sets of issues: First, services provided directly to industry offer a win-win opportunity for stakeholders and society at large. In particular, effluent treatment plants can achieve economies of scale in an industrial estate setting. Because the clients are industrial establishments, there is no risk of marginalising any poor stakeholder. Society benefits because negative externalities are assigned to point sources of pollution and regulation ensures that the polluter is charged appropriately. A level playing field encourages compliance among users. Management contracts or concessions for industrial wastewater treatment reduce administrative costs and support efficiency. Worldwide experience confirms that feasible levels of pollution charges can meet the capital and operating costs of the services provided. Any surplus revenues can be assigned to improving the quality of the general public welfare. A liberalised private sector regime for Combined Effluent Treatment Plants could thus bring more FDI, break local institutional gridlocks and provide respectability to Asia-Pacific processors in world markets. The clientele would be industry, and there is no risk of excluding the poor. Second, employment displacement in the solid waste management sub- sector is one of the greatest risks associated with trade liberalisation. Excessive mechanisation targets the livelihoods of some of the poorest 36 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All people. The exclusion of low-income communities from privatised and liberalised water supply and solid waste management services are also serious risks. In addition, there is considerable risk that biodiversity conservation projects managed by international consortiums will fence off parks and protected areas and deprive the poor of their traditional access rights. Third, one longer-term strategic opportunity for developing countries is to export labour and skill intensive environmental services. Other opportunities include securing recognition for watershed management in upland areas and traditional biodiversity management as environmental services, traded across borders or consumed abroad. Fourth, on the specific subject of water for human consumption within environmental services, there is a strong human rights dimension that must be recognized as on par with similar rights to basic food and adequate housing. This has been discussed in the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights, where countries have been urged to assess how trade policies affect human rights. The key point is that states have, over the years, undertaken many international human rights treaty obligations which need to be respected by WTO members during their negotiations and while implementing commitments to liberalise trade in managing air, water and waste.

While there is no evidence that GATS commitments automatically lead to increase in FDI, they could send a signal of sorts to investors. GATS also could lock in not only economic policy, but also human development-friendly measures that countries could not retract owing to vested pressures at a later date. The flip side, however, is that reneging on commitments can lead to costly trade sanctions. 37 Sixth, with coalition building around such experiential learning, developing countries of Asia-Pacific could embed reform and investment needs in their national anti-poverty strategies that comprehensively address water, sanitation and public health challenges through multiple channels: direct public investments, stage-wise privatisation, scaling up of participatory community-led approaches, and engagement in international trade. A comprehensive strategy that leverages all policy possibilities is the only way countries have any chance in filling parts of the glaring gaps in access, use and affordability of mainly water and sanitation. This bottom-up approach of home-grown policies also will assist countries to respond strategically to requests during sectoral trade negotiations at the bilateral, regional and global levels. 38 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All III. International trade in energy services and human development The scale of development challenges It will be nearly impossible to achieve any of the MDGs without the availability of adequate, affordable and clean energy, given its pervasive role in human life. More than 1.5 billion people in the world have no access to electricity; most live in rural Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The average electrification rate in South Asia is only 41 percent, less than half the average for Southeast Asia and China (87 percent). Nearly 2.5 billion people rely on traditional biomass for cooking and heating, of which 72 percent live in Asia. The data show that the higher the level of biomass consumption, the higher the extent of poverty. They suggest an inverse correlation between the extent of biomass energy consumption and key demographic indicators such as life expectancy and infant mortality. The absence of modern energy undermines efforts to raise the living standards of the poor, especially in rural areas, and prevents them from enhancing their livelihood opportunities. Energy can play a catalytic role in development, but this takes place in conjunction with other complementary development inputs, such as water supply, health facilities, market access and credit. This has been recognised by the United Nations under its WEHAB (Water and Sanitation, Energy, Health, Agriculture and Biodiversity) Framework presented at the World Summit for Sustainable Development 2002, which highlights the interconnections between energy and other factors that contribute to human development. In developing countries, important barriers in the way of supplying modern energy services (fuels and electricity) to the poor consist of the following: First, in rural areas, the primary problem is the poor\u2019s inability to access modern energy because supplies simply do not reach them. Transporting electricity and fossil fuels requires capital-intensive distribution networks for which remoteness and low levels of demand are major 39 constraints. The farther the poor are from the reach of such networks, the greater the difficulties of operating supply utilities on financial sustainability principles. Second, the poor lack purchasing power. As a result, even where communities as a whole have access, the poor among them have to forego the benefits of modern energy. The transition from traditional biomass energy and human/animal labour to efficient modern resources and appliances invariably \u201ccommercialises\u201d energy, since all modern energy options carry a price. Low incomes set a low threshold of affordability among the poor, with the want of energy competing with other survival needs. Third, insufficient cost-effectiveness is a crucial barrier to enhance affordability. Cost-effectiveness can be ensured when there is a multiplicity of energy services, and service providers to select from. The poor in developing countries have limited choices in both, partly due to resource and technology limitations but equally because of policies restricting the emergence of diverse and competitive energy markets. Fourth, rural poverty affects men and women differently, with women bearing a disproportionate share of hardship. Women are responsible for onerous and time-consuming tasks in collecting and using traditional fuels on rudimentary stoves. This has direct consequences for women, ranging from serious health impacts caused by indoor pollution to lost opportunities for self-improvement. Energy security and trade An overarching concern in the energy sector is energy security: the growth and preservation of international supply lines for critical fossil fuels and, in some cases, electricity.

Box 6: China\u2019s Quest for Energy Security In 2005, China\u2019s most ambitious takeover bid to date was launched by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation Ltd. (CNOOC) by overbidding the American oil giant, Chevron, for Unocal, another American company with large natural gas and oil reserves throughout the world. The Chinese bid of US$18.5 billion by the 70 percent Government-owned oil company trumped the US$16.4 billion offered by Chevron. However, much political hostility at the prospect of a Chinese takeover stalled the process in the United States, with some lawmakers proposing a ban on the acquisition for reasons of U.S. energy security. Amidst much rancour, CNOOC withdrew its bid on 2 August 2005, but left behind a mark of future ambitions on the global stage. CNOOC is the result of a 1982 Government directive that created a joint venture company for oil exploration in Chinese territory, and a part of the \u201cinner sanctum\u201d of the top 50 Chinese state-owned companies. At the same time, rising concerns over fossil fuel dependency have prompted the Chinese to pass a law that aims to have wind power provide 10 percent of total energy supplies in the next five years. The new plan, described as ambitious by experts, will see the present 0.01 percent of power grid contribution by wind- power electricity increase substantially through infrastructural investments and price fixing for solar- and wind- generated electricity. Sources: The New York Times, July 7 and 20, 2005 41 The global business turnover in energy products was estimated at US$2.4 trillion in 2000 (Evans 2002). The bulk of this, between US$ 1.7 and $2 trillion, featured in trans-border trade, much of it in oil, oil products and gas. Assuming an annual growth rate of 2.5 percent and taking into account the steep increases in global oil prices since 2003, the current volume of globally traded energy likely exceeds US$3 trillion a year, making energy the largest component of international trade. This does not include trade in energy services18 (the numerous technology, skill, capital and managerial inputs) that go into each link of different energy chains, from exploration to delivery at the point of end use. These are valued at about US$100 billion a year based on projected energy investment needs alone for the period 2000-2030 (IEA 2003). 18 \u201cEnergy services\u201d as distinguished from \u201cenergy goods\u201d in international trade definitions. 42 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All Table 2: Select Energy Indicators Traditional fuel Electricity GDP per CO2 emissions \u2013 consumption consumption unit of share of Country per capita energy use world total (% of total energy (kilowatt- hours) (1995 PPP US$ (%) requirements) per kg of oil equivalent) 2001 1980 2001 1980 2001 2000 Bangladesh 63.6 30 115 9.7 9.7 0.1 Bhutan 84.1 17 241 .. ..

With energy demand continuing to grow worldwide \u2014 especially in the Asia-Pacific region, which is expected to account for one-fifth of global demand by 2010 \u2014 the volume and complexity of trans-border energy trade are growing rapidly. Global trade in energy is expected to double by the year 2030 and will be accompanied by significant structural changes in trade flows. Evidence of this is indicated by the following developments: \ufffd Whereas historically, international trade in energy took place for the most part between energy-producing (mainly, oil-producing) developing countries and energy-consuming industrialised countries, new actors have emerged to alter this decades-old equation. A number of developing countries, notably China and India, are now among the top energy-consuming and import-seeking countries in world energy markets. Malaysia, a net oil exporter, has signalled an imminent reversal of its status to that of an oil importer as its reserves approach the point of saturation. \ufffd The limited extent of trans-border trade among developing countries traditionally involved neighbouring countries under bilateral agreements. The outreach of this trade is now expanding beyond immediate borders and across continents. China has a 50 percent 44 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All share in Iran\u2019s Yadavaran oil field; China National Petroleum Corporation owns 60 percent of Kazakhstan's Aktobemunigaz; Sinopec has invested US$1 billion in a joint venture with Brazil\u2019s Petrobas for a gas pipeline; and in the latest bold move, China National Offshore Oil Corporation made a US$18.5 billion bid for Unocal, a U.S. oil and gas company. Similarly, India\u2019s Oil and Natural Gas Corporation has invested in offshore gas fields in Viet Nam and in energy projects in Algeria, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Venezuela, Libya and Syria; an Indian private group, Reliance Industries, has a stake in an offshore field in Yemen, and ONGC Videsh Ltd. has acquired a 20 percent share in Russia's Far Eastern Sakhalin-1 field.19 \ufffd On an intra-regional basis, new initiatives have been launched to foster trade in gas and electricity. Notable among these are the ASEAN Gas Grid, ASEAN Power Pool, Greater Mekong Sub-Region Power Grid, SAARC Regional Grid and the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline20 projects. These are being accompanied by efforts to scale up the volume of existing bilateral energy trade arrangements such as, for example, electricity trade between Nepal and India. \ufffd Gradual deregulation of the publicly owned energy industry in as many as 16 countries of the region \u2013 China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Viet Nam \u2013 has triggered fundamental market transformations leading to new opportunities for trade in energy goods and services (WEC 1998). The majority of independent power producers (IPPs) in several of these countries is foreign-owned, and new policy emphasis on renewable energy also has led to the entry of foreign technology suppliers. 19 http://in.rediff.com/money/2005/jul/05guest1.htm 20 India and Iran signed a deal worth US$ 22 billion on 13 June 2005.

A breakdown of the former indicates that power generation, transmission and distribution will absorb almost 60 percent of the aggregate cost. Investments in the oil and gas sectors will each amount to more than US$3 trillion, or around 19 percent of global energy investment. The coal industry will require US$400 billion, or 2 percent. The five largest countries outside the OECD \u2013 Brazil, China, India, Indonesia and Russia \u2013 will need about one-third of global electricity investment. Financing these investments will be one of the biggest challenges of the generation. With the coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in February 2005, environmental considerations are becoming a major driver of new energy technology. Advanced technologies being developed today could dramatically alter energy choices and requirements in the longer term. The transfer of these technologies to developing countries will add a new dimension to established patterns of trade in energy. However, even assuming a generous scale of technology transfer from the rich to developing countries, the energy needs of the latter will continue to grow, in part because of their very low levels of energy consumption per capita at present and in part due to continued population growth.23 Short of dramatic breakthroughs in energy efficiency, the gains from the induction of improved present-day technologies into developing 22 APEC (2003) 23 Much of the world population growth up to and beyond 2050 will occur in developing countries. 47 countries will at least be partially offset by absolute growth in their energy demands and higher rates of per capita energy consumption. Against this background, market opening measures have gathered momentum in Asia-Pacific, with a growing number of countries finding it necessary to introduce structural reforms to cut costs and improve economic performance. These measures include: a) Deregulation (reducing state control) b) Corporatisation (placing public energy utilities under commercial discipline) c) Unbundling (breaking up vertically integrated, state-owned monopolies into smaller units, with portions of the energy supply industry passed on to the private sector) d) Private sector participation (joint ventures, energy service companies) and e) Privatisation (independent energy producers). The overall thrust of these reforms is to introduce competition in order to reduce expenditure on energy production, reorient decision-making to incorporate private rather than public economics, and establish more transparent pricing to better reflect energy costs. The underlying reasoning is that without massive investments, including foreign investment, it is not possible to meet the growing energy needs of developing countries through public investment and ODA alone. The central aim of the reforms is to enlarge access to cheaper, more efficient energy which, in turn, will enhance the productivity of people and enable them to compete in a globalised world. Significant energy sector reforms are now taking place in at least 13 countries of the region (WEC 1998). While progress is being made, none of the developing countries involved has achieved a substantial level of liberalisation comparable to the industrialised countries. Reforms across the board covering electricity, coal, oil and gas are occurring only in India. In other countries, one or more of these industries are undergoing structural 48 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All changes, with the majority of countries concentrating on reforms in electricity. The general direction of reforms is toward a diminishing influence of government, especially in terms of price controls and guaranteed markets. This involves a transfer in ownership either from central government to government-owned independent enterprises, or from government-owned to private companies; removal of import quotas and duties, and a reduction in government subsidies. Progress with the reforms has been mixed thus far.

Privately owned domestically-controlled, and privately owned domestically-and-internationally controlled power utilities are present only in the advanced economies of Hong Kong SAR, Japan and the Republic of Korea. However, private entities coexist with public utilities in Sri Lanka, where the latter retains its predominance, and in the Philippines, where private ownership is more influential. The Power Sector Reform Act and the Downstream Oil Industry Deregulation Act in the Philippines have sought to attract private sector investments while ensuring fair and reasonable energy prices. The former mandates the reduction of electricity prices and addresses the issue of access by stipulating that distribution utilities are required to provide universal service within their franchise areas (Pacudan 2003). In the majority of countries, the electricity industry remains vertically integrated with generation, transmission and distribution vested in government entities and pricing mostly regulated by the government. Independent regulators or competitive markets have yet to become prevalent. Although, as noted, these reforms have revolved around domestic markets, they have facilitated foreign capital, technology and energy flows. 49 Liberalising trade in energy services So far, the ongoing energy reforms in developing countries have concentrated largely on domestic markets. There are now calls to extend them further into the international arena. Energy resources are not the focus of these moves because states need to retain control of these resources for the welfare of present and future generations. The calls have more to do with the numerous activities, or \u201cservices,\u201d that go into the extraction, production, transformation, transportation and delivery of each \u201cenergy chain.\u201d The energy market is highly segmented, with more than 30 different types of such services that can be singled out as \u201cadding value\u201d to each stage linking an energy source to the final consumer (Zarrilli 2003, 25). The considerations for liberalising upstream services are different from transportation and downstream services. The Doha Development Agenda is the first time that energy policy measures have come under multilateral trade negotiations. The proposals on energy services are aimed at gaining greater access to markets being liberalised by reducing the potential of residual monopolies to frustrate competition. Initial \u201coffers\u201d at the WTO in the energy sector are difficult to assess because of scattered commitments,24 but qualitatively not much is on the table (South Centre 2005). Classification-related issues have attracted much attention in GATS proposals because they reflect the liberalisation goals of the United States, Japan, Chile and the European Union. These countries are pressing for liberalisation of upstream energy services with the aim of increasing and securing control of supplies. Some proposals also reflect domestic strategies for liberalisation of segments within the energy chain, such as in Indonesia. While it is generally acknowledged that the energy sector will continue to be regulated to pursue public goals, the outcome of negotiations on 24 From developed countries, the United States, Norway, Australia and the European Commission have made initial offers, and from developing countries, Egypt, Colombia, Chile and India, among others. 50 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All other key issues on the Doha Agenda could have potential implications for energy policies and human development, including subsidies and countervailing measures. These issues have been raised in negotiations of accession to the WTO, along with \u201cWTO-plus\u201d requests in the areas of governmental controls on production and export of petroleum-based products; domestic prices and pricing policy; export tariffs and taxation; the operations of state trading enterprises; and \u201cunfair\u201d trade practices (Gibbs 2003). Box 8: Indonesia\u2019s Strategic Approach GATS negotiating positions reflect domestic strategies such as those of Indonesia, which is liberalising the downstream segment of the energy sector to improve its refineries, mainly to be able to refine its own oil. Indonesia hopes to attract foreign investors who would bring the capital and technology needed to improve domestic refinery capacity. Indonesia also is liberalising the upstream segment of the energy sector and has recently privatised the national oil company, Pertamina. However, it wishes to attract only domestic private investors for now, because it believes that domestic companies would not be able to compete with foreign companies right away. In November 2004, Indonesia introduced at the WTO a revised proposal for classification of energy services with the aim of achieving a high level of desegregation in energy service activities. This would allow countries, especially energy-endowed developing countries, to liberalise only the specific sub-segments that they wish to liberalise.

In sheer investment terms, the electricity sector is most important, followed by the oil and gas sector where, aside from the volume of estimated investment, 51 concerns over supply security are added motivations. As a result, considerable attention is paid to gas transportation and transmission via tankers and pipelines. While coal features in broad-based requests for energy sector-wide access, its relative importance is low. In the case of oil, gas and coal, there is a stress on upstream services that are more capital-intensive than downstream services. Electricity transmission and distribution are, however, of considerable interest since the projected investment in them is larger than that in generation and exceeds the combined total of the oil and gas sectors. Of the four \u201cmodes\u201d of supply, Mode 1 is relevant for online trading and energy brokering and professional services that can be delivered by mail or electronically, such as consulting or legal services. It also covers services related to the cross-border transmission of electricity and gas through pipelines and interconnected grids. Mode 3 is the most important because it covers all different forms of foreign commercial presence, such as BOT25 contractors and IPPs. Mode 4 includes the movement of skilled personnel who deliver technical and managerial services, as well as the movement of semi-skilled and unskilled personnel needed, for example, for the construction and upgrading of grids. Potential human development impacts of energy market liberalisation Access to cheaper, more efficient energy through market reforms and trade liberalisation can mitigate the energy security concerns of developing countries, help sustain their economic growth prospects, and enhance the productivity of their people. These developments can enable developing countries to compete in a globalised world. However, reforms and liberalisation imply that governments will no longer be able to apply direct measures in the energy sector in support of human development goals, but shall have to pursue them through new regulatory structures. 25 Build, operate and transfer. 52 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All Asian experiences to date with energy market reforms represent a transition whose pace and eventual destination are still uncertain, given that the starting point for each country is different and that there are concerns over the human development impacts of open markets for energy. Taking the example of the electricity sector, where the most progressive reforms are occurring, developing countries have to cross several stages \u2013 from initial corporatisation of state utilities to full retail competition \u2013 before achieving the kind of substantially liberalised energy markets that are being advocated by development banks and their shareholding industrialised countries. Recent setbacks with liberalised energy markets in the United States have, however, prompted Asian countries to adopt a more cautious approach.26 Although these developments should not deter countries from the long-term benefits of energy liberalisation, they are nonetheless a warning against the potentially serious public interest consequences of hasty marketisation. Available evidence suggests that the price reduction benefits of liberalisation are long-term rather than short-term. By contrast, the current emphasis of energy strategies on human development seems to require a higher rather than lower level of regulatory intervention by the state. This points to the need for a graduated approach to liberalisation, accompanied by adequate regulatory safeguards in line with equity gaps in individual countries. As nations grapple with domestic reforms and international requests to trade in energy services, their potential impact on important human development variables must be noted. A recent review carried out by the 26 In 2001, Enron, the world\u2019s largest private energy company \u2013 with 21,000 employees, 25,000 miles of gas pipelines and 9,000 MW of electricity generating capacity in the United States and abroad \u2013 collapsed, with subsequent enquiries revealing widespread price-rigging practices. In a related development, the privatised electricity market in California underwent a series of convulsions, leaving hundreds of thousands of consumers without electricity and major power corporations in bankruptcy, requiring repeated Governmental interventions to ensure power supply 53 UNDP Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Initiative in five countries of the region sheds light on the nature of these impacts.27 \ufffd Energy consumption: In absolute terms, evidence suggests that market and trade liberalisation will lead to an increase in the growth of modern energy consumption at the overall national level. It is unlikely this will take place evenly across all segments of the population, however. Countries with large rural populations without access to modern energy cannot expect profit-seeking private firms to enter rural energy markets readily. Nonetheless, decentralised renewable energy programmes with private initiative can", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87d2a156-662b-40c6-8b72-887e1a2fd4bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "87d2a156-662b-40c6-8b72-887e1a2fd4bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3cda0e97f1177e8e404aac0c575f9b5b2ff3fb2603f845ad39776580618435a4"}}, "hash": "3cda0e97f1177e8e404aac0c575f9b5b2ff3fb2603f845ad39776580618435a4", "text": "increase modern energy consumption in rural areas. \ufffd Energy prices and affordability: Energy price increases are likely to occur in almost all cases of liberalisation. Competitive electricity markets do not support price subsidies and cross-subsidies. Price increases could be offset over time by efficient production, construction and transportation/transmission technologies, coupled with subsidies and lifeline rates targeted at the poor. The initial costs of decentralised renewable energy technologies could decrease gradually as market expansion takes place and economies of scale kick in. However, in the short to medium term, the price impacts are likely to be largely negative. \ufffd Universal access: Ensuring universal access to electricity and modern fuels implies the supply of a minimum quantity of modern energy to meet the basic needs of all. Market or trade liberalisation can, at best, contribute to the overall state effort aimed at universal access by easing supply constraints. 27 Refer to country case studies (on China, India, Iran, Malaysia and the Philippines) prepared by the UNDP Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Initiative. 54 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All \ufffd Employment and income: The potential for income growth due to liberalisation is mixed. For instance, in China coal industry reforms left 1.5 million workers unemployed. On the other hand, expansion of the energy industry as a whole due to market-opening could add new functions and employment opportunities. New jobs may occur in other economic sectors as higher energy consumption leads to economic expansion. \ufffd Rural-urban income disparity and migration: Even if liberalisation leads to greater energy availability for rural populations, no assurance exists that this will result in rural economic development that can arrest migration and reduce income disparities, given that energy is one of several inputs to rural development. \ufffd Human resource development and capacity building: In all five countries assessed by UNDP, liberalisation has transferred technical and managerial skills and knowledge from the developed countries along the energy chain, especially in exploration, production and transmission/transportation facilities. Further liberalisation can enhance these benefits, more so if it leads to enhanced local manufacturing capacity in energy equipment. \ufffd Education/literacy: Impacts on education and literacy will be negligible. The problem lies with low levels of modern energy supply to rural households. The level of illumination provided by lighting fuels and decentralised electricity is usually inadequate except for basic visibility. This is partly due to supply constraints, but more because of low incomes and the need for households to minimise their energy expenditures. \ufffd Health and local environmental protection: Liberalisation is expected to usher in new, environmentally cleaner technologies in various activities along the energy chain. Traditional biomass cooking fuels in rural households, which are a major cause of local environmental 55 degradation and poor indoor air quality, are likely to be replaced by less-polluting fuels like kerosene and LPG. However, fossil fuel consumption is likely to increase with liberalisation, with potential adverse effects on health and environment. \ufffd Gender equity: The gender dimension of energy has to do largely with the time spent by rural women in the time-consuming tasks of traditional fuel collection, preparation and cooking. Time savings for women in these activities cannot be realised from the promotion of kerosene and electricity, because these are intended for non-cooking uses. As a result, their enhanced supply, made possible through private networks and providers under a more open market climate, might carry other impacts but have little effect on women unless household incomes increase sufficiently to make cooking fuels like LPG affordable. \ufffd Small and medium enterprise development: Liberalisation will generally benefit SME development. However, countries with a large unemployed work force could be adversely affected in construction activities where local SMEs could be displaced by multinational presence. Negative impacts also are anticipated in wholesale and retail energy trade activities where foreign firms could replace the traditional role of distribution utilities and local contracting firms. \ufffd Energy security and strategic supply control: The ability of governments to retain strategic control over energy production and distribution is generally expected to diminish in a competitive market environment. To the extent that the operation and management of such services pass from the hands of state-owned utilities to free market players, there are potential adverse effects for national strategic interest and for lifeline supplies to marginalised populations. \ufffd Policy response flexibility: The ability of governments to exercise policy responses is expected to diminish under a more competitive 56 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All environment where regulation, taxes and other forms of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d893771-ec31-4f36-8a00-fab7c0c625db": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d893771-ec31-4f36-8a00-fab7c0c625db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45d2725da0d6dd2f28a1636e6f5bf640f5013f5a2170e2af9e4eeb0d9c75fa19"}}, "hash": "45d2725da0d6dd2f28a1636e6f5bf640f5013f5a2170e2af9e4eeb0d9c75fa19", "text": "government intervention in the market give way to more direct interaction between buyers and sellers. Although governments will continue to make broader policy decisions to pursue national strategic interests and welfare goals, these are not likely to allow them the kind of policy response capability that they have through state-owned utilities. \ufffd Efficient resource use: Resource use is expected to receive a boost, since this is a key strength of the market. Subject to continuing regulatory policies that ensure the community and welfare obligations of the government and also of the private sector, liberalisation will better reflect the scarcity value of primary energy sources in prices; introduce more efficient technologies; allow redundancies in overstaffed state-owned utilities; and bring in more effective financial planning and management tools. Box 9: Health Effects of Biomass Use on Women Biomass cooking on traditional stoves is a major source of concentrated air pollutants, including carbon monoxide and a number of carcinogenic compounds. In some places in developing countries, the pollutant exposure levels associated with indoor biomass burning is many times greater than generally accepted health standards, such as maximum particulate concentrations of 250 micrograms per cubic metre in the United States. However, in developing countries people are routinely exposed to indoor particulate concentrations many times higher. These levels rival or even exceed the pollution levels found in the most polluted industrial cities. Women and children are particularly affected, where cooking smoke is confined to indoor settings, to which they are exposed for extended hours each day. Source: WEC 57 Implications for poverty Transforming energy markets does not mean that all forms of government intervention in energy should be disowned or dismantled. That would be irresponsible and premature. Most developing countries in the region are far from achieving universal access to energy, with poor consumers particularly vulnerable to the \u201cliberation\u201d of end-user prices that have been regulated and subsidised by governments for decades under the public utility model. Any liberalisation of energy markets must, as a matter of human development priority, protect the interests of these consumers. A balanced approach to energy market transformation could simultaneously pursue market penetration and market creation, the latter directed at ensuring those enabling conditions that make it easier for the poor to make the energy transition within a predictable time frame. This would involve safeguards like subsidies and lifeline tariffs to cushion the price shocks of market liberalisation, as well as compatible measures to raise the poor\u2019s incomes so that safeguards do not become permanent aberrations of the need to reflect the scarcity value of energy in prices. The preceding assessments indicate some long-term gains to the poor in the form of higher energy consumption and access. However, the near- term losses to them in income, employment and price increases could outweigh the gains. Some would argue that this is a worthwhile trade- off, but the question is: for whom? The poor lack the most basic level of economic security in the form of assets and income. Asking them to endure higher energy prices and loss of livelihood for an uncertain number of years is not justifiable on human development grounds. The removal of pricing subsidies for energy post-liberalisation could prolong poverty, not resolve it. Misdirected subsidies clearly have a corrosive influence on efficiency as they obscure the true value of scarce energy resources. But so long as poverty remains a problem, the response to the abuse of subsidies cannot be to abolish them altogether. This is a 58 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All reality acknowledged by the World Energy Council which, while supportive of the abolition of subsidies in general, states that: \u201cGovernment or regulatory intervention in energy pricing mechanisms may be justified to address certain externalities or to achieve certain social or long-term goals. Energy subsidies, which may be necessary, must benefit those who really need them and should enhance the accessibility, availability and acceptability of energy services. Such subsidies should be visible in terms of their size, transparent in terms of their sources and beneficiaries, and subject to review within a prescribed time period.\u201d The other side of the coin is the poor\u2019s lack of income, which inhibits them from participating in the market. Rational pricing policies need to be matched by rational income policies. While energy can play a role in increasing the incomes of the poor, it does so effectively only when combined with other development inputs, implying that energy market liberalisation cannot be considered in isolation of policies in other development sectors.

While there are a number of powerful economic reasons why liberalisation should be sought, there are equally compelling reasons why governments should draw the boundaries of liberalisation to limit its adverse consequences for the poor. Creating energy markets for growth and access In the face of surging competition for international energy resources and unrelenting volatility in global energy prices, the transition to modern fuels and electricity in Asian developing countries can be accelerated only by diversifying their energy resource base, achieving higher levels of efficiency in energy production and consumption, and introducing greater competition in domestic energy markets that have historically functioned in a government-controlled monopolistic environment. Recent years have witnessed a growing sense of discontent with the concept of energy as a \u201cnatural monopoly,\u201d controlled largely by state- 59 owned energy utilities operating in highly regulated markets. The inability of this model to reach large numbers of people in spite of persistent supply expansion over the years and the limits to governmental investment capacity has prompted calls for policies to enable private investment and initiatives. Pressures to liberalise trade in energy services are an extension of these calls. This implies liberalisation of investment and trade through bound commitments in a sector traditionally viewed as strategic and central to national sovereignty. Box 10: War, Oil and Prices Dramatic losses of Middle East oil supplies did not materialise either during or after the Iraq war in 2003. OPEC members, especially Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, had committed to using their spare production capacity. The war\u2019s impact on oil infrastructures were largely confined to Iraq, but this did not eclipse the fact that sizable energy import dependence from a single region or oligopolistic supplier always remains a supply security risk. Oil prices breached projected levels in 2004 and peaked to US$70 per barrel in August 2005, and this trend is predicted to continue. High oil prices on international markets affect domestic energy prices and macroeconomic fundamentals. Costlier fuels raise input costs, damping exports from Asia, a region that accounts for 30 percent of the world economy. Growth rates are being revised downward because of higher oil prices \u2013 the forecast for Asia without Japan has reduced from 6.7 percent to at least 6.3 percent, but could fall another 0.6 percent. Partly because of rising energy costs, OECD too has forecast its growth rate at 2.6 percent compared to 2.9 percent in 2004. Issues of energy access and affordability are at the nexus between energy and poverty, and while many studies call for reform if not gradual elimination of price subsidies in petroleum products over the long term, there appears to be a dearth of literature on the short- to medium-term impact of recent oil price increases on poor people\u2019s livelihoods. Source: World Energy Assessment (2004); IHT Online, accessed 21 July 2005; UNDP Regional Energy Programme 2005 60 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All There are, however, differences between allowing the entry of domestic private providers and opening the doors to foreign investors who may have little interest in rural energy markets because of low projected returns. Trade liberalisation may facilitate the expansion of supply channels in energy, but it might do little to overcome the problem of developing countries in ensuring universal access. Governments are therefore cautious about ceding control over all elements of these channels (for example, oil pipelines or power transmission grids) to private players as they strive to strike a balance between growth and equity objectives. The uneven distribution of energy resources and disparities in the economic development status of countries offer opportunities as well as risks for developing countries. For instance, Bangladesh has no significant reserves of oil, but it has natural gas, which requires an urgent inflow of external technology and knowledge for exploitation.

The image of a country like Nepal \u2013 with more than a third its population below the poverty line and with nearly 85 percent of the population without electricity \u2013 becoming the largest exporter of hydropower to India is a study in contrast. In fact, the poor in energy exporting countries could well shoulder a greater economic, social and environmental burden than those in the importing countries as new export-oriented production facilities (hydroelectric and oil-/gas-fired plants) add to local disruptions to livelihood and pollution. At a broader level, increased trans-border trade in energy might do little to redress prevailing rural-urban poverty gaps in both exporting and importing countries. To the contrary, it may exacerbate them given that 62 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All the primary beneficiaries on either side of the bargain will be governments, industries and urban consumers. Protecting the poor against these risks implies a careful consideration of the benefits and costs of energy trade to the poor. It may require continued regulation to shield the poor from price shocks and other potential pitfalls like physical dislocation, loss of livelihood and adverse health impacts. Trade negotiations taking place largely in relation to government-industry perceptions of priorities should enlarge the scope of their participation to include consultations with the poor, who are rarely consulted on the agreements that countries enter into on their behalf. Moving forward In the dual economies of developing countries, where a socially and economically backward rural majority coexists with a modern urban minority, the benefits of economic growth tend to coalesce among the latter. There is a risk of trade liberalisation in energy services following a similar path. However, countries in which the dual economy phenomenon is less pronounced, or those that have mitigated them to a significant extent, can experience faster growth through market-opening measures. Where such growth is accompanied by prudent social policies to safeguard the interests of the marginalised population, progress in human development is conceivable. The challenge, therefore, is to strike the right balance between growth and equity and to sequence trade liberalisation in graduated steps commensurate with levels of a country\u2019s socioeconomic resilience to market transformation. The proposals at the WTO for trade liberalisation in energy services seek broad access to markets in developing countries at a crucial juncture, when many are implementing domestic reforms with varying degrees of progress. Available evidence on the outcomes of these reforms is partial and inconclusive. However, there are signs of economic benefits occurring by way of greater efficiency in exploration, development and production activities along different branches of the energy chain (coal, oil, gas and electricity), and early competition that could potentially 63 provide improved service to consumers. There is also evidence of adverse impact, importantly, through higher consumer prices and unemployment without offsetting re-employment. In this state of flux, developing countries lack a firm basis to negotiate trade in energy services either within the WTO, or bilateral and regional trade agreements outside of it. These negotiating proposals have come at a time when developing countries need to access advanced technologies, knowledge and much-needed capital. Given that energy technology innovation remains concentrated in industrialised countries, there are opportunities in the proposals worth serious consideration. The prudent course of action is to examine them carefully with in-depth analytical inputs, identify priorities and options specific to the situations and needs of each country, and negotiate a human development-friendly quid pro quo.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9177895-12b6-406b-b12e-9df049334389": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9177895-12b6-406b-b12e-9df049334389", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "50deaabf7ef9b89982bbb75f27f0a0429e401df432ae533c96fbe771b5c7d96c"}, "2": {"node_id": "3201b0f4-99c4-4fe5-82ab-c1cbdea940c0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a74bf8c21d414c743e29005d5453770e46658f08ce3a9e3f4daddf42d3f27565"}}, "hash": "651db27b1ced8965c9cf0d9d22b184a5dc4a94fef0ee30f07d9c1c835aaebeca", "text": "Under GATS, developing countries are under no obligation to make commitments against any of the proposals on the table.

Countries could continue to have monopoly energy supply providers so long as they have an accompanying regulatory body whose functions are open and transparent. They may or may not commit to providing third-party access to transportation and transmission facilities. They can, if they wish to, restrict market access to foreign firms and give preference to local firms if they feel it is in their national interest. Even if they make commitments to allow market access and national treatment, they can specify exceptions that allow them the flexibility to limit that access. They may provide subsidies only to local firms, if these are indicated in the national treatment column of their schedules. Finally, they can 64 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All impose public service obligations on foreign firms as a condition for access. The lack of policy options is not the constraining factor in GATS negotiations, but rather it is insufficient policy enlightenment on the role of energy in human development. Any commitment to liberalise access to energy markets would be made as a part of an overall Single Undertaking. WTO negotiations are based on reciprocity and commitments by Asia- Pacific countries that would provide huge economic advantages to firms from developed countries. They should be contemplated only if developed countries benefiting from such access make commitments and concessions in other goods and service sectors of export interest to Asia-Pacific countries. However, priority should be given to obtaining human development- compatible commitments from developed countries in the energy sector itself. Without this basic strategic understanding, developing countries run the risk of entering negotiations with scanty information, inadequate understanding of relative policy priorities, and the possibility of making hasty commitments that may come back to haunt them. The strategy for developing countries in the region thus could involve four core components: First, market access may be limited to those parts of the energy sector that are considered most beneficial and, reciprocally, access may be sought in developed-country markets in areas where a developing country has a competitive advantage. Asian countries with skilled human resources could trade energy market access commitments for a more secure movement of their professionals to jobs abroad. Others could seek concessions in agriculture or specific labour-intensive manufactures. Second, the energy needs of certain segments of the population cannot be expected to be served by the market, and therefore, those segments should continue to enjoy price and/or capital cost subsidies, special incentives for rural distribution cooperatives, and continued monopolies in electricity transmission networks. 65 Third, many countries in Asia-Pacific are actual or potential exporters of energy with distinct needs. They should, in particular, avoid obligations that would restrict their ability to maintain dual pricing regimes, i.e., they should be able to provide energy to domestic consumers at prices below those at which they export (world prices). Fourth, given the stark facts of energy deprivation in Asian developing countries, the MDGs and the implicit priority they assign to rural energy are of overarching concern. However, this should not confine energy policies to a \u201csmall is beautiful\u201d paradigm. Small-scale energy technologies have made a negligible contribution so far to reducing income poverty. Evidence suggests that income gains are more likely to accrue to rural populations that have access to electricity and modern fuels from centralised energy systems. Attention to trade questions must therefore balance issues surrounding both centralised and decentralised energy, with a long- term focus on ensuring convergent paths between the two. 66 | Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development: Contributing to Well-Being, Growth and Access for All REFERENCES 1.

One common challenge is to devise negotiating positions which help maximize gains from the various trade arrangements. Recent country-level studies commissioned by the UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo in four Asian LDCs, namely Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Nepal explored the potential implications of World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements, Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs), and Bilateral Trade Agreements (BTAs) for these countries. Out of these studies, a number of common challenges have emerged in relation to trade negotiations ranging from market access to Aid ForTrade (AFT). Based on the findings, this policy brief highlights a number of key negotiation issues and strategies that these LDCs can adopt to address their trade and developmental concerns. As the trade negotiation landscape is rapidly changing and significant changes have occurred in the past few months, this brief also tries to incorporate the recent developments, where applicable. WTO negotiations The Doha Ministerial Declarations, known as the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), were intended to address several trade-related development concerns of developing countries. The 2004 July Framework and the 2005 Hong Kong Ministerial Conference reaffirmed the Declarations adopted in Doha. However, the Doha Round of trade negotiations has gone through turbulent phases since it was launched in 2001. The recent failure of the mini-Ministerial Conference held in Geneva in July 2008 is testimony to difficulties in the negotiations. Although the future of trade negotiations depends on political dynamics resulting from impending elections in the major WTO Members, this brief takes the final offers that were tabled during the mini-Ministerial Conference as the basis to analyze issues of interest to the four Asian LDCs. Agriculture Agriculture has been the most contentious issue in multilateral trade negotiations. Since the agricultural sector has come under spotlight in the global political landscape due to recent increase in agricultural commodity prices, concerns over the impact of liberalization have assumed even greater salience. This sector makes a significant contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GOP), livelihood and private consumption expenditure of the four Asian LDCs studied. Among them, however, Lao PDR, which is in the process of WTO accession, is the only net exporter of agricultural produce; the other three, which are WTO Members, are net importers. Therefore, welfare implications from the liberalization of agriculture are likely to vary depending on the relative strength of the sector including the level of import dependence of these countries. Under the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture, Members have been negotiating for agricultural trade reforms; e.g. removal of agricultural trade barriers and subsidies. While little progress has been made in further liberalizing agricultural markets, trade reforms are expected to impact negatively on net importers of agricultural commodities. For example, according to a quantitative simulation by Raihan (2007), elimination of export subsidies as agreed in the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference could result in welfare losses of USS 12 million to Bangladesh and USS6.4 million to www.undprcc.lk 1 Trade Negotiation Issues and Strategies to Cambodia. As per the Revised Draft Modalities on Agriculture produced by the Chair of the agriculture negotiations on 10 July 2008, which formed the basis for the text prepared by the WTO Director General, the major subsidizers of agricultural products have been urged to reduce their domestic support by 70 to 80 percent (WTO 2008a). If and when this proposal is implemented, there could be a further increase in the import bill for net food importers, even though subsidy is not the only determinant of international price changes. Since end of subsidies is likely to increase world commodity prices, some argue that LDCs welfare losses from liberalization can be substantially mitigated by increased value of their agricultural exports. However, it should be noted that an increase in commodity prices might result in higher food import bills for countries that continue to rely predominantly on imports. The studies of four LDCs summarized in Raihan et al. (2007) found a number of agricultural commodities with significant export potential, including processed fruits and vegetables, tea, coffee, herbs and medicinal plants, organic rice, and cashew nuts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd721ed1-076d-48c6-8080-5067276d60bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd721ed1-076d-48c6-8080-5067276d60bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-negotiation-issues-and-strategies-asian-ldcs-joint-policy-brief-issue-3", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade Negotiation Issues and Strategies for Asian LDCs - Joint Policy Brief Issue 3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-negotiation-issues-and-strategies-asian-ldcs-joint-policy-brief-issue-3", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7cefee82b6dca68c433ae9736839598ede3408dc181b6f88de31755b24e3ea4b"}, "2": {"node_id": "18bec487-cc49-493d-b830-0c74aadf6d4c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-negotiation-issues-and-strategies-asian-ldcs-joint-policy-brief-issue-3", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7340b26d316e50ce400b9e484be6190a314162941e25f3d6c8d5d17705a622e8"}}, "hash": "7e515d568091b7dfccbd96adf58d5a73ea65faa81126bab262afaa3a99d3e6d6", "text": "High tariffs in major export markets act as inhibiting factors against export expansion of these commodities.

Non-agricultural market access Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) negotiations are proceeding towards the reduction of bound tariff rates, bringing unbound tariff rates under binding commitments, which will be subject to formula cuts, and identifying and removing Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs). A consensus was reached at the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference on NAMA modalities to use a 'Swiss formula\" for the reduction of bound tariff rates. The recent Draft Modalities produced by the Chair of the NAMA negotiations, which formed the basis for the text proposed by the WTO Director General, recommends the coefficients of 7 to 9 for developed countries and three categories of coefficients for developing countries in the range of 20 to 25 (WTO 2008b). lf and when NAMA tariffs are reduced, they will provide additional market access opportunities for the LDCs. Although LDCs are exempted from such reduction commitments, they are expected to substantially increase their binding coverage (WTO 2005). Issue 3 August 2008 If these NAMA-related measures are implemented, they are likely to have both positive and negative impacts on the four lDCs under consideration. On the positive side, the LDCs' market access to many of the developed and developing countries will increase in selected sectors due to tariff reduction. On the negative side, they may suffer from possible preference erosion in countries such as Canada and the EU, where they currently enjoy Duty-Free and Quota-Free (DFQF) market access. Services trade liberalization Liberalization of services trade under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) has important implications for all the four LDCs as services account for a significant share of their GDP. One of the major constituents of services trade-remittances-are important for these LDCs, particularly for Bangladesh where they contribute to 7.1 percent of GDP and for Nepal where the corresponding figure is 15.2 percent. However, services trade liberalization under the Mode 4 (Movement of Natural Persons) of GATS is largely being restricted by immigration regulations and barriers related to visa and work permit. In most cases, no distinction is made between temporary and permanent movement of workers, and the process involves complicated, non-transparent and costly steps to conform to labour market regulation. Furthermore, in terms of migration regulations, developed countries seem biased towards high-skilled workers. In general, the movement of low-skilled workers, which most LDCs can competitively supply, is the most restrictive. Cross-cutting issues This section deals with four distinct but inter-related issues of interest to LDCs, as they cut across most market access agenda under the WTO. Duty-free quota-free market access The 2005 Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration allows 'members facing difficulties' to reduce LDC product coverage for duty-free treatment to 97 percent of tariff lines (see WTO 2005). However, as the LDCs' exports to developed countries are concentrated on a few categories such as Ready-Made Garments (RMGs), most of their export items could be potentially excluded from such treatment under this scenario. Moreover, Asian LDCs are not granted preferential market access in the United States and thus face high tariff rates on most of their RMG exports. As per simulation results in Raihan (2007), gains from full DFQF access in the US market alone are around USS500 million for Bangladesh and USS 154 million for Cambodia. Gains for Nepal and Lao PDR would be much -------~ www.undprcc.lk 2 Trade Negotiation Issues and Strategies smaller-about USS 14 million and USS6 million respectively-but still significant in terms of percentage share of RMG export revenue from the US market. In addition, the potential products identified for export diversification such as Bangladeshi generic parts/light engineering and Nepalese leather also face high tariff barriers on their export markets. likewise, Cambodia faces high tariffs on the export of cashew nuts and natural rubber to developing countries such as China and India. Since advanced developing countries are also emerging as major markets for LDCs and they are likely to maintain high tariffs even after the completion of NAMA negotiations, achieving DFQF access in such markets could be immensely beneficial to LDCs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a1cc2a3-9d5d-4af2-8f6e-4e368693f31b": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a1cc2a3-9d5d-4af2-8f6e-4e368693f31b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-negotiation-issues-and-strategies-asian-ldcs-joint-policy-brief-issue-3", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade Negotiation Issues and Strategies for Asian LDCs - Joint Policy Brief Issue 3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-negotiation-issues-and-strategies-asian-ldcs-joint-policy-brief-issue-3", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a8deab1fffc0269a58f02bb7cd536240100d2da767e8af405dfae90ea4c37c7b"}, "2": {"node_id": "dff4e372-a2aa-409a-a76c-f7a0632eebd1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-negotiation-issues-and-strategies-asian-ldcs-joint-policy-brief-issue-3", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f752cd10351379f710a82e59ee300ccfcedd6f2a4bba038330dcf330f872a2de"}}, "hash": "41965f0c52105ac753a8230dcd257e1e51adb9160535e96972c96764a0ba9889", "text": "For example, a recent study by Laborde (2008) estimates that full DFQF market access in five large developing countries (Brazil, China, Indialv, Mexico and South Korea) would lead to annual export gains as high as USSs.6 billion for all the LDCs.

Standards related NTBs such as Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) restrictions act as major impediments to LDCs' exports, particularly when they are not based on scientific evidence and/or beyond the standards set by international bodies. The studies summarized in Raihan et al. (2007) found cases that developed countries impose stringent SPS requirements and other NTBs on export products from Asian LDCs. For example, developed countries, particularly the EU, impose stringent SPS requirements on Bangladesh's export of agro-processing and herbs. Cambodian rice exporters face strict SPS requirements in most of their export markets in addition to other NTBs such as import quotas in the EU and a restrictive rice import policy in Japan. Food processors from Lao PDR face SPS measures in most of their target markets. Similarly, Nepal's exports of tea and herbs to its major markets confront 100 percent incidence of NTBs. As for non-agricultural products, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Lao PDR face standards and labeling requirements in the export of handicrafts such as silk products to developed country markets including the EU and Japan. Nepal also confronts NTBs such as customs and administrative procedures in the export of leather products to its major markets. Issue 3 August 2008 ROO is another major NTB affecting Bangladesh, Cambodia and Lao PDR, and such barrier has resulted in low utilization of preferences for these LDCs. For example, their utilization rates of Everything but Arms preference given by the EU are in the range of 60 to 70 percent (Adhikari 2008). Preference erosion Since LDCs enjoy preferential market access in many developed countries- e.g. DFQF market access in Canada and the EU-tariff reductions under agriculture and NAMA negotiations would lead to preference erosion for them. As preference erosion largely depends on the value of exports, preference margin and current rate of preference utilization, Bangladesh is expected to be a major loser in EU market. For example, based on a simulation by Raihan (2007), assuming NAMA coefficients of 10 for developed countries and 20 for developing countries, Bangladesh is expected to lose USS 196 million from preference erosion. However, this loss can be offset by additional opportunities arising from DFQF market access to the United States, Japan and other developed countries as well as new opportunities that tariff reductions in developing countries would bring about. For example, Laborde (2008) shows that full DFQF treatment provided by five advanced developing countries (Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Korea) and five developed countries (Canada, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, and the United States) would not only reduce the losses arising from preference erosion substantially but also result in large-scale net gains for the LDCs. Aid for trade Recognition that market access alone is not sufficient to help developing countries in general and LDCs in particular to export their way out of poverty led to the incorporation of the concept of AFT in the Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration. AFT is expected to help the LDCs overcome their supply-side constraints and/or to mitigate the challenges posed by multilateral trade liberalization, such as preference erosion. After the adoption of the Task Force report constituted to provide recommendation on how the initiative Umight contribute most effectively to the development dimension of the DDA u (WTO 2005), the WTO has organized three regional reviews and one global review of the initiative. While the primary responsibility of providing AFT lies with multilateral development organizations and bilateral donors, the WTO will mainly play the monitoring and surveillance role. In addition, the WTO will also be responsible for implementing the Hong Kong mandate ----------------------- www.undprcc.lk 3 Trade Negotiation Issues and Strategies on Enhanced Integrated Framework (ElF), a revamped and modified version of the six multilateral agencies\"\" collaborative efforts to provide trade~related technical assistance to LDCs initiated in 1997.

For example, African LDCs could suffer from preference erosion in the US market, if the LDCs' proposal of full DFQF market access is implemented. Therefore, compensatory mechanisms such as preferential access to AFT resources should be proposed to the prospective losers in order to garner a broader support for common positions. Similarly, expeditious removal of cotton subsidies, which are of great concerns to African LDCs such as Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Mali, will have to be taken on board to demonstrate solidarity amongst lDCs, even though cotton issue has limited significance to Asian LDCs. Some of the LDCs' concerns relating to agriculture and NAMA are best addressed specifically through appropriately designed sectoral negotiating strategies; others can be comprehensively addressed through the cross~cutting agenda. For instance, LDCs should specifically align their positions with the proposal of G-33 on SSM and SP on agricultural negotiations. As for NAMA negotiations, LDCs had better demand for full autonomy while increasing their binding coverage. On services, a major negotiation strategy for LDCs is to call for removal of restrictions on the movement of low~ skilled and se mi ~sk illed category of workers. On cross ~ cutting issues, the following common positions for WTO negotiations are of critical significance: DFQF market access: Lobby to keep most of the Issue 3 August 2008 duty-paid export items off the exclusion list. One strategy is to negotiate for DFQF access to all products with relatively high tariffs (e.g. tariff rates higher than 6 percent). At the same time, it is beneficial to demand DFQF market access in advanced developing countries. Non ~ tariff barriers: Demand ROO applicable to imports from LDCs to be transparent and simple and contribute to facilitating market access, as agreed at the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference. The Canadian ROO provision can serve as a useful model for this initiative. In addition, the removal of regulatory barriers that are higher than the internationally agreed standards and/or not backed by evidence would be beneficial to LDCs. Preference erosian: Call for an agreement to provide trade solutions such as increased market access on protected sectors, and nan~trade solutions such as increased provision for AFT based on the magnitude of preference erosion. Aid far trade: Demand additional and predictable flow of AFT to help them take advantage of trading prospects with a view to better integrating their economies into the global economy. This is applicable in the context of goods as well as services trade. RTAlBTA negotiations One of the likely consequences of the failure of the mini~m inisterial conference of the WTO and ensuing hiatus in the DDA negotiations is the proliferation of RTAs and BTAs. While the interests of LDCs are best protected within the multilateral trading system, they cannot avoid negotiating RTAs and BTAs because of the way the various forms of trade agreements are currently being negotiated. Therefore, it is equally important for them to devise a well thought out strategy for the negotiations of these agreements. Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Nepal are members of several RTAs. For example, Bangladesh and Nepal are members of the Agreement on South Asia Free Trade Area (SAFTA) and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi~Sectora l Technical and Economic Cooperation Free Trade Agreement (BIMSTEC FTA). Cambodia and Lao PDR are members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and are participating in various negotiations under the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). However, some RTAs have not yielded the expected trade expansion. SAFTA, for example, is unlikely to expand regional trade because most highly~traded items and other items with trade potential are included in the sensitive lists by most countries. In addition, prospects for trade in other products that generally face low tariffs are ------------------------- www.undprcc.lk 4 Trade Negotiation Issues and Strategies by NTBs.

One of the services sectors, tourism, is of immense significance to all the three LOCs except Bangladesh. RTAs may prove mutually beneficial when the regions such as ASEAN and South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) are developed as common destination for tourists. While ASEAN tourism cooperation has been in operation since 1976, SAARC has been slow in this respectvii Accordingly, ASEAN LOCs are far ahead in terms of realizing this objective. For example, Cambodia recently signed a bilateral Single Visa agreement with Thailand with a view to increasing tourist flow. Besides, regional cooperation to enhance supply capacity in LDC member countries in the areas of infrastructure, transportation and vocational training is also crucial. These LDCs have also been engaged in several BTA negotiations with neighbouring countries and/or countries in the North. As for BTA negotiations, South-South BTAs can bring benefits to the LDCs. For example, the trade treaty between India and Nepal provides preferential market access for products manufactured in Nepal through the elimination of basic customs duties and quantitative restrictions on the basis of non-reciprocity (except for items on the negative list). As a result, trade between two countries has increased, albeit at the cost of growing trade deficit with the balance tilting in favour of India. In order to address this problem, both the countries are now contemplating to enter into a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. There are, however, concerns whether North-South BTAs will be beneficial for the LOCs. Some studies have indicated that BTAs between developed and developing countries can result in trade diversion for the weaker partners (UNESCAP 2007). Likewise, others have argued that due to inherently asymmetric negotiating prowess, Issue 3 August 2008 stronger partners can impose their will, including several WTO-plus conditions on services liberalization, competition and investment policies, environment and labour standards and intellectual property rights, which are detrimental to the interests of the weaker partners (Gibbs and Wagle 2006). Based on the analysis presented above, the negotiating position for South Asian LOCs within the regional trading arrangements should focus on deepening and broadening the areas of cooperation on other economic issues, besides pushing for the reduction of sensitive lists as well as removal of NTBs. ASEAN LOCs, which encounter limited market access restrictions within the Region, should focus on improving their supply capacity. As far as South-South BTAs are concerned, the LOCs should not only press for non-reciprocal preferential market access to the developing partner country, but also engage in more comprehensive economic cooperation. However, the LOCs need to conduct a development impact assessment as well as prepare a well informed negotiation position based on multi-stakeholder consultations before entering into a BTA with a developed country partner. The way forward The negotiation issues of Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao POR, and Nepal, are generally in sync with the positions of other LDCs at the multilateral level. Even where differences exist, they are not of the magnitude that cannot be reconciled. Since DFQF market access is the single major agenda for the Asian LDCs, they should be prepared to address the concerns of African LDCs on the removal of cotton subsidies and preference erosion in order to maintain cohesiveness among LOCs. Similarly, developing a common position on other issues relating to agriculture, NAMA, services negotiations, ROO and NTBs, in which all the LOCs have the same position, is not likely to prove difficult. While South-South RTAs and BTAs are likely to produce benefits to the LDCs, deepening and broadening of the areas of economic cooperation are necessary to realize the true potential of these arrangements. However, due to trade diverting nature and negotiation dynamics that are tilted in favour of stronger players, the LOCs need to be extremely cautious while signing North-South BTAs. Finally, it is necessary to sound a note of caution. Given the fact that these LOCs have limited institutional capacity and negotiating capital, it is necessary for them to prioritize the negotiating fora as a part of an overall negotiation strategy in order to obtain maximum advantage from trade negotiations. ----------------------- www.undprcc.lk 5 Trade Negotiation Issues and Strategies References Adhikari, Ratnakar. 2008. uThe Local Content Paradox at the WTO: A Minor Lapse or Organised Hypocrisy?,\" BRIDGE Monthly Review.

programme 26 TRADE, TRADE AGREEMENTS AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDS 1 2 Introduction Background The Pacific islands have some of the highest rates of obesity and diabetes in the world, with obesity rates as high as 75% and diabetes rates as high as 47% in some countries1. Increasing reliance on imported foods has contributed to an \u2018epidemic\u2019 of obesity and related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the region2 . In 2011 Pacific Island Forum Leaders as part of the 42nd Pacific Islands Forum communiqu\u00e9 declared the Pacific in a crisis due to the non-communicable disease epidemic. Several trade agreements currently being negotiated by the Pacific island countries are likely to have a big impact on future ability to address NCDs, including PACER Plus (being negotiated between the Pacific Island Forum Countries including Australia and New Zealand) and the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with the European Union. For example, reductions in tariffs (import taxes) on unhealthy products such as fatty meats, tobacco and alcohol could lower the prices of these products, contributing to obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Trade agreements can also restrict governments from introducing policies and laws to address NCDs, such as bans on certain products, restrictions on food labelling, etc. There is a need for closer engagement between the health and trade sectors in (i) developing health promotion strategies to address NCDs that are compliant with existing trade commitments; and (ii) contributing to the design of trade policies and trade agreements that are health promoting. The concept of policy coherence asks that health policies and trade agreements are formulated in ways which enable both trade objectives and public health objectives to be met at the same time. The need to work towards closer coherence between health policy and trade policy has been recognised in World Health Assembly Resolution 59.263 and reiterated in many regional meeting and research reports. Capacity development is needed to support such collaboration. In August 2011 during the NCD forum in Tonga, health offficials with responsibility for NCD prevention and management from 14 Pacific island countries were interviewed regarding their capacity for health-trade collaboration in their countries. The findings from these interviews substantiate anecdotal evidence and concerns previously expressed in the literature that the health sectors of Pacific island countries are generally not well equipped to initiate cross-sectoral discussions about health and trade. Capacity building strategies that were prioritised most highly included training in technical disciplines such as epidemiology and health economics; support from regional organisations (particularly country-specific advice); and earning opportunities for health officials (focused on understanding trade agreements) and trade officials (focused on understanding the impact of trade agreements on NCDs). Also emphasised was a need for different sectors (health officials, trade officials, clinicians, civil society, media etc.) to coordinate interventions in the intersection between trade and health.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7c432c9-cb17-4d49-b2d2-e2b9042440be": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7c432c9-cb17-4d49-b2d2-e2b9042440be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade, Trade Agreements and Non-Communicable Diseases in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2783de08e165699a8eb62192a0baf9064d4a29f516ddeacd8b9601a4db29f4bc"}, "2": {"node_id": "f2720d5c-b1ef-4fec-a723-700acbc3c093", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "81b8dbfbc698489460748d1a5323ab37897509191c818348562088ad84c453dc"}}, "hash": "16dc8388092a3d44c094b282b8de2050715ca77dbb04511cc57a5726ff1b7ddd", "text": "to coordinate interventions in the intersection between trade and health.

Goal and Objectives of the Workshop The overall goal of the workshop was to strengthen the capacity for effective collaboration between health and trade sectors in and across the Pacific Island countries, with a view to working towards trade relations which support health-promoting environments and accessible, affordable, available and adaptable health care and thus contribute to eliminating the excessive burden of NCDs in the Pacific Islands. Objectives 1. To encourage a shared understanding between health, trade, planning and civil society on the health implications of trade agreements in the Pacific 2. To identify tools and systems for assessing the potential impact of trade agreements on health, and health policy on trade 3. To draft country strategies for developing trade policies that support health, and health policies that are trade compliant Opening Statements The workshop began with an opening prayer from Dr Isimeli Tukana. The opening address was given by the Attorney-General, and Minister for Justice, Anti-Corruption, Public Enterprises, Communications, Civil Aviation, Tourism, Industry and Trade Mr Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum. Mr Sayed-Khaiyum indicated that there was a need for a balancing act between trade and the efforts to control non-communicable diseases. He stressed the need to take the best of what trade agreements could offer, while ensuring they did not add to the NCD challenge. He highlighted some of the efforts the Government had made to support the fight against NCDs, including changing import duties on healthier and less healthy foods, alcohol and tobacco. Opening remarks were also given by Dr Ezekiel Nukuro of the World Health Organization. He highlighted the scale of the NCD issue in the region, and the commitment given at global and regional level to tackling the problem. He emphasised how trade agreements and trade are affecting the supply of goods in and out of the region and stressed the importance of health being protected. There is also a need for greater understanding of how trade and health intersect. Opening remarks were then delivered by Mrs Fekitamoeloa \u2018Utoikamanu, Deputy Director General of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community. Mrs \u2018Utoikamanu said the interests of public health should be considered in trade negotiations and that there was a need for \u2018compatibility\u2019 between government efforts to minimize the negative impacts associated with unhealthy products, and international commercial treaties that promote the freer flow of goods, services and investment. Workshop participants were then asked to briefly introduce themselves and Dr Wendy Snowdon gave an overview of the aims and objectives of the workshop, and the programme content. TRADE, TRADE AGREEMENTS AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDS 3 4 Session 1: The intersection of trade and NCDs: an overview This session intended to provide an overview of health and trade intersection in the region, with a particular emphasis on NCDs. Dr Wendy Snowdon introduced this session, using an interactive \u2018clicker\u2019 session where participants were asked to use remote clicker devices to answer questions. Questions focused on underlying causes of NCDs and food insecurity, and where trade and NCDs may be interlinked in their country. Dr Temo Waqanivalu then provided an overview of NCD epidemiology and control in the region. He indicated that 75% of deaths in the region are due to NCDs and mostly premature. Recent surveys have found alarming rates; including diabetes prevalence in adults of almost 40% in one of the territories, and around 95% prevalence of obesity alongside high rates of tobacco use (60%) in another country.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78736158-07ca-49ec-bc3b-7570a2cd3939": {"__data__": {"id_": "78736158-07ca-49ec-bc3b-7570a2cd3939", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade, Trade Agreements and Non-Communicable Diseases in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d8ec41f94dcbffab76edd3859eaa57436c11a53bf5d48c6be98bd43dd5bc1cb7"}, "2": {"node_id": "e970dcb9-3044-46ee-8fd1-9db7f65c5078", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9686fd2caee108e3f89c1e2e4aa4aedeccb90d0321bf4223451ed31294d101b0"}}, "hash": "5ca5441db9b350fbd10388de8803cf1dc062681608b4c375ec75b5d2aa132665", "text": "Dr Waqanivalu indicated that up to one in ten diabetics may have an amputation in some countries, and 75-80% of admissions, general surgeries and renal dialysis patients are due to NCDs.

He emphasised that 60% of global deaths are due to NCDs and many of these premature deaths are now occurring among people who live in low and middle income countries. NCDs are clearly no longer synonymous with wealthy countries with ageing populations. Poverty increases the risk factors for NCDs through unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol, tobacco use and low physical activity rates. NCDs in turn increase the risk of poverty through health care costs, disability and premature death which cause decreased household income and further exacerbate the risks to poverty. Poverty, socio-economic determinants and NCDs in low and middle income countries Dr Xuereb then discussed how the social determinants of health influence NCDs and require a multi-stakeholder and cross- sectoral approach and call for countries to intervene at specific levels to affect the social structure (including gender), education and employment, trade and fiscal policies and purchasing power. He highlighted that since trade agreements are often quite broad in scope, i.e: covering trade in goods and services, regulation of intellectual property rights (IPRs), labour mobility, protection of foreign investments, phytosanitary regulations and the supply of goods and services to government; they can affect the social determinants of health which in turn have a high influence on NCD risk factors and the management of NCDs. Dr. Xuereb concluded that there are both benefits and risks for health in these agreements which require careful consideration. Dr Wendy Snowdon provided examples of how upstream determinants were affecting NCD risk factors, with a focus on diets and food supply. She outlined how store surveys had identified 54 countries of origin for foods sold in five countries in the region. The impacts of foreign direct investment including by fast food chains and of urbanization on diets were also discussed. Even aid post-disaster has contributed to long-term changes in dietary patterns in selected countries. Results of 5 country study on processed foods: 54 countries of origin of foods During the discussion, concern was expressed by one participant about a recent supermarket promotion in Fiji which gave away various high fat, sugar and salt items to customers. While consumers could refuse these items, there is also a need for work with all aspects of food industry including retailers so their activities support public health. TRADE, TRADE AGREEMENTS AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDS 5 6 Session 2: Trade agreements and how they can intersect with NCDs This session intended to introduce the intersection of trade and NCDs, from a trade perspective. Dr Benn McGrady began this session with another round of thought-provoking questions using the \u2018clickers\u2019. This included questions on how participants perceived the trade agreement development process and benefits in their country and the scope to implement trade regulation to address NCDs. Dr McGrady then spoke on the trade architecture and mechanisms in the Pacific Islands. The underlying feature of trade agreements is a commitment to lower barriers to trade (both tariff and non-tariff). Non-tariff barriers include quotas which might limit import amounts or health regulations.

Trade agreements which exist or are under consideration in the Pacific include PICTA, SPARTECA, EPAs and PACER Plus. Nicky Anaturin from the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat (PIFS) provided further information on the trade agreements in the region. He highlighted that 7 countries were currently trading under PICTA, with 4 yet to complete necessary domestic arrangements, and that other countries are yet to join. PICTA was regarded as a stepping stone for PACER Plus. EPAs are intended to be an instrument for development, and to assist Pacific Islands to be integrated into the world economy, as well as to achieve sustainable development and eradicate poverty, enhance production, supply and trading capacity and improve capacity to handle all trade-related issues. Progress has been made in recent trade negotiations in October and December 2012 for EPAs and negotiations are expected to be concluded by mid-2013. PIFS is also assisting small island states to develop and implement Trade policy frameworks to mainstream trade plans into trade policy, with a focus on: trade policy analysis and negotiations, trade facilitation and export development. Dr Sripen Tantivess shared an example of how health and trade agreements had overlapped in Thailand in the area of tobacco control. She highlighted the considerable burden of NCDs, and the importance of tobacco smoking as a risk factor. Since late 1980s government agencies, in collaboration with civil society organizations and private businesses, have introduced several measures to curb tobacco consumption. During the same period, smoking prevalence significantly declined. Excise tax rate, revenue and smoking prevalence, Thailand 1991-2011 Evidence suggests that raising excise tax was effective in reducing smoking, especially in low-income groups. However, this intervention was challenged under regional and bilateral free trade agreements (FTA), which required the elimination of tariff on tobacco products. Dr Tantivess also described how trade agreements under discussion may cause problems for tobacco efforts if the Thai government does not balance health concerns with economic benefits of these agreements on the agriculture and industry sector. In this respect, intersectoral, evidence-informed policy development is essential for health protection. During discussion of these three presentations a question was raised about whether any of the excise taxes in Thailand went to health promotion activities. Dr Tantivess clarified that 2% of the excise act were transferred to a Thai Health promotion Foundation. It was also highlighted that alcohol, food and tobacco cannot be tackled in exactly the same way, although some lessons may be drawn from successes in these areas. For example: that efforts are needed to increase access to healthy foods e.g. through support for local agriculture as well as reducing access to less healthy products. An additional question requested suggestions of what might be health-supporting interventions, which are trade compliant. Dr McGrady indicated that for tariffs, non-discriminatory excise taxes are preferred. Dr McGrady next presented on trade rules and their implications through a series of case studies. Indonesia argued discrimination when they were unable to export clove cigarettes to the United States, although menthol cigarettes were imported. The WTO panel had to consider whether clove and menthol were \u2018like\u2019 products, and whether restriction was more restrictive than necessary to protect human health. Indonesia lost its case. In regard to the adoption of plain packaging for tobacco, Australia is being challenged on the basis that the measure is restricting the use of a trademarks (tobacco company symbols and brands). A second case study was presented on the French ban on the import and sale of asbestos products. Canada complained under GATT (part of WTO) arguing discrimination as France uses asbestos substitutes (which pose no danger to health). The WTO panel found that the measure was discriminatory and favoured French substitutes but still ruled in favour of France because the measure was necessary for health. The final case study was on retread tyres, which Brazil banned the import of. They argued retread tyres have maximum lifespan of 5 years and then are discarded creating a breeding ground for mosquitoes. In fact less trade restrictive measures were available i.e. waste disposal, spraying, and ultimately the measure was found to be unlawful. During the plenary discussion questions were raised about the level of evidence needed to prove that something was harmful to health. Dr McGrady indicated that it was largely about assessing the risk, however there are no strict evidentiary requirements. It is important to ensure that product selection is consistent and \u2018like\u2019 products are regulated in similar ways, rather than targeting one particular product.

Multilateral trade agreements contain rules allowing for the adoption of measures to protect public health, even when such measures may violate parties\u2019 obligations. Article XX(b) of GATT 1947, for instance, has been invoked in certain cases as a justification for trade restrictive measures. GATT/WTO jurisprudence has subjected the application of this provision to the so-called \u2018necessity test\u2019, in accordance to which only the least trade-restrictive available measure would be permissible. In the Thailand-Cigarettes case, a panel rejected arguments based on article xx(b) . In Canada-Asbestos, however, the Appellate Body clarified that \u2018(1) the protection of health is a national objective of vital importance; (2) WTO members are free to select the level of health protection they believe appropriate for their populations; and (3) in cases analyzing measures to protect human health under the necessity test, the potential effectiveness of less trade -restrictive alternatives should receive strict scrutiny\u2019. One of the objectives of the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) is to enhance human health. WTO members can adopt standards higher than those recommended by the relevant international organizations if scientifically justifiable. The burden of proof is then shifted to Member countries. Governments should explore the ways for effectively using the public health-related provisions in the WTO system and in other trade agreements.

Prof Correa clarified that this was determined by parties to the dispute and the panel may also request expert opinions. Concern was expressed by one participant about CODEX standards which are promoted to be only food standards, not being of relevance for NCDs. Dr McGrady agreed that this was historically the case, with emphasis on food safety, however new areas were being discussed, such as trans fats4 . In the final session for day one, country teams were asked to share information about their country\u2019s situation in terms of both NCDs and trade and economic development, and to share any country-based examples of collaboration between health, trade and planning sectors. This was done through a pre-prepared poster, supported by a few minutes of explanation per team. This was a highly informative session for all participants, revealing considerable differences between countries and also some similarities. All countries highlighted their significant NCD burdens through mortality, morbidity and prevalence data. They also provided an overview of their NCD strategies and implementation approaches including multisectoral mechanisms (NCD committees) and regulatory interventions such as food regulations and sugar tax. Posters also included information on trade policies and economic country data, and their trade agreement environment. Civil society involvement in NCDs was also highlighted in some country presentations and some teams even identified actions they would pursue post-workshop to increase collaboration between trade and health. The presentations were lively and the posters provided a strong basis for the country group-work later in the workshop. Posters were left on display for closer examination during the remainder of the workshop. Example of posters developed by country delegates at the workshop Session 3: Regional cases where trade and NCDs have intersected The intent of this session was to consider regional examples of how trade agreements and NCD issues have intersected and how they have developed. The session began with a panel discussion on trade and economic development chaired by Dr Anne Marie Thow. Ahmed Moustafa began the panel by outlining the mixed results on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), across the region, with some good progress but also some issues. He also stressed that trade agreements do not directly lead to economic development, especially for countries in the Pacific. The markets for exports are already out there and accessible, with or without trade agreements, but the region has had problems with providing the supply. Additionally the market for primary commodities is highly volatile and competitive, to increase its earnings and the stability of these earnings, the region needs to move up value- added chain in terms of its exports.

Ms Falemaka also indicated that there was a need to consider health during development of trade policies and trade agreements, such as PACER Plus. For example, Vanuatu has a national trade policy, which integrates food security concerns. Dr Joann Young spoke of the work of the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat in regard to consideration of health in trade agreements, using the EPAs as examples. When Nauru, as part of its\u2019 EPA was asked to liberalise its market, it was allowed to exclude 20% of items from the agreement listing. It chose to exclude chapters 17-19, and it therefore can leave its tariffs for European goods unchanged \u2013 this includes sugary products thus meaning its sugar tax can remain in place. Dr Young also indicated that there was a provision in EPA for export tariffs \u2013 and this is allowed for \u2018special development needs\u2019. Paulini Sesevu from AusAid then spoke on the role of AusAID in the region, its strategic priorities and its emphasis on poverty reduction. The final presentation on the panel was from Dr Eva Jarawan from the World Bank who outlined the World Bank\u2019s commitments on health and development in the region. This includes improving health and nutrition, enhancing the performance of health care systems and sustainable health care financing. Dr Jarawan then provided a brief overview of a recent study by World Bank on costs of specific NCD treatments in three Pacific island countries. In particular she emphasised how costs increased as diseases worsened. Costs of treatment in Vanuatu for diabetes Ms. Jarawan also stressed that the fiscal space for health was shrinking and according to World Bank projections, raising the excise rate on tobacco and alcohol to reach WHO recommended level would generate extra excise revenue of 3.6 million Tala for Samoa (USD 1.57 million) and 2.5 million Pa\u2019anga (USD 1.4 million) for Tonga each year, whilst discouraging uptake. 4 This also includes food labelling and claims. A shift from trade-based standards to consumer-based standards and guidelines is underway in the Codex Alimentarius. This is a shift from a prevention of fraud approach (1960s) to providing more consumer information (1990s) and increasingly towards delivering health policy through labelling. TRADE, TRADE AGREEMENTS AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDS 9 10 During the discussion component of the panel, it was highlighted by a participant that health officers need to ensure friendly and open dialogue with trade officers. There was a request from one country participant for more countries to have studies on costs of NCDs. Nauru asked if World Bank would include other countries going forward. Dr Jarawan responded that World Bank would need to assess the value of and interest in further studies in the region. Dr Thow, Christine Quested and Samuela Bolalailai then spoke on mutton flaps and turkey tails. Mutton flaps and turkey tails were banned in Fiji and Samoa respectively. In Fiji, the ban was a health and commerce collaboration, proposed by health and implemented by commerce in the year 2000. Mutton flap imports declined significantly, but due to difficulties with enforcement mutton flaps have reappeared on the market despite the ban. In Samoa, the ban, first put in place in 2007 on turkey tails was proposed by the Prime Minister and implemented by Customs after a cabinet brief supporting the measure was prepared by the Ministry of Health. The ban resulted in removal of turkey tails from the food supply \u2013 consumers replaced consumption with a variety of foods, including seafood and chicken, and some consumers reported eating less meat as a result of the ban. Samoa\u2019s ban on imported turkey tails has since been lifted as part of Samoa\u2019s accession to WTO. These case studies highlight bigger issues related to trade, food, agriculture and health. One is that unhealthy cheap imported food creates incentives for unhealthy diets, leading to NCDs. Another is that these cheap imports undercut local agricultural productions, leading to decreased production capacity and greater dependency on food imports. Dr Thow then spoke on the issues with agriculture, trade and NCDs. NCDs have implications for agriculture due to their negative effect on a productive labour force. The agricultural labour force is also affected by trade due to increasing labour mobility. Specific challenges for Small Island states in developing sustainable agricultural production for both high quality exports and traditional agricultural production include: Scaling up agriculture; Sale of fishing rights; Value adding; Climate change; Labour shortages; Competition from cheap imports; Export oriented agricultural investment; and Under-investment in traditional agriculture. Opportunities to overcome challenges include: Investment (local & international) in agriculture to enable farmers to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e8a9555-fc53-4bb2-8943-41b6a692a47c": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e8a9555-fc53-4bb2-8943-41b6a692a47c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade, Trade Agreements and Non-Communicable Diseases in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c923e326b435de4c3c3e7fdcf811cfec72c0f95715daee1eca5f76228907c63d"}}, "hash": "c923e326b435de4c3c3e7fdcf811cfec72c0f95715daee1eca5f76228907c63d", "text": "engage with high quality export markets as well as traditional production (e.g. better land management for sustainable intensification), support for value adding and innovation in production and processing for traditional foods and collaboration between trade, agriculture and health sectors. During the plenary discussions, a question was raised in regard to sustainability of bans, given problems experienced in Fiji and Samoa. Dr Thow suggested that fat-based standards which have been implemented in Ghana on fatty meats (effectively preventing sale of very fatty meat cuts) might be preferable to product specific bans. Dr McGrady also commented that these bans are not necessarily against WTO law, this depends on individual country accession agreements. What Ghana has done is consistent regulation across food product range, and this is much more in line with a WTO approach. A query was also raised about whether people had potentially shifted to other less healthy products when flaps or tails were unavailable. Ms Quested indicated that there had been no obvious shift to one alternative product, but overall to chicken and seafood, and also lowered consumption of meat overall. Dr McGrady also added that once a measure was in place, countries do not have to be able to demonstrate immediate impact (the long term impact is often more important). Dr Snowdon presented on sugary taxes in the region and began by outlining the evidence demonstrating links between high sugar intake, overweight, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There is evidence of high consumption levels of sugar and other high-sugar items such as soft drinks in the region. Daily intake of soft drinks by 13-15 year olds (global school health survey) Dr Snowdon also highlighted how sugar and high fructose corn syrup (an alternative to sugar, particularly used in the Americas) were heavily used across a wide array of processed foods, and were cheap commodities, in part because of production subsidies. This has led to significant global interest in taxing sugary products in an attempt to reduce consumption, and taxes are now in place in many countries. In this region Samoa, Nauru, French Polynesia and the Cook Islands are some of the countries which have tariffs on sugary products and/or soft drinks. Evidence globally is that they can lead to reduced purchasing by consumers if the tariffs are high enough to be noticeable to the consumer. From a trade agreement perspective, these tariffs are unlikely to be problematic as long as they are applied equally to domestic and imported products, and if import duties are used then they must not exceed what has been agreed as the upper bound limit. Berrick Dowiyogo then spoke on the sugary tax that has been implemented in Nauru. This applies a 30% tax to a range of high- sugar products. Mr Dowiyogo commented that he has seen a greater supply of diet drinks since the tax. However, there has also been more sourcing of sugary products from Asia, which are cheaper, meaning that the price to the consumer for some products (e.g. can of soft drink) has not changed overall. During the plenary discussion it was emphasised any such measure needed to be undertaken as part of a comprehensive strategy (also addressing behaviours). Additionally, viable healthier alternatives need to be available and affordable. Concern was also expressed at possible side-effects of such tariffs, and it was emphasised that it was important to consider these prior to implementing a policy through health or social impact assessments. Peter Hoejskov spoke on the issue of salt and salt standards for sale or import. He highlighted how high sodium intake increases blood pressure and contributes to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Other damaging effects of high sodium intake include cancer, kidney disease, renal stones and osteoporosis. Raised blood pressure is one of the key intermediate NCD risk factors and cardiovascular diseases including stroke are among the leading causes of death in Pacific Island Countries. Population salt reduction has been found to be one of the most cost effective interventions for NCD prevention and control. Salt intake originates from three main sources: food prepared at home; food and meals prepared by the foodservice sector; and processed food.

Comparable prevalence of raised blood pressure in adults +25 yrs in 2008 Western Pacific Region (Mr Hoejskov - PowerPoint workshop presentation) Jeanie McKenzie then spoke about the experiences with the issue of exclusion of tobacco and alcohol from the Pacific Islands Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA). She began with an overview of PICTA\u2019s development and then outlined the process that had resulted in alcohol and tobacco being excluded. This was primarily more about concerns over declines in duties and taxes than health issues. The need for early and thorough assessment of legal, socio-economic and health impacts before entering into trade agreements was highlighted, particularly to ensure policy coherence between trade and health. The interests of various stakeholders including national governments e.g. revenue/taxation, manufacturers and health interests, showed that finally the agreement on the exclusion of tobacco and Alcohol from PICTA suited all parties but for very different reasons; protectionism, lack of readiness to adopt tax changes and the growing concerns about NCDs. She also indicated that the long term future for the exclusion of tobacco and alcohol form PICTA is yet to be determined but the Forum Communiqu\u00e9 on Regional Health Initiatives \u2018acknowledged urgent need for health systems strengthening and cross-sectoral, whole of country initiatives to achieve better health outcomes at national level\u2019, which would indicate that alcohol and tobacco will continue to be excluded from PICTA for the foreseeable future. A comment was raised after this presentation that the exclusion of alcohol/tobacco from PACER Plus or EPAs may be more difficult, as the process is likely to be more stringent regarding exclusions as the discussions include non-Pacific island countries. Dr Benn McGrady then spoke about the relationship between the WHO\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and trade agreements. FCTC is an international treaty that binds Parties to implement a wide range of tobacco control measures. These measures include tax or price measures, mandatory warnings on tobacco product packaging and a comprehensive prohibition on tobacco advertising, sponsorship and promotion. The Convention is supplemented by guidelines designed to assist the Parties in implementing their obligations. All Pacific island countries (but not the Territories of the Pacific) are Parties to the WHO FCTC. Dr Lester Ross shared the experience of the Solomon Islands with tobacco control. The country has developed a comprehensive Tobacco Control Action Plan, tobacco-free school policy and a tobacco control Bill. More work is underway, to develop and enforce regulations for example, and there is a need to gain more support from important stakeholders such as Chamber of Commerce and Ministries of Commerce and Trade. Dr David Legge spoke about trade in services as part of trade agreements and how this might impact on health systems in the Pacific. He mentioned that the main agreement on trade in services is WTO\u2019s GATS (General Agreement on Trade in Services) but that most bilateral or regional trade agreements now have a Services Chapter which covers much of the same ground. The four modes of trade in services (i) cross border supply, (ii) consumption abroad, (iii) corporate presence, (iv) presence of natural persons. In health care these could be exemplified by: (i) telemedicine or internet transcription services; (ii) medical tourism; (iii) foreign investment in hospitals; (iv) importing doctors. Dr Legge argued that trade in services provisions are virtually irreversible and all of the benefits can also be achieved through development cooperation; because of the irreversibility, there is good reason to be very careful about committing to such agreements. Since GATS at least is negotiated on an \u2018opt in\u2019 basis he recommended that Pacific countries should be cautious about including health services or health related services in their \u2018offers\u2019. He expressed some doubt as to the significance of trade in services agreements for the Pacific. Dr. Legge also stressed that the interests of Pacific countries in relation to the four kinds of trade in services could be well advanced through international or commercial negotiation. He spoke about brain drain and the development of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c69e6ea-4bbd-458c-8af2-d41546712676": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c69e6ea-4bbd-458c-8af2-d41546712676", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade, Trade Agreements and Non-Communicable Diseases in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "152b14cd9007ae6fd3702c994ad88ce8cce1dd25b7250baa7b0e646a82f2568f"}}, "hash": "152b14cd9007ae6fd3702c994ad88ce8cce1dd25b7250baa7b0e646a82f2568f", "text": "tertiary care in particular as important issues for the Pacific which could best be dealt with through direct international or commercial negotiation. Prof Correa presented on the issue of access to medicines. The adoption of the TRIPS (Trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights) Agreement (part of WTO) brought about a drastic change in the policy space that countries had in regard to intellectual property (IP). Notably, TRIPS obligates all Member countries (with a transitional exemption for least developed countries only) to grant patents in all fields of technology, including pharmaceuticals. Patents create a tension with public health as they can permit the charging of high monopolistic prices on patented medicines. TRIPS contains, however, a number of \u2018flexibilities\u2019 that allow Members to mitigate the impact of exclusive rights including through: certain exceptions, compulsory licenses and parallel imports. The legal challenge by a number of multinational companies to block the use by South Africa of some of the TRIPS flexibilities eventually led to the adoption of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, in 2001 which confirmed those flexibilities. Despite this, developing countries still face the problem of proliferation of pharmaceutical patents on derivatives, formulations, new uses, etc. of known substances, which may unduly prevent or delay the commercialization of cheaper generic drugs. Non-WTO Members should use the policy space that they have to frame their IP regimes in accordance with their national interests. WTO members should use to the fullest extent possible the TRIPS flexibilities.

They were now rewriting their intellectual property legislation to be WTO compliant and made sure it encompassed TRIPS flexibilities (e.g. removing data exclusivity from its draft IP law). She highlighted the importance of the health sector being knowledgeable and engaged in trade issues and of cross-sectoral collaboration and coordination during development of trade agreements. She also added that health needs to get involved with trade even if feeling uncomfortable. During the plenary discussion, Dr Gleeson added that countries need to be aware of newer trade agreements (bilateral and multi-lateral) which include much more IP protection (known as TRIPS plus). A participant suggested that a system be created within Ministries of Health to train such professionals. It was also commented that it was important to verify the patent status of medicines, as absence of patents on certain medicines allow for importation of their generic, more affordable versions. Session 4: Assessing potential impacts of trade agreements on health and feasibility of policy options This session intended to briefly familiarise participants with some of the tools and methods available to assess trade agreements and policies for their relevance and health impacts. Dr Gleeson began with an overview of the methods and tools available for impact assessment. The focus of the session was on assessing the impact of trade agreements, but the methods and tools were also discussed in relation to assessing the impact of health policies. The three main methods discussed were Health Impact Assessment (HIA), Social Impact Assessment (SIA) and Human Rights Impact Assessment (HRIA). Dr Gleeson explained that Impact Assessments can be conducted either ex ante (before or during trade negotiations, to highlight likely impacts and inform the negotiations) or ex poste (after a trade agreement has been implemented, to measure actual impacts and assist in identifying mitigating measures). Each of the methods discussed (HIA, SIA and HRIA) follow a similar series of steps, which includes screening, scoping, collecting information, assessing the information, making decisions and recommendations, and evaluation, monitoring and follow up. They all use a combination of data collection methods, which may include quantitative data (such as economic data) and qualitative data such as community consultations, focus group or key informant interviews. There are various practical guides available for all of these methods. While the methods are similar, there are important differences in the normative frameworks of these three methods. HIA focuses on the social determinants of health and the differential effects that policies can have on the health of different population groups. SIA includes a focus on the social, environmental and economic impacts of trade agreements. HRIA is explicitly referenced to the human rights obligations", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a01a6d84-1ae7-4db0-8b2e-97133021aecc": {"__data__": {"id_": "a01a6d84-1ae7-4db0-8b2e-97133021aecc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade, Trade Agreements and Non-Communicable Diseases in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b464b284c49c63fbbaa2c32ee5b0b4d60358a2bc2ecdcc6de8948f08e8534a2"}, "3": {"node_id": "1f60e479-a9b1-4df1-bc54-353af410061e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db4ba10a4b8c8a0f0dc6bb3c30c33f3b15366e4c1e93d983613e4c5954b15684"}}, "hash": "ab7eafc3d96c49cee95ef0071e08f474b4e11c42a7dc853fa10c75f3c7ce3d91", "text": "of states and includes a focus of the impact on the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. Issues that need to be considered in an impact assessment (whichever model is chosen): \u2022 When to conduct the impact assessment (before, during or after the negotiations, or as a cyclical process); \u2022 The appropriate scope and level of detail given the time and resources available; \u2022 Who is best placed to undertake the impact assessment (keeping in mind factors such as independence from the negotiations, expertise, and the implicit assumptions that different actors might bring to the task); \u2022 The best mix of methods for the particular situation; \u2022 Transparency (of objectives and decision making criteria, of consultation processes, and findings and recommendations) and inclusiveness; and \u2022 Opportunities for the findings to feed into policy decision making. Dr Wendy Snowdon, reflecting on her experience with HIA to predict the possible impact of introducing policies for health and nutrition on other health and social issues, emphasised the value of these tools to \u2018flag\u2019 policies which might have potentially negative side-effects and warranted further investigation before being considered for action. She also highlighted that the screening process was relatively simple to undertake in a participatory way with a strong working group and tool. Simone Troller then presented on Human Rights Impact Assessments. She stressed that Trade agreements and human rights conventions both impose legal obligations on countries, and therefore countries should make sure that one set of binding rules does not undermine another set of legal obligations. Trade agreements and policies can positively or negatively impact on people\u2019s enjoyment of their right, including their right to the highest attainable standard of heath; and they can positively or negatively impact countries\u2019 abilities to realize human rights, including the availability, accessibility, affordability, and quality of health-related facilities, goods, and services. Increasing attention therefore is being paid to human rights impact assessments as a tool that provides countries with evidence on how to mitigate negative impacts of trade on human rights, including the right to health, and how to maximize positive outcomes. The UN has adopted guiding principles for assessing the impact of trade agreements and policies on human rights in 2011, and the same year the EU Parliament has called for human rights impact assessments to be carried out for all trade agreements with the EU. Brian Lutz discussed how statistics could be used to support analysis of impacts, with a focus on Household Income and Expenditure Surveys (HIES). While evidence-informed policy-making requires reliable, regular data, especially on NCDs and their risk factors, obtaining primary data, can be costly. Analyzing secondary data (i.e., existing data collected through other means) could provide a workable \u2013 if sometimes imperfect \u2013 solution. Regularly administered in Pacific countries, the HIES captures relevant, disaggregated food expenditure at household level. This is collected through food frequency assessments and is used as an indicator of calorie/energy consumption. These data can be classified by users into four binary, non-mutually exclusive categories (e.g., imported/local, unhealthy/healthy, processed/unprocessed, non-traditional/traditional) to develop descriptive food profiles. Analyses can also be conducted that examine relationships among food classifications (e.g., imported and unhealthy food) and among food classifications and NCD risk factors (e.g., imported food and obesity). The approach can provide an indication of problematic foods at the nexus of health-trade policy. It can also be used potentially to estimate policy impacts and build policy impact scenarios. Mr Lutz shared some cross-country results from five Pacific countries and requested consideration of scope for improvements in the methodology.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f60e479-a9b1-4df1-bc54-353af410061e": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f60e479-a9b1-4df1-bc54-353af410061e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade, Trade Agreements and Non-Communicable Diseases in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b464b284c49c63fbbaa2c32ee5b0b4d60358a2bc2ecdcc6de8948f08e8534a2"}, "2": {"node_id": "a01a6d84-1ae7-4db0-8b2e-97133021aecc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab7eafc3d96c49cee95ef0071e08f474b4e11c42a7dc853fa10c75f3c7ce3d91"}}, "hash": "db4ba10a4b8c8a0f0dc6bb3c30c33f3b15366e4c1e93d983613e4c5954b15684", "text": "Example of HIES data analysis as a tool for policy decision Expenditure on imported food by country Expenditure on non traditional food by country Expenditure (as% of total food exp) Expenditure (as% of total food exp) 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 Kiribati Kiribati Country Country 0.5315 0.520382166 0.299771463 0.403538686 0.494128282 0.30233817 0.326126099 Samoa Samoa Tonga Tonga Vanuatu Vanuatu Solomon Island Solomon Island Expenditure on unhealthy food by country Expenditure on processed food by country Expenditure (as% of total food exp) Expenditure (as% of total food exp) 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0.4 0.35 0.3 0.25 0.2 0.15 0.1 0.05 0 Kiribati Kiribati Country Country 0.424840764 0.342038217 0.164022643 0.187745263 0.29197319 0.149462317 0.13572026 Samoa Samoa Tonga Tonga Vanuatu Vanuatu Solomon Island Solomon Island 0.2775 0.2775 0.5375 0.544585987 0.323494083 0.258473166 TRADE, TRADE AGREEMENTS AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDS 15 16 The participants were then asked to work in groups and to think through the issues related to impact assessment of trade agreements.

The outcomes of these discussions were picked up again in the country work on Day Four. Session 5: Towards health and trade policy coherence This session intended to consider how to build an environment where health promotion policies are trade compliant and trade policies support health. This session commenced with a presentation from Dr Tantivess on Health in all Policies, the Thailand experience. Health in All Policies (HiAP) is an innovative, horizontal policy strategy to improve population health and health equity. The focus of this is development of healthy public policy, across non-health sectors, which may have impacts on health such as agriculture, education, trade, industry and transport. In response to the need for health system reforms since 1980s, Thailand includes HiAP concept in its 2007 National Health Act. Under this law the National Health Assembly is annually convened, with the aim of providing public space where health problems and solutions are openly discussed among stakeholders from all sectors including government agencies, civil society organizations, private companies and provincial networks of lay people. Throughout the processes, deliberative exchange of knowledge, information and experience between different interests is encouraged as a means to pursue consensus on each resolution. During 2008-2012, evaluation studies indicated that the Assembly, as an alternative policy venue, provides opportunity for social mobilization and policy engagement of general public, although there is still substantial room for improvement. During plenary discussion a question was posed on how Thailand had been able to secure representation of the range of government officials and business people in the national health assembly and how does Thailand bring in people who are reluctant? Dr Tantivess responded that the process was now 5 years old and is currently being evaluated. The Commission has tried to solve the problem to make sure different sectors understand each other better, but the process is still fairly new and will take some time. She also emphasised that while alcohol and tobacco companies were excluded from the assembly; other companies are present including asbestos manufacturers. Dr Anne Marie Thow then presented on health promotion strategies which are trade compliant and trade policies which promote development and create healthy environments. This includes health promotion interventions consistent with commitments within trade agreements and policy interventions or improvements in coherence within trade, commerce, finance, agriculture. These policy directions must consider strategic framing of policy objectives that ensures that they are able to defend necessity and non-discrimination as key principles for trade compliance. Healthy trade policy includes: Trade policy and negotiations that are sensitive to protecting policy space for NCD prevention; and Implementation of specific interventions for health. Principles of healthy trade In developing these policy directions, assessment of health and other impacts is essential, as is ensuring flexibilities and policy space to protect public health. The opportunities created by collaboration between trade and health in the prevention and management of NCDs include: Potential for new strategic policy directions and innovation in NCD prevention; Development of more feasible multisectoral health interventions to prevent NCDs; and Pro-active engagement with trade negotiations to ensure public health is protected. A question was raised as to whether a country should pursue policy measures if they are associated with risk to other areas of health, or if countries should just pursue a health education approach. Dr McGrady emphasised that this is not either/or, policy and education may both be needed, but it\u2019s important to find the best approach. Prof Correa also added that in reality there is scope to try a policy measure, and then see if there is a WTO objection to it, and if there is then the measure can be revised, while if there is no objection, then the measure can be maintained. Prof Correa stressed that the WTO functioning is based on diplomacy and negotiation. Prof Carlos Correa then spoke about how to achieve trade agreements which progress healthy policy. He spoke of the importance of a clear identification of national interests in relation to NCDs and, more broadly, public health, being crucial when engaging in trade negotiations. It is also essential to assess the extent to which trade agreements may permit the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28e34db1-199b-4562-b6cd-30b366e47b41": {"__data__": {"id_": "28e34db1-199b-4562-b6cd-30b366e47b41", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade, Trade Agreements and Non-Communicable Diseases in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "70d16a2328fcc0fb2d84522bd83c8442517e5c643056ef39b807028e00964e46"}}, "hash": "70d16a2328fcc0fb2d84522bd83c8442517e5c643056ef39b807028e00964e46", "text": "achievement of such interests. Thus, access to markets will not automatically lead to an increase in exports; even if such an increase takes place, it will not automatically lead to poverty alleviation. Prof Correa also emphasised that the new generation of \u2018trade agreements\u2019 include a number of disciplines that limit governments\u2019 policy space, such as those on investment, labour and environmental standards. Investment disciplines, for instance, may be used (as illustrated by the cases of Uruguay and Australia relating to cigarettes packaging) to challenge public health measures. Improving the technical capacity to deal with the complex issues involved in trade negotiations is certainly crucial. But this is not sufficient to attain the desired objectives in the context of an asymmetric economic relationship, or when pursuit of a trade agreement is primarily driven by political reasons. Trade negotiations, should also be transparent; various government departments and civil society should be given an opportunity to continuously assess the process and express their concerns and aspirations.

He commenced this joint presentation by comparing trade policy to a \u2018tug of war\u2019 with various interest groups, industry lobbies, foreign corporations and foreign governments all pulling in different directions to better achieve their own objectives. Multiple pressures on trade policy For example, the multinational food industry had been very effective at the UN High level meeting on NCDs in ensuring that there were few references to regulation and where they appear they are very general. Dr Legge argued that while governments have a responsibility to manage these pressures and align the outcomes to the national interest, civil society participation in the conversation can be a very effective support for governments. Dr Legge described \u2018civil society\u2019 as including professional organisations, academics, NGOs, trade unions and churches. He instanced three NGOs which have been particularly influential in trade negotiations: Third World Network, Medecins Sans Frontieres and the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. Dr Legge returned to the South African Treatment Action Campaign which Prof Carlos Correa had mentioned earlier and described how civil society mobilisation had been critical to the success of this campaign including AIDS solidarity activists campaigning in both the US and in South Africa. Dr Deborah Gleeson then provided an additional example from Australia, and reflected on advocacy work undertaken by the Public Health Association of Australia around the proposed Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP). She mentioned the concerns of civil society organisations including the impact of tighter intellectual property provisions and restrictions on pharmaceutical programs on the cost of medicines, and restrictions on the scope for governments to regulate for public health as a consequence of the proposed investor state dispute settlement provisions. Dr Gleeson described the many facets of this episode of civil society advocacy including writing submissions, literature reviews, consulting with experts, raising awareness, advocacy at public health conferences, and involvement in stakeholder events during negotiating rounds. This example highlights the important role civil society can play in providing a counter-balance to the industry interest groups and corporations, which lobby governments and trade negotiators to promote their interests through trade agreements. In the last presentation in session five, Henry Tunupopo shared the experience in Samoa of working intersectorally on trade issues. When Samoa decided to join the WTO a public-private stakeholder committee was set up, chaired by the deputy Prime Minister with participation of various government Ministries including foreign affairs, finance, health, agriculture, environment, Attorney General\u2019s office and SUNGO (a local civil society umbrella organization). Academia and other groups were also invited to join. The terms of reference of the committee is to provide advice to Cabinet on trade arrangements, so that cabinet may make informed decisions to ensure that Samoa\u2019s gains from trade arrangements are in line with international agreements and the county\u2019s interests. The committee signs off on all matters relating to trade agreements. Issues have ranged from tariffs and turkey tails, to quarantine regulations. Consultations have been considered to be effective and included the general public. Negotiations are not kept secret from other stakeholders. All members of committee were invited to negotiations; they were allowed to sit in the room during negotiations.

They were also asked to consider what might be best practices in ensuring trade and policy coherence. The feedback by the different sectors was undertaken in the country team groups during session six. Sessions 6 & 7: Way forward and commitments Country teams considered specific actions they would pursue and what further support they would need for this. To facilitate this exercise, Brian Lutz provided an overview of what the country team discussions could cover: 1. Feedback from sector teams from session five and consideration of how intersectoral collaboration in their country on trade and health could be achieved; 2. Review their national strategies and other relevant existing commitments on NCD policy interventions, and along with the public health interventions discussed in this workshop, draw up a \u2018possible\u2019 list of public health interventions; 3. Review each option for NCD impact, trade relevance and importance (using provided excel sheet templates) to develop a short list; 4. Develop this short list into a detailed action plan, including specification of support needed. The country teams then worked on these tasks for the remainder of day three of the workshop, and also for an hour on the morning of day four. Each country team was asked to prepare a ten minutes presentation on their action plans, using a provided PowerPoint template. Samoa Country Presentation The team from Samoa identified three top priority actions: \u2022 Completion and implementation of the WTO study on practical and realistic options to combat Samoa\u2019s health problems \u2022 Reduction in import tax on fruit and vegetables (to increase affordability) \u2022 Introduction of a tax on sugary products and sugar (to complement their existing tax on soft drinks) They identified partners who would need to be involved in each of these, including their National Working Committee on Trade Agreements, government Ministries, SUNGO and SPARKEL (advocacy group in Samoa). They also identified their external assistance needs including technical assistance in the areas of taxation, WTO, law, HIA and nutrition, and agencies that can provide this support. On the issue of building multisectoral collaboration, particularly between health and trade they identified challenges as being of sustainability and data availability. Their proposed solutions were to have back-up members for committees, capacity building for other sectors and to strengthen their information and data systems. Trade Policy Civil society Foreign governments Export industries Foreign companies TRADE, TRADE AGREEMENTS AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDS 19 20 Fiji Country Presentation The team from Fiji then shared their action plan. Their top three action areas were identified as: \u2022 Graphic labeling on tobacco \u2022 Controls on alcohol advertising, promotion and sponsorship \u2022 Increased fiscal duty on alcohol They identified a need for technical support in the areas of policy formulation, monitoring and evaluation and enforcement. They also indicated that they needed a study on the economic impacts of NCDs in Fiji. In regard to the issue of intersectoral collaboration, they indicated a need to strengthen the existing National Trade Policy Committee and strengthen the development of evidence-based policy submissions. They also identified a need for impact assessments of trade agreements during accession discussion, and for capacity building on HIA. Additionally they suggested that there be a regional network on NCD awareness and knowledge sharing. Dr Neil Sharma, Minister of Health for Fiji commented that he was happy that the meeting had been held in Fiji and that Trade officials were being involved. He added that Fiji is trying to implement \u2018best buys\u2019 and have implemented tobacco registration fees to provide funding assistance for health promotion work. He also shared experiences of working with the food industry in Fiji, and that legislation may be needed when progress is slow. Tonga Country Presentation The team from Tonga spoke initially on their Technical Committee for Tax which was established by the Prime Minister in October 2012. The membership includes Revenue and Customs, Finance/National Planning, Health, Commerce and Trade (soon to be Foreign Affairs and Trade). The aim of the committee is to make the healthier choices the easier choices, through the development of cabinet submissions. The issues they identified for action were: \u2022 Removal of import taxes for tinned fish \u2022 Increased tax rate on dripping and lowered rate on vegetable oil to encourage a shift in fat consumption \u2022 Increased tax on sugary drinks The intended process", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d3a1f5d-6690-4f92-9db9-73b15feea0cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d3a1f5d-6690-4f92-9db9-73b15feea0cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade, Trade Agreements and Non-Communicable Diseases in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "502df6a3f4ddbd902df201616c9d7900da1a6ad037bda8ddee454d5449a23f0a"}}, "hash": "502df6a3f4ddbd902df201616c9d7900da1a6ad037bda8ddee454d5449a23f0a", "text": "was for the collection on data on quantity of imports and tariff rates from Trade, consultation with stakeholders and then work via their Technical Committee for Tax. They requested support for a review of their existing legislation, awareness campaigns before policy implementation and implementation of their MAF acceleration framework. In regard to multisectoral collaboration they emphasised need for health promotion to support policy change and acceptance, and clear responsibilities for policy enforcement to be defined. They also stressed the importance of ensuring that senior health officers were involved in trade negotiations, and that they would need to make an application to the respective Ministry to ensure this. Nauru Country Presentation The team from Nauru identified several areas for action: \u2022 Establishment of a committee on trade and health \u2022 Maintenance and improvement of sugar tax procedure and implementation \u2022 National workshop on trade and health connections to emphasise the importance of health in the Trade Policy Framework \u2022 Development of a mechanism for a health promotion fund, to support preventive measures They identified the key stakeholders who would need to be involved in each of these, including government ministries and external technical experts. In regard to multisectoral collaboration, they highlighted the importance of the above committee or of expanding on existing committees with health and trade. There was some discussion after this presentation on how to ensure actions progressed when multiple organisations were listed to lead actions. Vanuatu Country Presentation The presentation from Vanuatu identified the three key areas of action: \u2022 Maintaining high taxes on alcohol and enhancing alcohol policy \u2022 Establishing food standards to allow for stronger labeling and packaging regulations and taxing fatty foods higher \u2022 Increasing tobacco tax and a ban on the sale of locally grown tobacco. They identified that these actions would require multisectoral involvement from across the government, and that they would need financial and technical assistance, including some local capacity building in regard to food standards. A local food laboratory may also be required. They emphasised the importance of integrating health and trade policies, greater collaboration between health and trade committees and for developing an information exchange programme between health and trade. After the country presentation the possibility of regional food standards supported by regional or shared food testing was raised and discussed. Mr Hoejskov clarified that testing of the nutrient content of processed food can be done by existing laboratories in the region and is relative simple and inexpensive. Tuvalu Country Presentation To support healthy trade policy the team identified a need for a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between health and trade, which would support greater information sharing, networking and incorporation of health issues into annual trade work plan. They also indicated a need for proper co-ordination of policy development, including consultations. Their priority action areas were also to: \u2022 Implement a tax on sugary, fatty and salty foods, alcohol and tobacco. This would need to be compatible with existing trade policies \u2022 To undertake a feasibility study on sourcing alternative domestic healthier foods \u2022 To undertake an impact assessment (health, gender and climate change issues) on PACERPlus and establish a monitoring system. They identified the need to involve a number of government departments in these actions, and also a need for some technical assistance and capacity building. During plenary discussion, the possibility of a regional impact assessment of PACERPlus was raised. It was agreed that this might be useful, however it would not replace the need for country specific impact assessments due to considerable inter-country differences. TRADE, TRADE AGREEMENTS AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDS 21 22 Palau Country Presentation The team shared the content of the Executive Order number 295, in which the President of Palau ordered the Minister of Health to coordinate activities to manage the NCD crisis, including calling upon all Ministers and head of National government agencies to assist in his effort at tackling this national crisis. Additionally, the Minister of Health is requested to record all assistance from other Ministers and heads of national government agencies and report to the President every 6 months. A national NCD committee is already in place and includes representatives from across the government, civil society and private sector. Following an NCD summit early in 2012, a sub-committee on policy/legislation was formed. This committee includes Ministries of Justice, Health, Public Infrastructure, Industries & Commerce, Finance and Education. This committee would review existing legislation and priorities policies for action. The team emphasized a need for data on the burden of disease, health insurance and possibly other trade issues. They requested technical assistance and support for a cost of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9ac5c6b-d7bb-4c60-8561-24d05f00b167": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9ac5c6b-d7bb-4c60-8561-24d05f00b167", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade, Trade Agreements and Non-Communicable Diseases in the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b6a3ff6ea9c761cc224bd2089e7432f0d2f5735ca1517baeb69b51278f89f54"}}, "hash": "2b6a3ff6ea9c761cc224bd2089e7432f0d2f5735ca1517baeb69b51278f89f54", "text": "NCD study, health impact assessment and also further training \u2013in- country on issues of trade negotiations and also taxation. A query was raised as to whether Palau was able to sign up for trade agreements, as under a Compact with the United States. It is able to so, as long as compliant/consistent with the Compact. Kiribati Country Presentation The team identified a number of action areas related to alcohol and tobacco prices \u2022 To remove tobacco from price control (via submission of concept paper, meeting and consultations with Parliament/ Cabinet) \u2022 Increasing tax on tobacco and alcohol: along with survey of effects on health, and consideration of implications of the intervention These would need to involve actions by Trade, Finance, Health and the Attorney Generals\u2019 office and may require some financial and technical assistance. They recognised issues of multisectoral collaboration and suggested they needed a balancing act towards common national goals. It was suggested that health be allowed to join the Trade Policy Advisory Committee (TPAC) and Trade and Finance become members of the NCD committee (NCDC), which would need to be mandated by Cabinet. Delegates developing and presenting action plans Overview Of Post-Workshop Support And Assistance Following the presentations from the country teams, Dr Wendy Snowdon shared the proposed way forward on behalf of C-POND, SPC, UNDP and WHO. It was suggested that country teams should before the end of March \u2022 Review their action plan and update if needed, based on further consideration \u2022 Discuss drafts with their respective CEOs /managers and incorporate their input \u2022 Forward revised PowerPoint presentations to the Secretariat contact point On receipt of these, C-POND, SPC, UNDP and WHO committed to review the action plans and discuss and agree on a joint approach to supporting each country. By 10th April, each country team would be contacted by the secretariat to advise them of how support would be provided, and by which organisation primarily. In-country support for actions and associated research and data gathering actions would then occur, in line with country needs. Additional capacity building would be considered at regional, sub-regional and national level. The scope of support was then further clarified, as shown below in figures three and four. Resources would be sourced from existing projects, existing programmes and through new sources. Scope of support Key areas of support Meeting Statement Discussions took place to draft and finalise a meeting statement entitled \u201c the Nadi Outcomes Document\u201d in line with the proceedings (See pages 24 \u2013 25). Closing Session Following the awarding of certificates to participants and an evaluation session, the Fiji Minister of Health Dr Neil Sharma delivered the closing remarks. He highlighted that this was a landmark meeting and that he was impressed with the interactions and contributions from countries. He thanked the organisers who have made this event possible. He was pleased to see collaboration occurring between sectors, through discussions and sharing of experiences. The Yanuca declaration introduced the concept of healthy islands and this workshop was really supporting those commitments and ideals. He also stressed that the involvement of the health sector in trade issues is important. Technical assistance - Impact assessments - Policy development Research support - country specific + regional - operational to dev. trade & health policy coherence Capacity Development - workshops, tools, guides, trainings Multisectoral mechanism Fiscal and regulatory intervention Impact of future trade agreements considered Impact assessment of intervention TRADE, TRADE AGREEMENTS AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDS 23 24 He highlighted some of the actions in Fiji, including data collection such as STEPS, salt intake assessment and the oral health survey. He added that Fiji has just upgraded its food labelling requirements and was now considering a new approach to support this. He emphasised his interest in regulating the marketing of food and non-alcoholic beverages to children in line with controls on the promotion of breast milk substitutes and tobacco advertising. He recommended countries to have national strategies which were aligned, time bound \u2013 and relevant for NCDs and trade. Berrick Dowiyogo then gave a vote of thanks on behalf of the participants. He thanked regional and international organisations for coming together and making this workshop happen. He mentioned that the workshop had been valuable for the participants and provided information and advice that they can take back and use in their countries to strengthen the intersection between NCDs and trade. Dr Tukana then provided a closing prayer.

Recognizing that at the Forty-Second Pacific Islands Forum in Auckland, New Zealand, the leaders of the Pacific were deeply concerned that an estimated 75 percent of all adult deaths in the Pacific were due to NCDs, with the majority of the deaths occurring in adults in the economically-active age bracket and that there are huge economic losses due to NCDs and the resultant impact on national health budgets and possibly the region\u2019s ultimate achievement of the MDGs. Recognizing that the WHA Resolution 59.26 also identified the need for ministries of health, trade, commerce, finance and foreign affairs to work together constructively in order to ensure that the interests of trade and health are appropriately balanced and coordinated. Recognizing that addressing social determinants of health, social inequality and poverty, as well as the legal, policy, and regulatory frameworks, is essential for development and enjoyment of the right to the highest attainable standard of health. Recognizing that a number of factors, including the protection of intellectual property rights, individual behavior and lifestyle choices, and national capacity to provide adequate health-related goods, facilities, and services, affect the prevention and treatment of NCDs. Recognizing that trade agreements provide both threats and opportunities for improving public health. Recognizing that health gains from trade are important for economic growth and sustainable development which in turn lead to exponential gains in the health of the country, including through the prevention of NCDs. Recognizing the essential role of civil society in advocating for healthy trade and in holding governments accountable with regards to policy commitments and legal obligations. Emphasizing that the Pacific region should not be treated as a dumping ground for unhealthy products that are unwanted in other countries TRADE, TRADE AGREEMENTS AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDS 25 26 The workshop participants agreed on the need; - to apply or establish where necessary, coordination mechanisms involving ministries of finance, health and trade, and other relevant ministries, institutions and civil society to address the NCD crisis - to strengthen national capacities and regulatory mechanisms (where established) to include among others, undertaking impact assessments, introducing policies, including incentives (e.g. subsidies) and disincentives (e.g. taxation), which affect the risk factors for NCDs and participating in international trade negotiations - for international, regional agencies and development partners to continue to support countries including through provision of technical assistance to support policy coherence between trade and health sectors at a national and regional level and specifically enhance informed decision making and trade negotiations, - to accelerate the regional and national efforts to develop and implement food standards for relevant nutrients (e.g. fat, sugar and salt content in processed foods). The participants of the workshop agreed to communicate these outcomes to the upcoming Forum Trade Ministers Meeting (FTMM) to be held in Apia in 2013 and the Pacific Health Ministers meeting 2-4 July 2013 (Apia, Samoa).

Designed by: Imaging Systems, Suva, Fiji Printed by: Star Printery, Suva, Fiji Translating CEDAW Into Law CEDAW Legislative Compliance in Nine Paci\ufb01 c Island Countries Paci\ufb01 c Centre Vedna Jivan and Christine Forster 1st Edition February, 2007 This Edition May, 2007 Copyright 2007 i The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), known as the international bill of rights for women, remains the most comprehensive international human rights instrument addressing discrimination against women in a wide range of areas. Commitment to CEDAW in the Pacific has increased steadily over the last few years and it is now the second most ratified treaty in the Pacific (the Convention on the Rights of the Child has now been ratified by all 15 Pacific Island Forum countries). This joint UNIFEM/UNDP Pacific Centre publication; Translating CEDAW into Law: CEDAW Legislative Compliance in Nine Pacific Island Countries, is an example of the important and groundbreaking work that can happen when governments, civil society, regional organisations and the United Nations (UN) family work together towards the goals of universal ratification and implementation of CEDAW in the Pacific. There were many contributing activities and efforts that eventually led to the idea of developing concrete indicators to assess the degree to which national legislation complies with CEDAW. In particular, in April 2005, UNDP, UNIFEM, UNICEF, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat and the Secretariat for the Pacific Community convened a Sub-Regional meeting for Polynesia1, held in Nuku\u2019alofa, Kingdom of Tonga, on \u201cintegrating MDGs, CEDAW and CRC into National Development Plans\u201d. This workshop considered how the MDGs, CEDAW and CRC commitments could best be reflected in national plans and budgets. It also attempted to find practical solutions for achieving this integration, while at the same time reducing perceptions that each new convention or agreement simply added to the burden of governments and communities in the region. During the discussions, it became clear that while the MDGs and associated targets and indicators are a tangible means of monitoring development performance, there was a need to develop more concrete and measurable performance indicators for CEDAW. Following that Sub-Regional workshop, UNIFEM Pacific initiated work with the consultants who authored this report to develop indicators to measure legislative compliance with CEDAW.

This joint publication contains the legislative compliance indicators developed, instructions on how to use them, and full details of the nine completed country compliance reviews. Following ratification, many governments struggle with how to plan for the process of implementing CEDAW. The completed country compliance reviews provide an important road map for each country to use in developing its short term and longer term national plan for implementation. As is noted in the introduction to this work, while legislative compliance will not, on its own result in the full implementation of CEDAW, \u201cthe pursuit of legislative compliance is nevertheless an important initial measure towards that goal\u201d. The development of the CEDAW legislative compliance indicators and the associated country reviews mark an important milestone in treaty implementation. UNIFEM and the UNDP Pacific Centre, along with other development partners, remain ready, willing and able to provide support to governments and civil society as they work towards realising substantive equality between women and men (and girls and boys) in the Pacific. It is our sincere hope that the development of these CEDAW legislative compliance indicators will provide practical assistance in this regard to the nine Pacific Island countries involved, and also to those governments still working towards the ratification of CEDAW. ........................................................ ........................................................

The task of assessing legislative compliance required the application of a set of indicators. Indicators are a tool by which the question of how much (or whether) progress is being made towards a certain objective is measured. Indicators also provide a means of monitoring progress in the future. 4. The authors in collaboration with UNIFEM Pacific developed a set of 113 indicators which were based on the text of each of the articles of CEDAW; a close analysis of the 25 General Recommendations of the CEDAW Committee; a review of literature and information obtained from non-government and government sources and finally through consultations conducted with government officials, and non- governmental organisations (NGOs). 5.

This reflects the presence of reservations (a formal declaration that the State Party does not accept as binding certain parts of the Convention) on some of the articles of CEDAW. It should also be noted that, through the national constitution of the FSM, which is the basis for all legal authority, the power to legislate is divided between the FSM parliament and the state parliaments. Whilst the FSM has express power over areas such as tax, trade and national crimes, it may also establish systems of social security and public welfare concurrently with the states. The division of powers did not reduce the indicators and the FSM was measured against both the indicators which concern its express powers to legislate and against the indicators that relate to its power to implement systems of social security and public welfare. 6. The results showed a varying level of compliance in the nine countries and from article to article. In each of the nine countries, in some areas, there is significant compliance with CEDAW, in others some progress has been achieved, whilst in others non-compliance remains a considerable issue and significant legislative change is required. Whilst full compliance with CEDAW has not been achieved by any of the nine countries examined, it should be noted that this is yet to be achieved by any country in the world. 7. Fiji has achieved full compliance with 49 out of 113 indicators, partially complied with 26 and had no compliance with 38; Kiribati has achieved full compliance with 26 indicators, Executive Summary vi EXECUTIVE SUMMARY partial compliance with 29 indicators and no compliance in relation to the remaining 58 indicators; the Marshall Islands has achieved full compliance with 39 indicators, partial compliance with 19 indicators and no compliance with the remaining 55 indicators; the FSM has achieved full compliance with 26 of 111 indicators, partial compliance with 18 indicators and no compliance with the remaining 69 indicators. Chuuk has achieved full compliance with 30 indicators, partial compliance with 21 indicators and no compliance in relation to the remaining 62 indicators. Kosrae has achieved full compliance with 33 indicators, partial compliance with 18 indicators and no compliance with the remaining 62 indicators. Pohnpei has achieved full compliance with 34 indicators, partial compliance with 17 indicators and no compliance in relation to the remaining 62 indicators. Yap has achieved full compliance with 29 indicators, partial compliance with 16 indicators and no compliance with the remaining 68 indicators. PNG fully complied with 28 indicators, partially complied with 32 and had no compliance with 53; Samoa fully complied with 40 indicators, partially complied with 23 and had no compliance with 49; Solomon Islands fully complied with 23 indicators, partially complied with 33 and had no compliance with 57; Tuvalu fully complied with 21 indicators, had partial compliance with 31 and no compliance with 61; finally Vanuatu fully complied with 34 indicators, partially complied with 27 and had no compliance with 52. 8. Article 2 requires States Parties to guarantee a range of fundamental rights and freedoms in their constitutions including substantive equality and freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, sexual orientation, HIV status and disability. All nine countries guarantee the rights and freedoms of women in most of the areas required by CEDAW. However, although the Marshall Islands, FSM and its states guarantee men and women the equal protection of the law and Fiji, Kiribati, Samoa and Vanuatu guarantee equality before the law, and finally Tuvalu guarantees freedom under the law, none of the nine countries examined guarantee women equal benefits or outcomes as required by CEDAW. 9. Fiji, the Marshall Islands, the FSM and three of its states (Yap, Chuuk and Pohnpei), Samoa, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu have anti- discrimination clauses through which individuals who have experienced sex- discrimination can seek remedies against either a state institution or in some instances, an individual person or organisation. Whilst Kiribati and Tuvalu have anti-discrimination clauses in their constitutions, they do not include sex as a protected ground. This means discrimination against women is lawful in Kiribati and Tuvalu. Consequently, domestic laws which discriminate against women, although non-compliant with CEDAW, are not in breach of the Constitution in either country. 10. Only Fiji (expressly) and the Solomon Islands (implicitly) extend their anti-discrimination protection to include indirect discrimination (enabling challenge to a rule that appears to apply to a group of people in the same way but in practice places on particular members of that group a burden not faced by the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14bf218a-0206-4394-b152-3fc1688b76fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "14bf218a-0206-4394-b152-3fc1688b76fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Translating CEDAW Into Law", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a873025fb18cdca04926ff566266161c282bcf113bbb9b12fe5dc16fa6d00d1e"}}, "hash": "a873025fb18cdca04926ff566266161c282bcf113bbb9b12fe5dc16fa6d00d1e", "text": "majority). Further, with the exception of Fiji (which provides protection on the grounds of a range of factors other than sex, including sexual orientation and disability), the grounds of protection in all countries fall short of that required by CEDAW. vii 11. Articles 2 and 3 together mandate the establishment by legislation of national bodies and machinery to monitor the implementation of law and policy to foster the advancement of women. Two of the nine countries have instituted such mechanisms. Fiji has established a Human Rights Commission which is empowered to institute affirmative action in the areas nominated in the Constitution (education, employment, housing, commerce and advancement in the public service) and Samoa has established a Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs. However, although not established with enabling legislation (which leaves them vulnerable during times of political or economic upheaval), Divisions and Departments of Women with differing powers to participate in the implementation of law and policy for the advancement of women have been established in the remaining seven countries. 12. Article 2 condemns discrimination against women in all its forms and obligates States Parties to eliminate discrimination against women without delay. General Recommendation 19 adopted by the CEDAW Committee makes explicit that the definition of discrimination includes gender violence and recommends that \u2018sanctions, penalties and compensation\u2019 be introduced in relation to gender based violence. All nine countries examined have legislated against sexual assault. PNG in 2003 and the Marshall Islands in 2005 have introduced new sexual assault regimes which, in compliance with CEDAW, include a comprehensive range of offences, graded to reflect the seriousness of the harm to the victim. The offences include penetration of all orifices by a penis or any other object, sexual assault in circumstances that breach the trust between a person in authority and a child, and serious penalties for a range of other offences that do not involve penetration. The sexual assault laws, however, in all of the seven remaining countries, fail to provide adequate protection for the range of sexual violations perpetrated against girls and women. They fail to prescribe adequate penalties implying that sexual assault is not a serious offence, and all treat the sexual assaults of girls over 12 (or 15 in Pohnpei) as dramatically less serious than assaults of girls under 12. Although an assault against a young girl may have more serious consequences, particularly if perpetrated by a person in a position of trust, the vast disparity between sentences in these jurisdictions is unjustified and perpetuates an erroneous assumption that it is less serious and harmful to assault a \u2018more mature\u2019 girl. 13. Three common law rules have historically made it difficult for prosecutions against sexual assault offenders to succeed, and are contrary to CEDAW. Compliance with CEDAW requires that legislation prohibits the use of all three rules. The first, the admission of the prior sexual history of a victim in order to establish that she consented to the sexual act in question, is a common law rule which perpetuates the myth that a victim\u2019s previous sexual relationship with either the accused or others makes it more likely that she consented. Fiji, PNG, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu are in non- compliance with CEDAW because they have not legislated against the use of prior sexual history. Kiribati, Marshall Islands and FSM in compliance with CEDAW, have legislated against the use of evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct. However, in the Marshall Islands and in the FSM (with the exception of Pohnpei) evidence of previous sexual conduct with the accused (but not other actors) can be admitted to prove consent, and in Kiribati, it can be admitted if it is relevant to the reliability of the complainant\u2019s evidence. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY viii EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 14. Corroboration (independent evidence such as that of a witness that connects the accused person with the crime) is a common law rule that requires a judge to advise the jury that it is dangerous to convict the accused on uncorroborated evidence. Whilst Kiribati and the Marshall Islands have taken the positive step of legislating against the requirement for corroboration, none of the remaining seven countries have done so. 15. Proof of resistance is a common law rule which requires victims to establish that they physically resisted the perpetrator, otherwise consent may be inferred. It is discriminatory because physical resistance may be an unrealistic expectation of a victim against a strong or armed perpetrator, and does not take into account how fear and power imbalances may immobilise the victim. Only the Marshall Islands has legislated against the requirement for proof of resistance and all other", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2ff6312-7bb8-4b71-8f32-d02a665b24db": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2ff6312-7bb8-4b71-8f32-d02a665b24db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Translating CEDAW Into Law", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "973c549d62f253f104764f94f52e463a9a27227ea089cbe6c9855174600a7390"}}, "hash": "973c549d62f253f104764f94f52e463a9a27227ea089cbe6c9855174600a7390", "text": "countries are therefore non-compliant with CEDAW. 16. To comply with CEDAW, the legislation should not provide a defence to perpetrators in sexual assault offences of an \u2018honest and reasonable belief that the victim is of legal age\u2019. This places the onus (erroneously) on the minor to reveal her age rather than upon the accused to ascertain her age. In the Marshall Islands, Vanuatu and the FSM state of Pohnpei, in compliance with CEDAW, there is no defence in sexual assault prosecutions for the accused to claim that he did not know the girl was not of legal age. In all other countries, however, the accused can claim that he did not know the girl was not of legal age. In Samoa, the defence is only available if the defendant is under 21. 17. Compliance with CEDAW requires that consent is not a defence in a sexual assault offence in relation to any girl under 18, which is the age of adulthood stipulated by CEDAW. In all nine countries consent is not available as a defence in relation to girls under 16. This means, in effect, that the defence is available in relation to sexual assaults including rape of girls 16 or over and this is non-compliant with CEDAW. 18. Minimum sentences and mandatory prosecutions ensure that sexual violence against women is treated seriously. However, none of the nine countries examined have mandatory prosecutions for sexual and domestic violence offences (as required by CEDAW). In addition, only Vanuatu has incorporated into its legislation minimum sentences for sexual offences. Further, none of the nine countries automatically denies bail in instances of domestic and sexual offences where the safety of women and girls is at risk. In partial compliance, the Marshall Islands enables the court to deny bail if there is reasonable grounds to believe the person will be \u2018offensive\u2019 to the public. 19. Although General Recommendation 19 (which concerns violence against women), issued by the CEDAW Committee identifies domestic violence as a form of discrimination that inhibits women\u2019s ability to enjoy rights and freedoms on a basis of equality with men, none of the nine countries examined have incorporated domestic violence offences into their criminal laws. 20. Infanticide refers to the killing of a child by its mother (in contrast to abortion which refers to the destruction of a foetus). Full compliance with CEDAW requires that an offence of infanticide replaces a charge of murder or manslaughter and has a reduced sentence, recognising the societal pressures that lead women to kill their children. Vanuatu has no offence of infanticide in non-compliance with ix CEDAW. An offence of infanticide is contained in the criminal legislation of Fiji, Kiribati, PNG, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. However it reduces a charge of murder to manslaughter, rather than replacing both murder and manslaughter with a separate offence and a corresponding less severe penalty, and is therefore only partially compliant with CEDAW. In full compliance with CEDAW, an offence of infanticide is contained in the Samoan criminal legislation replacing a charge of murder and manslaughter with a separate offence of infanticide and a corresponding reduced penalty of 3 years. Further, the definition of infanticide is not restricted to the effects of lactation and birthing as in the other eight countries but includes \u2018any disorder consequent on childbirth\u2019 which in accordance with the research recognises that such killings are linked to post-natal depression caused in large part, by the social pressures of raising children. 21. Article 4 requires that temporary special measures provisions be introduced into national constitutions and legislation. Special measures provisions are an equality measure with real potential to redress historical discrimination and to achieve substantive equality for women. Vanuatu, PNG and Samoa have incorporated extensive affirmative action provisions into their constitutions for the advancement of women. Fiji provides for affirmative action in the areas of education, employment, housing and commerce, and it is unclear whether Tuvalu\u2019s special measures provision can be utilised for the advancement of women. 22. Article 5 requires States Parties to abolish or modify customary practices that discriminate against women. The Constitutions of all nine countries give constitutional status to custom law in a range of capacities and none contain a guarantee that equality law will take precedence over custom law. This is in non- compliance with CEDAW as it leaves women with uncertain legal recourse against discriminatory custom and practice. 23. Article 6 requires States Parties to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of women in prostitution (hereafter \u2018sex work\u2019) whilst Articles 2 and 11 require the elimination of discrimination against women in employment.

Soliciting in Fiji, the FSM states of Chuuk and Pohnpei, and the Solomon Islands is an offence.

This is to avoid \u2018punishing\u2019 sex workers for their occupation and denying them the rights and protections enjoyed by other workers. In a first for the Pacific, the act of soliciting is an offence in the Marshall Islands for sex workers (men and women) and their clients. Although this measure does introduce formal equality between men and women, full compliance with CEDAW requires that sex workers are not criminalised. In the FSM states of Yap and Kosrae, in Kiribati, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu soliciting is not an offence in compliance with CEDAW (although in Kiribati it is an offence for males). 24. The operation of organised premises and the aiding and abetting of soliciting is criminalised in all nine countries. However, research and experience shows that organised premises rather than street work is safer for sex workers and therefore, compliance with CEDAW (as per Article 11) requires legalising brothels and EXECUTIVE SUMMARY x EXECUTIVE SUMMARY implementing the safeguards that are present in other workplaces (such as regulated standards of occupational safety, standard rates of pay, parental leave, sick leave). 25. In compliance with CEDAW, Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, PNG, Samoa, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu have adopted a rigorous approach to the exploitation of girls under 18 and women who have been forced into sex work without their consent and trafficked to other locations within the country or abroad. PNG in particular has introduced a comprehensive range of offences and severe penalties for the exploitation of children including criminalising the clients of children. However, the states of the FSM provide only minimal protection for women and girls procured into sex work against their will and are non-compliant with CEDAW. Further, in non-compliance with CEDAW there are no offences for trafficking or sex tourism in the FSM, the Marshall Islands, or Vanuatu. Although Kiribati provides some protection for girls and women who have been trafficked to other locations both within the country or abroad, the low penalty of 2 years provides an insufficient deterrent required for full compliance with CEDAW. 26. Article 7 obligates States Parties to take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination in women\u2019s political and public lives. Universal suffrage and equal legal rights for women to political representation has been achieved in all nine countries. However, few women nominate for political representation and the absence of minimum quotas to ensure higher numbers of women enter parliament and participate in the governance of their countries means that all nine countries are not fully compliant with CEDAW. 27. Article 8 requires States Parties to ensure that women have equal opportunities to represent their governments at the international level. Although there is no legal barrier preventing women from representing their governments in any of the nine countries, the low numbers of women who do so requires all nine countries to introduce quotas to raise participation. 28. Article 9 requires States Parties to eliminate discrimination in the areas of nationality, citizenship and domicile. FSM, Fiji, the Marshall Islands, PNG and Samoa have achieved equality in this area. Some discriminatory provisions are however still in operation in the remaining four countries. For example, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu retain provisions whereby a woman who renounces her citizenship after marriage to a non-national can only regain her citizenship in her country of origin upon evidence of the breakdown of her marriage. Although this is intended to protect women and enable their return to their country of origin if the marriage relationship ends, it makes a woman\u2019s return contingent on her marriage rather than her own autonomy and choice. The provision does not apply to men presumably based on the stereotyped assumption that men will not join their non- national wives in another country. In Kiribati, women also do not have equal rights to include their husband and children in an application for citizenship or to include their husband and children in their passports. 29. Article 10 obligates States Parties to ensure women have equal rights and opportunities in the field of education. The provision of compulsory education is essential to ensure girls are equally prioritised and not discriminated against in education. Seven of the nine countries examined have introduced compulsory schooling at both primary and secondary levels.

However, girls and women continue to access education in lower numbers than boys and men in all nine countries. Therefore, full compliance with CEDAW requires the adoption of special measures for the advancement of women in education and a prohibition on the expulsion of pregnant students to ensure that girls are not discriminated against by educational institutions. 30. Article 11 requires States Parties to eliminate sex discrimination in the area of employment and it also requires the enactment of specific guarantees that protect the labour rights of women in legislation. 31. In non-compliance with CEDAW, six of the nine countries examined restrict women\u2019s employment choices banning them from night work, working in mines and, in Samoa and PNG, women are also prohibited from undertaking manual work. Fiji, in compliance with CEDAW, has removed these limitations from its employment law although the Minister still has a discretion to impose restrictions. Such protectionist provisions interfere with women\u2019s autonomy and place unreasonable restrictions on their right to choose professions and employment. Conversely, however, and in compliance with CEDAW, women\u2019s employment choices are not restricted in the Marshall Islands or the FSM and its states, leaving women to lawfully undertake night work, manual work and working in mines. It should be noted, however, that neither the FSM nor the Marshall Islands has yet put in place legislative mechanisms to protect the employment and labour rights of workers other than in the Public Service. 32. In the area of maternity leave the public service sectors of all nine countries offer more generous allowances than the minimum standards granted in the private sector. However, none of the countries examined meet the standards of 14 weeks paid maternity leave recommended by CEDAW and the International Labour Organisation (the ILO recommends a period of 14 weeks maternity leave and CEDAW recommends that it be paid). Further, whilst there is a general duty on employers to provide \u2018safe\u2019 working conditions, no country has introduced any specific health protection for pregnant workers. Breastfeeding mothers are provided with breaks of half hour duration twice daily in all countries except Marshall Islands, FSM and Samoa. However, these conditions are insufficient to enable breastfeeding mothers to balance the needs of young children with the demands of work. Similarly, the absence of any state or employer funded childcare facilities in any of the nine countries is likely to accentuate the difficulties nursing mothers face in the workplace. In all countries (except Marshall Islands and the FSM where there is no protection from dismissal) protection from dismissal ends upon the expiry of the approved maternity leave period, leaving women in precarious positions in relation to job security if they require (or choose) to take further leave. 33. Protection from sexual harassment is absent in all nine countries although there is limited scope for remedies under some criminal codes (e.g. Solomon Islands); human rights legislation (e.g. Fiji) and public sector legislation (e.g. PNG). None of these remedies, however, adequately address the range of unwanted behaviours that women experience in the workplace. It should be noted that new industrial laws proposed in Fiji and PNG will, if enacted, address many of EXECUTIVE SUMMARY xii EXECUTIVE SUMMARY the issues noted above and achieve substantial compliance with Article 11 of CEDAW. 34. Article 12 requires States Parties to ensure that women have access to health care services including those related to family planning. Whilst the Marshall Islands, and the FSM states of Kosrae, Pohnpei and Yap have no legislation that criminalises abortion, all other countries do criminalise abortion with an exception only to save the mother\u2019s life (except PNG). However, in all countries access to safe abortion facilities is limited. The failure to provide safe accessible facilities for women who require abortions endangers their life, health and that of any child subsequently born after a failed abortion. 35. Article 13(b) of CEDAW requires that women be afforded equal rights to bank loans, mortgages and other forms of financial credit free from discrimination. Although there are no legislative barriers to women obtaining bank loans and mortgages in any of the nine countries examined, discrimination continues to hinder women from obtaining credit and loans to purchase property or businesses, thereby interfering with their autonomy and ability to earn a livelihood. Article 13(c) of CEDAW requires that women have an equal right to participate in recreational activities, sports and all aspects of cultural life and there are no legislative barriers in any of the countries preventing", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f13080e-4af4-4000-8c05-876bd76108dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f13080e-4af4-4000-8c05-876bd76108dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Translating CEDAW Into Law", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc03be6f592e9a23b09923c616880a4139b5bc52b920f330c1a7ff92b18935fc"}, "3": {"node_id": "b8b2327f-4f12-422c-bdbb-9a3cdb7fcdc1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "522dd2ad1bd1b15c4990437c68267dbceb246edeaa9f806b920764873e0de697"}}, "hash": "2ae4568c17ed66cc7ad1ec9dd7991914c60b7e1b726801be6c94af418dabe9ea", "text": "women from doing so. 36. Article 14 obligates States Parties to put in place measures to ensure equality of rural women and to ensure their equal access to, amongst other things, education, health, development and housing. Fiji has incorporated affirmative action provisions into legislation in relation to land and housing which may assist rural women whilst Vanuatu, in full compliance with CEDAW, has incorporated special measures for the \u2018special benefit, welfare and protection of inhabitants of less developed areas\u2019. None of the other seven countries, however, have implemented measures such as affirmative action to achieve such ends. 37. Article 15 requires States Parties to guarantee women equality before the law and equal rights to participate in all aspects of civil life. The Marshall Islands and the FSM and its states guarantee men and women the equal protection of the law (the right of all persons to be treated equally by the law), Fiji, Kiribati, Samoa and Vanuatu guarantee equality before the law (the right of all persons to the equal application of the law), and Tuvalu guarantees freedom under the law and all are therefore compliant with CEDAW. However, PNG and the Solomon Islands do not provide a guarantee of equality before the law and are non-compliant with CEDAW. Further, in all nine countries in compliance with CEDAW, there are no legislative barriers to women\u2019s participation in court and tribunal processes, nor to conclude contracts or to administer property. 38. Article 16 obligates States Parties to remove discrimination in family and personal laws including; marriage, separation, divorce, child custody, property division, paternity and inheritance. The application of the indicators in this area to the nine countries revealed low compliance, as shown below. 39. In General Recommendation 21, which relates to equality in marriage and family relations, the CEDAW Committee recommends 18 as the minimum age of marriage for both males and females. Kiribati alone is compliant in this area with an equal minimum marriageable age for both males and females of 18. In Fiji, the Marshall Islands, the FSM states of Kosrae, Chuuk and Pohnpei, PNG (which permits marriage at 14 with the consent of the court), Samoa and xiii Vanuatu, the minimum age of marriage for males is 18 but it is 16 for females, in non- compliance with CEDAW. Whilst the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu prescribe an equal age for males and females (15 and 16 respectively), both ages, are well below the CEDAW and CRC recommended marriageable age of 18. Customary marriages are recognised in PNG and the Solomon Islands and such marriages are not subject to the statutory age restrictions and other protections in relation to marriage. 40. In the marriage of minors, in compliance with CEDAW, permission must be sought from both parents in Kiribati, PNG and Vanuatu. In the Marshall Islands, the FSM states of Chuuk and Pohnpei and in Samoa the consent of either parent is required. Whilst this represents formal equality, the failure to require both parents consent may lead to the prioritisation of the father\u2019s consent and does not constitute full compliance with CEDAW. Finally in Fiji, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu, the consent of fathers is prioritised reinforcing the stereotype of the father as the head of the household, and denying the equal parenting responsibilities mandated by Article 16. 41. The registration of all marriages is required by CEDAW to ensure that the minimum age for marriage, and the prohibitions on bigamy and polygamy are adhered to. Registration is required in all nine countries (except in the FSM state of Yap). However in the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu, customary marriages are exempt from registration in non-compliance with CEDAW. 42. Fault based divorces, which require proof of a matrimonial offence such as desertion or habitual rape, place women in the difficult position of having to provide evidence of situations that may be humiliating, embarrassing, or that may interfere with their dignity and privacy. It also denies women autonomy and the free choice to leave a relationship. Divorce in Kiribati, FSM, Tuvalu, PNG, Samoa and Vanuatu, in non-compliance with CEDAW, is based on fault based criteria (including adultery, desertion and cruelty). In the Marshall Islands, divorce, although also primarily formulated to reflect fault based criteria, allows for divorce after a two year separation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8b2327f-4f12-422c-bdbb-9a3cdb7fcdc1": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8b2327f-4f12-422c-bdbb-9a3cdb7fcdc1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Translating CEDAW Into Law", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc03be6f592e9a23b09923c616880a4139b5bc52b920f330c1a7ff92b18935fc"}, "2": {"node_id": "0f13080e-4af4-4000-8c05-876bd76108dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ae4568c17ed66cc7ad1ec9dd7991914c60b7e1b726801be6c94af418dabe9ea"}}, "hash": "522dd2ad1bd1b15c4990437c68267dbceb246edeaa9f806b920764873e0de697", "text": "In Fiji, the recent introduction of no-fault criteria allows the parties to divorce on the basis of a 12 month separation without any requirement to find or prove fault, whilst in Tuvalu the fault based criterion plays an evidentiary role and is not essential to secure a divorce.

This fails to take into account possible power imbalances between the spouses and the significant family and community pressure that may be placed on women to forgive. Both countries are therefore non-compliant with CEDAW as a result. 43. In General Recommendation 19(23) the CEDAW Committee states that a lack of economic independence or an inability to gain custody of their children upon separation forces many women to stay in violent or difficult relationships. Whilst all nine countries provide for maintenance during separation and after divorce for both children and spouses, the criteria applied in all but Fiji is inadequate to comply with the requirements of CEDAW. The right and the calculation of the amount to be paid is uniformly based (except in Fiji) on judicial interpretation and discretion of \u2018just\u2019 or \u2018reasonable\u2019 or \u2018the best interests of all\u2019. In Kiribati it is determined on the basis of \u2018the age of the person for whose benefit the application is made and the personal circumstances of EXECUTIVE SUMMARY xiv every person\u2019. The \u2018conduct\u2019 of the parties also determines the maintenance payable in several countries, revealing how principles of fault have been imported into judicial decision making. In contrast, the CEDAW recommended standards need; the means of both parties, the financial commitments of both parties to themselves and others, their respective capacities to earn, and the needs of any children for whom maintenance is sought, are unlikely to be prioritised in any of the countries which are therefore non-compliant. Fiji however, has adopted the approach that is most in accord with the principles of CEDAW. Fiji\u2019s approach includes an assessment of the means of both parties, the financial commitments of both parties to themselves and others, their respective capacities to earn and the needs of any children for whom maintenance is sought. 44. In General Recommendation 21, the CEDAW Committee states that the division of marital property should include recognition of non- financial contributions during a marriage such as, raising children, caring for elderly relatives, and discharging household duties. In the Marshall Islands and the FSM, property division upon divorce, like maintenance, is determined on the basis of \u2018justice\u2019 and \u2018the best interests of all\u2019. This is unlikely to lead to property settlements in which women\u2019s non-financial contributions to the marriage are recognised. In Kiribati there is no legislative provision for the division of property after separation and divorce. Consequently, any determination is left to custom, which may discriminate against women. Again, Fiji alone recognises both financial and non-financial contributions to the marriage partnership, including caring for children and household responsibilities. Fiji is therefore the only country that is CEDAW compliant. 45. De facto relationships, including same-sex relationships, are not recognised in eight of the nine countries leaving women without any support and right to an equal division of property after the breakdown of a relationship. However, in Kiribati \u2018any person\u2019 can apply for maintenance and the children of non-married women are specifically provided for. 46. The best interests of the child as the paramount consideration is universally accepted as the principle on which custody determinations should be based, according to Article 16(f) of CEDAW and General Recommendation 21. Fiji, Kiribati, PNG and Tuvalu have adopted the recommended standard of the \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 as the paramount consideration in custody disputes after separation and divorce, in compliance with CEDAW. However, in Kiribati and Tuvalu an unmarried mother automatically loses custody of her child at the age of two years to the father (provided he admits paternity and wishes to have the custody of the child). The latter situation although intended to protect the inheritance rights of the children of unmarried parents may not represent the best interests of the child, and discriminates against mothers. In FSM, the Marshall Islands, Samoa, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, the legislative criterion for custody determinations is based on what is \u2018just\u2019 and \u2018reasonable\u2019 and in \u2018the best interests of all\u2019. This criterion can be interpreted by the courts in line with the principle of the best interests of the child (as practised in the Solomon Islands). It nevertheless falls well short of the standard mandated by CEDAW, because the principle of the best interests of the child should be legislated and not left to the discretion and uncertain process of the courts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e245b4cd-96af-4f03-ac13-b10d840ce5ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "e245b4cd-96af-4f03-ac13-b10d840ce5ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Translating CEDAW Into Law", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "38b015b7e0edd182e324dd6aefc6c4fe9e72fa1b0d2d3151995536b8eee5293f"}, "2": {"node_id": "823ec2b9-009a-4223-ac5c-817f2383a879", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fab2fe2f4eee167e1f6f78b4a79f24cf946ebe090a205dade48ce02849ffeb9c"}}, "hash": "44bcd079acc984ca5c66373bf5d85f751fbd83799ad379e7042f7ad96bc2f966", "text": "47.

In all other countries, legislation does govern inheritance law which, with the exception of Tuvalu and Kiribati (where eldest sons are advantaged over daughters in relation to both land and important resource rights such as fishponds), are equal. However in all countries, customary laws in relation to land, which may discriminate against women in relation to inheritance, have constitutional status.

United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is the United Nation\u2019s global development network, an organisation advocating for change and connecting countries to knowledge, experience and resources. UNDP operates in 166 countries, and works with partner organisations and countries to develop solutions to global and national development challenges. This Report comprises the results of two desk reviews commissioned by UNIFEM Pacific and the UNDP Pacific Centre to assess the legislative compliance with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 1979 (CEDAW) of nine Pacific countries: Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. The reviews required the application of 113 (111 for FSM) legislative indicators (originally developed by the authors in conjunction with UNIFEM) to the constitutions and legislation of the nine subject countries. The reviews aimed, with the application of the indicators, to provide a thorough stock-take of the legislation of the nine countries to assess legislative compliance with CEDAW. The findings of the two reviews have been collated into this report. This report is not intended to reflect negatively on any particular government but is aimed at assessing the level of current compliance of each State Party with a view to identifying priorities and working towards greater compliance in the future. It is intended as a resource and a tool for governments and non-government organisations to achieve full participation and non-discrimination for women in all aspects of their lives.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "170dbd84-a2e8-4a26-aeee-b51ba6a0b7de": {"__data__": {"id_": "170dbd84-a2e8-4a26-aeee-b51ba6a0b7de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Translating CEDAW Into Law", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd053c26c4061c9a922af6596cd07bb36fdc847a29c05373e9c5473506b5d480"}, "2": {"node_id": "e4d2be8b-805f-4086-9138-b8fa102dff22", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a549d9d40c0708e0c55c658b8c28146ec5ee1485e2479f5be377fbfa802b1a79"}}, "hash": "113552e7b3438313f0bdef1e5fe429aa6f3837c43362619d814a52d2b706b42e", "text": "Background On 18 December 1979, the UN General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Further, CEDAW provides a comprehensive definition of discrimination against women and requires States Parties to take all the necessary measures to eliminate such discrimination. States Parties are therefore required to pursue policies that will result in substantive equality (real or actual) in the lives of women, including taking active steps to amend or introduce legislative measures aimed at the full realisation of the rights of women and girls. In the Pacific region, 11 of the 14 South Pacific Forum Island Countries have ratified or acceded to the Convention: the Cook Islands, Micronesia (Federated States of), Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Niue (through its protectorate), Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. The Introduction 2 Forum island countries yet to ratify CEDAW include Nauru, Palau and Tonga. The remaining non-forum Pacific nations of Tokelau, New Caledonia, Tahiti and Wallis & Futuna have acceded to the Convention through the ratification of their Protectorates. To date, three Pacific Island countries (Fiji, Samoa and Vanuatu) have submitted their Initial, Second and Third Reports to the CEDAW Committee and the Cook Islands has submitted its Initial Report. Fiji and Samoa have entered into constructive dialogue with the CEDAW Committee and Vanuatu and the Cook Islands are scheduled to be reviewed in 2007. The first desk review, commissioned by UNIFEM Pacific, sought to analyse and document legislative compliance with CEDAW in the six Pacific countries of; Samoa (which ratified CEDAW on 25 September 1995), Papua New Guinea (12 January 1995), Fiji (28 August 1995), Vanuatu (8 September 1995), Tuvalu (6 October 1999) and the Solomon Islands (6 May 2002). As none of the above six countries have entered reservations upon the Convention, all are obligated to comply with all of its articles. The second review, commissioned by the UNDP Pacific Centre sought to analyse and document legislative compliance with CEDAW in the three Pacific countries that have most recently become States Parties: Kiribati (acceded 17 March 2004), the FSM (acceded 1 September 2004), and the Marshall Islands (acceded 2 March 2006). Kiribati and the Marshall Islands have not entered reservations upon the Convention and are therefore obligated to comply with all of its articles. However, the FSM has placed reservations on Article 11(1)(d) of the Convention to enact comparable worth legislation (pay equity), Article 11(2)(b) to enact maternity leave with pay or with comparable social benefits throughout the nation, Articles 2 (f), 5, and 16 to the succession of certain well-established traditional titles, and to marital customs that divide tasks or decision-making in purely voluntary or consensual private conduct. Methodology There are two accepted approaches to assessing a country\u2019s compliance with CEDAW, the examination of de jure and/or de facto compliance. Whilst it has been universally recognised and emphasised in various instruments such as the Beijing Platform for Action, that legislative compliance (de jure) may not of itself achieve real or actual equality (de facto), the pursuit of legislative compliance is nevertheless an important initial measure towards that goal. This study has been designed to provide both descriptive and analytical information concerning the legislative implementation of CEDAW in the nine Pacific countries. It involved the application of the 113 indicators to the legislative and constitutional framework of each of the nine countries. However, the FSM and each of its four states were measured against 111 indicators. The indicators were reduced because of the reservations placed on CEDAW by the FSM (detailed above), which mean that it has excluded itself from meeting the obligations under the reserved provisions until such time as they are removed. It should also be noted that, through the national constitution of the FSM, which is the basis for all legal authority, the power to legislate is divided between the FSM Parliament and the State Parliaments. Whilst the FSM has express power over areas such as tax, trade and national crimes, it may also establish systems of social security and public welfare concurrently with the states. This review has measured FSM against both the indicators which concern its express powers to legislate, and against the indicators that relate to its power to implement systems of social security and public welfare.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36e3e507-1c62-4c3e-b1bc-fa0b9e2db5fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "36e3e507-1c62-4c3e-b1bc-fa0b9e2db5fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Translating CEDAW Into Law", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ca76ecfa9c8404c66eeac80e67c3674e355f9db569d2ce55b23987a1d4562eb"}, "2": {"node_id": "6c40c53b-8a9a-4032-8329-586fd7c65aea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6345f04cd3478b9b9fcd0896bc74332788def6d1241acb315db5bb1f36abe2b3"}}, "hash": "8eec92455512aeba2c61fd36a08cfd542da985a63015fb0c03eebe5976dc6919", "text": "Although the FSM is not obligated to legislate in the area of social security and public welfare (which includes many of the areas covered by CEDAW) the authors have taken the view that the national government, which has a direct obligation to implement CEDAW, should lead and encourage the four states towards compliance with CEDAW.

In some instances, however, it was not possible to obtain relevant legislation and a range of secondary sources including texts, academic articles, parliamentary reviews and resources produced by a variety of organisations were utilised. How to Use this Report This report is divided into 10 Chapters. Chapter 1 introduces and overviews the indicators used in the subsequent parts of this Report to assess the legislative compliance of the nine countries. This Chapter begins with the text of each article of CEDAW and is followed by the indicators relevant to that article. Each indicator is accompanied by an explanation of its link to CEDAW and provides a rationale for its inclusion in the set of indicators. Chapters 2 to 10 contain the results of the two reviews and show the legislative compliance of each of the nine countries against the indicator template. Chapter 2 (the FSM) contains five subsections, one for each of the five legislative systems operating in that country (the national system of the FSM, and the four states of Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei and Yap). To assist the reader, following a detailed synopsis of the results of the desk reviews, are the indicators and the country\u2019s corresponding performance under each indicator shown in table form. In brief, the template, in table form, identifies the article of CEDAW, the corresponding indicator(s), the level of compliance (i.e., yes, no and partial compliance), and the relevant legislation. Finally a brief commentary is provided where necessary on why a legislative provision does or does not meet the standard prescribed in the indicator, and to explain the level of compliance or any issues that arise. In sum, the reader should (after reading the introduction) read the relevant chapter (i.e. the results of each country) in conjunction with the indicators chapter which explains why a particular indicator was adopted, its link to CEDAW and what is expected for compliance. A glossary of terms has been provided at the end of this report to assist the reader.

The review required the application of 113 indicators (originally developed by the authors in conjunction with UNIFEM and the UNDP Pacific Centre and previously applied in nine Pacific countries) to the Constitution and legislation of the Cook Islands. The review aimed, through the application of the indicators, to provide a thorough analysis of the legislation of the Cook Islands and to assess its legislative compliance with CEDAW. This Report is not intended to reflect negatively on the government of the Cook Islands but is aimed at assessing its level of current legislative compliance with CEDAW, with a view to identifying priorities for working towards greater compliance in the future. It is intended as a resource and a tool for the government and for non-government organisations to achieve full participation and non-discrimination for women in all aspects of their lives. 1.2 Background On 18 December 1979, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). The Convention came into force on 3 September 1981 with over 20 countries becoming signatories. As of 20 November 2007, 185 countries had ratified or acceded to the Convention, making it one of the most recognised conventions in the world. CEDAW seeks to comprehensively address women\u2019s rights to equality in all areas of women\u2019s lives including civil, cultural, economic, political, and social. Further, CEDAW provides a comprehensive definition of discrimination against women and States Parties are required to take all necessary measures to eliminate such discrimination. States Parties are therefore required to pursue policies that will result in substantive INTRODUCTION 2 equality (real or actual) in the lives of women, including taking active steps to amend or introduce legislative measures aimed at the full realisation of the rights of women and girls. In the Pacific region, 11 of the 14 Forum Island Countries have ratified or acceded to the Convention: the Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Niue and Tokelau (through their status as protectorates of New Zealand), Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. Nauru, Palau and Tonga have yet to ratify CEDAW. To date, two Pacific Island countries, the Cook Islands and Fiji have submitt ed their initial reports to the CEDAW Committee and two, Samoa and Vanuatu, have submitted their Initial, Second and Third Reports. The Cook Islands shares its citizenship with New Zealand and is obliged to uphold a \u2018standard of values generally acceptable to New Zealanders in its law-making and policies\u2019. It is otherwise internally and externally fully self-governing \u2018in free association with New Zealand\u2019. The Cook Islands initially became a party to CEDAW in 1985 when New Zealand ratified the Convention. However, the Cook Islands acceded to CEDAW in its own right in 2006 and to the Optional Protocol on 27 November 2007 and also furnished its initial report to the CEDAW Committee in the same year. Accession obliges the Cook Islands to work towards the modification of its constitution and legislation to accord with the provisions of CEDAW.

The second, de facto compliance, requires that the obligations created under the Convention are not just recorded in the laws of the country but implemented in practice with the intended results. Whilst it has been universally recognised and emphasised in various instruments such as the Beijing Platform for Action that legislative compliance (de jure) may not of itself achieve real or actual equality (de facto), the pursuit of legislative compliance is nevertheless an important initial measure towards that goal. The CEDAW Committee\u2019s reporting guidelines require that a State Party\u2019s progress toward achieving both de jure and de facto compliance with the Convention be recorded in both its initial and subsequent reports. In particular, the guidelines specify that the initial report should \u2018explain the legal and practical measures adopted to give effect to the provisions of the Convention\u2019 [D 1.1(b)]; that the \u2018legal norms\u2019 relevant to every article should be described; and that the report should identify how Article 2 of the Convention is applied sett ing out the principal legal measures which the State Party has taken to give effect to the rights articulated in the Convention [D 2.2(3)]. The report should also outline any \u2018restrictions or limitations even of a temporary nature imposed by law, practice or tradition\u2019 on the enjoyment of the provisions of the Convention. The guidelines also require the report to contain sufficient quotations (or summaries) of the relevant principal \u2018constitutional, legislative and other texts\u2019 which guarantee and provide remedies in relation to Convention rights [D.3.1]. Subsequent periodic reports should document progress towards the implementation of the Convention since the initial report including INTRODUCTION 33 any new legal measures [E 4(b)]. A clear record of legislative compliance therefore is an integral component of the reporting process. This study has been designed to provide both descriptive and analytical information concerning the legislative implementation of CEDAW in the Cook Islands. Its compliance with CEDAW was measured by the application of all 113 indicators to its legislative and constitutional framework. The Cook Islands was previously subject to the reservations placed on CEDAW through its status as a protectorate of New Zealand. At the recent CEDAW hearings in May 2007, however, the government of the Cook Islands indicated its intention to remove all reservations to CEDAW. Accordingly this review has assessed the Cook Islands on the basis of the removal of the reservations and against all 113 indicators. Measurement of the Cook Islands\u2019 legislative compliance with CEDAW was primarily undertaken with reference to the primary sources available i.e., the legislation and constitution. In some instances, however, it was not possible to obtain relevant legislation and a range of secondary sources including texts, academic articles, parliamentary reviews and resources produced by a variety of organisations were utilised. It should be noted that the Cook Islands legislative review contained in this report was conducted using all materials available at the time, and although every effort was made to obtain the most recent and up-to-date legal material, it is possible that there will be errors or omissions. 1.4 How to Use this Report This Report is divided into 3 chapters. Chapter 2 introduces and overviews the indicators used in the third and substantive chapter of this Report to assess the legislative compliance of the Cook Islands. It begins with the text of each article of CEDAW and is followed by the indicators relevant to that article. Each indicator is accompanied by an explanation of its link to CEDAW and provides a rationale for its inclusion in the set of indicators. Chapter 3 contains the results of the review and details the legislative compliance of the Cook Islands against the indicator template. To assist the reader, following a detailed synopsis of the results of the desk review, is a series of tables containing the indicators and a review of if and how the Cook Islands performed against each indicator. In brief, the template, in table form, identifies the article of CEDAW, the corresponding indicator(s), the level of compliance (i.e., yes, no and partial compliance) and the relevant legislation of the Cook Islands. Finally, the last column of the tables contains a brief commentary where necessary explaining why a legislative provision does or does not meet the standard prescribed in the indicator and any other issues that arise. In sum, the reader should (after reading the introduction) read Chapter 3 in conjunction with Chapter 2 (the indicator chapter) which explains why a particular indicator was adopted, its link to CEDAW and what is expected for compliance.

Benchmark- ing, in turn, requires a justifiable and credible set of indicators. Indicators have traditionally been employed in the development sector and in the economic and social sciences. They have recently been adopted in the human rights field to establish objective standards of measurement with a view to assessing a state\u2019s progress in complying with its human rights obligations. Put simply, indicators are a tool of measurement that can answer the question of whether or how much progress is being made toward a certain objective but they do not answer the question of why progress is or is not being made. As discussed earlier in the introduction, whilst it has been universally recognised that legislative compliance (de jure) may not of itself achieve real or actual equality (de facto), the pursuit of legislative compliance is nevertheless an important initial measure towards that goal. This review utilised 113 indicators which were developed by the authors for an initial project with UNIFEM to monitor legislative compliance with CEDAW in the Pacific region. The process of developing indicators to measure legislative compliance with CEDAW involved an assessment of the meaning of its articles and how they could be translated into law. That assessment was based on a number of sources including; first, a detailed consideration of CEDAW\u2019s articles, second, extensive reference to the 25 General CEDAW Legislative Compliance Indicators 2 Recommendations of the CEDAW Committee. The CEDAW Committee (established to monitor the implementation of CEDAW) has released 25 General Recommendations to date, each responding to issues of particular concern raised by specific articles of the Convention. The Recommendations provide extended commentary of many aspects of CEDAW. Third, extensive reference was made to other reports and resources including government and \u2018shadow\u2019 reports to the CEDAW Committee, numerous reports by NGOs and agencies throughout the Pacific region, and the extensive body of feminist literature that interprets legislative frameworks in the areas governed by CEDAW. Finally, the authors engaged in a consultation process with a range of NGOs and women\u2019s organisations based in the region. The indicators, identified through this process were used to develop a template against which legislative compliance with CEDAW could be measured. Full compliance with CEDAW would require the satisfaction of all indicators, a feat yet to be achieved by any of the 185 States Parties. Rather than being prescriptive, however, this review seeks to assist States Parties in establishing priorities for more comprehensive legislative compliance with CEDAW in the future. The next section discusses the challenges of formulating indicators and the subsequent section identifies the articles of CEDAW, the corresponding indicator(s) and annotates each indicator, explaining the meaning of the indicator, its link to CEDAW (and the Beijing Platform for Action) and the rationale underpinning the selection of the indicator. A complete set of the indicators in table form can be found at the end of this chapter. 7 CEDAW LEGISLATIVE COMPLIANCE INDICATORS 8 Challenges of Formulating Indicators The development of objective and justifiable indicators is a process which involves several challenges. First, some of the obligations created by the articles of CEDAW (or components of its articles) are best dealt with by policy measures, education initiatives and consultation and collaboration with civil society rather than through legislative enforcement. For example, Article 5 obligates States Parties to modify the stereotypical, social and cultural conduct of men and women. Such cultural norms are arguably best modified through education in a variety of forums and policy measures rather than through legislative provisions. For this reason, some articles do not have many indicators, as arguably they are more effectively complied with using policy measures and education initiatives. Second, whilst the legal steps that a State Party must take to comply with CEDAW are clearly articulated in some articles, others are more broadly and generically framed. For example, the obligation to enact a constitutional provision providing for equality between men and women requires a State Party to incorporate an equality provision into its constitution. A corresponding legislative indicator in this instance is easily formulated (i.e., does the Constitution provide equality between men and women as a protected right?)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a03b108-a662-4452-8232-0d3cf870448b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a03b108-a662-4452-8232-0d3cf870448b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Translating CEDAW Into Law: Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d5d794119e7e335f98382f1746415f67c1c7bce4f49018bb5c512df19b77ebe"}}, "hash": "4d5d794119e7e335f98382f1746415f67c1c7bce4f49018bb5c512df19b77ebe", "text": "requiring a clear answer either in the affirmative or in the negative. In relation to other CEDAW provisions, however, the legal obligations of the State Party are less straightforward. For example, the obligations created by Article 14 to provide equality for rural women do not easily translate into the legal measures required for compliance. The obvious benefit of a broadly termed provision is that it makes then Convention both sensitive and responsive to the domestic context of countries, allowing for the development within a national framework of specific domestic responses to issues of concern. At the same time, however, it can be difficult (and ultimately subjective) to specifically identify indicators to guide a State Party towards compliance. Third, whilst the CEDAW Committee has interpreted aspects of many of the articles of the Convention (manifested through the issuing of general recommendations and concluding comments), the status of its recommendations, however, are not binding. Further, although the consultations and dialogue adopted during the reporting process allow for some vetting of the articles of CEDAW, rigorous legal debate testing the interpretation and meaning of an article is absent. Therefore, whilst the non judicial interpretations of the articles by the CEDAW Committee provide some assistance in determining the meanings of particular provisions of CEDAW (and consequently assist in the development of indicators), generally however, it is up to each State Party to determine the scope of the provision and to enact changes accordingly. Fourth, there is considerable overlap between some articles of the Convention. Some of the indicators, therefore, could quite conceivably relate to several articles or be quite justifiably dealt with in articles other than where they have been situated in this review. For example, the issue of women\u2019s health is a cross-cutting theme which spans a range of articles and is not confined to Article 12 which relates to health care and family planning. Therefore, compliance with Article 12 has been largely encompassed within indicators for other articles such as maternity provisions and the rights of pregnant women in employment (Article 11), violence against women (Articles 1 and 2), and women\u2019s access to health services in rural areas (Article 14). CEDAW LEGISLATIVE COMPLIANCE INDICATORS 9 Fifth, in some instances the legislative compliance of a State Party can only be measured in relation to the condition of women\u2019s lives in that country. Legislative indicators therefore, are not always universally applicable. If a customary practice discriminates against women in a particular society (e.g. the practice of child marriage) a legislative indicator that requires the prohibition of child marriage would only be relevant and meaningful in those country(ies) where it is practised, and meaningless where not. Further, knowledge of the conditions of women\u2019s lives in a particular country is also relevant in relation to those articles which require proactive measures. Affirmative action, for example, would only be required when there is a substantive inequality that is in breach of an area covered by CEDAW. Hence, the formulation of de jure (legislative) indicators requires some knowledge of the de facto circumstances of a country or region. The indicators developed in this review are partially reflective therefore of regional practices and regional conditions in relation to women in the Pacific. Finally, standards change as societies change and as new issues emerge. CEDAW must therefore be considered a living document. Consequently, no set of indicators can be fixed as they must change and adapt as circumstances change. The following section [2.3] identifies the articles of CEDAW, the corresponding indicator(s) and the rationale underpinning the selection of that indicator. Indicators: Justi\ufb01 cation and Rationale ARTICLE 1: DEFINITION OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN For the purposes of the present Convention the term \u201cdiscrimination against women\u201d shall mean any distinction, exclusion or ARTICLE 2: OBLIGATIONS TO ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATION States Parties condemn discrimination against women in all its forms, agree to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating discrimination against women and, to this end, undertake: (a) To embody the principle of the equality of men and women in their national constitutions or other appropriate legislation if not yet incorporated therein and to ensure, through law and other appropriate means, the practical realization of this principle; (b) To adopt appropriate legislative and other measures, including sanctions where appropriate, prohibiting all discrimination against women; (c) To establish legal protection of the rights of women on an equal basis with men and to ensure through competent national tribunals and other public institutions the effective protection of women against any act of discrimination; (d) To refrain from engaging in any act or practice of discrimination against women and to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3fde99ab-654c-4b4a-a971-d10169ea0d8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "3fde99ab-654c-4b4a-a971-d10169ea0d8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Translating CEDAW Into Law: Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "768c36df739091c9a9ee0e76528312a3a0838a3ac2b4ab5d9eb56c209526e26c"}}, "hash": "768c36df739091c9a9ee0e76528312a3a0838a3ac2b4ab5d9eb56c209526e26c", "text": "ensure that public authorities and institutions shall act in conformity with this obligation; (e) To take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women by any person, organization or enterprise; restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field. CEDAW LEGISLATIVE COMPLIANCE INDICATORS 10 ARTICLE 1 AND 2 INDICATORS 1.1 Does the Constitution guarantee fundamental rights and freedoms to men and women equally including in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field? The definition of discrimination in Article 1 encompasses any interference with the \u2018human rights and fundamental freedoms of women in the political, economic, social, cultural civil or any other field\u2019. The Committee notes in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women 1993 that these rights include inter alia: the right to life, the right to equality, the right to liberty and security of person, the right to equal protection under the law, the right to be free from all forms of discrimination, the right to the highest standard attainable of physical and mental health, the right to just and favourable conditions, the right not to be subjected to torture, or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Such rights and freedoms should be afforded to women free from discrimination. 1.2 Is there a Constitutional guarantee of substantive equality between men and women? Article 2(a) of CEDAW and para 232(c) of the Beijing Platform for Action specifically mandate the inclusion of a guarantee of substantive equality (equality of benefits) between men and women in national constitutions or, if not yet incorporated, in other appropriate legislation. Ideally, the principle of equality should be entrenched in national constitutions as this provides greater protection than that provided by legislation as it cannot be as easily repealed. An equality provision in the constitution can also have more expansive application as all legislation must conform to the principles contained therein. This ensures the highest form of protection for the principle of equality and its presence in the supreme law of a sovereign state also provides significant symbolic status. Satisfaction of this indicator would also comply with para 232(c) of the Beijing Platform for Action. 1.3 Does the Constitution contain an anti- discrimination clause on the ground of sex/gender? Article 2(b) of CEDAW requires States Parties to adopt appropriate legislative and other measures, including sanc- tions where appropriate, prohibiting all discrimination against women. This is reinforced in para 232(b) of the Beijing Platform for Action which also specifically requests governments to introduce anti-discrimination legislation to protect women. The de- finition of discrimination contained in CEDAW explicitly states that discrimination against women means any \u2018distinction, exclusion or restric- tion\u2019 made on the basis of sex. Specific anti-discrimination provisions provide ARTICLE 2: OBLIGATIONS TO ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATION (continued) (f) To take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and practices which constitute discrimination against women; (g) To repeal all national penal provisions which constitute discrimination against women. CEDAW LEGISLATIVE COMPLIANCE INDICATORS 11 the mechanics by which the principle of equality can be achieved and by which individuals can seek redress against discriminatory practices. 1.4 Does the Constitution contain an anti- discrimination clause on the ground of marital status? Article 2 of CEDAW prohibits all discrimination against women. Article 1 specifically includes in its definition of discrimination \u2018any distinction, exclusion or restriction\u2019 made on the basis of sex which aims or has the effect of preventing or hampering the enjoyment by women, whether married or unmarried, of their human rights to the same extent as men. Marital status has been used as a basis for discrimination against women in areas such as; property, inheritance, criminal law, domicile, citizenship to name a few. Such discrimination has the effect of preventing women from enjoying or exercising their human rights and fundamental freedoms. 1.5 Does the Constitution contain an anti- discrimination clause on the ground of sexual orientation? Article 2 prohibits all discrimination against women and in doing so obligates States Parties to guarantee the autonomy of women. A woman\u2019s right to independence and self- determination includes the right to define and express her sexuality and to choose her lifestyle. Discrimination against lesbians in employment, education, child custody and marriage often means that lesbians and lesbian families are denied economic and legal benefits granted to married women, including inheritance rights, tax deductions,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49e11768-99ae-49de-b27a-3a52c4f73d20": {"__data__": {"id_": "49e11768-99ae-49de-b27a-3a52c4f73d20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Translating CEDAW Into Law: Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f412803810266eba6b80e930482d6582228661bf97bec870a5adf070daeb7269"}, "3": {"node_id": "84ff2795-8422-46fa-851e-229e9fd57162", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "971b439eb0f8d6503fe0a2ae464726954b8c75799cd353caf374b4aa0de43b3a"}}, "hash": "fb113366c03882c624138b9047150759cf8469501782cebb6a07145e315436f5", "text": "insurance benefits, and more.

General Recommendation 15 re- commends that States Parties adopt measures to prevent specific discrimination against women in response to HIV/AIDS. In particular, the CEDAW Committee notes that women\u2019s subordinate position in some societies make them especially vulnerable to infection and discrimination as a corollary. Discrimination on the basis of a person\u2019s HIV status can intersect a range of areas of women\u2019s lives including employment, the right to privacy and confidentiality. 1.7 Does the Constitution contain an anti- discrimination clause on the ground of disability? The CEDAW Committee states in General Recommendation 18 that Article 2 obligates States Parties to eliminate discrimination against all women. It notes that women with disabilities suffer from a \u2018double discrimination linked to their special living conditions\u2019. Historically, areas where women with disabilities have experienced discrimination on the basis of both their sex and their disability CEDAW LEGISLATIVE COMPLIANCE INDICATORS 12 have included education, employment, health services and social security. 1.8 Does the breadth of the anti-discrimination clause encompass direct and indirect discrimination? The definition of discrimination in Article 1 of CEDAW goes beyond a requirement to achieve formal equality (the equal application of legal rules) and requires States Parties to seek substantive equality (real or actual equality). This is evident in the definition of discrimination which encompasses all situations that have the effect of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise of human rights. The use of the word \u2018effect\u2019 designates not merely formal equality but crucially equality in results. Therefore to be compliant with the definition of discrimina- tion contained in CEDAW, an anti- discrimination clause must recognise and eliminate indirect discrimination. Indirect discrimination refers to a situation where a rule appears to apply to a group of people in the same way, but in practice places on particular members of that group a burden not faced by the majority, or a requirement more easily met by the majority that results in unequal treatment. The concept of indirect discrimination recognises that discrimination does not always manifest in obvious or direct ways but may be disguised within policies or practices which appear to apply to all persons equally. 1.9 Does the anti-discrimination clause bind public authorities and institutions? Article 2(d) of CEDAW obligates States Parties to themselves refrain from engaging in any act or practice of discrimination against women and to ensure that public authorities and institutions act in conformity with this obligation. Therefore, any anti- discrimination clause should bind all state institutions. 1.10 Does the anti-discrimination clause bind any person, organisation or enterprise? Article 2(e) of CEDAW proscribes discrimination not just by the law, government and government authorities but also by any person, organisation or enterprise. The extension of protection beyond that of state actors to all other persons and organisations is indicative of the recognition that to effectively combat discrimination in all areas of women\u2019s lives, the regulation of both state and non-state actors throughout the public and private spheres of women\u2019s lives is required. 1.11 Are sanctions imposed for the breach of anti-discrimination provisions? Article 2(b) of CEDAW recommends that, where appropriate, sanctions for breaches of anti-discrimination provisions be provided. The provision of penalties and remedies is an essential component of effective anti- discrimination measures. This could include penalties such as fines, apo- logies or loss of government contracts and remedies such as compensation and injunctive relief. An effective system of sanctions provides a clear statement of the unacceptability of discrimination in society. Conversely, a system that is ineffective sends a range of negative symbolic messages. These include the message that discrimination is not CEDAW LEGISLATIVE COMPLIANCE INDICATORS 13 regarded seriously by the State; that the wrongs that discrimination victims experience are not serious; and finally that discrimination is not in itself an abhorrent harm that the State considers worthy of sanction or compensation. 1.12 Are there specific domestic violence offences in the criminal law legislation (penal code)?

In particular, in General Recommendation 19(24)(r), the Committee states that CEDAW obligates States Parties to make laws against family violence and abuse. In the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women 1993 issued by the CEDAW Committee, violence against women encompasses acts, coercion and other deprivations of liberty and includes psychological, emotional and coercive abuse. Whilst common assault offences, typically present in most Penal Codes could be used in some limited circumstances, they do not incorporate the complexity of domestic violence. Therefore, to fully comply with CEDAW specific domestic violence offences should be incorporated into criminal law legislation. Compliance with this indicator would also satisfy para 124(b) of the Beijing Platform for Action, which recommends that governments ensure that the legislation effectively protects women from violence and prosecutes offenders. 1.13 Is stalking a criminal offence? General Recommendation 19 notes that full compliance with CEDAW requires States Parties to take positive measures to eliminate all forms of violence against women. Stalking refers to the harassment or intimidation of a person causing them to fear for their safety. It is a course of conduct which may involve individual acts that are not unlawful (such as sending unwelcome gifts, making persistent phone calls or following a person from home and work). Taken cumulatively however, these acts can amount to intimidating and harmful behaviour. In the NSW Crimes Act in Australia, stalking is defined as \u2018following a person about or the watching or waiting, or frequently in the vicinity of, or an approach to, a person\u2019s place of residence, business, or work or any place that a person frequents for the purpose of any social or leisure activity.\u2019 Stalking, therefore, should be specifically identified as an offence in the criminal law legislation. 1.14 Is a restraining order available in situations of sexual and domestic violence regardless of marital status? The CEDAW Committee has stated that governments must \u2018provide victims of domestic violence with the maximum protection of the law\u2019. General Recommendation 19 notes that States Parties should ensure that laws against family violence and abuse, rape, sexual assault and other gender based violence give adequate protection to all CEDAW LEGISLATIVE COMPLIANCE INDICATORS 14 women so as to respect their integrity and dignity. General Recommendation 19 also addresses the accountability of States Parties for the conduct of non-state actors by stating that \u2018\u2026dis- crimination under the Convention is not restricted to action by or on behalf of Governments \u2026\u2019 and \u2018[U]nder general international law and specific human rights covenants, States may also be responsible for private acts if they fail to act with due diligence to prevent violations of rights or to investigate and punish acts of violence, and for providing compensation\u2019. Gene- ral Recommendation 19(24)(r) also specifically states that civil remedies in cases of domestic violence are needed to overcome family violence and General Recommendation 19(24) (t) obliges States Parties to take all legal and other measures, including civil remedies to provide effective protection of women against gender based violence. A restraining order obtainable under civil law (on the balance of probabilities) is one such remedy that would satisfy the above recommendations. States Parties are therefore obliged to provide access to restraining orders to women, including unmarried women, (also known as apprehended violence orders or non- molestation orders) as a crucial means of protecting women from gender based violence. 1.15 Is there mandatory prosecution for domestic violence offences? General Recommendation 19(24)(t) obligates States Parties to institute effective legal measures including penal sanctions to protect women against all kinds of violence including violence and abuse in the family. Article 4(d) of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women 1993 states that penal sanctions should be incorporated into domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs caused to women who are subjected to gender based violence. Domestic violence has historically been treated by the police and other enforcement agencies as a private and minor matter which should be resolved by the parties themselves. Such an approach allows men to abuse women and children in their homes without fear of sanction. Mandatory prosecution measures ensure that, if reported, such offences against women in vulnerable domestic situations are taken as seriously as other criminal offences by law enforcement agencies. Mandatory prosecution of domestic violence offences also sends a very clear message to the community of the unacceptability of family violence. 1.16 Does the criminal law legislation contain a broad range of sexual assault offences graded on the basis of seriousness to the victim? General Recommendation 19(24) (i),", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33746b30-db9e-4b88-9583-6ae75a828ac6": {"__data__": {"id_": "33746b30-db9e-4b88-9583-6ae75a828ac6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Translating CEDAW Into Law: Cook Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/translating-cedaw-law-cook-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eaeccd54ebd3116cd55def96500149a610af11ed59a84a58bdd1fedf5c0d9f4e"}}, "hash": "eaeccd54ebd3116cd55def96500149a610af11ed59a84a58bdd1fedf5c0d9f4e", "text": "and para 124(a) of the Beijing Platform for Action state that effective complaints procedures and remedies for victims of sexual assault must be provided. Article 4(d) of the Declara- tion on the Elimination of Violence against Women 1993 states that penal sanctions should be incorporated into domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs caused to women subjected to gender based violence. Sexual assault is a gendered harm, overwhelmingly perpetrated against women and girls. Women and girls can be sexually violated in a range of ways and all unwanted sexual contact should be unlawful. To effectively CEDAW LEGISLATIVE COMPLIANCE INDICATORS 15 redress and punish the sexual violations experienced by women, it is essential to incorporate into the criminal law an appropriate range of sexual assault offences, graded to reflect the seriousness of the invasion of personal integrity. A sexual assault on any girl below the age of consent should be considered a serious offence and no significant differentiation on the basis of age should be made, nor should it be considered much less serious in older girls (as is common Pacific jurisdictions). 1.17 Does the definition of rape and/or other sexual assault offences include penetration of non-penile objects to anus, vagina and mouth? Historically, rape was considered serious not because of its harmful effects on women but because it interfered with the rights of men to have exclusive sexual relations with their wives or future wives. To comply with CEDAW, however, (which focuses on the harmful effects that rape and other sexual assaults have on women) rape offences should not be restricted to penile penetration but should be extended to include the penetration of all orifices by any object. This would also accord with research which shows that women experience serious harm from all forms of sexual abuse. 1.18 Is there an offence of incest for girls and women? If there is no offence of incest then there is full compliance with this indicator. The offence of incest was originally based on religious and cultural prohibitions on sexual interactions between family members and concerns about the genetic implications of hav- ing children together. Historically, it was never intended as a means of protection of children, young persons and women from sexual assault by fam- ily members. However, research shows that incest is primarily perpetrated in the context of unequal power relations between men and women/girls in the family. Criminalising all parties to an incestuous sexual encounter may dissuade a victim of an incestuous sexual assault from reporting the offence due to the knowledge that she may be charged with an offence. 1.19 Have the terms indecency, carnal knowledge, defilement and insulting the modesty been removed from the criminal law legislation? In General Recommendation 19, the CEDAW Committee emphasised that States Parties should respect the digni- ty and integrity of girls and women. The use of these terms to describe sexual offences against women and girls imparts an understanding of women and girls as \u2018damaged\u2019 or \u2018spoilt\u2019 by the offences. Such an approach, which is reflective of Victorian notions about women\u2019s purity, gives rise to the view that the victim is no lo
